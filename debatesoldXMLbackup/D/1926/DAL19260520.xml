    <P>Motion made, and question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's object in introducing this Bill is to bring about an improvement in what is considered <Col N="1838" /> to be abuses of the present system&mdash;not an improvement of the abuses, but of the services.  Taking the services of the local authorities generally, I have yet to learn that any system which will be introduced will give better returns than those you have at present.  In some counties the present chief officers compare very favourably with the best officers in the Civil Service. I will pay that tribute to the officers of local authorities in my own county.  Any scheme that is to be an improvement on some of the existing services will want to be a very good one.  Generally speaking, we have no great exception to the appointment of chief officers under sub-sections (a) and (b) of Section 2, but we strongly object to interference with the rights of the county councils in the making of minor appointments.  We object on behalf of the county councils to the central authority interfering in the appointment of other officers lower than those mentioned in the two sub-sections.  We do not agree to the central authority taking these appointments out of the hands of the county councils.  We contend that as the county councils supply the funds for these officers' salaries they should have the making of the appointments and should be the supreme authority, subject, of course, to the sanction of the central authority in Dublin.</P>
      <P>We do not object to the setting up of a Public Boards Commission for the appointment of chief executive and other technical officers, but we contend that that Commission should send forward to the local authorities the names of one, two or three persons who are qualified for such appointments.  In the case of a minor appointments the Commission should make a panel containing the names of one, two or three of the most desirable candidates.  The local authority should have the making of the appointment, subject to the sanction of the Minister.  If the Minister will amend the Bill to that extent we will support the Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We consider that the effort being made to form what Deputy Johnson called a municipal civil service is a very poor one.  In our opinion, entrance to a position under the county <Col N="1839" /> boards should be by way of qualifying examination, and all officers in the junior posts should have the opportunity, if they are capable, of promotion according to ability and service. So far as the Bill reserves appointments by local authorities to the local staff it is acceptable.  But we believe that appointments to the higher offices should not be from outside.  There should be gradual promotion from suitable people in service, and they should have the right to attain to the higher posts. Such a system is in operation in Dublin, and works very well.  It has evolved your present Town Clerk, and it works under the Joint Committee of Grangegorman Mental Hospital.  All the officers in these places enter through examinations held at the Technical Schools in Dublin, and there is gradual promotion from the lower posts to the higher.  We consider that is the ideal to strive for.  We do not agree to give the Minister the right of making these appointments, because the result will be that the local boards will not have the necessary authority over these officers.  They will be more or less independent of the boards, as they are appointed by the Minister. The masters of these officers, even for disciplinary reasons, should be those who are conducting the business of the boards.  In the Bill all the authority that is given is the right of suspension. That is not enough.  The boards require to have the right of appointment.  I agree that certain abuses have crept into the present system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It will inevitably have that effect.  The central authority cannot be expected to elect suitable people.  The county council is composed of men elected by Proportional Representation and consists of the best of every section in the community. These representatives cannot be expected to administer the affairs of the county council unless they are given real authority.  We feel that that is where the central authority will be cutting across what we consider is necessary for the better working of the public utility services.  Admittedly certain abuses crept into the system but that system was inherited from a people who have had long experience of government, and in practice it worked well.  Take care that the new system will not be like that introduced for the amalgamation of workhouses, which has been, more or less, a failure and which is gradually developing back towards what was broken up in 1920.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have made it clear that we do not object to the Bill where it deals with the appointment of technical officers.  We consider that laymen are not capable of judging <Col N="1841" /> the qualifications and abilities of such persons.  We believe that is a job for Commissioners but we say that the Commissioners should submit the names to the local authorities.  If we could get the Minister to agree to that principle we would accept the Bill. Otherwise we will have to put down amendments on the Committee Stage with a view to attaining that end.  I cannot see what injustice would be done by permitting the county councils who pay these men to have the right of making appointments.  The Minister seeks to do away with canvassing.  We are all opposed to that system.  While we are opposed to canvassing we consider that the county councils should not lose the right of making appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that Deputy Wilson has not sufficiently cleared his mind on this matter.  The existing system is not a good one, apart altogether from what abuses it may have, and there will always be abuses in such a system.  It is said that canvassing is not wanted, that in certain cases the lay board is not competent to decide between the best man and the worst man, and at the same time it is insisted that the system which produced canvassing and which laid these responsibilities on the lay board, which it is not fit to fulfil, should be continued. The talk about the indignity and insult to the county councils is just the talk that has been put forward by certain people in regard to the position of Ministers in their Departments. There are people who say that in his Department a Minister should make all appointments.  In fact, at the present time a Minister can have full control in his Department, can carry out his policies, can do everything that a Minister should do, although he has no control over appointments.  In my Department the men who are in office are either men I found there&mdash;and that would always be the position in regard to any county council&mdash;or the men who have been put there as the result of the operations of the Civil Service Commission. I do not feel that it is any insult to me that I am not allowed to make appointments.  I do not wish to make them.  But, in any case, looking <Col N="1842" /> at it in a broad way, you may take it that no Minister would fail to be influenced in the long run by the kind of pressure he would be subjected to if he had the making of appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's position is not analogous to that of a public body.  The public body is the payer; it finds the funds to pay these men, and the Minister is only an official, so to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister finds the funds just as much as the public body finds them.  The public body is only a trustee for the people.  Deputy Wilson has just disclosed the whole thing. The idea has grown up that the people who serve on public boards have a right to dispense patronage as a reward for their services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, not at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>At all events, the idea is that because people serve on public boards they have a right to put their friends into positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the idea. and whether they acknowledge it or not, that is what is at the back of the Deputy's argument.  It is suggested that a panel of two or three names should be put forward to the public bodies. What argument is there in favour of that except that there should be canvassing, except that there should be an opportunity of putting in somebody who has a pull, who is not the best man?  If the public board is not competent&mdash;and it is not competent to decide which is the best of a group of candidates for, say, a dispensary&mdash;it is not competent to decide between two or three names that may be put forward, and there is no reason in favour of the submission of a panel to the board other than that the board should be enabled to appoint people who are not the best because of reasons of influence or because of reasons of political affiliation.  I feel that that is entirely bad.  It is bad in the case of a Government Department that a Minister should have a choice and that he should appoint somebody who perhaps was clearly not the best person, simply because that person has some means of <Col N="1843" /> getting at him.  There is a complete analogy between a Minister in charge of a Department and a public board. The Minister is a trustee; he is there simply doing the duty of the public, dealing with public money, money which is not his own.  The public body is there as a representative of the ratepayers, and its members are dealing with money that is not their own.  If it is not an indignity for a Minister, it is not an indignity for a public body.</P>
      <P>There were great difficulties in introducing the competitive examination system into the British Civil Service; there was great opposition to it, but it was found to be an improved system, and it gradually spread.  As a matter of fact, we have carried it a step further.  It is really no argument to say that the present system of local appointments is an inherited one.  That kind of system prevailed in the State service.  It has been got rid of.  It is a logical development that we should now carry into the local authorities' services the system that has been found good in the State service.  I believe that in regard to local appointments, as in regard to State appointments, the object should be to get the best person for the service, and so far as possible, to have the appointments on the same uniform and consistent basis.  There is no reason at all why the person who can use his influence should succeed, why the poor man's son should be prejudiced, rather than the rich man's son.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Baxter said that it was a scandalous thing to suggest that dispensary appointments should not be made by the votes of members of the local authorities.  I heard of a case lately where dispensary appointments were made by a selection board, and the individual whose expression of view I heard was not one of those appointed. There were three appointments, and he came fifth or sixth, I think.  He was asked what he thought about it, and he said: &ldquo;I am very well satisfied. I have no influence.  If it had been by the old method I would not have troubled to apply, because I would not have got sixtieth if there had been voting.&rdquo;  There was a person, who had not been appointed, expressing <Col N="1844" /> himself highly satisfied with the result of it, and I believe that this development of the methods we have adopted in the Civil Service in the sphere of the local authorities will meet, in time, with the approbation of every section, that when the members of councils have had experience of it they will be pleased with it.  People who desire appointments will, in the main, be pleased with it, because those who are defeated will be satisfied if somebody better than themselves gets the appointment, and it will be in the interests of the ratepayers.  I think that we should not pay any attention to the kind of outcry that will arise from people who like to exercise patronage.  There are always people who are pulling strings, and there have been people who pulled strings in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>And in the Minister's constituency particularly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that. There was a case where we had for an important position two very good candidates. The whole county was canvassed for a year in advance.  That is a most undesirable thing.  I know in that particular case that there were people who did not go forward for election to the county council because they did not want to have to take sides. I think you will find that instead of having the result that Deputy Johnson indicated, of men refusing to go forward because these appointments are taken away from the local authorities, men who now do not want to have the trouble that they continually have of being canvassed will be ready to serve on the boards under the new arrangement. There seems to me to be absolutely no logic in the arguments of Deputy Baxter and Deputy Wilson. They admit certain abuses: they admit that the system is not perfect, that it has faults; and still, simply because there is a certain vested interest in question they do not want a change to be made, or they want us to go only half way, to take some step short of what is proper and necessary.  The idea that there should be a panel is simply to try to leave those who like wire-pulling some power of doing it. Certainly it could give no other results. <Col N="1845" /> It is not proposed that the ordinary manual appointments should be made the subject of the operation of this Board.  What are really concerned are the official appointments, those which correspond to Civil Service appointments. It is not necessary that there should be examinations for each separate appointment.  For instance, if a number of county medical officers of health are to be appointed there might be one examination.  The top man could then have his choice and the next man his choice, and in a great many cases it should be possible to deal with a series of appointments by means of the one examination.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnson referred to Section 10.  That section is certainly not necessary to the spirit of the Bill.  It is a section, as I understand, to meet with difficulties which might arise when the system is new through a council refusing to make an obviously proper promotion or refusing altogether to take some pensioned officer of its own or some local adjacent board who would be entirely suitable and whose employment would be a relief to the taxpayer, but when the system is working for some time there will be no need for the powers given in the section.  There might be need for them in the beginning and that really brings me back to the question whether an appointment might be by the Minister or the local board.  In the case of Government departments the appointment is by the Minister but no trouble occurs there.  When a candidate passes an examination he is appointed in the Minister's name.  The Minister probably does not hear about it; but you can anticipate the result if a name was sent down to a local authority and if they had to take a vote to make the appointment and if the name was not a favourable one.  If the council were well canvassed and were in favour of somebody and if another name was sent down you would practically have to appoint a Commission before the appointment was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the thing were working properly, and if you could depend on all the local bodies behaving reasonably and carrying out the spirit of the law as well as the letter, there would be no reason why <Col N="1846" /> the appointment should not be made and why the name should not be sent down to them.  Someone would propose that the appointment be formally made and to have it passed without any trouble, but we know, in the circumstances, that if some positive act had to be done by the local authority just when these powers of patronage were taken from them, a great deal of trouble and debate would be raised.  I know this is an Act which will probably arouse some little friction in the beginning, and that is a reason why the board is being set up.  The Civil Service Commission were not willing to go into it, at least some of them.  This is a new duty, because where any sort of dispute occurs, with the Department, it is settled by correspondence.  If the dispute were to occur in future with the local board, you would have local papers with pages of the dispute, for a week at a time, and members of the Civil Service Commission do not wish to be dragged into the kind of controversy that might arise.  That will only be a temporary thing, and will not last if Deputies will realise there is no necessary connection between the proper discharge of duties by a public board and control of appointments. Once a man is appointed, his position is the same in both cases, and is secure. They might have a greater control over a man who never canvassed any of the members, who had no faction on his side, and who came in there on his merits.</P>

I do not know in what way they differ.  He has practically the same powers.  At the moment we are talking about the principle of the Bill and what I conceive to be the principle of the Bill.</P>

      <P>What I suggested is that the principle of the Bill is really, so far as it can be done, laying down that local appointments to positions under local authorities should be made in the same way as the appointments to the Civil Service of the State are made, and that this business of election by a board should be done away with just as appointments by a Minister have been done away with.  I think that is the principle of the Bill.  There are various subsidiary clauses and additional powers, but that is the central principle, and I think the House will certainly be refusing to help a most important and valuable reform if it does not accept the main principle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. CONLAN Mr. CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>From the attitude taken by the Minister it would seem to me at least that he is satisfied only with the Bill, the whole Bill and nothing but the Bill.  I look on this as a reactionary measure inasmuch as it deprives local bodies of their rights and powers which have been given them by the Local Government Act of 1898.  As the House is aware, that Act was passed into law by the then Mr. Arthur Balfour, now Lord Balfour, and as we all know, he was no great admirer or lover of the Irish people. At the same time he thought it unnecessary to hamper local bodies, set up <Col N="1848" /> in that Bill, with all the restraints the Minister now seeks.  It appears he had more confidence in the honour and integrity of the Irish public bodies than the present Government has.</P>
      <P>A great deal has been said about the abuses which have crept into the present system.  I have been in close association with the officials of the county in which I reside, and also with the staffs of public bodies of three or four other counties.  I say, in point of administrative ability, and integrity, they can compare favourably with any body of administrators that can be set up under this Act.  Deputy Wilson has dealt with the point that this measure is likely to undermine discipline in the staffs of local bodies.  I think there is a good deal in that contention.  People naturally look to those who have the right of appointment and the right of dismissal, and the attitude towards them will be in the degree that they consider them their masters.  This Bill will deprive local bodies of the power and authority they have at present over those officials.  A little time ago, under the Local Government Act, it was said that one of the chief reasons for bringing forward that measure was that certain local bodies such as district councils and boards of guardians were created.  We had a change in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have recently had an election for men to act on the county councils and their various committees, and now it appears that these recently elected bodies are also suspect and that the Minister is not prepared to trust them in making even minor appointments. There is one thing certain and that is that this measure is, and will be, resented in the country by men who have very exacting duties to perform and who have to give a considerable portion of their time to the transaction of these duties.  It is very poor reward for the sacrifices which they make to conduct the business of the country to be deprived of the little authority which they possess at present.  This Bill is a step towards centralisation, of which the Government is so enamoured.  As has been stated by other Deputies on these benches, we do not object to anything in the way of <Col N="1849" /> getting the best men that can be got for election, but, at the same time, we hold that, when a certain number of men have proved themselves to be up to the standard and to be eligible for election, the right of appointment should rest with the local body.  It does not follow that because a man passes an examination and, perhaps, comes out first in it, he is going to be a good administrator.  The Minister for External Affairs is not present in the House at the moment but if he were he would probably confirm what I am going to say regarding the experience of another State which has gone in for examinations to such an extent that no man can get any post without passing an examination.  I allude to the Chinese Empire&mdash;I believe it is the Chinese Republic now. They have not got very far as a result of their system of examination.</P>

By men who are performing arduous duties, and who consider it a poor reward for those duties to remove the discretion, at present vested in them, in the matter of public appointments, so that the right to make public appointments, according to Deputy Conlan's idea, is the reward for the performance of arduous and exacting duties.

      <P>What offices were filled?  We came here in the early lifetime of this Parliament with a Bill constituting the Civil Service Commission. The fact is that up and down the country members of public bodies, members of farmers' unions, and members of other organisations, have been talking about an orgy of jobbery and about appointments to the public service on grounds other than a man's capacity to perform the particular function assigned to him.  There is the <Col N="1851" /> acid test of the sincerity of that talk. Are the local bodies prepared to do as Ministers have done, namely, to do their jobs with staffs supplied by a competent tribunal and to divest themselves of patronage, in the same way as Ministers, by their own will, have divested themselves of it?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>On this question as to who performs the formal act of appointment, if appointment is to be automatic on the recommendation of the tribunal, does it matter in whom it lies?  If the person is nominated by the Commission, is it a material point who performs the formal act of appointment? The reason for prescribing in the Bill that that act shall be performed by the Minister is the reason given by the Minister for Finance, namely, that where a name is sent down, which is not the name that was desired by a majority of a particular local body, you are courting the position that they will refrain from making that particular appointment, and you do not want simply to court that kind of clash to secure that where the appointment is duly made, you would almost have to dissolve the local body and appoint a commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main principle of this Bill is to secure that people will be appointed to the public service on merit, and merit alone; that the personal equation will be eliminated, and that the public will get, in the various services that are under the auspices of the local authorities, the best men to perform the duties.  That is what matters to the public, whether we take health in the case of dispensaries, sanitation in the <Col N="1852" /> case of engineers, or the work performed by officials under the county boards of health in the administration of the poor relief Acts.  It does matter, and matters very vitally, to the public that men shall be appointed because of their qualifications, because of their competence to perform the office rather than because of the accidental circumstance that their aunt married a cousin of some member of a local authority.  Deputy Connor Hogan can take Deputy Conlan, Deputy Baxter and Deputy Wilson out to the lobby for a few minutes and have a little quiet talk with them as to the degree to which men are appointed to public positions because of reasons of that kind, and perhaps when they come back they can make another speech and tell the Dáil that on the whole they are inclined to reconsider their position.</P>

      <P>To my mind this Bill is another effort on the part of the Local Government Department to filch, little by little, from local boards throughout the country any authority that they possess.  The tendency of the Local Government Department in this House for some time past has been to treat the local authorities all over the country as so many children.  In my opinion this Bill gives the Minister powers, the extent of which Deputies will not fully realise until they are found in operation, and then they will see that they are against the best interests of their constituents.  The Bill gives the Minister more power than he is aware of himself.  Different interpretations can be placed upon this Bill, interpretations different to those which have been expressed either on this side of the House or on the Government side.  The discussion that took place on Section 2 bore upon the appointment of a medical officer, town clerk or secretary to a county council.  I would like to point out that in paragraph (c) of that section the Minister can take upon himself to appoint even a street-cleaner. In my opinion that is going a little too far.  Deputies on these benches, as well as on the Farmers' benches, have already stated that we are out to get the best results so far as appointments to public boards are concerned. The Minister for Local Government said last night that the Government had divested themselves of patronage.  In my opinion the Minister is investing himself with patronage under this Bill.  As far as I can see, it is not the men who come out on top at examinations who are going to be appointed under this particular scheme. <Col N="1854" /> The names of three or four men may be sent up to the Minister, but according to the Bill the Minister will have the right to ask for certain qualifications, apart altogether from the results achieved by means of a competitive examination.</P>
      <P>For instance, it is the policy of the Department and of the Government at the moment to see that ex-Army men get preference in jobs.  I think the Government know that I am not against ex-Army men or ex-Army officers as such; but, take it that the names of six or seven men are sent up by this particular Commission; the seventh name on the list may be that of an ex-Army man, and because of the policy of the Government in this connection the seventh man must, I think, be appointed at this particular time.  I do not think that is the way to get the best results, nor do I think that in that way you are going to get the best possible men for a particular job in a particular area.  The Minister talks about vested interests and of doing away with canvassing.  As a member of a public board for a considerable time, I must say that canvassing is a nuisance.  There is no question about that, and in my opinion it should be regarded as a disqualification in the case of a candidate seeking a position.  I have advocated that time and again.  What really is being done under this Bill is, that a manager, or what is tantamount to a manager, is being appointed over the public boards.  You cannot expect to get loyal service from a servant who is put in to act over the heads of the local authorities, and that is what is being done here.  It is all very well to talk about loss of dignity.  It is not altogether a question of dignity.  Surely, the men who have been trusted with the confidence of the people and who were elected to represent certain areas, have the right to appoint their own officers. They pay the piper and they ought to have the right to call the tune and to make their own appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have stated, we want to get the best men possible for public positions. The Labour Party has always advocated competitive examinations, but this cannot be described as a system of competitive <Col N="1855" /> examination in its entirety.  It is giving patronage to the Minister, and though the Minister himself, as well as the Minister for Finance, and the Minister for Justice have said that they are trying to get away from that it is absolutely patent in this Bill that patronage is being given to the Minister under it.  That is clear in Section 2 and in other sections of the Bill.  It may be the intention of the Minister to have the best people appointed, but from reading the Bill that is not the impression that one gains from it.  I cannot support the Bill, and for the reasons I have stated, I propose to vote against the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>I desire to congratulate the Minister in bringing forward this Bill.  I have been a member of public boards for a great number of years, and from my personal experience on them, I can say that one of the greatest curses we have in the country is this system of canvassing for public appointments, whether in connection with county councils or other public bodies.  Not long ago there was an appointment of a medical officer to be made in a certain local area.  Three or four gentlemen offered themselves for the position.  We found in the end that the man elected was the one who had the greatest pull and was the most incompetent. Recently an election was held for an appointment under the county council in my district.  There were five applicants for the position, and I must say that the most incompetent of the five was elected owing to the pull that he had.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing in this Bill, and I propose to give him all the support that I can in connection with the measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisJosephDalton" hpid="Mr. D'ALTON Mr. D'ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening to a number of speeches in connection with this Bill, and particularly one from the Minister for Justice, who talks of the high standard to which he is going to raise the administration of public affairs, higher than ever was the dream of the men we followed in the past.  His idea with regard to raising the standard of national life and <Col N="1856" /> public spirit is to tell the people that the abuses that have occurred in the past in some of our public bodies are likely to continue unless the people on the public boards who act with justice and firmness in the best interests of the country are told they are not to be trusted.  These representatives on public boards have been elected by the people as the custodians of their affairs but they are to be told they cannot be trusted unless they are under the direction of a master mind that can say. &ldquo;You can go so far but not further.&rdquo; In this matter the Minister is simply putting a pitchfork before the tide.  If there are boards in Ireland that do not do their duty it is for the people to get rid of their representatives on these boards.  If authority to make appointments is to be vested in the Minister for Local Government it will be found the type of candidate that should go forward for service on those public boards will not do so.  You will get the type of candidate who will act with a sense of duty to the ratepayers, the public and himself.  He will not go on public boards as a mere nominee, a man who has no authority at all.  Why should he under such conditions waste his time by going on public boards?</P>
      <P>Unfortunately there are not enough of the best men going on public boards, as anybody acquainted with public affairs knows and regrets.  This is not a matter of to-day or yesterday. It dates back for many years.  It applied not only to the Dublin Corporation but to various parts of the country. The patronage of that time, without which nothing could be got, was exercised by the English garrison.  We want nothing of that.  We believe in competitive examination as the means of appointing the right man, and not appointing a man because he happens to be locally connected.  If positions are given to people who are not qualified, simply because they have relations on the public boards.  I say it is a pity. People in the Free State would have little regard for their dignity if they continued to appoint to positions men who are not qualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My idea is that the county council or other local bodies when filling a vacancy should make a selection from <Col N="1857" /> the candidates and send them to the Local Government Department to undergo examination.  The Local Government Department could then send down the names of those who are qualified for the position, and if an appointment were made in that way it could not be said that a person was appointed who was not qualified.  I do not see anything wrong with selecting from five or six candidates sent up two or three of the best qualified men after competitive examination.  Of course you may get an assistant secretary of a county council who has a better knowledge of the work than any man who can be appointed through this system of examination in Dublin, for he has acted for years in that capacity.  In all such cases, where a man has a record it should be a question of promotion.</P>

      <P>I would support the promotion of a man who has given entire satisfaction to the council, and I believe that would be the best thing for the ratepayers and the public.  I do not believe in central control.  I do not believe in taking from local bodies affairs that should be in their hands. I believe that any officer of a local body who does not do his duty should be dismissed immediately.  No local authority should retain in its service a man who is not doing his work, and by acting on that principle you would have the right class of official administering affairs.  I do not believe in this Bill, which is taking control out of the hands of the people elected.  At the last election there was no question of centralisation. There was no idea that local bodies were to be superseded and Commissioners appointed.  If these local bodies cannot be trusted, if they have no idea of what their civic duties are, I would be in favour, after they had been given a fair opportunity of improving and doing their duty, of making a change, whether by the appointment of the Commissioners or otherwise.  If the time comes when local bodies will not use their powers as they should be used, then I say it would be the time to act, but to take <Col N="1858" /> that power out of their hands otherwise would not be fair to the ratepayers who have elected these representatives on public bodies to administer rates that are raised by themselves, subject to the control of the Local Government Department.  I do not believe that the Bill is necessary at the present time.  I certainly do not approve of clauses 10 and 12, and I will refuse to vote for a Second Reading.</P>

      <P>I wish to say that I thoroughly welcome the general principle of this Bill.

I have no hesitation in saying that the system of appointing officers in local bodies is a dismal failure, and that nobody realises it more than the candidates for these positions themselves. I have some experience of public boards and public bodies, and I would venture to assert that the vast majority of county and urban councils throughout the country, so far from resenting this Bill, will welcome it from their hearts, because if it did nothing else it will relieve them of the intolerable nuisance of canvassing which goes on in connection with these appointments and which none of us who are public representatives can get away from.</P>

      <P>I would like to deal with the remarks of Deputy D'Alton.  He mentioned that public boards are so perfect that they require no order, so to speak, from headquarters, so that they should have a free hand.  A little while ago I sat on a Commission that was set up by the Dáil to help to straighten out the machinery to administer a certain Act.  A member of a public board was one of the witnesses examined, and he admitted before that Commission that in the public board of which he was a member, the general rule was that they would act the good fellows, when certain claims came before them that they would pass them, knowing that the Government would hold the big stick still in their hands and turn down those things that they had approved of in their spirit of generosity.  There is that feeling in public boards.  I am a member of a public board, and I know that not very long ago the Local Government Department drew our attention to a certain case in which one of our officials absented himself, and was not doing his work.  It came before the board and the feeling there was to be good fellows.  &ldquo;We will reinstate him,&rdquo; they said.  &ldquo;It is a slip. He is a good fellow just the same.  Of course, the Government are right, but at the same time we must keep him on.&rdquo;  Deputy D'Alton is not quite at home in his remarks about the perfection of the public boards, and I think it is well that we have a higher authority than public boards to give people their rights.</P>

      <P>It is one thing to have it there and another thing to exercise it.  What I really want to point out to the Dáil is the tendency of these measures that have been introduced by the Minister for Local Government. It seems to me that it is leading up to the abolition of local bodies in this country, and centralisation. It seems to be the belief of the present Ministry that the ratepayers of this country are not able to elect to local bodies men who are prepared and able to do their work honestly and well.  Following that out, if the people of the country are not able to put men on the public bodies to do the work of those local authorities in a proper way then they certainly are not able to do the work of electing people to a national assembly.  The people who voted in the Ministry are the people who voted in the local authorities. There is this whole principle underlying every action of the Ministry, that they are infallible, and that not only are they able and fitted to do the national work, but they are also able and fitted to do the work of the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government, and two of the three ex-Ministers for Local Government&mdash;perhaps it is one of the explanations of this peculiar Local Government legislation that we have a Minister for Local Government and three ex-Ministers for Local Government, notwithstanding the short time that the State is in being&mdash;all emphasised the point that they have done away with patronage.  Apparently they are sorry they did that, and they want now to exercise patronage in connection with the local authorities.  That appears to me to be the position.  I am prepared to agree, to a very large extent, with Deputy <Col N="1861" /> Egan.  I do not claim to have as much experience of public boards as he has, but I was a member of local bodies for a number of years, and I agree that the system of canvassing and bribery was certainly nothing short of a public scandal and that any fair measures that can be taken to eliminate it should certainly have the support of every public-spirited man.</P>

For the past thirty years I have sat on the premier public board in my own county and I must say that in that time I have never witnessed one case of corruption or bribery.  I do not think that the Bill introduced is going to improve things in the least in our county as far as corruption, bribery, or anything like that is concerned. We do not, at all, wish to put men who are not suitable into these positions.  We are quite agreeable to try and get the best men, but we would like to have the final selection of these men left to the boards.  I do not believe that the Bill will make for any great change in local government in any shape or form, except in some counties, such as the county represented by Deputy Egan, where bribery and corruption are rampant, according to him.</P>

      <P>A lot has been said about the system of canvassing for public positions under public boards. To my mind the county councils could stop that without this Bill.  I know in my own county we stopped it.  We made it illegal.  We let every candidate know that if he canvassed he certainly would not be eligible for the position and to a very large extent we stopped canvassing throughout the county. Why should not other county councils do this if they are so troubled by canvassing? We are not troubled to that extent at all.  We simply let them put their qualifications before us by letter but not otherwise.  Any candidate who is found to be canvassing directly or indirectly is simply disqualified for the position.  I do not see why other county councils could not carry out the same rule in their counties.  Therefore, I hold that the Bill, to a certain extent, is not wanted; at least it is not wanted in a good many counties.  The Bill has been before the public bodies in my county and they all declare that it is not wanted, that they are getting along well, that they have good officers in every position they hold.  You cannot heat their officers in any county in the Saorstát.  They were all appointed by the local authorities and they are well able to do their work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. RODDY Mr. RODDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support wholeheartedly the principle underlying the Bill although in some respects it is not a very admirable production. It is time that some steps should be taken to remedy abuses in connection with local appointments. Members of the Dáil who have experience of local affairs must agree that canvassing is the bane of their existence and that in the overwhelming majority of cases it means that the candidate with the greatest influence behind him will get <Col N="1863" /> the vacant position irrespective of qualifications.  The candidate without the pull or the poor man's son, to whom the Minister for Finance referred a moment ago, will be left out in the cold no matter what his abilities are.  I cannot conceive a fairer method of selection than that indicated in the Bill and already it is my experience that where examinations have been held in connection with appointments which occurred quite recently under public boards, the candidates selected have given entire satisfaction and this method of selection is working out successfully. Everyone will agree who has experience of local administration that the successful working of public bodies depends almost entirely on the chief executive officer, and in my opinion the severest test ought to be applied in order to ensure that the most capable and the best qualified candidates available are appointed to these positions, because, after all, no matter how experienced a county council may be and no matter what the capabilities of its chairman are, unless you have a highly capable and highly efficient chief executive officer you cannot have successful administration in that county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Admittedly the success of the administration depends entirely on the abilities and the capacity of the chief executive officer.  I do not see any other means of selecting the most highly qualified and most capable candidate except by examination.  The Minister stated in his Second Reading speech yesterday that the Bill was urgent in view of some appointment to be made in each county in the near future.  I refer to the county medical officers of health.  I think the members of this Dáil who are medical practitioners will agree that there is room for a great deal of improvement in the medical services in the country, and the best way to secure that improvement in these services is to see that the most highly qualified man that it is possible to obtain should be appointed. The county medical services will be under his control and it will be his duty to remedy whatever defects exist in the present system.  An appointment <Col N="1864" /> of that kind could not very well be made by the county board of health or by the county council.  It follows naturally that some board of specialists should be set up for the purpose of making this appointment.  It is not sufficiently clear whether the Bill applies to boards of health, which, as far as I am aware, are statutory local authorities under the Local Government Act of 1925.  Owing to the transfer of many functions which were heretofore performed by the district councils, the members of such a board will have a monopoly of local appointments, and it is necessary in the interests of efficiency in administration that some at least of the more important appointments should come within the scope of this Bill.  The same thing applies, of course, to the secretaries of old age pensions committees, except the position of secretary to the County Old Age Pensions Committee.</P>
    <P>Another important item in the Bill is the appointment of Commissioners. I take it that there are not to be more than three local Commissioners for the whole of the Saorstát.  Such a number, in my opinion, would be quite sufficient. This is a point that is not made clear in the Bill on account of the word &ldquo;local&rdquo; being used.  There is not sufficient information in the Bill as to who the Commissioners are to be, what their qualifications are to be, whether they are to be on the basis of whole-time experts and paid a salary accordingly, or whether their actions may be scrutinised by any authority.  I would also like to know whether they are to be chosen from any particular profession, and whether they are to have a knowledge of the Irish language, which is the official language of the country. These are points that are not very clear from reading the Bill, but I assume the Minister in his concluding statement will deal with some of these points at least.</P>
    <P>I think in this Bill, perhaps, there is too much authority left in the hands of the Department and the Executive Council.  In my opinion, one of the Commissioners ought to be a lawyer with a degree other than a legal degree. Another to look after the health services throughout the country should <Col N="1865" /> be a doctor with a diploma of public health.  I should say that both of these men should have at least ten years' experience in their respective professions. I think that is a very important point, as the success of this measure will depend to a large extent on the types of men you select as local Commissioners. I would suggest that the third Commissioner should be a lady.  There are certain reasons in view of the nature of the public health services why a lady should be one of the members of this body.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt there is a great deal of opposition&mdash;there seems to be a certain amount, at any rate&mdash;to this Bill in the country.  Local authorities undoubtedly have the feeling that the tendency on the part of the Department of Local Government and Public Health and its officials in Dublin, is to centralise all matters at headquarters here.  In order to overcome that objection and make the Bill more palatable to them, I would suggest that the chairman or vice-chairman of the local authority concerned should be invited to sit with the Commissioners when dealing with any appointments.  This would establish a point of contact between the local authority and the Minister, and, in addition, it would give the public a direct interest in the work of the Commissioners.  In that way you would help to remove a good deal of the suspicion that will inevitably arise when this Bill becomes law; that suspicion is bound to continue for some time after the Bill is given legal effect to, and it is desirable to remove it.</P>

I certainly think the Bill <Col N="1866" /> needs to be amended considerably in many of its sections, and I think that the Minister, when he is making his concluding statement, should be a little more explicit, especially with regard to the payment of Commissioners.</P>

      <P>As I was a member of nearly all the public bodies in Kildare for twenty-eight or twenty-nine years, I feel I should be wanting in my duty if I did not give my opinion on this Bill for what it may be worth.  Most people who have had anything to do with local government in this country in the past must be of opinion that in regard to the appointments that were made a great deal of exception could be taken to the method of making the appointments.  Many years ago I was of opinion that some system such as is brought forward in this Bill ought to be adopted.  There ought to be some competitive system so that the best and most efficient man would be appointed, and not one who would be selected merely for his personal popularity, or, perhaps, because of the influence his people were able to exert in his behalf.</P>
      <P>I think the conditions that existed in regard to appointments were most undesirable.  In many cases the matter of efficiency was clean lost sight of in the desire to appoint a certain person. Most of us are aware that in connection with the appointment of doctors there was open scandal all over the country; everybody was canvassed to such a degree that one had almost to hide in any backway or hedgeway in order to get out of the way of canvassers.  I remember on one occasion, while a strike was on, being pursued by two parties who were canvassing for doctors, and I recollect having great difficulty in evading them.  I think it is most undesirable that that sort of thing should continue.</P>

      <P>I do not allege bribery at all, but I allege that undue influence has been used.  It is not for the national good or for the good of a county that popularity in a candidate should be the only thing considered. <Col N="1867" /> We should go in for efficiency.  We are spending public money and we ought to get the best value possible for it.  In the past I always thought that was not done, except sometimes by chance.  When I say that I do not mean that some of the appointments were not very excellent ones; but the method by which the appointments were made was certainly most undesirable. I think this Bill will go a long way towards removing certain inequalities and the wrong methods of selection which were in operation.</P>
      <P>There are one or two things that the Government has done especially well. One good thing was the removal of J.P.'s.  That has made for clean administration of justice and a more even distribution of justice.  I think this Bill, which aims at having the best men appointed, the men with the most ability, is a good second.  I hope that out of this measure will come a great advance in the purity and better administration of local government.</P>

      <P>I would be in favour of this Bill if it proposed to set up a system of local Civil Service, but it does not do so.  It proposes to give the Minister, acting through the local appointments committee, the power of filling senior appointments on the local boards; it gives power in respect to all appointments, but the greater number of positions to be filled will probably be senior positions.  I think the House will recognise that a system of competitive examination may be a good one when you come to deal with junior appointments, with young men fresh from school; but when you have to deal with men who are to fill responsible posts requiring a good deal of administrative ability and other qualities, the system of competitive examination forms an insufficient test, and is not a suitable means of finding out the candidate best qualified.  I maintain this Bill is not serving any useful purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is taking away power from the local boards.  He is taking that power into his own hands, acting through the Civil Service Commission.  As I view <Col N="1868" /> the matter, it is simply taking the power of patronage from the local boards and placing it in the hands of the Minister, and the canvassing which in the past took place with local representatives will, in the future, be transferred to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I look upon this Bill in its present form as practically a vote of censure on the new councils recently established. Under the Act of 1923 we set up a number of new councils with much greater powers and responsibilities than had been attached to those bodies in the past.  The members of these boards faced extremely difficult problems of economy, retrenchment and re-organisation, following on a system in regard to which the Minister for Local Government and the members of his Party cannot avoid responsibility. They cannot avoid responsibility in regard to the chaos and semi-chaos that had arisen in many boards, and particularly in regard to their financial commitments.  Under the Act of 1923 we started on a new system.  We have given greater powers and responsibilities to those new bodies, and the first thing that the Minister does, following this, is to bring forward a Bill which is in effect a vote of censure upon, and a lack of confidence in, these boards.</P>
      <P>The Minister will say, of course, that these appointments will not all be made by competitive examination, that there is also power in the Bill to deal with applicants in other ways besides that of competition.  That is so, but I maintain when it comes to dealing with applicants by other courses than those of competition the proper people to deal with them are the local representatives. They are the men acquainted in most cases with the candidates, their qualifications, character and general administrative ability; they are the proper men, and not this Commission to whom the candidates will be practically unknown when they come forward. The local representatives are the men who should be in a position to select the candidates best suited, in every sense, to fill the appointments that are proposed to be filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill as it stands does not meet with my approval.  I believe the underlying principle of the Bill is reasonably <Col N="1869" /> sound; that we ought to try and arrive at some method whereby we can select a man because of his merits.  But I do not see that this Bill is going to provide that.  We are going to have a local appointments commission set up. That commission may be composed of civil servants, officers possibly taken from the different Departments concerned. Are we to take it those civil servants will be perfectly independent &mdash;that they will not be consciously or unconsciously influenced by the desires of the Minister?  I do not say the present Minister is going to try to influence any commission he may set up, but I do maintain that the outlook of a commission of that kind is bound to be affected by the Minister's outlook. And further than that, the Minister does retain the right, under Section 10, actually to recommend and suggest that certain people be selected, and, as far as I can gather from Section 10, when the Minister does suggest that certain persons be selected, the commission has certainly no option but to select such persons provided they have reasonable educational qualifications.</P>
    <P>Now I suggested in this House before that the proper way to deal with local services is to have a local Civil Service, and that we should hold competitive examinations for the junior appointments, and that we should promote by seniority and merit.  If such a proposition is brought forward by the Minister I will be prepared to support it, but this Bill, as it stands, does not do anything of the kind.  It proposes to take from the men we have placed on the local councils the only bit of patronage they have.  I do not suggest that these men want patronage for any personal results that may come from it, but when you throw personal responsibility upon men, and ask them to give time and intelligence, without remuneration, to the work of public boards you must, at least, show that you have confidence in their integrity. You appointed them to carry on the work, and now you say to them, &ldquo;We do not trust you in the final selection of the men suitable to fill your official posts.&rdquo;  I say the proper way to deal with this matter, for the present, is to <Col N="1870" /> hold qualifying examinations, and when these qualifying examinations are held, the men qualified should be submitted to the local board for final selection.  I am confident there is no body, Civil Service Commissioners or Ministers, more capable of selecting men suitable to fill these appointments than the local bodies themselves.  That being the case I cannot give my support to this Bill as it stands.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Morrissey was unfair in the analogy he sought to establish between what the Government is doing with regard to its own officials, and what it proposes to do with regard to the officials of local bodies.  He said that the voters who elected the local bodies are the same voters who elected the Government, and that they are equally competent to appoint their officials.  But the analogy he sought to draw is not at all complete.  The Government does not propose to take from voters in the County Tipperary, for instance, the right to elect the councillors of Tipperary. The Bill does not contemplate that at all.  The Local Government voters of Tipperary can still elect the council the same as formerly.  But the voters never elected the officials. The officials, working for the Executive Council, are all appointed after competitive examination, and what this Bill proposes to do is not to lower, in any way, the dignity of the local councils, but rather to raise their dignity. At present the officers working for the Government are selected after competitive examinations.  This Bill proposes that the officers now working for local bodies shall be selected in the same way, so that the local bodies will see that, in that respect, they are being put on a level with the Executive Council.</P>

He might go in for the examination and pass the examination; then why should he not be selected for the position by the Commission if he is the best man?  I was greatly surprised at the argument used by Deputy Heffernan.  He is in favour of a Civil Service for local officials, but he objects to a scheme that lays the foundation for that Civil Service.  He says in one breath: &ldquo;We do not want patronage; we want fair play.&rdquo;  In the next breath, he says: &ldquo;Why should we not give any patronage that is going to the men who are doing the work?&rdquo;  He cannot have it both ways.

      <P>The Bill we are now discussing has for its object the removal, amongst other abuses, of the abuse of nepotism.  I should be no enemy of nepotism.  As an official of a local authority, anything I ever got was due to nepotism.  It is well to be candid.  My qualifications were never considered.  I was fortunate in having relatives and friends in the local body and they never failed me.  That is the way with every other local authority and local official in Ireland. It has struck me that the opposition to the present Bill partakes of the nature of an unholy alliance.  We have, on the one hand, the Farmers' Party and, on the other hand, we have Deputy Johnson's Party.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson, with his usual Parliamentary <i>finesse</i>, queers the issue, but, nevertheless, when speaking last evening, he convinced me that he was as jealous of the patronage of the local bodies as any Deputy on the Farmers' benches.  True enough, he feared the nepotism of the Minister for Local Government more, and he attempted to prove that there was an opportunity for nepotism to be exercised by that Minister, relying mainly for support of that contention on Section 10, paragraphs (a) and (b), of the Bill.  I have read those paragraphs. I do not profess to be a lawyer or to be capable of interpreting them properly.  But I think they are, to a great extent, quite harmless and that there is a good deal to be said for them.  Paragraph (a) would seem to me to make provision for the promotion of an official, while paragraph (b) deals with the case of an officer who, under the amalgamation scheme, found himself in receipt of an allowance or gratuity.  We know that a lot of those men were excellent officials.  I know many medical men&mdash;most capable surgeons&mdash;to have failed to get transferred because they had not friends enough on the new body.</P>

      <P>I think when the Minister comes to reply he will show you that he is giving you all that you want.  I believe that is all the Deputies on the Government benches want. As regards competitive examination, it has been said that this form of examination, especially in the case of professional men, is not the best test.  I agree with that.  I will tell the Dáil how they may get better men.  If this Commission, in making the appointments, lets it be understood that any man who has done six months' post-graduate work in, say, surgery, six months' post-graduate work in medicine, or six months' post-graduate work in midwifery will get a preference, better men will be got.  If you get a man who has done this course satisfactorily, you will get a man much better than the man you are getting now&mdash;a man with experience and a man well trained.</P>

      <P>Regulations framed under this Act, when it becomes an Act, will give it to you.  I am certain, from my experience, that the Selection Boards will give it to you, and I believe that this Bill has for its object simply the perpetuation of the Selection Board system.</P>
      <P>We are told that this Bill is a vote of censure on the local bodies.  Deputy Heffernan's family, many of whom were distinguished medical men, owe something to competitive examination. It gave them an opportunity of becoming distinguished men in other services. But for the principle of competitive examination, they would never have had that chance.  Instead of this Bill being a vote of censure on the local authorities, the object of the Minister, and the object of the Government, I think, is to remove temptations from the frailties of human nature (interruption).  I may say, by way of explanation, that I do not hear interruptions. It takes me all my time to give attention to my own thoughts. With reference to the vote of censure on public boards, we need only go back to last November when the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Bill was going through the Dáil and when certain exemptions were claimed in regard to the appointment of professional men.  The Labour Deputies and the Farmer Deputies showed a wonderful anxiety to save the Government from their own frailties.  They wanted everything done by the Civil Service Commission.  Deputy Heffernan, on that occasion, made a speech which, if it were good then, I believe should be good now.  I will give you a brief extract from that speech:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, if the Dáil grants this power, it opens the door to all kinds of possible jobbery and the giving of appointments to men who have earned the right to the appointments, not because of real ability, but because of political services.  I do agree with the Deputies who have already spoken, that the present Minister had no intention of that kind in his mind when introducing <Col N="1875" /> the Bill, but the fact remains in any case that it can be used for that purpose.  It is my opinion that there are very few appointments that cannot be filled by competitive examinations. I think it should be the ideal to be aimed at, and that every possible appointment should be filled by means of competitive examination. It was the ideal put forward by Sinn Fein.  It was the ideal which an attempt was made to force on the local boards through the country.  I certainly am not going to give my vote for a Bill which will set an example from headquarters, so to speak, and give appointments for other reasons than real work and real ability as proved by competitive examination.</P>
    <P>I think that holds good on the present occasion.  I think it makes the case for the Government.  Why should the Government have a double dose of original sin?</P>

Still you made provision to save them from themselves.

      <P>They have frequently told me that the most distasteful thing in their experience of public life and public administration was the canvassing that was taking place, and their having to vote for people that they would not vote for if the voting were by ballot.  Let us consider for a moment the volume of opinion in favour of this Bill.  The General Council of the County Councils&mdash;the bodies that preceded the present county councils&mdash;passed a unanimous resolution at different meetings advocating <Col N="1876" /> the filling of appointments to local bodies by a Civil Service Commission.</P>

      <P>Ought you not have as high ideals as these men?  You claim to have higher ideals.  Then show them to us.  The medical profession shared some of the moral obloquy of the boards for nepotism, and for any corruption that may have taken place. As far back as 1911, on a plebiscite, 94 per cent. of them voted for entrance to the local government service by competitive examination.  That was under the British régime.  Now, we know that Arthur Griffith advocated this system for local appointments, and we know, too, that his advocacy of that very policy strengthened Sinn Fein, and attracted forces to Sinn Fein that it would never have otherwise.  They saw the purity of the man's ideals and the purity of his policy.  I have already quoted the opinion of Labour, and, added to this, I have already given quite a respectable body of organised opinion in favour of the present Bill.</P>

      <P>Potential candidates for county health appointments have gone to America and have gone to England, and have been away from their homes for six or eight months studying public health questions.  I know that many of these men have gone abroad for these studies.  I can tell you that if these men thought that the local authorities would have the making of these public health appointments, not one of them would have stirred a foot to go abroad in order to have improved their studies or to make themselves better qualified. I believe that if you adopted the so-called panel system that has been advocated here by some Deputies and if you sent down a panel to the local authorities, and put one of these men who have studied at the top place, that the twenty-sixth man, with friends and relations, as in my own case, would get elected.  I am candid about the whole thing.  It was only on the assurance that the Civil Service Commission <Col N="1877" /> for making appointments to local bodies would be created, that these men went to America and England, and are spending their time and their money there in study.  I know some of these men would not, with all their qualifications, get as much as a proposer or seconder if the appointments were to be filled by the local bodies, and that the local man who never stirred from home to gain any special or extra knowledge would beat them easily.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>That word &ldquo;panel&rdquo; has been used very loosely. He might not get on the panel or get elected for that matter.  If the Civil Service adopted the panel system, one of these men would be put, say, first place on the panel, but the fact of his being number one on the panel would not get him elected.  Every man here who has any connection with local bodies, where blood relationship counts for so much in Ireland, knows that I am speaking the truth.  We have heard a good deal that the man who pays the piper should call the tune.  I hold, and it is a fact, that the salaries of the local officials in Ireland are paid out of the central funds.  The grants voted here pay far more than the salaries of these men.  There are places in Ireland in which, I am told, it is unnecessary, owing to these grants, to strike a poor rate at all.  The poor rate goes to defray the county health board charges. These county health board charges are comprehensive charges.  They mean the salaries of dispensary doctors, county home assistants, outdoor assistants, and so on.  All the grants paid to local bodies pay these salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, take the case of the County Wicklow.  I am a ratepayer there.  I am a farmer.  Perhaps that accounts for my predilection for these benches.  The county health board charges there, when you deduct the grants, just work out at 6d. in the £. <Col N="1878" /> That is the amount that falls upon the farmer.  That is the modest sum when the agricultural grant in aid is deducted. Under the circumstances, what is the use of saying that the local authorities find the money to pay the officials?  With the grants, they do not, and the tendency will be&mdash;I believe it is a rightful tendency&mdash;that all these public health charges, the charges of the sick and the poor, will be a national charge.  They are, in fact, a national charge largely, at the moment, and I believe they must be continued as a national charge.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I do not see what is wrong about these appointments being made centrally. We hear a lot about bureaucracy and centralisation.  We ought to remember that we have a population of about three millions, and that for that population of three millions, between the central and local authorities we have about 150 boards.  To my mind, the Dáil, and its Departments, should be able to do central government and local government.  That is the way to have economy.  You will not have economy otherwise.  I have heard&mdash;and it was not a kind thing to say&mdash;that these men on public boards should not be deprived of the appointment of officials.  I do not think that that was a carefully-thought-out argument on the part of those who used it, because the suggestion is that they went on these boards for the patronage that was to be dispensed.  That was the suggestion, because there cannot be any other loss. What are they losing if they do not go on them?</P>

A picture is being held up to us of what this Commission will be like, and we are told that they will be free from political and family influences. Probably family influences will not have as much pull there, but I am certain that political preferences will have as much pull as, or more than, on local boards.  We have no doubts that these Commissioners will not be supermen; they will be men of ordinary clay and will not be better than anybody else, and we look for patronage there much more marked and much more in operation than in the case of the local bodies. Probably a commission set up by the Government will have one political colouring.  I might take it at that from my experience.</P>

      <P>Perhaps that was rather an unfortunate way of putting it.  It might not be quite accurate, but I say that the local authorities are composed of several political elements, that all the political elements in the country are represented on the local boards.  Every body with a political viewpoint sets up a party for election to the local boards on a different ticket and it is unfair to say that politics will have a pull.  Why not set a standard? If you do not think the standard is sufficiently high, raise the standard. Let candidates pass examinations before a commission, or some other authority, and let local appointments be made by the local people.  If you take away all the methods of what I call administration from the local authorities they will not function at all.  You had better concentrate all the government of the country in Dublin and set up another branch of the Civil Service to deal with this part of it.</P>

Set any standard you like; raise the standard as high as you like; let candidates come up to that standard, and then let the local authorities make the appointments. That ought not to be impossible, and under that system we would have a great deal less patronage and a great deal less suspicion than we will have under the suggested system.  I hazard the guess that you had better, when appointing this commission, also set up a school of commissioners to carry out all local administration, because from my experience&mdash;I may not be as unfortunate as some Deputies, including Deputy Dr. Hennessy&mdash;this will be considered an insult by the local authorities that I am and have been acquainted with for 20 or 30 years.

      <P>This is not a question of patronage at all.  There are other things besides examinations and answering questions.  There is something like commonsense, and is it suggested that the proposed commissioners are the people who will have a monopoly of commonsense?  I think that is very clearly and very definitely suggested in the Bill.  I am opposed to the Bill, and I think you will find that the majority of the county councils will be opposed to it.  If you are going to do this, send down your commissioners to the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am supporting this Bill, as I believe it will make for clean and pure administration in the public <Col N="1883" /> affairs of the country.  Deputies have picked holes in and have found fault with the present administration.  I think that ought to be sufficient reason why we should try to support the Bill. It must be admitted that canvassing for public positions under the local boards is most objectionable.  Most of us know men capable of discharging public duties, who are prepared to give their services on the public boards, but who would not touch public life owing to canvassing.  We know that canvassing has gone even as far as bribery for votes.  These men would not touch local boards because of the manner in which they were approached by men who were looking for positions.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Morrissey has gone a great deal further than any of the other Deputies on the Labour benches.  A measure of this kind was strongly advocated in the Seanad, and, as far as I could gather, by Deputies, when the Local Government Act was going through.  I thought this Bill would have got a very favourable reception from all parties. The objection of Deputy Baxter and Deputy Corish seems to be, first, to Section 2 sub-section (c).  In criticising <Col N="1884" /> Bills of this kind I think Deputies should give the Government and Government Departments credit for having some judgment.  It is preposterous to suggest that we are bringing forward a Bill which would make it obligatory on local authorities to have all appointments, even roadmakers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would be prepared to give every possible consideration to any proposal Deputy Baxter or Deputy Corish makes that would improve sub-section (c).  My whole difficulty is this: the Local Government net is a very widely cast one, and includes a great number of officials of very different kinds.  Sub-section (c) is devised with the object of making it possible for me not to include a large number of officers and employees, and, at the same time, to leave machinery wide enough to include classes of individuals who may not be in existence at all at the present time, or who may be in existence, or whom it is not advisable to include just now, but whom it may be advisable to include later on. If any one can devise some other form of wording which will achieve that idea I would be quite willing to agree to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not even a class of person in mind.  It is quite obvious that at the outset our machinery may not be working properly and we might consider it advisable later on to include classes that we do not feel justified in making a provision for at this stage. The general atmosphere surrounding the arguments in opposition to the Bill seems to be that the whole idea is to <Col N="1885" /> concentrate power in the hands of the Minister and to leave no power whatever to the local authorities.  In fact one Deputy suggested that it was merely transferring patronage from the local authorities to the hands of the Minister for Local Government.  I do not see how any Deputy who has read Section 5 could say that.  That section gives local authorities absolute power as regards the promotion of suitable officials at present in their service, and power to elect suitable pensioners who had experience of similar work in the past.  There is absolute power to make those appointments without any reference to the Commissioners.  It is only in cases where they failed to make these appointments that the machinery of the Commissioners comes into operation at all.  When the Commissioners' powers do come into operation they are restricted to the making of appointments by competitive examination. That deprives them and the Minister of any power of patronage, if they were willing to exercise such power.  The only limitation on that is the limitation contained in Section 9.  Deputy Heffernan and other Deputies who condemned the Bill very strenuously admitted, and in fact argued as something against the Bill, that in some cases competitive examinations do not provide the best and most suitable candidates. That is particularly true in the case of county medical officers of health which is pre-eminently a position where administrative abilities will count far more than theoretical knowledge. The next exception is that contained in Section 10.  That section is merely devised with the object of protecting officials under local authorities who should in the ordinary course of events be promoted, who are the obvious people for promotion, but who, owing to the fact that they may not have a pull in a particular council, or perhaps a particular council may have a grudge against them, are not put forward for the appointment.  In such a case the section is a safeguard for those particular officials so that the Minister should have power in cases of hardship to put forward their names.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the intention. In order to meet the wishes of the Dáil I am prepared to leave this to an open vote.  But I hope if it is defeated there will not be any complaints lodged with me, if there are cases of hardship, where officials who should be promoted are not promoted, owing to the machinery of the Bill being defective.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies contended that the power given in sub-section (3) of Section 6 to the Ministers should be vested in the council.  As a matter of fact, I think in most cases local commissioners will recommend just one individual.  I do not think there will be many cases where they will give power to the Minister to select from more than one, but in cases where they do I think it is necessary that that power should be left to the Minister, because in very many cases local authorities will probably have an objection to the appointment made.  They will be in favour of some particular man amongst the candidates going for the position, and if that man is not selected pressure will be brought to bear on the council to refuse to accept the man selected by the Commission.  They may refuse to make the appointment, and if they resign it is necessary that the power of making the appointment should be left to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, under the provisions of the Bill the Minister could decide, but those are matters which may be discussed on Committee Stage.  In connection with Section 6, Deputies have asked: why not get this Commission to pick out three names, supposing you have a vacancy in a dispensary? The Civil Service Commission have taken up a position which, I think, we should acquiesce in.  They will refuse to make an odious distinction between professional men.  The mere fact that a man is registered on the General Medical Register qualifies him for the post, and if we were to pick out one man and say &ldquo;You are <Col N="1887" /> qualified and the other two are not,&rdquo; I think it would leave us open to an action.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson took up a line that I was surprised at.  He said, and several other Deputies followed him, more especially those on the Farmers' benches, that they were all afraid that if the power of patronage were lost the best type of representative would refuse to go forward for those positions as representatives on local authorities.  I think that is an unfair statement to make about representatives on local authorities.  He contends that the only reason that they go forward is that they are anxious for the use and enjoyment of patronage, and I think if we reach that stage the sooner that <i>dies irae</i>, which Deputy Johnson is looking forward to with such foreboding when I am going to sweep away all local authorities with a wave of my hand, comes, and when I am to put in commissioners in their place, the better.  I do not think we have reached that stage.  I believe the majority of the best type of representatives will welcome this provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been talk about having set up a local or municipal Civil Service.  That is one of those catch-cries I do not understand and I wish Deputies would put forward some specific proposals.  The idea seems to be to make a kind of entrance examination for all the classes of officials under local authorities and to promote them gradually from this particular panel.  I do not think it can be done.  It is a very difficult thing to promote an assistant county, surveyor <Col N="1888" /> to be a county medical officer of health. You would have so many different classes to divide your panel into that the thing would be impossible.  There may be some possible means of getting over the difficulty, but so far as I am concerned I cannot say.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sir James Craig quoted the words of Section 7, which decides the qualifications of officers appointed. I admit that is somewhat clumsy phraseology, but we cannot get literature, like what would come from the pen of Robert Louis Stephenson, worked into an Act of Parliament. It is in order to put the position clearly from the lawyer's point of view, rather than from that of the layman, that that language is used.  The object of the section is to make it possible to limit the class who can be appointed to a particular office, according to professional qualifications and also to qualifications of various kinds.  Senator O'Farrell, in his proposed amendment to the Local Government Bill in the Seanad, brought in a provision whereby an examination for a particular post should be restricted to people living in a particular area.  We thought that it might, perhaps, be advisable to leave that power still in the Bill.  It is rather difficult to get a phrase which would enable us to restrict qualifications for an examination, say, to a medical practitioner, a nurse, or a midwife and, at the same time, to a person who was born or who lived in a particular area.</P>
      <P>With regard to the personnel of the Commission, that point has not been definitely decided, and I do not think that it is very material at this stage. Our intention is, if possible, to have some, if not all, of the Civil Service Commissioners act upon it.  One of these Commissioners is a native speaker and is very familiar with the Irish language. That, I think, should satisfy Deputy Roddy.</P>

There is nothing <Col N="1889" /> sinister, nothing of the trick-o'-the-loop method about it.  It is open and above board, and if Deputies have any reasonable amendments to introduce I will be very pleased to consider them on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I do not know how this is going to fit in with the programme of legislation which has been submitted.  I think the Minister would be well advised to see if it would be possible to delete by agreement such sections in the Bill as are objected to by a large number of Deputies, and make provision in this Bill or in some amending Bill to meet the case of urgency that Deputy Sir James Craig spoke of yesterday&mdash;the case of the appointment of county medical officers of health.  I do not think any Deputy in the House would object to securing the appointment of medical officers by some outside central authority.  If that is the urgency, I think the Minister could get an agreed Bill hurried through the House without much difficulty.</P>

      <P>The whole Bill, from my point of view, is necessary, and to a great extent it is an urgent measure. Some parts of it are more urgent than others.  My difficulty is to know what part of the Bill any large section in the House objects to.  In the debate that took place on the Second Reading it was difficult to find out if there was anything in the Bill that was objected to.  It was something that was not in the Bill but which they read into it themselves that certain Deputies objected to.</P>

      <P>I suggest for the consideration of the House that if the Minister intends to stand by this Bill in its present form, or anything like its present form, it will be strenuously objected to in many parts of the House. That will mean delay, not only in respect to this Bill but in respect to other portions of the legislative programme.</P>

      <P>I am in favour of the Bill and have just voted for its Second Reading.  Except for the urgent part of the Bill, the part dealing with the appointment of county medical officers of health, I do not see any prospect of it getting through the Dáil before the Summer Recess, because it is a contentious Bill.  It is a Bill in connection with which many amendments will be prepared.  We have to deal with the Estimates and four or five measures of considerable importance have also to be considered, and unless the Dáil is prepared to sit to the end of July I do not think the Minister can get this Bill through.  I would urge him to bring in a Bill dealing with the question of the appointment of county medical officers of health, which would be an agreed measure and passed without debate, and to leave over the remainder of this Bill, which I am in favour of, and which I believe to be necessary and desirable, but which I do not believe to be so urgent that it ought to be rushed through the Oireachtas before the end of June.  I would suggest to the Minister, in the interest of getting adequate discussion for all our measures, that he should <Col N="1893" /> bring in a separate measure dealing with the question of the appointment of county medical officers of health and allow the remainder of the Bill to be postponed until the autumn.</P>

      <P>I want to put it to the Minister that at a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges <Col N="1894" /> held this morning the President put up the proposal that the Dáil should sit on Mondays and that it should sit until 8.30 on Fridays.  We, the representatives of the Opposition Parties, consented to that on the grounds of great urgency.  The President in return said that no measure that was not absolutely of immediate urgency should be proceeded with.  I agree with Deputy Johnson that if this measure, which is not entirely of urgency&mdash;it has one factor that is of great urgency, but the other factors could be postponed until the autumn&mdash;is going to be pressed forward, then we must oppose sitting on Mondays and sitting until 8.30 on Fridays.  We agreed to the time-table put forward by the Government.  If that time-table is going to be upset by the action of the Minister for Local Government, well then there will have to be opposition all along the time-table and not only on this particular measure.  There has been a great desire to co-operate with the Government in getting the adjournment at the end of the month of June, but if suggestions put forward by the Government are not going to be acted on, then we on our side are released from any adumbrations that have been made.</P>

Was not this Bill before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges when they were considering this matter, and did they not know that it had got a First Reading and was before the Dáil?

      <P>The Committee on Procedure and Privileges arrived at an agreement to-day as to the programme for the remainder of the session, and that agreement was on the lines described by Deputy Cooper.  The President told us he could make no promise with regard to this Bill, but it was the opinion of the Committee that the Minister should be asked to drop a portion of the Bill until the autumn session, and that the more urgent portion of the Bill might be proceeded with.  The Committee arrived at that conclusion after having gone into all the Bills and Estimates, and they drafted a time-table.  They agreed it was absolutely impossible to adhere to that time-table if this Bill was proceeded with fully.  I also would appeal to the Minister to drop portion of the Bill until the autumn session, and to proceed now only with the portion dealing with medical officers, as a matter of urgency, and that is all he can get through.  Deputies representing all parties in the House agreed with the programme, and I think it should be adhered to.</P>

The Second Reading of the Bill having been passed the whole principle of the Bill is agreed to.  I will just go ahead with the machinery of the Bill that enables the county medical officers of health to be appointed, without prejudice to what is going to happen in the autumn, but I must say that I do it under protest.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right to say that the Committee on Procedure did not really take any steps about this particular Bill.  The Committee on Procedure considered, generally, the work that has to be done before the summer adjournment.  The question of this particular Bill arose. The President made it quite clear that he could not, seeing that the Bill was a Bill introduced by an extern Minister, give any promise about it, but that he did understand, and the Committee, generally, was given to understand, that there was one particular thing in the Bill that was very urgent. I do not think it right to say that there was any proposal made by the Committee that the Bill should be carved up.  I very much doubt that it is possible to do what is actually suggested; that is read this particular Bill a Second Time, and then, in Committee, <Col N="1898" /> do the exact thing that is suggested now.  The understanding of the Committee was that the particular thing but that the rest, although urgent, was regarding, I think, these county medical officers of health was urgent, not so urgent that it could not wait until the autumn.</P>
      <P>Before we continue this matter, the suggestion that the Minister should have an opportunity of thinking it over is the best suggestion that has been made, that instead of fixing the Committee Stage of this Bill now we should postpone the fixing of it until to-morrow, so that the Minister might not be charged with having made some promise that possibly he may not be able to carry out.

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the heading of &ldquo;Warlike Stores&rdquo; in 1924-25 the sum granted was £136,519; in 1925-26 it came down to £49,424.  This year the sum asked for is £43,487.  I do not know what the figure would be regarding the actual expenditure, but I think it is desirable that we should have some information regarding this provision for warlike stores.  I might say regarding the Appropriation Accounts for the year in which £136,000 was granted only £38,000 was spent. What was spent in 1925-26, of course, is not known yet.  But in view of the time of peace since 1923 it is difficult <Col N="1900" /> to understand why this considerable expenditure on warlike stores, each year about the same amount, should be required, and I think it is important that we should have some statement regarding it.  In particular, I would like to know whether the Minister's declared policy regarding second-hand or Disposals Board materials applies in the case of warlike stores as well as the general stores.  In particular I would wish the Minister to tell us whether in any recent purchase, or in any contemplated purchase of aeroplanes it has been the policy to purchase old, reconditioned machines or newly-built machines.  I do not know in what year the purchase of aeroplanes was made or what account it might have been charged against, whether 1924-25, 1925-26, or even prior to that.  I think, as a matter of fact, there have been purchases of aeroplanes within the last year or eighteen months.  I would like to know whether those aeroplanes have been purchased as new machines or reconditioned old machines, and whether, if the latter, there was care shown in the purchase and ample test made before delivery was taken.  If, on the contrary, there were new machines purchased, has the Minister been satisfied that new machines were delivered?  Then in respect of the purchase of ammunition.  I would like to know whether it has been the policy of the Ministry in the purchase of rifle cartridges to purchase new cartridges or old cartridges, 1925 cartridges or 1920 cartridges, and whether there has been care taken in the purchase, whether it has turned out, in fact, that a very considerable proportion of those delivered recently have been cast as unsatisfactory, and will the Minister confirm or correct the statement that as many as 14,000,000 rifle cartridges have been purchased for delivery within the year, or delivered in any small portion of the year, and if anything like that proportion of cartridges has been purchased, will the Minister give us some justification for the expenditure on that quantity at this time.  I have no idea at all what the value of cartridges might be, but a quantity such as I have mentioned must, inevitably, cost <Col N="1901" /> a large sum of money, and I do not think any prospective demand upon the ammunition reserve would justify having so large a quantity of ammunition in store.  I presume, if my figures are approximately correct, they are additional to the stock already in hands.  So there must be, at the present time, or in contemplation, an immense reserve of rifle ammunition.  If my suggestions are baseless, then I shall be pleased to have the refutation immediately from the Minister, but if I am correctly informed, or if any quantity even in or about the figure I have named is accurate, then I think it is desirable that the Minister should justify the expenditure of so large a sum as would be required to purchase so large a quantity of rifle ammunition.</P>

      <P>If the Dáil thinks it is necessary a Vote can be brought in any day to pay for the swords.  If the Dáil is prepared to vote the money, I am prepared to hand back to the officers the few pounds they have paid for the swords, but until that is done, and until the House tells me it is an absolute necessity to do that at the public expense, I am not inclined to do it.  As regards the question Deputy Johnson has raised about the war-like stores, nothing like the amount of ammunition he has suggested&mdash;14,000,000 rounds of rifle ammunition&mdash;is being purchased this year.  A certain amount of ammunition is being purchased for the purpose of keeping up our reserve and for the replacement of what would be wasted in training and manoeuvres generally. That replacement will be made during the year.  We have a reserve of ammunition, and we are bound to have a reserve of ammunition.  I think that the Army Chief who would say that he should be left high and dry with a few rounds of ammunition behind him would not be a man that could be trusted in a position of that kind.  It is necessary to have a reserve, and the amount of that reserve is what is considered normal and reasonable.</P>

I think I have already stated before in this House that I do not intend, and never intended, to <Col N="1903" /> purchase second-hand stores.  I have not done it in the past, where it could be avoided, and it is not my intention to do it in the future.  Any article which can be purchased, let it be ever so small, will be purchased new.  Even if we have to wait for twelve months, my policy is to buy new materials wherever it is possible to get them.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say whether, in the case of the ammunition that was purchased, it was new ammunition or old ammunition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>The ammunition purchased last year was up-to-date ammunition; it is new and serviceable.  It was put into store, and it can be taken out this year, next year, or whenever it comes in turn.  There was, as I am sure Deputy Johnson knows from his connection with the Public Accounts Committee, a certain amount of old ammunition bought four or five years ago. That ammunition was not of a class fit for storage.  It has been used up to a very large extent, and any of it that was considered dangerous was destroyed. The purchase of such ammunition does not take place now; ammunition of that type was not bought last year or the year before, and it will not be bought in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise that matter because I know the information is being retailed and I want to give the Minister an opportunity to make it clear, as he has now done, that any cast ammunition was old, not new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite clear about that; there is not the slightest doubt about it.  The ammunition purchased last year was perfectly new, and the ammunition that will be purchased this year will be new.  All that ammunition is made for storage, and we can keep it over two or three years. It will be used in the ordinary way, and we will get replacements every year. What we buy this year will be placed in reserve and will be taken out next year or the year after.  It is ammunition which can safely be kept in reserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I told the Deputy, there was ammunition made, not for us particularly, <Col N="1904" /> but for general purposes during the war; that ammunition was not made for storage, and it would not keep more than two years at the outside.  We got that ammunition; we had to take what we got at the time.  It has been used up as far as possible and any that was considered dangerous was destroyed. As far as last year's purchases are concerned, it was all up-to-date ammunition, ammunition I can vouch for.  I am glad to have an opportunity of refuting the statements that have been, and are being, made about purchases of that kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson referred to aeroplanes. I think we have passed the item touching on aeroplanes, but if the Deputy wishes to get any information about aeroplanes, I will be glad to give it to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a question in regard to aeroplanes when we were touching that sub-head, and the Ceann Comhairle mentioned that I could raise that point under the sub-head dealing with war-like stores.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to give the Deputy any information he requires in regard to aeroplanes.  We purchased some aeroplanes, and we got the type of machine we wanted.  The machines were of a type in use and that was tested in other places.  Some people wanted to carry out experiments with new machines in connection with which trials had not been completed.  I did not think I was justified in having experiments of that kind, and I decided to take the type of machines that were tried and that are, in fact, in use at the present time and are associated with bigger armies in other places.  They are machines that have passed the experimental stage.  I stipulated for new machines, but when the machines were delivered we discovered that the engines were reconditioned engines. There was no secret about that, because the log-books were sent along with the machines, and we knew exactly everything that happened each machine from the day it was made.  We knew how many hours they were in the air and everything else about them.  After a good deal of discussion and negotiation we fixed on prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1905" /> We are aware that these engines are not made new at the present time; it is impossible to get them made new. They are the very same engines that are being utilised by the British Government. They are reconditioned engines, and, from the technical information I could get from people who are able to advise me on this matter, I am given to understand that the machines are air-worthy.  They have been duly certified, and, as far as I am advised, they have given every satisfaction since they came here.  I had more than one discussion with the officer in charge on this matter, and he is satisfied that the machines are satisfactory.  The machines did not come into our possession as new machines.  The engines, I should say, are not new; we knew when we were getting them that they were not new, but the rest of the machines is absolutely new.</P>

      <P>I believe the machine in which Major Moloney unfortunately lost his life was air-worthy.  Major Moloney was an officer of very high intelligence as an airman and he was satisfied with the machine.  He knew all about it and had flown it on many occasions.  I believe it was an air-worthy machine the morning he took it out.  Unfortunately, he met his death, and as far as anybody can make out his death was due to an accident, an accident that nobody, to this day, can explain.</P>

      <P>The machine that Major Moloney unfortunately lost his life in was not one of the machines under discussion at the present time. It was a machine purchased at an earlier period, and Major Moloney knew exactly the condition of that machine.  It was the Major's duty, if the machine was not in order, to report it to his Commanding Officer.  I am not assuming the machine was not in perfect condition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to say a few words on two items of sub-head T&mdash; Military lands.  The cost of tillage is set down at £1,123, and besides that there is an item of £250 for feeding and shoeing five horses, and for farm implements, etc.  These two items, taken together, make £1,373.  Under the head of Appropriation-in-Aid I see <Col N="1907" /> that the value of produce from tillage is £1,265, leaving a loss of £108.  I do not raise these matters in any carping or fault-finding spirit.  On the contrary, I think I am in a position to congratulate the Minister upon the results shown.  It may be that some of the amateur farmers in the Dáil would consider that the Minister should have made a profit.  I do not hold that.  I think if the accounts of any practical farmer in the Dáil were examined, it would be found that the results shown in similar circumstances would have been, if anything, worse.  Deputy Gorey is regarded for his intelligence as a sort of super-man as an agriculturist. I have heard my friend, Deputy Wilson, express his willingness to challenge any Dane or inhabitant of Scandinavia to come to his home farm, and, seeing the methods practised there, to suggest anything in the way of improvement.  That being so, I think the result is fairly satisfactory, and we may confidently expect that in future the results will be better because the Minister has in prospect a considerable advantage that he will have in the future when the oatmeal tax is put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask if it is the intention of the Minister to continue to hold these lands, some of which are held at an enormous rent, and which we got as an inheritance from the former Government?  I wish to know if it is necessary, in the interests of the Army, to maintain these places where the rents are out of all proportion to the accommodation required.</P>

      <P>Deputy Conlan seems to congratulate the Minister on losing £108 upon tillage.  Of course, I understand his point, although I am sure the Deputy will be surprised to hear that on tillage, at Lusk, we made a profit of £333.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>It is shown, and the Deputy must take into account that the Appropriation-in-Aid figure shown there is for all our lands, including mountain land, and all our other lands in the country.  We pay a very high <Col N="1908" /> rent, as Deputy Wilson has said, for some of our lands, but we cannot surrender them owing to the leases. When the leases fall in we will surrender them as quickly as possible. But we made a profit last year on tillage of £333, and we purpose this year to make a profit of over £500.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to sub-head V, Barrack Services, I move an amendment to reduce the sub-head by a sum of £15,000.  In order to make my case I am afraid it may be necessary for me to review the expenditure on furniture and utensils for the Army over a period of three or four years. When our Army took over barracks, from the British, most of these barracks were equipped with furniture, not with private furniture but with the furniture of the British Government. Some of the officers always supplemented the allowance of furniture by armchairs and card-tables and so on, but they took these away before the barracks were handed over.  The normal furniture remained.  In several cases the officers who took over these barracks were Irregulars, and they either burned the barracks or, at any rate, they took no charge over the furniture, and it is not fair to blame the Minister for Defence or the State for the loss of that furniture.  But a certain amount of the furniture in a certain number of barracks taken over was British.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now in the financial year 1922-23 there was a sum expended to buy new furniture on the part of the Board of Works.  I cannot tell the amount; there was no detailed account in that year, but the report of the Public Accounts Committee shows that there were certain bills for furnishing officers' quarters in the financial year 1922-23 which had to be defrayed by the State.  In the following year, 1923-24, there was no Vote for furniture or utensils on the Army Vote, but there was a very substantial amount on the Board of Works Vote.  The <Col N="1909" /> Board of Works exceeded their estimate by a sum of £212,000.  The Minister for Finance on the 26th March, 1924, said: &ldquo;The total amount provided for military purposes, furniture, fittings and utensils, amounts to over £250,000&rdquo;&mdash;that is a quarter of a million pounds.  Then the Army also removed a certain amount of furniture from commandeered premises.  Where troops were quartered in a commandeered premises, and where they found more beds than were needed, and chairs not needed, they were removed to the various permanent quarters of the Army, so that a quarter of a million pounds is comparatively a low estimate. For furniture and utensils, in 1924, £36,000 was voted.  In 1925, £45,000 was voted, so that washing out the 1922-23 Vote altogether, and washing out the compensation for furniture removed from commandeered premises, the Army has had voted in the Dáil, in this regard, on the Estimates, at least £331,000 for furniture and utensils.</P>
    <P>As far as utensils are concerned, I do not want to stress the case.  Utensils, I take it, include basins, plates and mugs, things that are breakable and that are constantly being broken, things that must be replaced.  But I do stress the Vote with regard to furniture. We have provided furniture to the value of £300,000.  In this year, apart altogether from utensils, we are asked to provide furniture to the extent of £27,000 more.  I suggest to the Dáil that that is unreasonable and excessive. We have equipped an army at the rate of £300,000 for 12,500 men.  All that we ought to be asked for in the future is maintenance.  I would suggest to the Dáil that £1 per man per year is enough for maintenance.  I am confirmed in that belief by the fact that while we estimate for £2 6s. per head for the rank and file of the Army for furniture, the British Army estimate is £1 0s. 7d. and the British have had a longer period for deterioration than we.  Therefore, I think this amendment is a moderate and reasonable one. Some replacement of furniture will be needed.  You have got to fix a definite scale, and I suggest that the scale of £1 per man is a reasonable scale.  There is an Appropriation-in-Aid of £2,000 in <Col N="1910" /> regard to barrack damages.  I think that is insufficient.  If £64,000 is required altogether for furniture and utensils, £2,000 is too low a sum for barrack damages.  I would like to know, when the Minister replies, if barrack damages are paid by the officers?  In the British Army, when an officer is supplied with the necessary furniture for his quarters, he pays one penny a day as rent for his furniture.  That works out at 2/6 per month.  It is not a very serious charge on officers.  Where we furnish quarters for our officers, I do not think it would be unfair to ask an officer to pay that amount.  It is a very small amount, £1 10s. a year.  It would just provide for the necessary replacements and repairs.  Therefore, I would ask the Dáil to agree with this amendment to reduce this Vote by £15,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps in the course of the Minister's reply he would tell the Dáil what is the scale allowed to the different grades of officers for the furnishing of their quarters.  I think I am right in saying that there is a defined scale since the earlier estimates were prepared and the earlier accounts examined.  It is desirable that we should be informed what is the scale of allowances of the different grades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cooper makes a rather general statement as regards the furnishing of quarters, and the amount of money spent on furniture since the Army was established.  He stressed the fact that the British Army when they went out of occupation here, left behind them a considerable amount of furniture.  Last year I visited every post in the country, and as far as I can see, they left very little behind them. Anything they did leave behind them was certainly only fit for a marine dealer.  They took jolly good care to take anything that was any good away with them.  Our system of furnishing quarters has been a gradual system. We estimated last year for a sum of money to furnish quarters for officers and N.C.O.'s.  We got a considerable amount of furniture last year.  We did not get it all.  It was not possible to get it.  As a matter of fact we did not <Col N="1911" /> buy it ourselves; the Board of Works bought it for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year we estimate for £27,000 odd and that is to complete our furnishing. From this year there will be only 10 per cent. for ordinary wear and tear and replacement.  The capital charge from this year onward will be comparatively nothing&mdash;only the ordinary replacements.  We did not spend the amount of money the Deputy states in one year; we do it gradually, and this is the last time we will come to the Dáil to ask for money to furnish quarters.  In that £27,000 it is proposed to furnish the quarters of officers, married and single.  The Deputy, I am sure, does not wish to see officers housed badly.  I am sure he would like to see them housed comfortably.  I am sure he would say that it is not to the well-being of the officer that he should not be given comfortable quarters to live in.  The quarters that I have been in certainly were not fit for an officer and were not furnished in the manner suited to the rank of a person holding the position of an officer.  Some of these quarters have no wardrobe or washstands even.  The officers had no place in which to hang their clothes. They simply had a bed in the room and a broken chair.  In most cases that is all the furniture they had.  I have seen this myself.  I have taken nobody's word for it.  I went very closely through the various barracks and that is what I found in many cases.  This £27,000 is the sum that is necessary to equip those quarters in a reasonable way.  That item will not appear again in the same shape as it is, but there will be about 10 per cent. for ordinary wear and tear.  We do propose further that the N.C.O's. will get quarters separate from the ordinary billets of the men.  I think that would be good for discipline.  The quarters will be furnished somewhat better than the ordinary billet.  I think the Deputy will agree with me that this is a necessity. It appeals to me at any rate and I propose to do it.  That is included in the £27,000.  It is further proposed to have a gradual improvement and the ordinary day-room in which the men dine will be made somewhat better than <Col N="1912" /> the bare table accommodation that one meets in most barracks.  I believe that that will do good in the long run, and that it will be well-spent money.  It will show the men that they are being given some little comfort and will turn them out better citizens when they return to ordinary life.  It does cost a considerable sum of money.  Deputy Johnson asked a question as to the scale allowed for the different grades of officers in the furnishing of their quarters.  In Grade 1 it is £650, and it comes down then to £450 in the case of captains and lieutenants.  That is under the regulations of the present time.  As regards barrack damages, under the new regulations we are getting out this will be assessed on the unit, and when the unit is charged it will bring in the officer as well as the men.  At the present time officers are not charged barrack damages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not dispute anything the Minister has said.  But the Minister, when referring to stores taken over from the British, talks about the inspection that he made in the year 1925&mdash;that is only last year.  Any inspection of that kind to be of any value should have been made in the year 1922.  I do not know if stores taken over from the British Army disappeared, though I think it probable.  I know that furniture taken from my own house has disappeared, and that some of it has gone to the houses of officers who are no longer officers of the Army, and that some of it is in the quarters of the Army at the present time.  I do not quarrel with that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would inquire where some of his presses and chests of drawers in Finner Camp came from.  I am not quarrelling. I am being compensated for that furniture on the Board of Works Vote. My furniture has gone and I am getting fairly adequate compensation for it.  But there is a lot of furniture which has not come under this Vote but has gone on the Board of Works Vote.  I will tell the Minister the <Col N="1913" /> names of the officers who, I believe, removed my furniture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want that&mdash; the names of the officers who, the Deputy believes, removed his furniture. That is going too far.  I want to get the names of the officers who removed it, and to get information as to where the furniture exactly is.  This is a serious allegation to make against men regarding furniture which the Deputy says he does not want back.  Let us be honest about this thing and let us have the information now.</P>

      <P>I am not going to name any officer under shelter of the privilege of the Dáil.  I prefer not to give them.  But I have been told by a man whom I believe to be truthful that furniture was removed from my house to Finner Camp.  I believe it was removed by military agency.  I am being paid reasonable compensation for that furniture.  I do not allege dishonesty or any unfair treatment.  I only allege that this Vote is not the whole Vote for furniture.  I allege that the Army has commandeered furniture; that it has spent a quarter of a million from the Board of Works Vote on furniture, and that still we are asked to provide more furniture.  That is the point I make.  I am not suggesting that there is any unfair treatment of me at all.  I put in my claim for furniture and for commandeering of my house, and, on the whole, I have been treated with fairness.  I have not got all I asked, but I have been treated very fairly.  I am not making a personal grievance at all.  I hope the Minister will not believe that I am trying to make a personal grievance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure that I have referred to does not come into the Army Estimate for furniture at all. There was a quarter of a million voted on the Board of Works Vote for furniture in 1923-24 for the Army.  Having voted a quarter of a million on furniture when the Army was 50,000 strong &mdash;that was £5 per head, and the rank and file do not need very much furniture&mdash;we are steadily increasing the <Col N="1914" /> Vote.  The figures were £36,000, then £45,000, and now the figure is £27,000. I do not want to put my argument too strongly, but I would suggest to the Minister that there is not sufficient control of furniture in the Army&mdash;that, in some cases, where men are not supplied with fuel, they have been burning the chairs.  I have some chairs with the backs burnt off.  I had some doors in my own house with the panels knocked out.  I, therefore, know of these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">

      <P>I would like if the Deputy would stick to the barrack furniture and would not trouble so much about the chairs in his house that have the backs burnt off and the doors with the panels knocked out.  I have not the 1923-24 Estimates before me, and I should like if the Deputy would inform me whether the quarter of a million he refers to was for the purposes of the Army or for the purposes of the Board of Works?  I am of opinion that the quarter of a million was for the purchase of furniture by the Board of Works for Government establishments generally.</P>

      <P>The Deputy states the amount was for furniture, fittings and utensils.  We are dealing here with an item of £27,000 for furniture.  If we are going to bring in that quarter of a million for furniture, fittings and utensils I should like to know how much of it was for furniture and how much of it was for fittings and utensils. It is not quite fair to say that a quarter of a million was spent in that year for furniture for the Army.  The Deputy says that he is quoting the Minister for Finance.  The figures which the Minister for Finance gives, I am sure. are perfectly correct, but &ldquo;fittings and utensils&rdquo; would probably include electric and gas fittings, pots, pans, knives and forks and a hundred other things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1915" /> I think it will be found that there was very little spent on furniture in that year for the Army.  The Army would be about 30,000 strong at that time, and all the utensils had to be provided new for them.  If the cost of fittings and utensils is taken out of the quarter of a million the Deputy speaks of, I think it will be found that the expenditure for furniture that year was very small.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot improve on the figures of the Minister for Finance.  But I cannot believe that a quarter of a million was spent on utensils&mdash;on jugs and basins and plates &mdash;for an Army of 50,000 men.  I am quite sure that furniture came into that item, just as I know that furniture came in the previous year in respect of the equipment of Portobello and other barracks.  The Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am a member, got details of that.  The Minister is really not quarrelling with me; he is quarrelling with the Estimates presented by the Department of Finance two or three years ago, because they were not shown in detail.  That is not my fault.  I cannot be expected to know how much was spent on furniture, on fittings and on utensils.  But I do not believe that it would be possible to spend a quarter of a million on electric light and gas fittings for the Army.  I do not believe that utensils could come to £50,000 at the outside, and I do believe that a considerable proportion of this quarter of a million demanded by the Minister for Finance as a special grant for the Army on 26th March, 1924, did go in furniture. I believe that some of the furniture has not been properly looked after by the Army, that some of it probably has been burned, and that at that time there was not a sufficient sense of realisation that the Army were the stewards of the furniture and of the quarters they occupied.  I think, probably, that things have changed now. I say that the best way to check extravagance and irresponsibility of this kind, and to check the feeling that if you want to keep the fire up you can break the leg off a chair and put it in, is to curtail the Vote.  Until you inflict some discomfort on people who are <Col N="1916" /> careless in their stewardship of the goods they are in charge of, you will not make them understand properly that they will suffer.  Therefore, I ask the Dáil to agree to this amendment. It allows £1 per man in the Army for the year to replace furniture.  Utensils are out of it.  I have allowed the Minister the full Vote for utensils, as they get broken and must be replaced, but, so far as furniture is concerned, there ought to be a rate of renewal, and my amendment would allow £1 per head per year to replace furniture broken. I suggest to the Dáil that that is a sufficient rate, and, therefore, I press my amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper spoke of furniture being broken to make a fire.  I am sure bedsteads and bedding have not been used to make fires.  I would like to know what has become of the furniture, fittings, beds and bed clothing that accommodated 52,000 men, now that we have only an Army of 12,000.  We had accommodation&mdash; perhaps it was not the best&mdash;certainly fair accommodation in 1922 for 52,000 men.  I was acquainted with some of the accommodation at the time.  We have only to accommodate 12,000 men now. What has become of the furniture, fittings, beds and all the other paraphernalia that were in barracks throughout the country when 52,000 men were required? Are they in cold storage? Have they been disposed of, or what has become of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to tell us whether in the contemplated expenditure for furniture, utensils, fittings, etc., he had in mind the retention of the Army at its present size or was his provision for the smaller army which is anticipated after the year 1927?  Presumably furniture will last a few years.  It would be wasteful expenditure to purchase furniture for an army of 14,000 men if in two years or one year it is anticipated reducing the army to 10,000, or perhaps 5,000.  That, I think, is rather more important even than looking back on what happened to the furniture that was in barracks in 1922.  Even the provision, as described by the Minister, seems to contemplate the retention of an army of <Col N="1917" /> the present size.  I think that is a mistake, when we have it suggested to us that the Minister's policy is one of gradual reduction.  We should be assured that the proposals regarding equipment are for the smaller army which is anticipated after one or two years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in absolute agreement with Deputy Cooper when he says that £1 a year should be quite sufficient for maintenance, repair and general upkeep.  But there is no use in talking about £1 a year for the general upkeep of furniture you have not got. You must get your furniture before you can keep it up.  This is for quarters that have not been furnished.  I agree with Deputy Cooper that when that is done the £1 should be sufficient.  But there is no use in charging £1 for the upkeep of an amount of furniture that you have not got.  I think that that is a very peculiar way of looking at the thing.  When we have the quarters furnished I believe that the amount the Deputy mentions will be quite ample. I have here the Estimates for 1923-4, and the figure under the heading of &ldquo;Furniture, Fittings, and Utensils&rdquo; for that year was £44,500.  It is quite within the recollection, or the knowledge, of most people that all the barracks were starved for furniture; there was no furniture in them.  Where people, Irregulars or others, commandeered furniture, took it from houses like Deputy Cooper's, or other houses throughout the country, and burned it, did away with it otherwise, or sold it, I am not responsible.  My responsibility is only to see that the ordinary furniture that is required to keep men in decency, but not in luxury, is put into these barracks.  These rooms have never been furnished.  I say that deliberately.  If they were furnished I say that the people who did not care the furniture, but let it become dilapidated in such a short time, would deserve the gravest censure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present every article of furniture in every barracks is on charge, and on charge correctly, and every article has to be accounted for to the Stores Accounting Officers.  We send officers down the country occasionally to take stock of all these articles, and if an <Col N="1918" /> article is missing out of any quarters or stores it has to be accounted for by the officer in charge.  No furniture or stores of any kind or description can be done away with until a Board of Surveyors has condemned them.  Then they have to be sold in the ordinary way, and we get the best competitive price we can.  It is not possible at present to do the things that Deputy Cooper suggests have been done four or five years ago.  Deputy Cooper should know&mdash;I am sure he does know &mdash;that there was what some people term a war on here, and I am sure his experience will enable him to know that it is not possible to have the same check on things in war time as in peace time.  I am sure that the Deputy could not account for a number of things that happened under his own charge on several occasions if he were taken to task for them; I am sure that there would have been some little wastage here and there that the Deputy could not check.  That happened here; everybody knows that it happened, and it happens where a similar set of circumstances prevails in any country.  I do not think that the slightest good would be done in going back and thrashing out things that happened four or five years ago.  We all know they happened. They happen in every country where troubles like the troubles we had took place, and perhaps we got out of it better than most countries have got out of troubles of the same kind.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Cooper's figures about the quarter of a million are right, the average price might be taken as somewhere around £500.  A quarter of a million would provide 500 billets at £500 each.  There are over a thousand officers in the Army.</P>

      <P>I do not quite understand what the Minister means when he says that I would know of certain leakages.  The only leakage I know of is where I told a man to embark certain mess stores on a ship and he failed to do so; these stores were lost, and I had to replace them out of my own pocket.  I was never responsible for any leakage that was charged to the State, either the British State or <Col N="1919" /> this State.  The Minister spoke of 1923-24.  I have only the Appropriation Account for 1924-5, and while it is suggested that these barrack services were starved, nevertheless £51,000 was spent on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I said services, and I agree about the utensils.  But if men are entitled to break that amount of utensils in a year, they are wasted in the Army; they should become tramp jugglers.  I agree that it is not fair to blame the Minister for what happened three or four years ago, because he was not then a Minister, but there is a laxity in dealing with these things that began three or four years ago, and though it <Col N="1920" /> has been checked, it has not been checked to a sufficient extent.  I believe that it can be checked more effectually by agreeing to my amendment, by reducing the Vote for furniture&mdash;I am not proposing to reduce the Vote for utensils&mdash;to a limit of £1 per man in the ranks per year.  If that presents difficulties, so far as the officers' quarters are concerned, I think that the officers should be asked to contribute a penny a day. Half-a-crown a month is not a very serious item for an officer, but mounting up it would make a substantial contribution to the cost of furniture. Therefore, I am afraid that the amendment will have to go to a division.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a question on sub-head Y.  There has been on the Order Paper, I understand, an amendment with regard to this Vote.  Although it does not appear on to-day's Order Paper, I think it is necessary to raise the question of the wisdom of continuing to provide both a Minister and a Parliamentary Secretary on this Vote.  We shall be told, I have no doubt, that it is essential there shall be a Minister and a Parliamentary Secretary.  But I do not think it is necessary that there should be two persons holding these two offices. Ministries which are growing in their responsibilities and functions are not provided with a Minister and a Parliamentary Secretary, and as the work of the Ministry of Defence is much less urgent than it was three years ago, I submit there is a need for a coalition of offices so long as we are bound to provide two officers.  I am not quite certain whether it is a statutory obligation to have a Parliamentary Secretary. I think it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is in the Ministries and Secretaries Act, Section 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is not provided that he shall be paid one thousand pounds a year, or that the Minister from this Department must be separate from any other Ministry.  My point is that, while it is essential by statute that there shall be two persons holding two offices in this Ministry of Defence, we are not bound to provide two salaries, and it does seem to me that the office of Minister for Defence might well be combined with some other Ministry, and the actual parliamentary work done by a Parliamentary Secretary so long as the statute remains as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the salary fixed for a Parliamentary Secretary is also included in that Act, and is laid down at £1,000 to £1,200 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

I said there were Ministries provided with Parliamentary Secretaries at salaries differing from that provided for this Parliamentary Secretary.  I am only putting that forward as testimony that the salary of a Parliamentary Secretary is not fixed by Act of Parliament.

      <P>I do not think the Minister for Defence himself, who is answering here, can be asked to make a case against the abolition of the Minister for Defence as a separate personality.  What Deputy Johnson suggests is that conceivably under the Ministries and Secretaries Act, by order of the Executive Council, it could be ordained that one person would hold the two offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Ministries and Secretaries Act provides for a Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister for Defence in order to establish a Council of Defence.  You could not have a Council of Defence in accordance with the Act, without having a Parliamentary Secretary.  It provides for two laymen on the Council of Defence, and I think the Dáil did that deliberately in order to take away from that Council the military aspect, which it would have if it were composed of all military men.  I think the reason a Parliamentary Secretary was put into that Act was in order that a certain amount of civilian control should be exercised over the Army.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quarrelling with the Act, but my recollection is clear enough.  There was a time when the President held the office of the <Col N="1924" /> Minister for Defence, and if it were possible for one person to hold two Ministries then it should be now.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is stronger than that.  The Dáil appoints a Minister who is a member of the Executive Council on the nomination of the President, and that procedure has been adhered to in connection with the appointment of the Minister for Defence and also in the case of the Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>It is necessary to have a Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Defence, but the Deputy can argue that it is not necessary that he should be paid £1,000.  The other argument as to the combination of offices can arise on another Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>My argument against the payment of £1,000 to a Parliamentary Secretary, having in mind all the other charges of the Ministry, rests on the fact that it is a diminishing requirement.  It is a service which is not as essential to have all these appointments now as it was two or three years ago, and the duties of the office do not require as much time and attention as they did when the statute was passed and when the original salary was fixed.  I think the time has come when we ought to revise salaries in respect of this Ministry.  I am precluded, in view of the withdrawal of the motion, from voting on this matter, but I call attention to what I think is an unnecessary expenditure in regard to this Ministry in the year 1926-27.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that Deputy Johnson's argument may be answered by saying that it is a matter of opinion.  It may have happened that very much more work fell on the Minister for Defence in 1922-23, 1923-24 and 1924-25, but it did not follow that there was work which might have been dealt with much more satisfactorily from the Minister's point of view if he had more assistance.  That was my experience when I was Minister for Defence.  It has been my experience in all the offices which I held in the State that this Ministry of Defence took up most time.  This is not a question that can be solved by saying that the Ministerial charges can be cut down.  I <Col N="1926" /> think there is need, and I think there will be need for some time longer&mdash; how long I cannot say&mdash;for the office of Parliamentary Secretary.  He can render a service which is very good value for the salary paid, and in my opinion it would not be economy to abolish the office, and the best interests of the Ministry would not be served by not having a Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <P>As regards the staff, I notice that there are ten higher executive officers this year as compared with nine last year, 26 junior executive officers in place of 24, and 3 staff officers in place of 1 last year.  In view of the fact, as Deputy Johnson says, that this is a diminishing Vote, one would expect that the number of higher officers would also be diminishing, whereas they are, as a matter of fact, increasing.  There is a reduction in the number of lower officers, such as temporary clerks and temporary shorthand-typists, but I see no reason, particularly in view of the fact that we have an Army Finance Officer, a Deputy Army Finance Officer, and an Assistant Deputy Army Finance Officer and a Parliamentary Secretary, why there is an increase in the number of higher officers.  I would like to know, in view of the disemployment of a certain number of temporary lady typists, if soldier-typists are being employed in their positions, and if their cost is included in this Vote.</P>

      <P>There are good reasons why there are more executive <Col N="1927" /> officers this year than last year.  We had a considerable number of temporary clerks in the office who got the option of sitting for an examination. A certain number of them did so, and passed, and they are now established servants.  In my Department, as in all the Departments generally, it is the policy to get permanent officers into it.  It means a saving, because it works out in the ratio that where you had three temporary clerks employed two permanent officers can do the work. The temporary people are being gradually withdrawn from the service and permanent people employed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There were four transferred officers of the higher executive grade.  The increase of one higher executive officer was due to the fact that there was a vacancy in the Army Audit Section of the office.  While we are tightening up all the services that we have in that office, it has been found necessary to appoint this officer.  We find that wherever officers of this class are brought in to do special work they effect considerable savings, and it is in order to effect savings that they are appointed.  If you want to get work of a specialised character done, and that it is necessary to send a man down the country to do it, a man that you can trust, then you must have an officer of some standing.  You could not send a temporary man on such work.  Unfortunately we had some trouble with temporary people, but at the present time we have very few temporary people in the office.  The typists in the office are lady typists who have passed an examination, and there are no soldier-typists.  We have still some temporary typists.  The system in my Department is that all that kind of work is pooled, and is distributed amongst the lady typists by the lady superintendent in charge.  There is a considerable tightening-up in that respect and a considerable saving is being effected in the office.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate for the current financial year shows a reduction on that for last year of £12,781.  Deputies will note that for four or five years past there has been a steady reduction in this Vote.  There is, of course, an obvious explanation of that, that owing to the civil war and the number of <Col N="1929" /> prisoners in the years 1922, 1923 and 1924, the Vote was heavier, and that also, as an indirect consequence of the hospitality extended to those prisoners, the repair vote for the prisons for some time after was also heavier.  The actual expenditure in the year 1922-23 was £200,554; in 1923-24 it was £189,570; in 1924-25 it was £145,923, and last year the estimate was £157,631.  This year the estimate is £144,850.  Maintained under this Vote there are eight prisons and the Borstal Institution at Clonmel. The daily average of prisoners in the local prisons has dropped now to quite a small number.  It would not be more than between 30 or 40 for Dundalk; probably between 40 and 50 for Galway, and something upwards of 50 for Waterford and Limerick.  But as long as those prisons are there, it is necessary to maintain in connection with them a governor, a medical officer, chaplains, and a sufficient staff of warders. The question of a possible reduction in the number of prisons has been gone into rather carefully, and the considerations which weighed against any departure of that kind have been, firstly, the population of the Free State is scattered, the railway facilities not always convenient, and the hardship of conveying prisoners long distances in winter and in inclement weather is obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be necessary to put against whatever saving would be achieved in establishment charges the cost of conveyance of prisoners, and the cost of escort on every such occasion in the case of remands for short periods, and for committals for trial.  It would be difficult for prisoners to arrange for their defence if they were sent far from their friends and legal advisers. That is one of the points that has been urged against the reduction in the number of prisons before several Prison Commissions.  Then there is the problem of the short sentence prisoner. Prisoners are sometimes sentenced to quite short periods, such as a week or a fortnight, and sometimes as an alternative to the payment of a fine.  It is quite natural and proper that justices would consider the hardship and expense of sending prisoners a long distance for short terms, and might not sentence to imprisonment in the absence <Col N="1930" /> of some reasonably convenient prison to which the prisoner would be sent.  It is felt that if you had that state of affairs there would arise from it immunity, or comparative immunity, for the lesser infractions of the law. Those most skilled in matters of this kind are of opinion that it is through the lesser infractions of the law people graduate to more serious crime.  Only one remedy has suggested itself so far for short sentences and for short remands, and that would be police lockups through the country.  In the Prison Act of 1877 power to embark on that line was provided, but it was never in fact acted upon, and that course was opposed very vigorously and strenuously by persons who gave evidence before a Commission on Prisons.</P>
    <P>We have come to the conclusion, at present at any rate, that there is very little room for further reduction in prison establishments.  At the same time we would look towards reduction whenever it is considered feasible. Taking the sub-heads in order: sub-head A for salaries, wages and allowances is a total of £8,637, a reduction of £191 as compared with the provision made for 1925-6.  That is due to a decrease in the provision for bonuses. There is no change in fact in the number of persons covered by the Vote. The work of the office includes the necessary administration work in connection with prisons and prisoners, under the supervision of the secretary and the accountant; payments for supplies and services under the supervision of the clerk in charge of accounts; supervision of receipts and issues of stores devolves on a junior executive officer; registration of habitual criminals by means of finger prints and photographs, and securing photographic prints for the administration of justice, is carried out by two clerks in the habitual criminals' register, one of whom assists, in addition, in the administration branch of the office; the supervision of building supplies, works, etcetera, comes under the clerk of works.  The agent for discharged prisoners mentioned in the Estimates assists prisoners and Borstal inmates after their discharge.  He visits them and makes reports to the Board as to <Col N="1931" /> their progress.  This officer also attends the Dublin District Court.</P>
    <P>The messengers and office cleaners, in addition to performing the necessary messengers' duties in the office, have had imposed upon them, without additional remuneration, the duties of messengers and office-cleaners in the Reformatories and Industrial Schools Department, which is in the same building as the General Prisons Board. Passing to sub-head B, travelling and incidental expenses, £350, there is a reduction of £50 as compared with the financial year 1925-6.  Expenses under that sub-head are for the payment of travelling expenses of members of the Board and the officers of the Department. Deputies might wish to know the rates of payment.  They do not differ, I think, from the general rates prevailing in the service.  The members of the Board and the secretary are paid on a scale of 20/- per night: the executive officers, 15/-; the clerk of works and agent for discharged prisoners, 10/-; and there is a third scale of 10/-.  Under this sub-head the other expenditure includes the purchase of newspapers for official use, chemicals for photographic uses, repayments to the Stationery Office for the cost of advertising for supplies, and so on.  Sub-head C, pay and allowances, including uniform, a sum of £80,700. A reduction of £7,000 is effected under this sub-head.  That is due, firstly to the reduction in bonuses of £4,000: a reduction in uniform equipment of £650; a reduction in overtime payment of £500: a reduction in the temporary warders and temporary wardresses staffs of £1,300; and in the permanent staff of £700.  The total reduction in numbers under this sub-head has been 24 as compared with 1925-6.  The question of establishment charges is being carefully watched and, as opportunity arises, proposals will be submitted for effecting every possible economy, with due regard for the efficiency of the service.  Certain posts have been suppressed in the course of the last financial year, notably that of the steward of the Borstal Institute and a clerkship in Waterford.  The total number of prisoners provided for <Col N="1932" /> is 1,000, which is a reduction of 100 as compared with that of 1925-26.  The establishments under the control of the Board are, of course, the same as those covered by the Estimates of last year&mdash; Mountjoy, Maryborough, the Borstal Institution at Clonmel, Cork Male and Female Prisons, Dundalk, Galway, Limerick, Sligo and Waterford.  The daily average number of prisoners throughout the year ending 31st March, 1926, was 912, and 223 of that number represents the daily average of male convicts in Maryborough.</P>

I possibly will be able to get one comparison, at any rate, a comparison with Britain.  Sub-head D&mdash;Victualling&mdash; £14,000.  There is a substantial reduction of £5,000 here.  It is due to the provision for only 1,000 prisoners which is made possible by the restoration of normal conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimate is based on a provision for 1,000.  One factor in keeping the Vote under this sub-head low is that every available piece of ground attached to the various prisons is cultivated, and the crops produced are availed of to form part of the prison diet.  Under sub-head E, there is a Vote of £4,500 to cover clothing, bedding and furniture.  The reduction here is due to the reduced number of prisoners to be provided for and only the minimum requirements for each prison are sanctioned by the Board.  In sub-head F&mdash;Medicines&mdash; there is a reduction of £50.  The reduction there, of course, is due to the same cause&mdash;the reduction in numbers. Under sub-head G, a Vote of £10,360, there is a reduction of £640.  That reduction is due, mainly, to two causes, the introduction of electric light in Mountjoy Prison and the purchase of <Col N="1933" /> coal at favourable prices by the Board of Works.  A sum of £285 goes in payment of rents for various places.  We pay a rent, for instance, of £139 for the Borstal Institute.  We pay a rent of £60 for the Cork Sunday's Well Prison.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Under the heading of Ordinary Repairs&mdash;subhead J&mdash;a reduction is shown of £700. I think that brings the Vote under that sub-head probably as low as it can be brought.  The maintenance works are, of course, carried out by the works staff of the prison and, to some extent, by prison labour.  Sub-head J.J.&mdash; Alterations at Mountjoy Female Prison &mdash;a sum of £1,500.  The alterations indicated under that sub-head are in connection with the introduction of electric light in the female prison at Mountjoy. Under sub-head L. a sum of £1,200 for travelling and incidental expenses is dealt with.  There is a reduction of £800, due to the altered conditions and reduced numbers.  Sub-head M. shows £450 for telegrams and telephones, a sum of £13 for the maintenance of children of female prisoners, and for <Col N="1934" /> the maintenance of criminal lunatics, £10,500.  There is a decrease of £1,000 there.  That expenditure really lies outside the control of the Board.  It is a diminishing one.  Under sub-head P. there is a sum of £350 for gratuities. There is a reduction of £50.  It is expected that the amount provided will be sufficient.  Gratuities to the extent of 10/- can be earned by ordinary prisoners.  Convicts can earn gratuities up to the amount of £3.  That can be further supplemented by an extra gratuity of £3 in the case of men, and women convicts can earn up to £4, which can be supplemented by a further grant of £2.  The inmates of the Borstal Institute can be given gratuities not exceeding £3.  There is a contribution under sub-head Q. of £150 to the Discharged Prisoners' Aid Society.  Sub-head R. shows Appropriations-in-Aid. There is a reduction of £200 due to the reduction in the number of prisoners.  The more prisoners, of course, the greater the output of the workshops.  The receipts in the manufacturing department are derived from the sales of firewood and mats to the public.  In Cork Prison baskets are made.  Then there are certain miscellaneous receipts, including the sale of old stores, offal, surplus produce from the gardens in the nonagricultural prisons.  Then there are some small receipts by way of rents of cottages not occupied by members of the prison staff.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether it is essential by any regulation or statutory rules that this Vote should be headed &ldquo;Chairman of the Prisons Board&rdquo;?  I gather by a previous discussion that it was not proposed to fill this office, and if that is so is it essential that we should still pretend that it is intended to have a Chairman of the Prisons Board, if the office is vacant?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>What will you call the Vice-Chairman of the Prisons Board if you eliminate the Chairman, even though the post is not vacant? The fact is, of course, that the person who was Vice-Chairman is now the Chairman of the Board, the senior member of the Board, but it is not proposed <Col N="1935" /> to make any addition to the Board or to appoint any person at the rate of remuneration previously drawn by the person who was Chairman. Probably the Board as such will disappear, but it is part of our administrative machinery that we did not interfere with because it was working smoothly and efficiently.  There was not any reason for interference, and there was so much else to attend to, but the survival of the Board as a Board is, of course, a purely nominal thing. There is constant contact and communication between those who act on the Board and the officials of my Department. It is in every respect functioning under the supervision and control of my Department and probably even the name &ldquo;Prisons Board&rdquo; will disappear and simply these officials will take their places as officials of the Department attending to a particular branch.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have heard the Minister tell us something more.  He did suggest that the whole question of what we shall call the organisation or administration of the present system was to some extent at least under consideration at the moment. I would like to know from the Minister if the whole prison system in the country has been at any time recently, or is at present being, given attention by the authorities on this question.  Our prison system is at least in some respects akin to our mental hospitals and many feel that the whole question of treatment of these hospitals is not developed along scientific lines to the extent that should be possible.  I would like to know what consideration is given to the question of treatment of, shall we say, criminals in these institutions with a view to a possible change in their mentality, whether in any of these institutions in any country there has been given consideration to this aspect of things or not.  My experience for a little while in one of these institutions&mdash;perhaps the Minister might be able to say the same thing &mdash;was that it was really amazing to find that even inside there, despite all the efforts of the warders and of very close vigilance, one saw criminals able <Col N="1936" /> to be in possession in the prison of all sorts of various things.  One saw them with pen-knives and watch-chains and a marvellous collection of things of that kind.  Criminals in the prison at all times were prepared to exchange for cigarettes, say, articles at least ten times the value of the cigarettes, and the impression I gathered was that there was comparative idleness.  That certainly bred further mischief.</P>
      <P>It occurred to me then: what were the possibilities of altering the system, if there was any possible chance by a system of tuition, or treatment by some other methods that, at the present time, are not practised, to change the outlook of many of these individuals?  It is rather a difficult question to discuss for one with very little experience, but undoubtedly those who have spent a short period in a prison&mdash;the experience of some members of the Dáil, and others outside&mdash;have all agreed that some change should be made in the administration of these institutions. There ought to be an attempt made to run them on lines other than those attempted up to the present.  The idea that an individual put into one of these prisons is a criminal, has to be treated as a criminal and as an individual who is beyond hope of change, that he is there merely to be punished is, I think, not exactly sound.  The possibility of classification or employment of some methods other than what we have known up to the present, with a view to an improvement in the character and outlook of prisoners generally, is something that demands attention and thought, and I would like to know if anything has been done, or is being done, in that direction.</P>

      <P>There does not seem to be any great enthusiasm for criticising this Vote.  Perhaps it is that Deputies are afraid of the Minister's string of facts and do not wish to bring down his merciless criticism on their heads.  Broadly speaking, the facts as disclosed here show there has been a considerable reduction of expenditure in connection with this Vote, but yet we are faced with the formidable total of £144,850 in connection with the upkeep and maintenance of <Col N="1937" /> the prison system.  The Minister has told us that there are eight prisons and a Borstal Institute which are maintained for this sum.  One cannot but think that eight prisons are excessive for a population of three million people, more particularly when we realise that the three million people comprise a very large proportion of the farming community which, incidentally, represents 75 per cent. of the wealth of the country.  In addition, of course, the farming community is notoriously peace-loving and law-abiding. Under those conditions and recognising that the farming community is now so law-abiding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;that we might expect they would give us all the assistance in their power in all parts of the country in the direction of maintaining law and order, it does seem that one must criticise the continued maintenance of eight prisons.  The Minister has indicated that he is working towards a change in the condition of affairs, and we recognise that once the Minister for Justice takes a thing in hand it is almost as good as done.  Following the line that Deputy Baxter has taken, I suggest that the incarceration of persons in prisons for minor offences could be improved upon, and I would ask the Minister to reconsider the old system of utilising stocks on the village green and putting delinquents under the charge of a very civil civic guard. Some time ago I suggested that the Circuit Court, combined with a native civic force, would have a paternal and disciplinary effect on the people.  I think they could be entrusted safely with looking after minor offences and assisting the people to choose the narrow rather than the broad path that leads to destruction.  In that way we would be able to foster a civic spirit and, possibly, after a time a central prison in Athlone would suffice.  To that prison we could send all the very bad cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in a position to criticise this Vote very fully.  I have not had an opportunity of enjoying the hospitality of any of the prisons.  Perhaps there is a good time coming.  As a <Col N="1938" /> matter of fact, I have not been within the precincts of a prison, even as a visitor.  I have very little knowledge of the state of affairs that exists within the prison walls.  I was always quite satisfied to view the prisons from the outside, and I never hankered for any closer intimacy with those establishments. I do hope the Minister has followed the line, which seems to be largely adopted in connection with other Estimates, of over-estimating the prisoners he will have to cater for. Conditions are improving in the country, and I do hope that in the near future we will be able to say that the Minister has made a substantial cut in his Estimate.  In dealing with an Estimate of this sort it would be dangerous for us, with our limited knowledge, to ask the Minister in advance to cut down what he considers is necessary, because that might be hampering the administration of justice.  I throw out those suggestions and I hope that the Minister in this case has very largely over-estimated the amount he will require to spend.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson was anxious for comparison, and while Deputy Hewat was entertaining the Dáil I endeavoured to get the information. I find that the last year I can get information about with regard to Scotland is 1923; I think it is the last year for which definite figures are available.  There was there an average prison population of 1,996 from a population of, I think, about three and three-quarter millions.  The figures for Great Britain for 1924 show that the average prison population was 11,148 from a total population of about 38 millions.  The comparison which we worked out, for what it is worth, is as follows:&mdash;Scotland, 52 prisoners per 100,000 of the population; Great Britain, 29 prisoners per 100,000 of the population, and the Free State, 29 prisoners per 100,000 of the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Baxter discussed the prison system generally, and talked about his own experience, and the evils of idleness in prisoners and so on.  I had hoped, before this Estimate came up for discussion, to be able to go round all the prisons and the Borstal Institute, simply because I thought it would be <Col N="1939" /> desirable to inform myself, in a personal and direct way, about the conditions in all those places.  So far, I have only been to Mountjoy Prison and to the Borstal Institute at Clonmel on a visit of inspection, but I hope to go round all the prisons shortly.  I must say that in Mountjoy Prison I was favourably impressed, and I had a feeling that I did not sufficiently appreciate it when I was there in another capacity.  The place is very well kept, is very bright and clean, and there was no general atmosphere of idleness.  On the contrary, there was quite a good deal of work going on in the workshops and in the wood yard.  In the female prison the prisoners were at work on laundering, sewing, and other works of that kind suited to them.  The Board understand that there is a receptive mentality in the Department, and in me personally, for any suggestion they may have to make for the improvement of the prison system. But there is nothing to be gained by simply allowing oneself to be led into a disposition for change for the sake of change.  There is no intrinsic virtue in establishing something different.  If we are to change we must be reasonably sure that the change will be for the better.  The whole matter is one on which I should like to feel my way carefully.  I should like to give more attention to it before taking any action or recommending any departure than I have been able to give up to the present in the course of the last two or three years when there were many other administrative claims that really outweighed that aspect of things.</P>
    <P>On the question of mitigating in any way the severity of the prison code I have not much to say.  The prison system as it now exists is not severe. There is nothing really in the nature of physical hardship in the lot of a prisoner sentenced to imprisonment. One small matter has been under consideration, and that is the abolition of the plank-bed.  In the end, when it comes to a point of decision, it will be largely a question of finance.  The plank-bed is, I think, gone in some prisons elsewhere, and if the financial position was better and more comfortable <Col N="1940" /> than it actually is we might be disposed to recommend that that change should be adopted here also. But, at the moment, I am simply not in the position to say that a definite change in the prison system has been decided upon or is even in contemplation. When we have more opportunity to study the matter than we have had up to the present I agree it would be reasonable on the part of Deputies to inquire whether we were satisfied with the existing system or considered any change advisable.</P>

      <P>I beg to move an amendment to reduce sub-head C by £2,781, and I want to explain how I arrived at that figure.  Some time ago, in reply to a question, I was informed that out of a total of 420 officials 238 were pre-Treaty officials.  They are paid altogether £80,700.  The old officials are paid £52,886, and the difference, apparently, is that paid to the new officials, £27,814&mdash;that is to say, the newly-appointed officials are paid over £27,000.  There are 180 of them.  Now, the policy being pursued in the country, not acceptable in some quarters, not a pleasant duty to have to perform, but demanded by the necessities of the moment, and which must be carried into effect, is to reduce, where possible, the expenditure in all institutions.  The ratepayers' representatives have, for the last few months, been going into this question of expenditure in practically every county and are tackling this problem, and they have made reductions in the payments of the staffs of these institutions <Col N="1941" /> of from 10 to 20 per cent.  Some have suggested that the people in the country are not prepared to stand up to their responsibilities in these matters. It is said that they come here to the Dáil and advocate economy but are not prepared to tackle the question when it comes to their own doors.  That cannot be said certainly of the representatives on the county councils, mental hospitals and such institutions, and I think practically in every instance reductions have been made in estimates for these institutions.</P>

      <P>I think it can hardly be suggested that there is very great difference in the work of officials in our prisons and the officials in mental hospitals.  I think it is correct to say that the smallest reduction made by any mental hospital committee in the country is a reduction of 10 per cent., and on the figures I have given, accepting things as they are, we find 180 new officials paid £27,000.  I am asking the Dáil to agree to a 10 per cent. cut in the salaries of these officials.  That is the reduction that is being carried out in other institutions where the work is similar and where the responsibilities are no greater.  These reductions are being made by ratepayers' representatives because they feel the conditions in the country demand it.  We will be putting these officials on the same plane as others, in similar circumstances, down the country, if the Dáil agree with the reduction that I am suggesting. I have given the figures on which I have based my amendment.  I ask the Dáil to agree with me that this reduction is reasonable and that the amendment should be accepted.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy scarcely supported his amendment with adequate considerations.  He said that certain things are being done in the country, and argued from that that they should be done here.  Of course the argument is not complete.  It is not by any means all-sufficient.  I am wondering whether the Deputy, before putting down his amendment, took the trouble even to ascertain what the pay <Col N="1942" /> of the ordinary warder per week is, and if he asked himself whether it was excessive for the work performed?  I think he should begin there and not simply say that some county council or some board of health that he had read of in a local paper, was reducing all salaries of its staff, and that therefore the staff of the Prisons Service should have their salaries reduced.  He may have other arguments; he may have other reasons, good, bad or indifferent, but I am taking the position as presented. Deputy Baxter read in a local paper that some county council or some board of health was reducing the pay of its staff and he put down an amendment here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to believe the Deputy.  I think that that is a very sweeping generalisation.  I do not think the prison pay is excessive.  The ordinary warder gets at present about 55/- per week.  For the work performed and for the type of man we must get, or try to get, and for the expectation we have of reliable, faithful service from that man it is not an excessive rate of remuneration, having regard to the present conditions.  It may be that the local authorities here and there through the country are reducing the rate of pay of their staffs, but we should know what the rate of pay was and what is the proposed change before we could base any argument, however flimsy, on it.  Will the Deputy say that they are reducing it below this rate here?  Or is it simply that being very much in excess it will now, after very courageous action on the part of the local authority, be somewhat less in excess?  We do not know. The Deputy builds up a kind of case, but if we were to take it seriously at all we would need a lot more information about it than at present.  Even if we take him to be stating the exact facts when he says the mental hospitals all over the country are reducing the rates of pay of their officials, we would want to know what these rates were, what the reductions were, and what the future rates would be, before we could proceed to draw an analogy between <Col N="1943" /> them and the rates paid in the prison service.  I admit the work in the prison service sometimes is not arduous, but there is sometimes a big demand on the staff and sometimes a less demand.  But you want reliable service.  It is responsible work, very responsible work, and in all the circumstances, I am not prepared to subscribe to the suggestion that the pay is excessive.  There is a further fact, of course, and that is that a big proportion of the staff is protected by the Treaty Article in the same way as civil servants and police are protected and that any interference with their rates of pay will have probable reactions on your pensions list.</P>

      <P>I know the Deputy deliberately excluded that and said: &ldquo;Deal with the others.&rdquo;  It does not require much imagination to conceive the state of affairs you bring about in an organised service like the prison service if you have men working side by side doing the same work, taking the same responsibility and drawing a different rate of pay.  That is not a situation that I would like to contemplate in any force like the police or the prison service where men work in close contact, side by side.  A, knowing that he is doing the same work as B, and that he is probably doing it as well, and feeling that he is drawing a smaller rate of remuneration, that would create friction and discontent in your service, and I think the economy, such as it would be, would be unsound economy.  It is a small service; there are only a couple of hundred men in it. But it is a very important service, and the loyalty of that staff is a matter of very real concern to the community at large if your prison service is to be efficient at all.  Now the suggestion is that all new men, all the men who came in since the establishment of the State, are to have their pay reduced, and that the others are to be left at their present level.  I will not stand for that suggestion, and if the Deputy were in my place, instead of being in opposition, he would not stand for it either. No man responsible for a service such <Col N="1944" /> as that would be prepared to accept the suggestion that two-thirds of the staff would do their work at a particular rate of pay, and that the other one-third would do the same class of work at a lesser rate.  You could not have that state of things in the Army or the police force or a service such as this. You could not have discrimination in the pay of men who do identical work. On these grounds, looking at the thing fairly and on its merits and looking at the thing in the abstract and apart from this question of discrimination, and also because I do not think the pay excessive for the work performed, I ask the Dáil to reject the Deputy's amendment.</P>

I suggest that to the Minister.  He knows just as well as I do that the service can be recruited from the type who are prepared to come in, and they are not asking what the pay is.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think you will find that £2,781 represents a reduction of 10 per cent. on £27,814.  According to the figures given to me, 180 new hands have been taken into this Vote.  There are 420 officials in all, of whom 238 were old officials.  The difference between the total Vote and the amount paid to the old officials gives us £27,814 as the cost of the new officials. Ten per cent. reduction on that will give you £2,781.  I hold that the work that is being done in every Department of State to-day could be as well done by the same men at a lower figure than the figure fixed.  I say that that statement is true of this service as well as of the services we have dealt with and that we are to deal with.  If the conditions demand a reduction in any estimate, whether local or central, you cannot urge that one service, where it is possible to have a reduction, should be excluded from the sweep of the brush.</P>

      <P>That sounds a very good argument and I am sorry to break in on the Deputy.  The Deputy says that if the rate of pay was good enough two years ago, it is too good now.  That is his argument, I think. The rate of pay falls with any fall in <Col N="1946" /> the cost-of-living index figure.  The fifty-five shillings is inclusive of bonus. As the cost-of-living index figure goes down, the Deputy can rest easy at night in full knowledge and confidence that the rate of pay of the prison service is coming down with it.  The fifty-five shillings I have mentioned is inclusive of bonus.</P>

Therefore, it is not a good argument to say that if the salary was good enough three years ago it is too good now because it was higher than fifty-five shillings three years ago.  It has fallen and will fall with any further fall in the cost-of-living figure.  Therefore, I am entitled to put to the Deputy the bald, plain question: &ldquo;Is fifty-five shillings per week now, in the existing conditions, an excessive rate of pay for the man who performs the duties of warder in the prison service?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If the Minister made the statement that fifty-five shillings per week included everything&mdash;uniform allowances and all that sort of thing&mdash;I would be prepared to say that it was not too high a figure.  But if the warder was paid sixty-five shillings twelve months ago, and if the reduction in the warder's salary is such that it is fifty-five shillings to-day, that is accounted for by the fall in prices. The fifty-five shillings is as good to him to-day as the sixty-five shillings was twelve months ago, because the drop in his salary is only on that side of his salary which is affected by bonus.  What I hold is that the salary paid twelve months ago or two years ago should be the subject of revision to-day, and that if we are to deal equitably with every official we can legally deal with, the same case stands for a reduction in the salary of these people as in the salary of people in every other service in the State.  If the position was that these men were paid fifty-five shillings per week and that there were no other allowances, I would say it was not a very exorbitant figure.  But there are allowances to warders which we know bring their salaries above fifty-five shillings per week.  I cannot calculate at the moment what these allowances amount to individually, but I am prepared to stand by my statement that if a man was paid sixty-five shillings a year or two years ago and that he has lost ten shillings since, he has lost it because there has been such a drop in prices that his bonus is reduced and that the fifty-five shillings is as good to him to-day as sixty-five shillings was a year or two years ago.  On that I say that there is justification for a reduction.</P>

      <P>Deputy Baxter is making the case that the rate of pay of warders established under the British régime was too high or, alternatively, if it was not too high, that the plan of bonus is excessive, that the rate of bonus and the system of reduction in bonus allows too great a sum to the <Col N="1948" /> warders or to other civil servants.  I do not know whether Deputy Baxter intends to maintain that position right through the Civil Service.  He will get very few civil servants to agree with him with respect to either of these counts, and he will get very few people with any experience of life outside the Civil Service to agree with him&mdash;that the rate of pay fixed for warders, beginning at 29/- per week, rising by 1/- to 35/-, and then by 1/6 to 43/- a week, was excessive pre-war.</P>

I am surprised at Deputy Baxter using any argument which would lead to that conclusion, because that is the conclusion that he wants, to lower even the standard that prevailed in the lower paid ranks of the Civil Service pre-war.

      <P>Pre-war comes in by the fact that the scale upon which these men are paid is the pre-war scale, and a certain advance was made to them because of the increased prices ruling, and these prices, as they fall, inevitably bring down the remuneration.  If the Deputy wishes to reduce the Vote I do not think we should attack the wages of the warders, or of any of the other lower paid ranks of the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>I agree more or less with Deputy Johnson in one particular, that is, with regard to attacking the lower officials and not the higher officials.  For instance, take the governors. We have two governors in class <Col N="1949" /> I., one in class II., six in class III., and two deputy governors, giving a total of eleven for eight institutions.  Is that right?</P>

      <P>There seems to be a tremendous number of chaplains, too. I think that that end of it is pretty well attended to also.  I do agree with the Minister to this extent, that you want a very exceptional class of man as a warder, and, I think, more particularly as a warder, because loyalty in this connection is something that is absolutely necessary. But even with the small number of prisoners that there are, we have heard of recent escapes and we have heard a good deal of comment as to how these escapes were effected.  It is not my business to inquire; rumours are one thing and facts are another.  But one thing is certain, you cannot expect them to do this work, and do it well, at the same wage as that paid to an ordinary man outside.  We know that they are subjected to temptations; money has been offered to them; money will be offered to them.  As a general rule money is rather plentiful among criminals, and this class of man must be put above temptation.  I should say that he is in a different position altogether from a Civic Guard, but still, considering his salary, bonus and allowance, not from the bottom at all, but from the top right down, I think some economies should be effected.  I have referred to the number of governors.  Perhaps I have not a full grasp of the position, but I think that, although the Vote is a small one, there are ample opportunities for effecting the economies suggested by Deputy Baxter within the next twelve months.</P>

      <P>Let us see these governors and deputy-governors all over the place.  There are two first-class governors and one second-class governor.  The first-class would be Mountjoy and Portlaoighise.  There is one second-class governor in Cork, and there are six third-class, Sligo, Dun-dalk, Galway, Waterford, Limerick, and the Borstal at Clonmel.</P>

      <P>They are all old officials.  Most of them held their present positions in the past, and others were promoted to them.  They are not new officials; I have not brought men in and put them into the positions.  On the question of these allowances, what it amounts to is this: there is uniform for officers.  For male officers the uniform is a cap, two jackets, two trousers, two pairs of boots, supplied annually, a great coat, supplied every two years, and a belt as required.  The one belt practically does the man his time in the service.  The cost of that&mdash;because, of course, it is produced by prison labour in the workshops&mdash;is about £5 to the State.  For pension purposes it is allowed to count as 3/6 a week, but I estimate the real value of it is about 2/- a week.  A man gets quarters, and if it is not possible to provide him with quarters&mdash;I do not know that there are many cases of that kind&mdash;he is given a living-out allowance of something between 6/- and 8/- a week.  Eight shillings would be the maximum.  The Deputy can take it, therefore, that if you count these two allowances and add them to the 55/-, I contend that with the type of man you require and must get, it is not an excessive rate of pay.</P>

      <P>Such recruitment to the Prison Service as there has been since we took over has been recruitment to the rank of ordinary warder only.  My first position is this: that is not excessive under existing conditions, quite apart from any other consideration, and I move on then to this <Col N="1951" /> position, that you are debarred, or practically debarred, from any change in connection with probably two-thirds of the personnel, that if you were to adopt any change you would be met with the evil that you would have men doing the same work and bearing the same responsibilities at different rates of pay, and nothing could play greater havoc in an organised service than that.  I put it to you that, if it saved every penny of this £2,781, it would be bad business, and I would not recommend it.  As Deputy Gorey says, even as things are, members of the staff are occasionally suborned with results that make a flare heading for an evening paper.  You can only face that and deal with it.  When that happened other things happened within the prison staff.  Temporary warders, who had never won the complete confidence of their authorities were discharged without further notice, and a general order was issued that any temporary warder who, after a reasonable period, had not succeeded in gaining the complete confidence of the officials placed over him was to be discharged.</P>
      <P>There is a period of probation in the prison service, and my position is this, that if a man is taken on as a temporary warder, and if, after a year, eighteen months, or two years, that man is not fit to be incorporated as a permanent warder, he must go.  He must, within his probation period, secure the confidence of the Board or go.  And when my attention was drawn to the fact, after that escape, that we had temporary warders that the Board had never thought fit to recommend for incorporation in the service as permanent warders because they had not complete confidence in them, I said, and I think I was justified in saying it: &ldquo;It is time that these men went,&rdquo; and certain officers were discharged.  I think the whole case is now before the Dáil.  I do not think that the present rates of pay are excessive. Further, I think that such a thing as is contemplated by the motion, a discrimination between men doing identical work, is highly inadvisable, and I recommend against it.</P>

      <P>On this Vote last year I made a very full statement and I really have little to add.  The Estimate is practically the same except that one of the senior officers, the Assistant-Keeper, has been definitely transferred to another Department.  It is not proposed to fill the vacancy during the current financial year, so that the Estimate is lower than last year by about £900.  Up to the present the work of the office has been practically confined to the examination of the comparatively few papers salvaged from the wreckage after the burning and explosion in 1922, and the reception and filing away, on a rough temporary system, of records which, being out of current use, are being got rid of by the various Departments.  It is important to have a clear view of the actual conditions at present in the office.  There are really three distinct structures or buildings&mdash;the Birmingham Tower, the Record Office (Treasury), and the Record Office proper. One is in Dublin Castle.  Its contents are absolutely intact.  Certain minor repairs and the installation of other conveniences were necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1953" /> Then there is the Record Office (Treasury) situated on the Four Courts site, at the back of the Record Office proper.</P>
    <P>This was a modern structure built for the convenience, storage, and easy production of records.  The Record Office proper was in front of the Record Office (Treasury) and contained the public room by which access to the Treasury was had and in which searches were made for indexes.  It contained printed calendars and indexes. The Record Office (Treasury) has scarcely been touched at all in the reconstruction, and there is not considered to be any particular urgency about re-building, because there is no special demand for it.  The vaults in the Record Office will be ample to hold all that is at present available in the way of documentary records, and the Board of Works is making progress towards putting the vaults in good condition. In regard to any scheme for reconstruction of records by getting originals or copies from private individuals, libraries, or other Governments, or any other scheme for reprinting old manuscripts and calendars, matters of that kind have been left aside as not being proper for consideration up to the present.  That would involve an expenditure in printing and staffing, and it pre-supposes rebuilding a considerable portion of the Treasury.  That expenditure may be small from the point of view of the scholar or historian in comparison with the value of the object aimed at, but we have not yet thought fit to approach the Minister for Finance to put up money, and it may be considered whether in next year's Estimate it would be possible to make a beginning in that direction.  There is also a question as to whether we could find people here to act in an honorary capacity for the examination of such documents of historical value as might be found to exist here or elsewhere.  At the moment, <Col N="1954" /> however, I need not be taken as issuing any call for that.  Possibly by the time that this Estimate comes up for consideration by the Dáil again, we may be inviting members of the public to give honorary service in that capacity.</P>
