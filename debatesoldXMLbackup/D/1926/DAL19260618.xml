      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 15, before Section 21, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The Commissioners may, at their discretion, grant to any whole-time officer or servant in their employment who either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  has attained the age of 65 years and has at least twenty-five years' continuous service, or</P>
      <P>(b)  becomes incapable of discharging his duties with efficiency by reason of permanent infirmity of mind or body not caused by his own misconduct, or of old age, and who has not less than ten years' continuous service.</P>
      <P>upon his resigning or otherwise ceasing to be employed an annual allowance for his life not exceeding in any case two-thirds of his annual remuneration and emoluments, and subject to that over-riding limitation, not exceeding an annual sum calculated at the rate of one-sixtieth of his annual remuneration and emoluments for every completed year of service with the Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The Commissioners may, at their discretion, grant to any whole-time officer or servant in their employment <Col N="1364" /> who has at least ten years' continuous service and who retires or is removed from his employment in consequence of the abolition of his office or situation, or for the purpose of facilitating improvements in the organisation or working of the undertaking of the Commissioners, by which greater efficiency and economy can be effected, such special annual allowance for his life by way of compensation as on full consideration of the circumstances shall appear to the Commissioners to be a reasonable and just compensation for the loss of his office or situation, but not exceeding in any case two-thirds of his annual remuneration and emoluments and subject to that over-riding limitation not exceeding an annual sum calculated at the rate of one-sixtieth of his annual remuneration and emoluments for every completed year of service with the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Commissioners may, at their discretion, grant to any whole-time officer or servant in their employment, whose service is less than ten years, and who either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  becomes incapable of discharging his duties with efficiency by reason of permanent infirmity of mind or body not caused by his own misconduct, or of old age, or</P>
    <P>(b)  who retires or is removed from his employment in consequence of the abolition of his office or situation, or for the purpose of facilitating improvements in the organisation or working of the undertaking of the Commissioners by which greater efficiency and economy can be effected.</P>
    <P>upon his retiring or ceasing to be employed, a gratuity not greater than one-sixth of his annual remuneration and emoluments for every completed year of service with the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>(4)  The payment of any allowances and gratuities authorised to be paid by this section shall be a purpose to which the tolls and other income received by the Commissioners may be applied.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1365" /> (5)  The grant of any annual allowance or gratuity made prior to the 1st day of June, 1926, by the Commissioners to any of their former officers or servants is hereby confirmed, and the payment thereof is hereby declared to be a purpose to which the tolls and other income received by the Commissioners would have been and may be applied, notwithstanding that the amount of any such allowance or gratuity exceeds the rate authorised by this section.</P>
    <P>(6)  In this section the expression &ldquo;annual remuneration and emoluments&rdquo; means in relation to an officer or servant who has been employed for not less than three years the average amount of remuneration and emoluments during the three years ending on the day on which he resigns or otherwise ceases to be employed, and in relation to an officer or servant who has been employed for less than three years the average amount of his remuneration and emoluments during each completed year of service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.K. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of sub-section (1) to add the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that for the purpose of calculating any annual allowance which the Commissioners may, at their discretion, grant to the secretary holding office at the date of the passing of this Act, it shall be lawful for the Commissioners to add any number of years not exceeding ten to the actual number of completed years of service of the said Secretary.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There are exceptional reasons for this amendment.  The present occupant of the office is an old man.  He is well over 80 years of age.  He has given valuable service and he is anxious to keep on the office.  The Commissioners are anxious to be in the position that if he is knocked out they will be able to add a certain number of years to his service and give him fair compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. NOLAN Mr. NOLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt this gentleman has given very valuable service for the number of years he has been <Col N="1366" /> in office.  He is now, I understand, about 85 years of age.  He was almost 70 years of age when he entered office as secretary to this Board.  He was a very successful business man, I understand, and carried on business as a corn merchant, a manure merchant and coal importer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">

      <P>Is he getting a pension for all these?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. NOLAN Mr. NOLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>He gave up business in order to get this position.  I am sure that when he was giving up business he kept something for himself.  As my colleague has stated, he gave valuable service but it is unreasonable to adopt the procedure of extending the years of service in order that the pension should be increased.  It is a bad policy and I object to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The points for and against this amendment have been put.  We have this exceptional case of a man who went into the post when he was almost 70 years of age.  He has now completed 15 years and he is still actively working at the age of 84 years. It is proposed by this amendment that certain additional years shall be given to him.  That really arises from the insertion of this superannuation allowances and gratuities section under my amendment.  Otherwise if that were not there the Commissioners would have given him whatever retiring allowance they liked.  They are now tied to a certain sum and the case is made that this gentleman would be entitled only to one quarter of his present emoluments by way of pension.  That does not seem enough and the amendment is accordingly being moved.  I have Deputy Nolan's objection to the proposal; it seems undesirable to have a special provision made for a single individual in a measure of this general type.  The House is free to vote as it likes on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point that must be made so that the House may have the facts properly before it.  This gentleman went into the service of the Harbour Commissioners at the age of 69. He had a successful business career, according to Deputy Nolan.  He goes into the post at an age when most men would be thinking of pension rights <Col N="1367" /> and not of the work, and he has had the advantage of being in this post for 15 years&mdash;up to the age of 84 years. There is no doubt the Commissioners have got very valuable work out of him.  He has given good service, but if you are giving a man extra years, not for the abolition of office but because of the circumstances of the date when he entered the office and his age at the present moment, it is a different matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:</P>
      <P>In page 15 before Section 22 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister for Industry and Commerce may by order appoint a fit and proper person (in this Act referred to as &ldquo;the auditor&rdquo;) to examine and audit the accounts of the Commissioners, and may by such order fix the amount of the payments to be made by the Commissioners by way of salary and expenses (if any) to the auditor.</P>
      <P>(2)  The amount of the payments so fixed as aforesaid shall be paid by the Commissioners to the auditor out of the tolls and other income received by them.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Minister for Industry and Commerce may by order remove the auditor from office, and shall by the same or any subsequent order, unless the appointment of an auditor appears to him for any special reason to be unnecessary, appoint a fit and proper person to be the auditor in lieu and stead of the auditor so removed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper is moving a further amendment to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I was Chairman of <Col N="1368" /> the Committee that considered this Bill and the amendments.  The Committee considered it desirable, while adopting the substance of the amendment proposed by the Minister, that it should be altered in such a way as to make it mandatory on the Minister to appoint an auditor.  The sub-section sets out that the Minister for Industry and Commerce may, by order, appoint a fit and proper person.  I move as an amendment to the Minister's proposal: &ldquo;In sub-section (1), line 1, to delete the word &lsquo;may&rsquo; and substitute therefor the word &lsquo;shall.&rsquo;&rdquo; That is what the Committee suggests.</P>
      <P>All the other provisions relating to the audit are compulsory.  It is compulsory for the secretary and the Commissioners to attend the audit.  It is compulsory on the Harbour Commissioners to submit their accounts for audit, and the Committee held that it should be made compulsory on the Minister to appoint an auditor.  The Minister has ample power under later portions of the section to remove the auditor from office if he considers him unsuitable and appoint another auditor to replace him.  It is not unreasonable to ask that the obligation should be the same on both sides.  The Commissioners are obliged to submit their books for audit, and the Committee are of opinion that the Minister should be compelled to appoint an auditor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment itself is not, I suppose, objectionable, but it hardly carries out what appears to have been the intention of the Committee, that is, to make it mandatory that there should, in all cases, be appointed a fit and proper person to examine and audit the accounts.  Deputy Cooper refers to the power I have under this amendment.  That power negatives, or does away with, the intention of the Committee with regard to the first amendment.  Although in sub-section (1) I have power to appoint, when it comes to sub-section (3) I have the power, by order, to remove that auditor from office, and shall, unless the appointment of an auditor appears for any special reason to be unnecessary, appoint another auditor to take his place. <Col N="1369" /> I suggest that if the Committee wanted to make the thing quite binding, they should have paid some attention to sub-section 3 of amendment 2. The new position would be that instead of leaving it that I may appoint an auditor in cases where it seems right and proper, I must appoint the auditor, then remove him, and make no appointment in his place.  It does not seem to me that that is a desirable thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee assumed that the special reasons referred to in sub-section 3 do not exist at the present time.  The provision made in this section is for the existing situation, a normal situation under which the Limerick Harbour Commissioners are to operate.  The only special reason there could be would arise if there were no accounts to audit.  If for some reason, let us suppose, owing to the development of the Shannon scheme or any other scheme, the Port of Limerick ceased to function for a year and therefore there would be no dues, that would appear to me to be one special reason that could arise for not having an auditor.  If there were no accounts it might not be necessary to have an auditor.  The Committee assumed the special case put forward in sub-section (3) is non-existent at the present moment, and therefore they think the auditor should be appointed at present when the Harbour Commissioners are working under normal conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McBRIDE</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Docks and Piers Act or some such Act, is there not power in the Commissioners to appoint an auditor themselves, and furthermore is it not compulsory on them to publish the balance-sheet of their accounts?  Why should the power be taken away from the Commissioners to appoint their own auditor?  Of course I know the auditor is always subject to the supervision of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put the view which occurs to me that this is a private Bill touching the Limerick Harbour and the Limerick Harbour Commissioners, and it seems to be more fitting that provision regarding the appointment of an auditor should be <Col N="1370" /> put in the terms of &ldquo;may by Order&rdquo; rather than that we should insert in that private Bill a mandatory provision that the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; appoint such an official.  I think the right course, if we wanted to ensure that the Minister would carry out this optional provision, would be that we would pass a resolution that it was desirable that that should be done rather than to make this a mandatory provision.  I think there are many cases where the optional &ldquo;may&rdquo; is almost invariably deemed to be mandatory.  From the point of view of the construction it seems to me that the alteration of this section to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would be somewhat out of the regular course and therefore undesirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 15, before Section 22, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  It shall be the duty of the secretary to the Commissioners on any examination and audit of accounts to attend before the auditor at the appointed time and place, and there to produce and give to the auditor all his books of accounts, vouchers, receipts, and other documents, and all such information in his possession as shall be required by the auditor, and it shall also be the duty of the Commissioners and every officer and servant (other than the secretary) of the Commissioners if required by the auditor so to do to attend before the auditor at the time and place appointed for the examination and audit, and there to produce and give to the auditor all such documents and information in their possession respectively as shall be required by the auditor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  It shall be the duty of the auditor on any examination and audit under this section to examine <Col N="1371" /> into the accounts of the Commissioners and to disallow and strike out of such accounts all payments, charges, and allowances made by any person, and charged on the funds of the Commissioners contrary to law, or which he deems to be unfounded, and to surcharge the same upon the person making or authorising the payment, charge, or allowance so disallowed and struck out, and thereupon to certify the same to be due from such person.</P>
    <P>(3)  The auditor shall, on application made to him in writing within ten days after the completion of any examination and audit made by him under this section by any person aggrieved by any allowance, disallowance, or surcharge made by him on such examination and audit, state in writing his reasons for such allowance, disallowance, or surcharge and furnish forthwith a copy of such statement to such aggrieved person.</P>
    <P>(4)  Any person aggrieved by any allowance, disallowance, or surcharge may, within twenty-one days after the completion of the audit if a statement of the auditor's reasons for such allowance, disallowance, or surcharge has not been applied for within ten days after the completion of the audit, or within fourteen days from the furnishing of the statement of such reasons if such statement has been applied for within the time aforesaid either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  appeal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the manner to be prescribed by such Minister, and such Minister shall deal with the matter (including, but subject to the provisions of this section, the costs of appeal) as justice may require, and the decision of such Minister on any such appeal shall be final and shall not be subject to appeal to or review by any court; or</P>
    <P>(b)  in lieu of such appeal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, apply to the High Court for a writ of <i>certiorari</i> to remove into the said Court the said allowance, disallowance, or surcharge in such <Col N="1372" /> manner as may be provided by rules of court, and on the removal of such allowance, disallowance, or surcharge, the Court shall make such order thereon (including, but subject to the provisions of this section, an order as to costs) as justice may require.</P>
    <P>(5)  On any proceedings under the foregoing sub-section the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the High Court as the case may be may if it appears to such Minister or Court that the decision of the auditor was correct, direct that the costs of the auditor be paid by the person appealing or prosecuting such writ of <i>certiorari</i> as the case may be, or if it appears to such Minister or the High Court that the decision of the auditor was erroneous direct that the costs of the person appealing or prosecuting such writ of <i>certiorari</i> as the case may be, be paid out of the tolls and other income of the Commissioners, but in no case shall any order for payment of the costs of the person appealing or prosecuting such writ of <i>certiorari</i> be made against the auditor.</P>
    <P>(6)  Any costs (including costs between solicitor and client) incurred by the auditor in relation to any proceedings on any appeal or writ of <i>certiorari</i> under this section and which have not been recovered by the auditor from the person appealing or prosecuting such writ of <i>certiorari</i> shall be paid to the auditor out of the tolls and other income of the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>(7)  Any sum certified by the auditor under this section to be due by any person shall (subject to any reversal, cancellation or variation of the certificate by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the High Court) be paid by such person to the auditor within twenty-one days after the completion of the audit or, in case an application has been made for a statement of the auditor's reasons for such allowance, disallowance, or surcharge, within fourteen days from the date of the delivery of such statement, or, in case an appeal has been made to such <Col N="1373" /> Minister or proceedings have been taken by way of <i>certiorari,</i> within fourteen days from the date of the decision on such appeal or proceedings, and every allowance made by the auditor which has been disallowed by such Minister or Court shall be a sum due from the person making or authorising the payment which was the subject of such allowance, and shall be paid to the auditor within fourteen days from the date of the decision of such Minister or Court, and any sum payable under this sub-section, to the auditor may, if not so paid in accordance with this sub-section, be recovered as a civil debt by the auditor by action or other proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction, and every sum paid to or recovered by the auditor under this sub-section shall, when received by him, be applied by him in the manner directed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and any costs and expenses by the auditor in proceedings for the recovery of any such sum which are not recovered by the auditor from the defendant in any such proceedings shall be paid to the auditor out of the tolls and other income of the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>(8)  Every person who being required by or in pursuance of this section to attend before the auditor or to produce any document or give any information to the auditor fails or refuses so to do shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding ten pounds or at the discretion of the court to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month.</P>
    <P>(9)  Every person required by or in pursuance of this section to produce any document or to give any information to the auditor shall if so required by the auditor verify on oath (which oath the auditor is hereby authorised to administer) any document produced or statement made by him to the auditor and any person who shall upon examination upon oath by or before an auditor under this section wilfully give false <Col N="1374" /> evidence shall be guilty of perjury, and shall be punishable accordingly.</P>

      <P>I told the Dáil on several occasions, I think, that it was intended to relieve the burden cast upon jurors of the City of Dublin within the last few years.  My intention was that a section giving that relief would form part of a comprehensive measure amending generally the law as to jurors.  But owing to pressure of legislation it has not been found possible to introduce a measure of that kind before the end of the present session.  I was anxious that the Dublin jurors should be relieved at as early a date as possible. Accordingly, I am introducing this Bill.  The larger measure will probably be taken up in the Autumn Session.</P>

      <P>That the Special Order made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Electricity Supply Acts 1882 to 1919 and the Electricity Commissioners (Transfer of Functions) Order, 1924, in respect of the Urban District of Letterkenny, in the County of Tirconaill, which was presented on Tuesday, 15th June, 1926, be approved.</P>
      <P>This Order was made on the 8th June, 1926, to authorise the Letterkenny Urban District Council to generate and supply electricity within its area.  The council at present supplies gas to the Letterkenny Urban District, but owing to the decrease in the demand for gas, due to the installation of private electrical plants, the council is now unable to continue the supply of gas except at an unreasonably high price.  The present price of gas in Letterkenny is 12/6 per 1,000 cubic feet, and if the gas works are to be continued a further substantial increase of price would have to be made.  The council has accordingly applied for authority to supply electricity in lieu of gas, and the majority of gas consumers in the district have signed an agreement to take a supply of electricity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the discussion will cover both.  The object of the Minister in proposing this tax, as stated by himself on the occasion of the introduction of his Budget, was to raise the sum of from £150,000 to £200,000.  He proposed doing that by instituting a 5 per cent. tax on turn-over on betting transactions on racecourses and otherwise.  Now, as far as I can understand, the Minister has come to the conclusion that he will be enabled to secure this sum, approximately at any rate, by the institution of a 5 per cent. tax on what is known as the totalisator, remitting half the proceeds for certain purposes, and decreasing the tax on betting on racecourses from 5 per cent. to 2½ per cent. I have no quarrel with that argument on the part of the Minister, but I venture to say that he will have no more chance of realising £150,000 to £200,000 on his present proposal than he had on his original one.  A certain sum of money is devoted to betting.  It has not a limitless source.  I doubt very much if the whole amount of <Col N="1377" /> money expended and paid over on bets in the Saorstát from one end of the year to the other amounts to more than £100,000.  I believe that this proposal, just as the original one, will eat up all the original money that goes to betting transactions.</P>
      <P>Anyone acquainted with betting knows that though bets are made in seemingly large sums the amount of money that passes is very often small. A person may go to a race-meeting&mdash; and certainly those who indulge in heavy betting follow this course&mdash;and may have bets of £25, £50, or £100 on various races, and at the end of the day there may not be more than £15 between him and the bookmaker.  Most bets of that character are on paper. What is proposed here is not a tax on the actual sum won or lost, but on the turn-over, which is probably contained in the bookmakers' books on paper. I say that the amount of money at the disposal of the public&mdash;and by the public I mean all connected with racing&mdash;breeders, trainers, bookmakers and the general public&mdash;will not exceed £100,000 a year, and that instead of being enabled to secure from £150,000 to £200,000, if the Minister persists in his present proposal, by the end of the financial year he will find that the tax will not pay for itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The money expended in racing here nowadays is almost entirely confined to this country.  At one time fresh money did come in.  People from England and elsewhere bet upon our racecourses, but that is not the case to-day.  The crowds of people that used to come here to attend our race meetings have very seriously diminished.  Therefore, I submit that this tax would not pay for itself&mdash;that the cost of collection will exceed the amount received in revenue; that it will entail the creation of a huge army of officials, that there will, of course, be serious attempts at evasion, that there will necessarily be raids and prosecutions, and that the administrative cost will be such that the proposal of the Minister will not be worth while.  As against that, the Minister has had offered to him a net sum of from £80,000 to £100,000&mdash;and that is a certainty.  He has had the figures given to him.  He has told us <Col N="1378" /> that he has not had sufficient time as yet to peruse the figures.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Dáil would be somewhat surprised if I detained them for a few moments in showing the amount of the tax that would have to be paid by one class of the public, namely the bookmakers. Supposing a bookmaker bets £10 per race on one day's racing and there were six races that day, he would bet £60 and the tax would be £3; as there are 153 days' racing here, according to the Irish Racing Calendar, he would pay no less than £459 per year under this tax at 5 per cent.  Of course the amount would be reduced by half if the tax was so reduced.  I say &ldquo;he would pay,&rdquo; but I do not know whether the bookmaker will pay it or not&mdash;I do not know who will have to pay it&mdash;whether it is the public or the bookmaker.  The question is whether when a person comes to make a bet upon a racecourse, the bookmaker will not endeavour to get that person to pay the tax then and there.  I think it will be a rather difficult matter as between the two parties. Take the case of a bookmaker who bets £40 per race; that would be £240 on six races; the tax would be £12 under the original proposal, £6 now, and the sum he would have to pay in the year would be £1,836 at 5 per cent. and £900 odd at 2½ per cent.  Then take the case of a bookmaker who bets £100 on each race; six hundred pounds would be the total for six races; the tax would be £30 at 5 per cent., and £15 at 2½ per cent.; the total for the year's racing would be £4,590 at 5 per cent. and half that at 2½ per cent.  I could go on showing by increasing amounts the ratio of the sum that would have to be paid.  The tax is altogether out of proportion to the amount involved.  If it were a question of taxing the profits there would be something to be said for it but, when you come to taxing turn-over, where the money is not really there, where most of it is on paper, and where transactions are conducted principally on credit, it is a different proposition.</P>
    <P>This proposal, as it now stands, even as amended, would not only injuriously affect interests connected with racing, such as horse-breeding, training establishments, racecourse companies and bookmakers themselves, but it would <Col N="1379" /> also seriously affect certain towns and districts.  The Minister thinks that small meetings do not count, and that they should not be held at all.  I think small meetings are of the utmost importance, especially in the interests of farmers.  It is well known that it is only at these meetings farmers have an opportunity of trying their horses. When these horses show themselves to be of any particular quality the owners can then send them elsewhere or sell them.  That is why the horse-breeding industry has been so successful in this country.  The tax would not only injure these interests, but it would also injure certain localities.  As I said yesterday there was no racing in Tramore in 1905, and it took years for that little seaside resort to recover.  People flock there to race meetings, money is spent there, not altogether on the racecourse, and there is a general benefit to the community.</P>
    <P>Then take the position of the railways. I understand that last year the Great Southern Railways ran no less than 250 passenger &ldquo;specials&rdquo; to race meetings.  I am informed that the income derived from that traffic amounted to about £30,000.  These &ldquo;specials&rdquo; did not go to the Phoenix Park or other large race meetings, which the Minister is not adverse to keeping in existence, but places as far afield as Ballinrobe, Tralee, Thurles, and Tramore.  As a result the railway company was able to make this huge sum of money.  The number of horses carried is another consideration that should be taken into account.  No less than 14,000 horses were conveyed by the railways to and from the various racecourses in this country last year.  Is not that of some importance when considering the injury that this tax will be to small race meetings in areas that are more or less rural?  When the Minister talks lightly about these race meetings being of no use, and as fixtures at which only &ldquo;crocks&rdquo; are run, I would ask him to visit some of them. I would remind him that &ldquo;Knight of the Wilderness,&rdquo; which was running recently in Thurles, won the Sefton Steeplechase, and is a horse that would sell to-morrow for a large sum of <Col N="1380" /> money.  That is the class of horse that runs at these local meetings.  It indicates a great want of knowledge on the Minister's part to suggest that these race meetings are not the very life blood of the horse-breeding industry in Ireland.  I am not complaining because the Minister has not got that knowledge, but I am convinced that if this proposal goes through, even in its present modified form, it will seriously injure the various interests I have enumerated.</P>
    <P>I think it is a pity the Minister was not inclined to accept my amendment last night.  At any rate, it would be well if he took a little longer to consider the matter and to learn a little more&mdash;because he has learned a good deal since he started to investigate the subject&mdash;before proceeding.  If so, I am convinced that when he has made a thorough investigation, and heard the views of the various interests affected, he will come to the conclusion that I have come to, that this tax is not a practicable one, and that it would be better, in the interests of the fourth greatest industry in this country&mdash; horse-breeding&mdash;to drop it altogether.</P>

      <P>According to the G.A.A. rules it is illegal for a bookmaker to carry on betting at Gaelic meetings.  Deputy Shaw gave the Dáil the views of owners and trainers, as well as those who run stud farms, and also, I presume, the views of the clubs concerned.  Deputy Gorey who understands coursing gave the views of those interested in coursing meetings.  No Deputy knows more about coursing than Deputy Gorey, who made it clear last night that this tax would wipe out the sport completely.  We were expecting to get coursing meetings exempted from entertainment tax but instead of that, this additional tax is proposed. In and around practically every town <Col N="1381" /> in Longford and Westmeath labourers, artisans, small farmers and traders keep greyhounds, not for the novelty of keeping them, but as a hobby, and in many cases they are able to make a few pounds each year in this way, so that it forms a part of their income.  I know very poor men who keep two or three greyhounds who probably sell five or six pups in the year, and this brings in money to enable them to feed their children.  If this proposed tax&mdash;I would not agree to 2½ per cent., or to any tax&mdash;is inserted in the Bill it will mean doing away completely with this little industry which means a few pounds in the year to many poor men. The Minister has said that coursing is no asset to the State, but coursing gives employment to the men who look after the hounds, and food has to be bought.  Every little thing counts, and if this tax is imposed the Minister for Finance will succeed in wiping out the only old Irish sport left.  When the Minister retired to rest last night after a hard day's toil I would like to know if his dreams did not turn to the betting tax on coursing, and whether it was, as Deputy Wilson mentioned yesterday, like a fairy godmother coming to him during the night, making it possible for him to realise that this tax would wipe out coursing, once and for all.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister at least to exempt from the tax betting on the course, because it would not be able to bear it.  If you put 1/- on at 5 to 2 it would take a good deal of calculation to find what amount should be deducted as the State's proportion.  At these coursing meetings the great proportion of the bets are only shilling bets. People who attend these meetings have not money.</P>

      <P>Those who have no money require sport as much as those who have, and if you let one class of people have it why not let another, and why deny the right to the poor man to enjoy himself when you give that right to the rich man?  If that is to be done the sooner this country becomes Bolshie the better it will be for the workers.  I deny the right of any man to refuse <Col N="1382" /> the worker the right to enjoy himself. This is the only winter sport left to the worker, and he can put up his greyhound against another, and have the honour of winning or the pleasure of seeing his dog run.  It is not the people who can put £100 on a horse who go to coursing meetings.  It is the ordinary common man.  Deputy Shaw has spoken for the racing people, but as far as coursing is concerned, unless I get some satisfactory explanation as to the Minister's intentions.  I will put this to a Division.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>While endeavouring to make the best compromise possible, I do not admit, of course, that a 2½ per cent. tax on turn-over is not excessive, and that it will not injure racing.  I believe that it will.  But if the Minister agrees to refund half the amount collected, the extraction of the money will not be so serious, because it will give the small meetings an opportunity of increasing their stakes, thereby bringing much better horses and larger attendances to them.  When I was speaking of a refund of 50 per cent. of the tax last night, I omitted to mention that the Turf Club has been receiving from the British Treasury a very substantial subsidy towards stakes in this country, even since the Treaty was passed, and if they continue to give us this considerable sum surely our own Government should be much more generous.  We have a meeting at Kilbeggan, in Westmeath, perhaps one of the smallest in Ireland, but which at the same time is known as the Ascot of Ireland.  It is probably one of the most popular meetings in Ireland at present.  It was held about a month ago, and two of the horses which ran at it, called Gay Boy and Newsboy, could not be bought for £10,000.  The Kilbeggan executive&mdash;and I only mention this as an example of all the other meetings of the kind&mdash;are not able to give large stakes owing to the amusements tax and because of other expenses, such as having to pay a very large sum for the rent of the racecourse for one day, which I believe comes to something like £100.  Therefore, I think that if a reasonable refund <Col N="1383" /> was made in a case like that it would improve racing very much indeed, and that is my reason for saying that I will have to be absolutely adamant in regard to my claim for a refund of half the money.  If that is not agreed upon, I will be forced to call for a Division. But in view of the fact that many controversial matters are still in abeyance, and that the Minister has stated that he will reconsider the tax on starting-price betting and coursing, I do not think anything would be gained to-day by taking a vote on this.  I believe that on fuller investigation the Minister will drop the tax on coursing altogether, will agree to refund for the increase of stakes half the tax collected on racecourses, and reconsider the 5 per cent tax on any turnover.  As I said last night, I have no doubt at all that he would get a much larger revenue by charging 2½ per cent. than by charging 5 per cent., because a 2½ per cent. tax would probably allow the present starting price betting to continue, while a 5 per cent. tax would reduce it to about half.  I would like to know if there is any possibility of obtaining figures showing what the loss to the Post Office revenue would be if telegrams, telephones and letters in connection with betting were stopped or largely reduced.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Minister is going a considerable distance to meet Deputy Shaw's views, not so much in connection with the improvement of racing as on account of the effect it will have on hunter breeding in Ireland.  I do not agree with what the Minister said about old-stagers at local meetings.  I believe that the local meetings are of the greatest importance, especially because they help hunter breeding.  I do not know much about racing dogs, nor have I any great interest in them, but I believe these coursing matches are a popular form of amusement in the country for people who cannot afford to attend race meetings.  For that reason I think they are a healthy form of sport, and I would be sorry to see the Minister take any steps that would injure them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has struck me in listening to <Col N="1384" /> all these debates is, that we look for grants, and that those of us who are most insistent on getting grants, who boast to the country of having got grants, and believe that we have put the electors under an obligation to us for getting them, do not meet the Minister fairly when he comes to raise the money to meet these grants.  We want the grants but we do not want the taxation. We want to have it both ways, and we want it to go to the country that we got people grants and made a valiant fight to save them from paying taxes.  I do not think that is the way in which this business should be met.  If we want grants we should make up our minds that we will generously meet the taxation.  I am not so much concerned with Deputy Johnson's action in this matter, because the Minister knows the distinction as to the incidence of taxation, which is quite a different thing from all the exemption that is claimed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is only necessary for me to say one word about the argument reiterated by Deputy Redmond: that there is practically no money in racing or in betting, that no new money, or very little, comes into it, that there is a very small pool, and that it is scarcely being fed at all. Deputies will have seen in the newspapers that four hundred bookmakers were willing to pay a licence of £200 per annum if the betting duty were dropped, and it has been suggested that more could be got, that perhaps there would be 500 bookmakers who would be willing to pay £200 per annum.  That means that, apart from the small bookmakers who objected to that proposal altogether, there are about five hundred bookmakers in the country who do a substantial business.  The expenses of a bookmaker in carrying on his business are fairly heavy.  Even the expenses of a bookmaker who does legal betting are fairly heavy, the expenses of travelling to courses and the expenses of clerks and so forth are heavy, and it can hardly be said that bookmakers all live in a state of frugal simplicity, and that a very small income suffices for their personal needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking all these things into account I should say that each of these five <Col N="1385" /> hundred bookmakers, between their own cost of living and their expenses, takes out of racing not than £1,000 per annum, which for these five hundred bookmakers means that £500,000 of new money must be provided each year. I need not pursue the matter at any great length, but there are other draws on the pool which must be met by new money, and I would estimate that the new money per annum that comes into racing is not very far short of £1,000,000, so that when it is suggested that we could not possibly get something like £200,000 I think that is one of those arguments that does not bear investigation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the amount specified here, an excise penalty of £50, can be looked upon as a moderate fine as compared with the fine of £200 in Section 22, but to my mind it is a different matter altogether for a man to go on to a course and receive money in betting without having a licence.  In this case, whether he is a licensed bookmaker or not, if for some reason or other he raises the slightest objection to the Guards visiting his premises for the purpose of getting any documents that they think necessary, he is liable to a penalty of £50.  In comparison with the fine in the other section, I do not think that is right at all.  The section does not say whether the fine is for the first offence, the second or the third offence.  It does not say how much he will have to pay for a second or third offence.  It simply says that on summary conviction thereof he shall be liable to an excise penalty of £50.  I would like to know whether it would be advisable <Col N="1388" /> for the Minister to make this a criminal offence and add to a penalty not exceeding £50 &ldquo;or six months in prison with or without hard labour.&rdquo; To my mind the fine is too great altogether for a first offence.  A man probably may not understand the law or the Act.  He may be a bit excited when the Guards visit his premises. He may have some domestic trouble or he may not be in the best of humour. He may use some offensive words towards the Guards and he is then summoned before a court and fined a sum not exceeding £50.  I know he can be fined as low as £1 or 10/- but the justice can fine him £50 if he wishes.  I think that amount is too great, particularly for a first offence.  The offence may be altogether unintentional and I would like the Minister to accept the amendment to reduce the fine.  That is quite enough as a maximum for the first offence.  I do not mind whether the Minister makes the second offence either £20 or £50 fine, but by this you are giving the justice an opportunity of fining a man £50 for a technical offence.</P>

      <P>In the case of an excise penalty where there is a specific penalty laid down, the Justice has power to mitigate to one-fourth, so that in case a person were convicted the Justice need not fine him in actual practice more than £12 10s.  I think that really a fairly substantial penalty must be imposed on people who would commit the offence dealt with here.  There will be undoubtedly every attempt at evasion and it must be possible for the officers of Customs and Excise or the Gárda Síochána to see the books promptly whenever they require to see them, so that persons who are trying to evade the tax will not have opportunities of making rectifications.</P>

I can see cases where a Justice would come to the conclusion from the evidence that a £50 penalty should be inflicted.  Circumstances could arise that would justify it, and I would not depart from it.  I would like to reduce the minimum to a smaller amount.

He may only impose one-fourth, but if he does it is still very high, as it amounts to £12 10s.  Would it be possible, I wonder, for the Minister to keep the maximum at £50, and to insert words to the effect that for a first offence the fine should not be more than £5?  If that were possible, it would, I think, meet the case.</P>

If the Minister is prepared to agree to the suggestion made, that the minimum fine should be £5, I certainly would have no hesitation in withdrawing the amendment.  I think that for a first offence under this Act the minimum fine should not be more than £5.  It will take a long time before the people get to understand the Act.  People may commit a technical offence, and for such a technical offence the District Justice will be obliged to fine them the minimum amount mentioned by the Minister, namely £12 10s.  They may not be aware that they were committing an offence at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is much danger of people inadvertently committing an offence under this particular section.  There might be other <Col N="1390" /> laws which a person would break without knowing that they were committing an offence, but a person is not going to &ldquo;resist, obstruct or impede an officer of Customs and Excise or a member of the Gárda Síochána&rdquo; from entering their premises or searching for books or documents without being aware that he is doing it.  Neither is a person going to refuse to produce books or documents without being aware that he is committing an offence. If by any chance there was some case where there was an offence inadvertently committed there is, of course, the further power of remission with the Revenue Commissioners.  That is, the District Justice will fine the person £50, but if he thinks the circumstances are suitable and require it, he can mitigate the penalty to £12 10s. If he thinks that it should be further mitigated he can forward a recommendation to the Revenue Commissioners to that effect.  In general, I think there will be very few offences committed under this section that ought not to merit the penalty of £12 10s.  Remember that the refusal to produce a document may enable the person to rectify his books so that he would be able to save himself if he gains a respite of an hour or two. During that hour or two he may so alter his books and documents that he would be able to make away with a very large sum.</P>

      <P>I would just like to say that I cannot agree with the Minister in this.  I think the people who are likely to refuse to produce books and documents will not be the wealthy bookmakers or people with something to lose, but rather the poorer class. Therefore, as Deputy Redmond suggests, a fine of £5 would be a very big sum for a poor man to have to pay. The District Justice who heard the case would have the power to fine him £50.  It is only in cases where certain <Col N="1391" /> excuses are made and where it is a first offence that it is suggested the District Justice should be able to make a recommendation to mitigate to £5.  I think that in this matter the Minister is rather drastic, and that Deputy Redmond's suggestion of a £5 minimum fine is reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says he would not agree, but I am afraid that the proposition inevitably involves that.  I do not know what the law relating to excise penalties may be.  As far as I can gather from the discussion there is no question of a sum not exceeding £50 or £500, as the case may be, but there is a fixed penalty for a definite offence, and what is in fact a kind of appeal to the discretion of the District Justice in respect to mitigation from that fixed penalty.  I gather from the Minister that the mitigation is only exercised in respect of three-fourths, and that it may be reduced to one-fourth.  I suppose that is part of the excise law.  If there is to be an exception made only in reference to this particular offence in respect of the amount allowed to be mitigated, it seems to me to be a wrong way of approaching the question.  If the general desire is that the powers of mitigation should extend to as low as five per cent. of the fixed penalty, then let it be done by a general amendment of the excise law, but not in respect to a particular offence under this section. The argument of Deputy Gorey is clear that he would be prepared even to extend the maximum beyond the £50.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is not prepared to lower that maximum <Col N="1392" /> we should need to alter the general law as well as the powers of the District Justice to mitigate.  I think the Minister has met that point by saying that the power of the District Justice extends beyond a mitigation&mdash;to a recommendation to the Revenue Commissioners still further to remit, and if he were convinced that the offence was a trivial one, that there was no aggravated criminal intent, and that he felt that the sum of í12 10s. was more than sufficient, he would no doubt make a recommendation for a further mitigation. I make the point particularly that if you are going to alter the law relating to the powers of the District Justice respecting the mitigation of penalties, it had better be done in a general way and not by having reference particularly to these offences.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson's suggestion, to my mind, does not hold water, for I do not see why it cannot be stated clearly that the penalty shall not be less than £5 and not more than £50.  The general law as regards mitigation refers to the maximum and not to the minimum.  If it is stated that the minimum shall be £5, well, then the District Justice shall have no power to mitigate; it is only in regard to the maximum that the District Justice has the power.  I cannot see why it should not be perfectly clearly stated that there shall be a penalty of not less than £5 and not more than £50.  In regard to the £5 the District Justice will not have the power to mitigate, but in regard to the £50 he will have the power.  I cannot see any difficulty in the matter, if the Minister so desires.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that a general legal policy has developed with regard to evasion of taxation.  Experience has been operating, and certain general arrangements have been adopted.  These arrangements include something more stringent and something more rigid in the way of penalties than the penalties for normal offences.  I certainly would not desire to depart from the general principles that are applied in connection with other revenue offences.  I would not like to make some special arrangement here for this particular matter which does not exist in regard <Col N="1393" /> to other offences of evading revenue. There is no doubt that, unless there is a fairly stiff penalty, and unless there is a certain amount of rigidity about it, people would be tempted to carry on frauds, and when a person came to inspect their books they would refuse to produce them and would make alterations in them, and then allow them to be inspected on a second demand and pay their penalty.  The District Justice covers a very limited district, and that is one of the reasons why the full discretion in the matter of mitigation is not given to the District Justice, but is given in the last resort to the Revenue Commissioners, so as to get a sort of uniformity, and also to take into account the prevalence of a particular class of revenue offence in particular areas, whether it is spreading over the country or not, and circumstances of that character which are more fully known to the Revenue Commissioners than they would be to the individual District Justices.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;On and after the 1st day of July, 1926, five shillings shall be substituted for £1&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  as the <i>ad valorem</i> stamp duty imposed by sections one hundred <Col N="1395" /> and twelve and one hundred and thirteen of the Stamp Act, 1891, as extended by section twelve of the Finance Act, 1896, on statements as regards the capital of the companies referred to in those sections; and</P>
    <P>(b)  as the <i>ad valorem</i> stamp duty payable under or by virtue of any private Act on any statements as regards the capital of any company; and</P>
    <P>(c)  as the <i>ad valorem</i> stamp duty imposed by section eleven of the Limited Partnerships Act, 1907, on statements with regard to the amounts contributed by limited partners to limited partnerships.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The object of this is to enable companies to be registered here at the cost of 5/- per cent. instead of as at present £1 per cent.  This stamp duty, or capital duty, was originally 2/- per £100 for nominal capital.  That was in the Stamp Act of 1891.  Then it was increased to 5/-in the Finance Act of 1899, and in 1920 the capital duty imposed by the Act of 1891 and the Act of 1899, as well as the capital duty payable under any private Act, under the Limited Partnerships Act of 1897, was increased to £1.  This was done in 1920, as was a great deal of our taxation, for war purposes.  I think the Minister is already conversant with the feelings of a great many commercial people in the Saorstát with regard to the proposed reduction.  The advantage to the State would be that it would facilitate companies in registering here. It would be an inducement for companies with Irish prospects, and probably with Irish capital, to register in the Saorstát instead of registering as a great many of them do at present in Great Britain.  Take, for instance, the case of Messrs. Guinness, a great Irish concern, and yet it is a registered British company.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister knows a little about it, and I said that originally.  I presume it would be beneficial, but I do not presume to speak for Messrs. Guinness.  I wish by reason of possession of their shares I was able to do so.  I am only giving Guinness as an instance where it would be an inducement&mdash;I do not say for a moment whether it would&mdash; for them to register here instead of in Great Britain.  The advantage to the Government of the Saorstát, and to the Saorstát itself, by their registering here, or by any other company registering here, is to be found in the duties that would accrue to the Free State Exchequer which now accrue to the Exchequer of Great Britain. Perhaps I will make myself clearer when I say, supposing a person has shares in a concern&mdash;I will take Guinness again&mdash;and he is resident in the Saorstát and he died here, the death duties are payable not to the Saorstát but to the British Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am suggesting that if the company were registered here it would mean that the duties would be payable here instead, and furthermore, it would give an impetus&mdash;I do not say that it would immediately mean that you would have a great crop of companies growing up to-morrow morning, but it will, at any rate, be some sort of an inducement&mdash;to commercial people to form companies in the Saorstát and register here instead of elsewhere.  Besides that it would mean that these death duties payable now to the country in which the company is registered would accrue and be payable to our own exchequer. If that were so I think it <Col N="1397" /> would be a substantial advantage.  I put down this amendment for the special purpose of hearing what the Minister has to say and I hope he will give us some information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment.  I do not think it would give us any advantage and it would mean an immediate loss of £15,000 a year.  The Deputy talks about Guinness's.  If we thought a company like that would come over, if we had any grounds to think they would be prepared to register here instead of England, we would go further than the amendment proposed, but there is not the slightest possibility of that.  It is really misleading to refer to the case of Guinness's in this particular connection. So far as death duties are concerned we can get the advantages in another way.  The position at present is that if a person domiciled in the Saorstát holds shares in Guinness's those shares are subject to double taxation. They are taxed in Great Britain because they are property situated there, and the company is registered and controlled in Great Britain, and they are then taxed here because they are the property of persons domiciled here, so in practice the tax is divided, but if the firm of Guinness had a colonial register situated here in which the shares held in Ireland were registered, then the shares would be situated here where the colonial register was, and we would get all the death duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We propose to take steps, where a firm carries on business here and has Irish shareholders, that it shall be necessary to have a register here for these shares.  This is a matter that has been under consideration for some time. Unfortunately, it has not been possible yet to deal with the matter, but I may say if we had been able to take action before this it would have meant £160,000 for the Exchequer in the case of a recent death.  We can get the results that are desired for the Exchequer by proceeding with the necessary measures to ensure that a company doing business here and having Free State shareholders shall have <Col N="1398" /> a register here, but there are disadvantages to the Exchequer in encouraging&mdash;that is passing away from the question of big companies or companies already existing&mdash;the formation of numerous small companies.  The whole question of the administration of death duties is really made more difficult by the setting up of those companies. The people who turn their businesses into limited liability companies secure a definite advantage, and I do not think the registration fee charged at present is too heavy for the advantages which individuals get by turning their businesses into limited liability companies, and I would not be inclined to accept the amendment.  It would mean an immediate loss, and we would not get by it what we may get by other means.</P>

      <P>I am glad I put down this amendment, because I am more than pleased to hear that the Minister has in mind a proposition whereby he will insist on companies registering in some shape or form in this country, and thereby enable the Exchequer to reap a certain amount of benefit. Probably, as he said, that would have reaped within the last few months a great benefit by death duty.  The Minister does not like small things, not only small meetings, but small companies, but however that may be, I think the purpose of my amendment has been sufficiently met by the assurance, which I welcome, that he has considered the position of the Free State in regard to those death duties, and I hope he will soon be able to bring in the proposals he has already spoken of.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:</P>
      <P>Before Section 36 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The following exemption shall be substituted for exemption number (6)  under the heading &lsquo;Receipt given for, or upon the payment of, money amounting to two pounds or upwards&rsquo; in the First Schedule to the Stamp Act, 1891:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(6)  Receipt given for or on account of any salary, pay or wages, or for or on account of any other like payment made to or for the benefit of any person, being the holder of an office or an employee, in respect of his office or employment, or for or on account of money paid in respect of any pension, superannuation allowance, compassionate allowance or other like allowance.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Under the Stamps Act of 1891 a receipt stamp is required on receipts for wages, salaries and all such allowances over £2, but I am sure the Minister knows well that that section of the Act is not generally observed.  The fact, at the moment, is that only public servants pay receipt stamp duty.  The Minister knows, I am sure, that the section is being evaded and ignored by those in outside employment.  Public servants are the people who are now left to pay receipt stamp duty under this particular Act.  That duty operates, I think, rather unfairly.  An officer who is paid monthly affixes only 12 stamps yearly, and an officer who is paid weekly affixes 52 stamps, so that the poorest paid officer has to pay most frequently.  Relief has already been given from this duty in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and I suggest that the Minister should give similar relief here and remove an anomaly which exists between public servants and outside employees.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment about which I cannot say that I feel very strongly.  I admit that there is something in what the Deputy says. The amount involved would not be very large, and, so far as Government employees are concerned, it would be about £5,000 or £6,000 per annum.  It is difficult for us to estimate what the effect would be in regard to outside employees. Undoubtedly, Government employees are not the only people who pay this duty.  Others pay it, but I am not in a position to have any firm estimate. It may possibly run up to about £10,000.  I do not think, without conducting an investigation that would be disproportionately costly, it would be possible to get a fair estimate of what the total cost of the concession would be.  As regards Government employees, they, at any rate, entered the Government employment knowing that this particular stamp duty would be required of them.  If they have to pay it when other people have not, many of them have certain alvantages in being in Government employment, and, perhaps, the matter is equalised in that way.  In any case it would mean, so far as the Government services is concerned, a loss of between £5,000 and £6,000 a year.  As I say, it would mean giving some little advantage to people which they had no reason to expect when they entered the service, and, as their conditions are somewhat different, they have no reason to expect that, because outside employees are not obliged to pay it, they should not have to pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's defence of this little tax is in line with his statement of last year on the same subject.  I had hoped that after twelve months' cogitation and &ldquo;wet-towelling&rdquo; he would have arrived at a right conclusion on the matter.  He says that the Government employees, when entering the Government service, knew that this tax was to be charged, and, therefore, that they are at no disadvantage when it is charged.  If there is any justice in assuming that Government employees entered the Government service with that knowledge, one can say that the law is applicable to <Col N="1401" /> all persons whether in Government employment or outside.  It is when the Government employee finds that he is being singled out in this respect that the irritant arises.  The amount is not tremendous.  I think it is 8/8 a year for the weekly wage earner.  That is a consideration, and in practice, whatever the law may be, there is a distinction in the singling out of Government employees for the payment of this duty. That has been recognised in Great Britain, where the law has been adjusted with the facts.  Five or six thousand pounds a year is a consideration, but 8/8 is a much greater consideration to an individual than is five or six thousands pounds a year to the State.  If only on the grounds on which the Minister conceded Deputy Redmond's plea, the saving of printing year after year, it would be well to consider the remission of this tax.  It is a small one, but it is an irritant, and it is a pity to allow that irritant to remain.</P>

      <P>The Minister based his case on the civil servant as against the post office employee who is paid weekly.  The Minister appears to think that every post office employee is in a very enviable position.  I want to remind the Minister that men who receive £2 5s., £2 10s., £2 15s., or £3 a week pay 8/8 a year, and, comparing that employee in the post office with an outside employee, I do not think that the latter has anything to covet.  There might be something in the case of an officer in the Civil Service who is paid £600 or £700 a year, but I maintain that the Minister has made no case that the people to whom I refer, the weekly wage earners, should pay this imposition when those in outside employment do not pay it.  The Minister gets his income tax regularly from the Government servants, as they have no escape. I think that he should grant this relief, which has already been granted in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. As he has given no concession this year in his Budget statement, I think he could reasonably accept this amendment. In any event, the cost of printing this amendment year after year until it is accepted will more than outweigh any loss to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>This amendment is not trivial in the sense that Deputy Redmond's amendment was trivial. Deputy Redmond's amendment involved £80 a year.  That, I think, could rightly be described as trivial, when dealing with taxation.  This amendment involves somewhat more. I do not feel that I have a very cast-iron case against it.  On the other hand, I do not think there is a very good case for it.  Government employees are not the only people affected in this way.  There are probably as many other people affected, outside Government employees, though we could not be sure of the number. Consequently, there is no definite discrimination against Government employees. Certain employers, by adopting different methods of paying wages, avoid the necessity for this stamp.  We might sacrifice £10,000 a year&mdash;we would certainly sacrifice £5,000 or £6,000&mdash;by adopting this amendment, and we would not give any great relief to anybody.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider raising the amount of wages for which a stamp would be required to, say, £5 per week, and deal with the matter from that point of view?  There would, I think, be a considerable outcry if this tax of 8/8 were imposed by way of income tax on an income of, say, £2 5s. per week.  If thought of in terms of income tax, it is a considerable sum comparatively.  If the Minister is not prepared to give it away entirely, perhaps he would give consideration to the question of fixing the wage-sum at some figure over £2 per week on which it would be required.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment, which is perhaps rather obscure, is to apply the exemption which is given to taxi-cabs of Ford make, registered as such before 21st April, to all vehicles licensed to ply as taxi-cabs&mdash;that they all pay a flat rate of £12, which is, I understand, the rate they were paying until the introduction of the Finance Bill.  I put forward the plea that we should retain the taxation on these taxi-cabs at a flat rate on two grounds. One is the convenience of the public. <Col N="1406" /> It is better, in many ways, that the driver of a taxi-cab licensed for hire should keep a second-hand car of a better type and quality, rather than that he should be invited and encouraged by the Minister to keep a second-hand Ford which, in its later stages, is not the most comfortable or the most accommodating of vehicles.  As matters stand, the better the type and quality of the taxi-cab the higher the tax the driver will have to pay.  I do not think that is entirely in the public interest.  It is not as if there was discrimination. It is not as if a man with a good car plying for hire could earn more than the man plying for hire with a cheap car.  When you go to the hazard, you have to take the first taxi-cab there.  You are not enabled, as a rule, to pick and choose.  The man with the good car is not in a position to earn more than the man with a bad car.  Therefore, I suggest that it is not quite fair to ask him to pay taxation at a higher rate.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I make the plea on account of the position of the man himself.  These owners of taxi-cabs&mdash; there is not a very large number of them&mdash;would have sunk their savings in a comfortable car, when embarking on business, in the belief that their rate of taxation would be under £12. The sliding scale proposed by the Minister will raise that rate of taxation in many cases to £14 and in some cases to £16 or £20.  On a man who is not a rich man, and whose fares are limited by the police authority, such an increase in taxation does mean a substantial loss.  On the other hand, I do not think the loss to the Revenue by the change suggested would be very great.  I do not think in equity that there is any real claim to increase further the revenue from this source. The taxi-cabs licensed on the conditions laid down in this Schedule use the roads in the towns principally.  It is comparatively seldom that they go into the country.  This taxi-cab is not a particularly heavy vehicle, and it is not, as a rule, a particularly speedy vehicle.  It does not wear out the roads to any excessive or disproportionate extent.  In view of the fact that the amount of revenue involved is comparatively <Col N="1407" /> small, the Minister might reasonably make some concession in this direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Deputy in his appeal to the Minister.  Deputies may not be aware that there are two types of taxi.  There is the garage taxi, which one rings up for, and there is the street taxi.  The owner of the ordinary street taxi has his fares limited by police regulations.  A definite scale is laid down.  The garage taxi has not its fares limited in the same way.  That class of taxi can charge the public so as to make up for this increase, whereas the street taxi cannot do so.  The fares for the street taxi were fixed by police regulations, and sanctioned, I think, by Judge Dromgoole.  Some of these street taxi-owners bought a big type of second-hand car, the tax on which is now likely to be raised from the flat rate of £12 to a sum of £20.  That is practically an increase of £8, while the driver is allowed nothing to play with but has to charge according to the scale fixed by police regulations.  There are not, I understand, many of these cars that will have to pay the increased rate, but at least some of them will.  I think it is unfair that these men should have the taxation charge increased while their fares remain the same.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister might meet the point made by Deputy Cooper and see these men with cars not benefited by the Act&mdash;these owners of street taxis&mdash; should not be in the position of having this licence duty increased upon them while they have no right to increase their fares.  It will only mean that those men with higher-power engine cars on the street will have to apply to the authorities for a revision of the fares already sanctioned and that, eventually, the public will have to pay. The new conditions are a great hardship upon those men.  It will mean in some cases increases of £4, £5, or £6, and, possibly, in other cases an increase of from £12 to £20, as the rates are now fixed.  Considering the small amount involved to the revenue, I think the Minister might well give way to the appeal made to him by Deputy Cooper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, I think, desirable that we should get away from the special rates charged for hackney cars. The existence of a special rate for hackneys has always caused difficulty &mdash;in the country especially.  We have had cars registered as hackneys by all sorts of people who never used them as hackneys.  To get convictions is difficult.  It is not easy to deal with a person who avoids paying the tax he ought to pay by registering his vehicle as a taxi.  That is one of the main reasons why we came to the conclusion that hackney cars ought to pay the ordinary duty on private cars.  I would not be inclined to agree to the amendment.  Certain street drivers will probably gain a little by being charged as for private cars.  Some of them now paying £12 will, under the new conditions, only pay £11.  In general, I think the new payment will probably be £14.  Some few will go up to £16, and there may be a very few who will go up to a higher rate.</P>
      <P>It would be very easy to make too much of the argument that when these people bought the cabs they have they thought they would have to pay a particular rate of duty and that it is unfair and harsh to ask them to pay more now.  The probability is that when they bought their cars the roads were not in anything like as good condition as they are now.  The difference in the extra duty will be more than made up to these people by saving on tyres following the improvement in the roads.  If we liked to argue the matter out, I think it could fairly be said that because of the improvements that have been made in the roads and because of the further improvements it is proposed to make in the roads by enabling the Minister for Local Government to borrow a sum of £2,000,000, these people will be more than recouped for any loss that they will sustain from increased duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these increases were suggested for the purpose of increasing the income of the Road Fund, and so make it possible for the Road Fund to borrow some sum like this £2,000,000 for the permanent improvement of the roads more rapidly than would be possible if the income of the fund had been simply expended from year to <Col N="1409" /> year.  It is fair that the taxi-cab drivers, who do perhaps use the roads more than anybody else, should make some little contribution towards the improvement which will save them considerably in the actual maintenance cost of their cars.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I was careful to state the purpose of my amendment, because I was not entirely satisfied with its drafting.  I think the Minister has taken his argument on too general a ground.  As far as private owners registering their cars as hackneys and evading taxation, that seems to me a matter for the licensing authority.  If that authority has been lax, it can be made to take this matter more seriously.  I would like to narrow the argument down to taxi-cabs licensed to ply for hire in Dublin.  They are in a position which other taxi-cabs are not in.  They have a fixed scale of fares, regulated by taximeters.  They cannot increase those fares, whatever increased charges they have to pay themselves.  That is not the position of taxi-cabs which work from garages.  They can increase the scale of their charges.  It is said that it is open to the city taxi-cab owners to agitate for permission to increase their fares, but I think, on the whole, that would cause a great waste of time, and would involve trouble and considerable expense on the part of those men who have taxis in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accept the point made by the Minister with regard to the use of the roads.  These taxi-cabs for the most part ply in Dublin and the neighbouring towns, and they derive comparatively small advantage from the Road Fund.  And rightly so, because the roads in and near the city were not in such a bad condition as to need it. This £2,000,000 Road Fund is not going to advantage the taxi-cab driver except possibly when he goes to Punchestown or Fairyhouse.  When going on such journeys as these one does not usually take a taxi-cab on the street if you can help it, because they are not very satisfactory for such journeys, and the taxi-cab driver does not want to go because the scale of fares is not too generous for long journeys.  City taxis will <Col N="1410" /> derive little or no benefit practically from that £2,000,000.  They will derive benefit from the street improvements effected by the Dublin Corporation, but these improvements are paid for out of the rates.  I do not think the Minister met my case fairly.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I do not think the Minister met me fairly on this point.  I would like to remind him that by putting this additional tax on the best type of car he will be penalising the man who has had a little vision and enterprise and who was prepared to sink a little more capital in order to give a better service to his patrons.  Perhaps the Minister would examine this question before the Report Stage and see if it is not possible to meet the case of the taxi-drivers. We are not asking him to sacrifice a great deal of revenue.  The taxi-drivers in Dublin deserve this concession, and I think it is a case in which the Minister might reasonably give way in order to avoid hardship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what has been said by Deputy Cooper on this matter.  The opposition of the Minister is based entirely upon the assumption that the taxi-cab owners will be benefited by the expenditure out of the Road Fund on the country roads and on the fact that there was evasion whereby other cars, by registration as hackney-cars, got the benefit accruing to real hackney-cars.  That does not at all meet the case of the licensed hackney-car whose fare is fixed by an automatic taximeter.</P>
      <P>I desire to add my plea that that particular class of car in connection with which charges are fixed by regulations of public authorities and by the mechanical means of the taximeter should come under the duty of £12. The case is one of very great importance to men who are doing a good service and are making a living by a useful occupation.  This is going to be a pretty heavy burden upon them, and I hope the Minister will agree to the proposition in general and find some formula which would allow him to relieve these men in the city and the townships around Dublin of the increased charge upon their earnings which this proposal involves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support a plea made by Deputy Cooper for some concession for these taxi-drivers who ply for hire on the streets of Dublin. I know from experience that taxi-driving is not a lucrative occupation. The maintenance of a car, expenditure on petrol and oil, and the need of keeping the car in such a condition that it will periodically receive the approval of the police authorities, involves a lot of money.  I know that taxi-drivers are out from 10 o'clock in the morning until 10, 11 and 12 o'clock at night endeavouring to make sufficient to give them a fair wage and provide the essentials to keep their cars running. About 90 per cent. of the taxi-cabs on the Dublin streets are owned by the people driving them.  With the exception of one or two firms that have taxi-cabs plying for hire, the individuals who drive own the remainder of the cabs, and they rely on the cabs as a means of livelihood.  It would be unfair to put these people in the position of having to pay an increased charge for licences.</P>
      <P>The Minister has mentioned that these people would receive benefit in the way of improved roads which would be provided for by the taxation received under the section.  The men driving the Ford car will also benefit by an improvement in the roads.  The benefit will not be confined solely to the men paying £14, £16, or £18; it will be universal.  If the driver of the Ford car derives benefit from improved roads without having to pay such a high licence fee, I think it is only just that the licence in the case of taxi-drivers should be reduced to the Ford car level.  The amount of revenue involved as far as Dublin City and the surrounding townships are concerned would be small.  In the case of taxi-drivers the fares are fixed by court. The Minister should accede to the plea to give exceptional and preferential treatment to taxi-drivers in Dublin City and County.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an amendment standing in the name of Deputy Good which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 5 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Part I of the Second Schedule to the Principal Act shall have effect and be construed as if the words &ldquo;erected by any persons&rdquo; together with the figures &ldquo;£45,&rdquo;&ldquo;£60,&rdquo; and &ldquo;£75&rdquo; had been omitted, and the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; had been inserted before the word &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; in the second paragraph, also that the figures &ldquo;£60,&rdquo;&ldquo;£80&rdquo; and &ldquo;£100&rdquo; had been deleted and the figures &ldquo;£75,&rdquo;&ldquo;£75,&rdquo;&ldquo;£75,&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
      <P>I imagine that the purport of the new section will be more familiar to the President than it is to me.  But obviously it is in furtherance of the claim that Deputy Good has always made for more consideration for small houses and to express the greater need of small houses in connection with this Bill than there is for five-roomed houses or four-roomed houses.  I think he has already expressed himself fully and his views are familiar to the Deputies, and no doubt the President will say whether he is prepared to accept or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hewat is right in saying that Deputy Good has consistently supported the case for the provision of three-roomed houses&mdash;I do not know that it would be right to say <Col N="1420" /> as against&mdash;but as a better means perhaps of solving the housing problem. That view is not accepted, I think, generally.  Within the last 15 years a considerable advance has been made in the standard of houses provided under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.  I think about 15 years ago in the case of one local authority, perhaps the most advanced in connection with the provision of housing, there was a general understanding that they would not depart from the standard of three-roomed houses for the future.  I believe that in one case they did, but it was only in a small number of dwellings.  The amendment really provides a premium for the erection of three-roomed houses. If carried, it would mean that a subsidy by the Government and the local authority in connection with the provision of houses would be limited to a sum of £75 in respect of five-roomed houses.  The case for this amendment has been made on many occasions by Deputy Good, and on fairly safe grounds and on fairly sound foundations. That is that we cannot afford to provide four and five-roomed houses.  I think that is really the basis of his contention and I think the Oireachtas would certainly suffer very considerable criticism if it were to say that we were satisfied with a three-roomed house or that it was all that we considered desirable.  We would not exactly go that far but very near it.  Now from the moral standpoint practically every person qualified to speak has laid it down that no house should be provided through the agency of public funds containing less than three rooms.  That means that in a family in which there are boys and girls there is separate accommodation in separate rooms for the sexes, and the parents then have to sleep in the living room. The living room is the room most used in all these small houses, and it is at that point that all persons interested in sanitation come in and they object to having the living room used as a sleeping apartment, that it is not healthy.  We are driven then to the four-roomed house, where the living-room need not be used as a sleeping apartment, and there are <Col N="1421" /> separate bedrooms for the parents and the children of both sexes.</P>
      <P>The next point to be considered is, what house is the most economic to build from the point of view of the money spent?  Recently a rather important local authority received tenders at the following rates for the erection of houses: Three-roomed house, £358; four-roomed house, £426; five-roomed house, £550.  In the case of the five-roomed house I believe a bath was to be provided.  Deducting the maximum subsidy provided, it will be seen that in the case of the three-roomed house the cost was approximately £100 per room; in the case of the four-roomed house, £86 10s., and in the case of the five-roomed house about £90.  From that it would appear that the three-roomed house is an expensive house to build.  The cost per room is a vital consideration, and taking that along with the objections from the point of view of morality and sanitation, I think there is a good case for the provision of the four-roomed and the five-roomed house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we go a step further and take the difference between the cost of the three-roomed and the four-roomed house&mdash;I think it is about £68&mdash;allowing for the subsidy, it will be found that it runs to about £50 per house.  Assessing that £50 at 8 per cent., which I think is looked upon as the normal outgoing in respect of building, it will be found that something like 1/7 per week would pay the rent of the additional room.  Having regard to that fact, I think there is a very good case for the four-roomed house.  I think there are very few people at present living in a three-roomed house who would not be willing to pay 1/7 per week more in order to get a four-roomed house. The difference between a four-roomed and a five-roomed house would be much the same.  The five-roomed house has the advantage that a little parlour is provided, and it has been represented to the Local Government Department and to various local authorities that the provision of such an apartment is a decided advantage.  If there was no competition for the occupation of five-roomed houses, or if a big effort had to be made by people occupying them <Col N="1422" /> to meet the rent or to acquire them on the instalment system, there might be a case for considering this amendment. But, on the whole, I would not like to take the responsibility of accepting it.</P>
    <P>While saying that, I admit at once that the time may come when the State and the local authorities may not be able to afford to provide the larger houses, even for large families, but having regard to the great success which has attended the working of the Housing Acts, I think we would not be justified in withdrawing from the four-roomed and five-roomed houses the advantages that they received under the Acts of 1924 and 1925.  I have not been able to get the number of three-roomed, four-roomed and five-roomed houses constructed up to date, but I have the figures in one case, where 2,306 houses were provided.  Of these, 1,945 were five-roomed; 174 four-roomed; 124 three-roomed, and 67 two-roomed. I will finish by saying that if I had any responsibility for providing houses I would not provide two-roomed houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Good is not here to fight his own battle, but in his absence I must endeavour to speak for him as well as I can, knowing as I do his views on the matter. The President, naturally, dealt with this amendment largely from the economic point of view&mdash;that it is certainly very desirable from the point of view of those building houses, whether private investors or local authorities, to get the best possible house built. He is undoubtedly right in saying that is a sound, economic proposition; but, on the other hand, we have to consider what the position is to-day.  I am told on good authority that the Artisans' Dwellings Company, who build two-roomed, three-roomed, and four roomed houses, have at present a thousand applications on their books for two-roomed or three-roomed houses. The essence of the housing problem is to provide the greatest possible number of houses to suit the greatest number of people.  The great question to be considered is whether the people can pay an economic rent for the houses erected.  Therefore, while we <Col N="1423" /> should proceed up to a certain point with the provision of five-roomed houses, it has been demonstrated clearly that in many cases the incentive to a person to take a five-roomed house is not to get a five-roomed house for himself, but to get accommodation for himself and, by sub-letting, bring down the cost of the house to himself. That is a growing evil and must be recognised.  So far the effort has not been in the direction of providing the greatest number of houses.</P>
      <P>The President says the State should not take the responsibility of providing three-roomed houses.  Is that right? We are moving in the direction of decontrol. We are coming to the time when men with money to invest in housing and with an inclination to build must be enabled to build houses and provide for the wants of the people.  Is it fair to ask such persons to provide three-roomed houses which the local authorities and the Government say should not be erected because they are not an economic proposition? I say it is not.  The burden that is borne to-day by the local authorities and the State in this matter cannot very well be carried by the private individual. I think the State and the local authorities should aim at providing the man who cannot afford a five-roomed house with a house which he can afford, and let those who can afford a five-roomed house depend more on the initiative of private builders to provide houses for them.</P>
      <P>I controvert the view held by the President in this matter.  Deputy Good's amendment indicates that while three-room houses should not be built to an unlimited extent, they would be better for the people than one-room tenements and better than five-room houses with three of the rooms sub-let. They would also be better for people who are least able to provide houses for themselves, and who are not able to pay the rents asked for five-room houses.  That class has a greater claim for reasonable assistance than those in more or less fashionable localities where five-room houses are erected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the pleasure of an interview recently with a prominent member of <Col N="1424" /> the Drogheda Corporation and he informed me that the housing programme there had come to a halt owing to the short periods for which money could be borrowed.  At the same time he said they were not providing houses for those who really needed them.  While the President was right in what he said, from the æsthetic point of view, I think from the economic point of view he was wrong.  Taking the position as we find it to-day, I think it is wrong to persist in giving the same bonus for the erection of a five-room house as is given for smaller houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the motives that actuated Deputy Good in putting down this amendment I must say that I take the President's view. The three-room house is a poor remedy for the situation that exists.  I agree that it brings a house within the means of the people, but from the public health point of view it is unwise and a danger.  There is also the question of the proper division of the sexes. That cannot be provided in a three-room house.  Wherever the money is to be found an effort should be made to provide four-room houses.  Otherwise there will be no proper segregation of the sexes.  I believe that these four-room houses are most wanted in the cities and in the large urban areas. The rural areas have been pretty well provided for, so that any money that is to be raised should be spent on providing houses for those poor people who, I think, were described by Deputy Good as the casual labourer class.  I appreciate the hesitancy of the President in accepting any proposal to erect three-room houses as I think they would be too dear at any price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>So that there may be no misunderstanding I should say that the Schedule as it stands provides for a subsidy of £60 for three-room houses erected by a local authority or by a public utility society; £80 for a four-room house, and £100 for a house with not less than 5 rooms.  For private persons a subsidy of £45 is provided for a three-room house; £60 for a four-room house, and £75 for a five-room house.  The amendment proposes to insert £75 as the subsidy for a three-room house, £75 for a four-room house, <Col N="1425" /> and £75 as a subsidy for a five-room house, making the sum equal in the case of a private person and a local authority.  As far as the difference in the two proposals is concerned, it means that £15 of an additional subsidy would be given in the case of a three-room house.  Already a large number of three-room houses have been constructed, and a considerable number of four-room houses.</P>
      <P>I think it is due to the Local Government Department to say that the houses in Drogheda mentioned by Deputy Hewat were built to a plan furnished by the housing section of the Department. They were four-room houses and cost, approximately, £270, £70 being given as a subsidy.  These four-room houses cost, approximately, £200 and are fairly good value.  I agree that more three-room houses are required, and I am satisfied that a fair subsidy is provided under the Bill for such houses.  The difference between the proposal in the Bill and the amendment that Deputy Good has put down, is that where we propose to give a £20 subsidy per room, Deputy Good would give £25 in a three-room house; where we gave £20 per room in a four-room house he would give £18 15s., and where we give £20 per room for a five-room house he would give only £15.  I am satisfied if Deputy Good were here he would not get the Dáil to agree that the proposal he makes is one that could be accepted.</P>

      <P>I have already made known my views respecting the proposition that preference should be given to the building of three-room houses as against houses with four or five rooms. Deputy Good's amendment is clearly intended to give preference to the building of three-room houses as against four or five-room houses.  Of course the effect would be that only three-room houses would be built, because the subsidy is proportionately so much greater per £ expended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, we have had certain figures given to us by the President as to the relative costs, and if the same amount is to be paid per house for the three-roomed house as for the five-roomed <Col N="1426" /> house, knowing that the three-roomed house costs considerably less than the five-roomed house, it is obvious that the subsidy is greater proportionately per £100 for the smaller house than for the larger.  That is a clear advantage to the builder, and an encouragement for that class of building from the point of view of the builder.  It is right and necessary that regard should be had to the economic effects, but we must, as the President said, give very great consideration to the social and moral effects of the several propositions, and I think that the judgment upon this matter will depend upon how much weight one is giving to the mere economic proposition from the point of view of whoever is building, whether a private person or a public authority, or the weight that you will give to the social consequences&mdash;not merely the immediate social consequences, but the consequences affecting the family and the neighbourhood at any time until that house is razed to the ground, and even after that. You have got to look twenty years ahead in this matter, and if we go deliberately out of our way and encourage three-roomed houses to be built in the city and surroundings, as opposed to four and five-roomed houses, then we, as I think, will be disregarding the social consequences and disregarding the moral values.  As I said the other day, we have to think not merely of the newly-married couple taking a house, but we have to consider the possibilities of family life in ten or fifteen years' time, and that to me is so great a consideration that I am glad to hear the President say that he does not look with favour upon this amendment. I would be better pleased if I felt confident that he would not in the near future accede to a proposition of this kind.  I think that the President is not definitely strong enough on the matter. Nevertheless I appreciate the position that he takes in regard to this amendment. I hope that the House will agree with him and will not agree to give a preferential subsidy to the three-roomed house as against the four-roomed house and the five-roomed house.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to see that the President has no intention of accepting this amendment.  To local authorities the grants for three, four and five-roomed houses are £60, £80 and £100, and it is proposed that a local authority which is prepared to build a good class house, the usual four-roomed house, is to be deprived of £5 of the subsidy.  I think it would be most unfair to local authorities to deprive them of part of the subsidy if they are prepared to build this good class of house. It also applies to rural areas, because it mentions &ldquo;any person.&rdquo;  In rural areas you would have everyone building three-roomed houses and getting the £75 grant, and you would find in a short time after the grant is paid every kind of annex put on to these houses.  That, I think, would not be a benefit.  If the amendment were accepted you would not be improving housing conditions in any way while you would still be paying out State money.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I had to be in another place when this discussion started.  One of the points that influenced me in trying to get an equal grant for all houses, whether three, four or five-roomed, is that the principle advocated in the amendment is exactly the principle adopted on the other side, where the subsidy is identical, whether the house is a three, four or five-roomed one.  The result is that private individuals and local authorities are in a position to build whatever class of house suits the locality.  There may be cases where the five-roomed house is, in the opinion of the people of the locality, the proper house for that locality.  In such a case under this amendment they are placed at no disadvantage whatever.  If in other areas it is thought that a four-roomed house is the proper one, they are at no disadvantage.</P>

      <P>No, not under my amendment, which would mean £75 for each of them.  I mean that if the amendment were adopted we would be on all fours with the position in Great Britain to-day where there is no priority, and individuals are free, and that <Col N="1428" /> is exactly what we want.  The Government will agree that there are cases where it is highly desirable to have three-roomed houses.  Deputy Johnson caters for nobody except the aristocrat of labour with a large family.  That may appear a strong statement, but can you show me an unskilled labourer to-day who is able to afford a rent of anything from 15/- to 20/- a week for a five-roomed house?  It is only the well-to-do tradesman who can afford it, and that is the class of man you are catering for.  The result is that the other unfortunate man, who should have as good a claim on the State as the well-to-do man, is not catered for at all.  In other words, Deputy Johnson is advocating legislation for a class.  That is what his point amounts to in substance.  He will himself admit that only the well-to-do man can afford to pay the rent of a five-roomed house.  Is it fair that those who form the larger proportion of the population should remain untouched and uncatered for by a measure of this kind?  All I ask is that where the local authority is satisfied that it is desirable to erect a number of three-roomed houses they should not thereby be in any worse position, that there should not be this argument: &ldquo;We will get a larger subsidy for a five-roomed house and therefore we will only erect five-roomed houses.&rdquo;  What is the position to-day?  You may divide the people concerned into three classes, people who are anxious to get married, a widow, possibly, with a couple of daughters, and a married man with a large family.  These are the three principal sub-divisions of the classes of tenants as we find them to-day.  If the local authority is confined to a five-roomed house&mdash;because that is practically what this Bill means&mdash;it is only catering for one of these three sections. The newly married man does not want a five-roomed house.  It is an incubus. It puts a burden on him that in many cases is highly undesirable.  It produces sub-letting, because in order to get accommodation he is forced to take more accommodation than he wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the President in his opening statement gave us the figures he promised to give us in regard to Dublin for the last four or five years.  He was to give the number of <Col N="1429" /> three-roomed, four-roomed and five-roomed houses that had been erected by the local authority, but I am quite satisfied from what I know of these figures that they will show that a very much higher proportion of five-roomed houses were built than any other class.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a total of 2,306 houses built, made up of 1,940 five-roomed houses, 175 four-roomed houses, 124 three-roomed and 67 two-roomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I thought; practically all the houses erected in recent years are five-roomed houses. Having done so much for one class of the community, it is highly desirable that something should be done for other sections of the community.  As I say, the Bill as it stands gives a decided preference and a decided leaning in favour of the larger house as against the smaller house.  The idea underlying this amendment is that the local authority should be quite free to erect the particular type of house that it finds most suitable for the applicants. It gives no priority to one particular type of house over any other type of house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said so much on that point, there is just one other aspect of the question that I would like to touch upon very briefly.  In this amendment, it is proposed to do away with the first part of the Schedule.  The first part of the Schedule deals with private individuals. Why a private individual who erects a house or a series of houses should get less encouragement from the State than the local authority is a conundrum I have never been able to solve.  It does not exist on the other side, except in certain areas known as agricultural areas, which are not touched by this Bill at all.  From the point of view of the State, if we are anxious to get houses, why handicap, because really that is what it amounts to, the private individual?  We want houses.  It is a matter of indifference as to whether they are erected by private individuals or local authorities. That is what I aimed at in this amendment&mdash;to put them exactly on the same lines.  Under this proposal the private individual will get exactly the same as <Col N="1430" /> the local authority.  That, as I said, would be a decided advantage, because from the figures I gave the other day, evidently private individuals here are not doing as much at all as they are on the other side.</P>
    <P>As I said, one-third of the houses erected on the other side last year were erected by private individuals without any State subsidy of any kind.  We want to encourage private individuals &mdash;this amendment, which is a two-fold amendment, has that as one of its objects&mdash;to come forward and do more than they have done.  The 1925 Act does not do that.  Under Schedule No. 2 of the 1925 Act, the subsidy given to private individuals on the three different classes of houses is approximately 25 per cent. less than given to local authorities.  Why that should be, I could never understand.  Possibly the President can explain it, but seeing what has been done on the other side, I would be strongly in favour of giving more encouragement to private individuals to come forward and to take their part in this burden of providing houses. As I said, this is the object I had in putting down the amendment&mdash;first of all to give no priority in favour of the three-room, four-room or five-room house.  Let the individual or the local authority build whichever is most needed.  I think the amendment would achieve that.  I hope the amendment will achieve something also in the way of encouraging private individuals to do more in the future than they have done in the past, and that it will not put them in a worse position than the local authority.</P>

      <P>The Housing Act of 1925 was the principal Act, and the present amending Bill is, in the best sense of the term, an amending Bill, because it develops the excellences of the principal Act.  There are two elements constituting the amendment of Deputy Good.  One is that he regards this proposal of his as giving no priority.  Those of us who supported the last measure, to which this is an amending Bill, advocated the five-room house as against the smaller house that Deputy Good contended for.  The figures we have got show that the public <Col N="1431" /> were wise and that quite a small, an insignificant, number of two-room houses was built&mdash;only 67&mdash;whereas close on 2,000 five-room houses were built.</P>

      <P>When I say &ldquo;the public&rdquo; I suppose I must be meticulously exact and I must speak by the card.  It is those who took advantage of and put into operation the Housing Act.  It is very much better for the public and very much better for the nation to have assets of greater value provided out of the moneys which are subsidies to building.  Deputy Good contends that equalising the subsidy so as to read £75 in all three cases, would give no priority.  Surely a moment's reflection would convince him that it would.  This is a proposal that gives priority to one type of house, because the cost of construction for the five-room house is ever so much larger.  There is more enterprise and more courage in investment required to go into a five-room house on a large scale of production, and consequently the inducement in that case ought to be more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>

      <P>No doubt it is.  I am not alleging that there are greater profits to be made.  It is no part of my case, but the broad fact remains that the actual amount of money to be invested in any particular case is considerably larger for the construction of five-roomed houses and, therefore, the inducement to go into them ought to be larger.</P>

      <P>I assume from the figures given by the President that these houses were built in response to a known demand.  I take it that both the private builder and the local authority <Col N="1432" /> are not blind to the facts.  As regards the second part of Deputy Good's amendment, I am with him.  I believe that better results would accrue through helping private enterprise to put up houses.  The work would be done more expeditiously.  However, the fact remains that the main purpose for which Deputy Good recommends the equalisation of subsidies is not a purpose that it is desirable to serve, and in any case it does not serve his intended purpose.  If the State could have afforded them, which I know it could not, I am quite sure that the subsidies would have been much larger. There is this much to the credit of the State, that it has done more, considerably more, in the solution of the housing problem than any other State, and very much more proportionately in relation to its own resources.  Deputy Good, it seems to me, has made no case at all for the alteration of the different grades of subsidy with regard to the different types of houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I wish to have explained, and that is why there should be any difference in the subsidy paid to private people and to public authorities.  In the case of a five-roomed house, a private individual who desires to build one is offered £25 less than the public authority; for a four-roomed house he is offered £20 less, and for a three-roomed house £15 less.  I am satisfied that if private individuals got the same amount of subsidy as the public authorities you would have very many more four-roomed houses built.  There is a great demand for that class of house, and I see no reason why the subsidy should not be the same in both cases. If it were you would have many private individuals making arrangements to build their own houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is a matter that the President might give some consideration to.  When I raised this matter last year I was told that if four or five persons formed themselves into a public utility society they could get the same amount of subsidy as is given to the public authorities.  Deputies would be surprised if they knew how difficult it is to get three people together to agree in the case of building houses with their <Col N="1433" /> own money.  It is almost impossible to get five people to join in forming one of these societies.  I made an effort to do it, and I succeeded in getting two people to meet.  They secured a third person to join them, but we could not get a fourth or fifth, even if we were to go to the extent of offering a reward to them to join in the enterprise.  The three people who came originally together would undertake the building of their own houses if the Government gave them the same subsidy that is given to the public authorities.  I hope this is a point that will be considered sympathetically by the President.  I am satisfied that, if the suggestion I make were agreed to, there would be many more individual applications for grants for house building purposes than the Government is receiving at the present time.  On the question of three-roomed houses, if I got my choice I certainly would prefer a four or five-roomed house, but in Dublin to-day there is an extraordinary demand for three-roomed houses.  Proof of that is to be found in the fact that speculators are buying large houses in good class neighbourhoods in the city and converting them into three-roomed flats.  Very decent people, earning good wages, are going into those flats which are let at an average of 30/- a week.  Some of those people were with me asking how they would go about getting a house. They told me they would much prefer a three-roomed cottage to one of these three-roomed flats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in one of these flats.  In one of the rooms containing a double bed you could no more than turn about.  The other two rooms were fairly decent.  It was a top flat in one of the principal thoroughfares in the city.  From that class of people you would have an exceedingly big demand for four-roomed houses.  Then you have the tenement dweller.  This is a class that is more numerous in my constituency than, I suppose, in the constituency of any other Deputy for the City of Dublin.  They are a numerous class in Gloucester Street, Gardiner Street and Grenville Street.  They pay 6/- and 7/- a week for single <Col N="1434" /> rooms.  Some of these people would almost give their eyes to get a three-roomed cottage.  Most of them have families, and because they cannot get a three-roomed cottage they have to live in tenements.  There is no other accommodation for them.  Then you have the married man with a wife and two children.  That man is willing and anxious to pay a rent for a three-roomed house, but he cannot get it.  The five-roomed houses that are being built and let at a rent of 15/- and 16/- a week are beyond him.  This class of house is only suitable for the man in constant employment and who, perhaps, has two sons and two daughters working.  We are making no effort to deal with the tenement dwellers who are compelled to live in single rooms. I know the Government is anxious to help them, and that the President at all times has displayed the greatest activity and interest in the housing of the working classes.  I know what his desires are in this direction, and I would make a special appeal to him on behalf of these people.  I think on inquiry he will find that there is an extremely large demand from amongst the men with small wages and small families for three and four-roomed houses.  In Seville Place we have an Artisans' Dwellings Company.  The company has erected avenues of two, three, four and five-roomed houses. Some of the people in these two-roomed houses have reared very large and very decent families.  When the families grow up they apply for a transfer to a three-roomed house, and then from a three to a four-roomed house and so on.  That, I think, will help to bring home to the Government that there is in the City of Dublin a very big demand indeed for three and four-roomed houses.</P>

      <P>Under present conditions I am sorry to say that there is. I know that when one of these two-roomed houses becomes vacant the company has at least 1,000 people on its waiting list for it.  Because of the conditions that prevail people are compelled to apply for two-roomed houses. I urge on the President that private <Col N="1435" /> individuals who are ready and anxious to build three and four-roomed houses should get the same consideration as regards the subsidy that is given to the public authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Deputy that question because I realised the importance that is attached to the existence of a demand.  Of course there is a demand for two-roomed houses, and for three-roomed houses, but are we to take it that because of a demand for two-roomed houses we by a deliberate act should give a preference by means of a subsidy to the building of two-roomed houses? Nobody claims that you should give a subsidy for the building of two-roomed houses.  I apply the same reasoning to the three-roomed houses the building of which it is proposed to encourage by a subsidy, because there is a demand for them.  Are we satisfied that in the City of Dublin that is a desirable system of housing not merely for this year, not merely for the immediate future? It is not the existence of a demand which should determine our action here, though it does determine the builder if he is not restricted. The builder will build a two-roomed house if he thinks he can let it or sell it at a profit.  If we are going to say that the insistence of a demand is the factor that is to determine our action we would be doing all sorts of undesirable things, for people demand all sorts of things that are not good, simply because of the circumstances that are driving them.  The very circumstances that create that demand are the circumstances we must take into account in deciding what should be the housing policy that should be encouraged having regard to the future welfare of the people.</P>

      <P>The Deputy says he does not want to get into that, but it is an important consideration.  The local authorities or private individuals build houses, but the person who enters into occupation of the house expects to become the owner of that house.  Now you talk of removing them to larger houses when the opportunity comes, but they are the owners of their houses and are tied.  Deputy Good makes the point&mdash;perhaps it is not of much importance&mdash;that my proposal is to cater only for the artisan who is in regular employment and that I am prepared to leave the unskilled labourer in his tenement room.  My belief in this matter is that we ought not by a deliberate act to say to the unskilled labourers: &ldquo;In our opinion it is right and desirable that you should be on a lower cale permanently than the artisan.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I think it is a proposition with which there would be general agreement, that we would all like to live in houses better than we can afford, but would it be wise for us to do it? If it is unwise for us, should we not consider that is what we are endeavouring to do to-day for these poor people? We say: &ldquo;We are not going to build a small house for you.  We are going to build a larger house, and no matter where you get the money that is the house you will get.&rdquo;  That is exactly what our legislation means to do. In order that that may be more thoroughly carried out the Schedule attached to our Housing Bill of 1925 allows £80 for a four-roomed house and £60 for a three-roomed house. Naturally the local authority will build a house for which it can get the largest subsidy, because the house with the largest number of rooms is the cheapest to construct.  In proportion, it is much cheaper to construct a five-roomed house than a three-roomed house.  If you take that into account this means that you are going to get five-roomed houses, and you are actually getting them.  That is against the policy on the other side.  They have a larger experience of these problems than we have.  They give no preference to one size of a house as against another.  They lay down that your house shall not be of less floor-space or greater floor-space than so-and-so.  We want no further figures.  Leave it to the local authority and let them provide the house they will find the greatest demand for.  If there is a demand for a certain size of house we should do nothing to prevent that house being provided for that particular class of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1438" /> Some little while ago, in the local authority I happen to belong to, we had a deputation representing tenants and people who are anxious to become tenants.  The proposition they put before us is: &ldquo;We want three-roomed houses.&rdquo;  If that proposal is put before the local authority I do not want the local authority to be in any worse position if it provides three or four-roomed houses than it would be for five-roomed houses.  You are not meeting that demand when you give them five-roomed houses.  Legislating for a five-roomed house is class legislation, because just as you and I find there is a certain type of house we would like to be in but which we cannot afford, so there is a certain type of house they like to be in but cannot afford.  Let us give them the house they like and take them out of their horrible surroundings.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point I am called on to answer is the difference between the sum of money given to a private person and that given to a local authority or public utility society. Before answering that question, on the face of it that looks a bad case, but in practice it turned out that under the 1924 Act, where the sums were equal we had practically the same response as we had under the Act of last year. But that is not the reason why the alteration was made last year.  The reason of it was that there is a distinction between two persons, one of whom alters a house or gets a house built himself and the other who occupies a house which is constructed by the local authority.  The local authority has to deal with a class who cannot, I think, be expected to build for themselves. The person who constructs or alters a house is a one-hundred-percent. person; the person who looks to the local authority to provide it is a seventy-five-per-cent. person, and the local authority requires something more than the private individual who is in a position to build his own house. The local authority has to meet certain expenses which the private person has not got to meet.  I think that the cost of collection and the inspections that have to be made place a considerable burden on the local authority.  In the <Col N="1439" /> first place, the local authority has to pay a higher standard of wage than is paid by the ordinary individual.</P>

I refer Deputy Good to the Departmental Housing Inquiry of 1913 and to the report, from which it will be seen that whereas the average cost for repairs to dwellings by, I think it was, the Artisans' Dwelling Company, was £1 5s., the cost to the Corporation was £2 12s.  If a local authority has a person collecting rents I think that person is drawing a twenty-five per cent. bigger salary than the person collecting them for a private individual, and generally speaking, the cost to the local authority is greater than that of the private individual.</P>

      <P>Looked upon in that light, it is a capital sum, and the capital costs bear a relation to the other costs.  We compensate the local authority by giving them a larger subsidy. In the same way a public utility society is regarded as a local authority. The public utility society makes practically no money out of it.  I think they are mainly philanthropic societies. Some extra help was needed to enable them to carry out this work.  That is the reason for the difference between the two.  In one case the person looked to the local authority for help and in the other case the private individual is in a position to help himself.  In addition to a subsidy a private individual can get what is possible from the local authority, and in Dublin I think they give the same amount as is given by the Government.  In that connection I should like to point out that if we could accept the figure mentioned here to-day for a three-roomed house and take £120 off that, it leaves the outgoings £238, a reasonable sum.  Deputy Good was not in the House when I contrasted the prices which I gave: £358 for a three-roomed house, £426 for a four-roomed house, and £550 for a five-roomed house.</P>

      <P>Not in very large numbers.  These are for the City of Cork.  In Dublin the price of a five-roomed house would be between five hundred and £535.  Deputy Good will accept a sum of eight per cent. as the only outgoing in respect of the house. Allowing the subsidy of £60 off the £358, the sum is reduced to £298.  Eight per cent of £298 is practically £24.  Let us take a four-roomed house at £426 and deduct the subsidy, that is £346. Eight per cent. of that is £27 13s. 4d. The difference between the two is £3 13s. 4d., somewhere about 1/6 a week. I put it to Deputy Hewat, before Deputy Good came in, that there are very few people at present taxing themselves to their utmost to pay the rent of a three-roomed house who would not be satisfied to pay an extra one and sixpence to get a four-roomed house.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister for Agriculture already explained the exceptional circumstances which led to the introduction of this Estimate.  Certain proposals were not prepared in time to be fully examined in the Department of Finance when the original estimates were being made ready for the printers, and they had to be struck out.  I think that the actual matters covered by this Supplementary Estimate have been dealt with by the Minister for Agriculture when the main Vote was under discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will remember that on the discussion of the estimates for the Department of Agriculture I indicated the supplementary estimates which it was proposed to move afterwards.  I gave all the items set out in the paper now being circulated, except sub-head O (2), Dairy Produce <Col N="1443" /> Act, £1,750.  That is a rather important supplementary estimate.  It is to provide for what we call one-man auxiliaries.  In some districts, such as Clare, and areas in the Midlands, there is an insufficiency of cows to support a central creamery economically.  The only way of introducing dairying to those districts would be to have one. central creamery and a number of auxiliaries.  An auxiliary costs from £1,200 to £1,500, and the capital expenses are too high for the very small milk supply you are likely to have in places like Clare, where the number of cows in a given area is much more, say, than in a place like Galway, but much less than in a county such as Limerick.  If we could arrange an auxiliary, which would come within the terms of the Dairy Produce Act, and have all the plant and equipment required in accordance with that Act, but which would be run by one man, and cost, say, £600, that would be economic.  Deputies will see the enormous possibilities in that, if it could be done.  It would mean that instead of home-butter-making in Clare and other districts, where the people lose because they must sell at low prices, we could introduce creameries into these districts, which at present go in for home butter-making to a greater extent than for the raising of young stock.  It is not meant to introduce creameries into places in the West, like Mayo, Galway, and so-forth, but into places such as Cavan, Leitrim, and portions of Kerry, where there is a large amount of home buttermaking, and where butter is more important than store stock.  This vote is to provide a subsidy to one, two, or three experimental one-man creameries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could not ask anybody to set up an auxiliary creamery and take all the risks of making an entirely new experiment without guaranteeing him in some way.  Moreover, if we do arrange, either with a society or an individual, to build an auxiliary creamery, according to their own or our specification&mdash; in any event, it will have to be approved by us&mdash;we must ask them afterwards to keep accounts, and to let us have the costings of every single item in connection with the running <Col N="1444" /> of that institution.  Under these circumstances we will probably have to supply the equipment for two or three of these institutions.  If the experiment succeeds, we can always sell the equipment to the society or individual who makes the experiment for us.  One of these institutions has practically been arranged.</P>

You could not afford to put up five or six auxiliaries at a cost of £1,200 each, but if you can afford to put up five or six, at a cost of £700 each, and to run them afterwards with one man, you will be in a totally different position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>On this sub-head, I want to commend the action of the Department in taking a very unusual step and a step which I hope will be productive of good results.  If the experiment, as the Minister suggests, promises success, he will have done a great work for districts where dairying is, <Col N="1445" /> under the present law, becoming an economic proposition, and where the conditions of the farmers prevent them erecting a creamery at the present cost. The cost of erecting a creamery would be about £1,500.  In a very poor part of the county from which I come&mdash; that part which adjoins Co. Leitrim&mdash; the farmers made a very valiant effort to erect a creamery, which they need very badly.  They would be able to secure about £400 or £500 in capital, but the yield of milk per cow would be small and it is doubtful if they would be justified in expending the necessary sum.  If it can be proved by this experiment that an auxiliary of this type can be economically run, it will mean very swift development of the dairying industry.</P>
      <P>I desire to refer to sub-head I, which deals with special agricultural schemes in congested districts.  I think it is regrettable that the decision to make these funds available was not taken earlier by the Department.  The administration of the schemes has been made more difficult, because the county committees were not aware that these additional grants would be forthcoming. The fact that there was delay in making that decision will mean that they will not be as great a success as they would be if the decision had been taken earlier and made known.  Even as it is, I think these schemes should be very helpful to the districts concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make the plea&mdash;I have already urged it upon the Minister&mdash; that my constituency should get consideration under these special schemes which it has not got heretofore.  Early in the debate on the first Land Bill, an effort was made by the then Farmers' Party to have Cavan scheduled as a congested area.  Why it was not so scheduled when these districts were first mapped out is more than I can understand.  The conditions in Cavan are exactly similar to those across the Border in Connacht.  These special schemes are running and are giving satisfaction in these places and also in Donegal, but we in Cavan are excluded from the benefits.  I pointed out before that in the western end of Cavan the committee <Col N="1446" /> of agriculture were experiencing great difficulty in getting the farmers to take up schemes, particularly towards improvement in the breed of cattle by procuring premium bulls. The cost to one small farmer in this congested area of one premium bull would be too great.  They could not afford to pay anything between £60 and £90 for an animal and take him down to a holding of ten acres among farmers with holdings of a similar size. The risk of investing this sum is too great for one of those men.</P>
    <P>The result is the advantages coming to farmers in the better districts, where the holdings are larger, are denied to the farmers in the poorer districts.  In the congested areas the policy of the Minister is such that schemes to enable farmers to get loans on special terms to procure bulls have operated very satisfactorily.  I make the plea that Cavan is entitled to consideration under these schemes, but we have not got it up to the present.  I am not now indulging in any special pleading; the conditions are there to be seen by anybody.  The Minister paid one visit to part of my constituency, and I think he will agree that the conditions he saw there are just as bad as the conditions prevailing in the great part of the Province of Connacht.  I urge that the Minister should recognise now, when a special effort is being made to improve the congested areas and to put the farmers there in a position to enable them to get the best out of their holdings, that the same facilities should be extended to farmers in other districts where they have not been able to avail of the ordinary schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that Cavan is a congested county, and should be treated in the same way as other such districts. I agree with the Deputy that so far as these special schemes are concerned it should receive consideration.</P>
