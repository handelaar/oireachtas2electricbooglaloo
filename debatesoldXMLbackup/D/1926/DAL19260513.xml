      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is in a position to have printed and circulated amongst members of the Oireachtas a table setting forth the existing rates of subsistence allowance granted to the officers in the several Departments of the Civil Service and categorically arranged in respect of (a) class, (b) period, and (c) scales of salary of recipients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Existing rates of subsistence allowances have in the past been fixed in different circumstances for a large number of different classes of travelling officers.  The rates for officers of the same salary differ somewhat between one Department and another.  Generally speaking, however, the rates now regarded as appropriate <Col N="1502" /> for officers with the same salaries are the same throughout the Civil Service. I am prepared to issue, for the information of Deputies, a table setting forth these general rates.  The higher rates of subsistence have recently been reduced and the rates now payable are those that were in force before 1914. These rates are again under investigation with a view to ascertaining whether in some cases they require further modification, having regard to the actual present cost of living away from home.  It is intended that so far as possible the revised rates should be applied uniformly in the service.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that there is general dissatisfaction amongst the traders of Co. Cavan owing to the large number of scales, weights, and measures which are discarded by the Inspectors of Weights and Measures; and if he will state if it is not the duty of the Inspectors to adjust and stamp the weights.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that protests have been received from traders in the Belturbet district, County Cavan, against rejection of weights and measures by the ex-officio inspectors.  In this area, during the period from 13th August, 1924, to 30th April, 1926, the number of weights, measures and weighing instruments examined was 1,239, and the number of rejections 350.  For the same period in the whole Co. Cavan the numbers were 10,860 and 2,748, respectively. The reason for the comparatively high number of rejections is that for several years prior to the Gárda Síochána taking over the duty, no inspections had been made, and there was thus a large accumulation of unjust and improper weights and measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ex-officio inspectors of weights and measures are liable to severe penalties under the Weights and Measures Acts, apart from disciplinary action, if they stamp any articles which are not in conformity with the Weights and Measures Acts and regulations, and they are also forbidden by law to adjust any weight, <Col N="1503" /> measure or instrument which has been discarded.  A civilian adjuster is, however, usually available to adjust any article which the ex-officio inspector considers can be adjusted.  Moreover, traders have a right of appeal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who in certain specific cases may issue an order for the adjustment of rejected weights, measures and scales.</P>

      <P>A claim to unemployment benefit, made by William Doyle of Croghtenclogh, Castlecomer, on the 25th February, 1926, was disallowed by the insurance officer under Section 8 (2) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, on the ground that the claimant had left his employment voluntarily and without just cause.  The claimant appealed against the decision to the Court of Referees, which on the evidence before it recommended that the claim should be disallowed.  The insurance officer agreed with this recommendation, and in the circumstances no benefit can be paid on the claim.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Contributions under the Unemployment Insurance Act are compulsorily payable in respect of all employment except those specified in Part II. of the First Schedule to the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, as excepted employments, and unemployment benefit is payable under the same Act to all persons who satisfy the statutory conditions contained in Section 7 and are free from the disqualifications specified in Section 8 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920. If an owner of land engages in insurable work he is bound to pay contributions, and the ownership of land does not disqualify an insured contributor from obtaining unemployment benefit. A claim to unemployment benefit made by Andrew Neill, of Kill, Castlecomer. on the 2nd January, 1926, was disallowed on the grounds that the claimant was not unemployed and not unable to obtain suitable employment. Exercising his statutory right, the claimant appealed from that decision to the Court of Referees, which, on the evidence before it, recommended that the claim be disallowed.  The insurance officer agreed with this recommendation, and accordingly the claim remains disallowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of this Bill, entitled the &ldquo;Protection of the Community (Special Powers) Bill, 1926.&rdquo;  As I said yesterday, from the information at our disposal, I am satisfied that a measure of this sort is necessary.  The main necessity for it arises from the fact <Col N="1510" /> that there is a shortage of essential commodities in particular places in the Saorstát.  As I mentioned yesterday, the satisfactory information we received with regard to the cessation of the strike in England did not bring to an end the coal dispute, and one of the commodities in which a shortage exists is coal.  It may be necessary, therefore, to ration supplies, and it would not be possible for us, without this measure, to undertake that work in a satisfactory manner.  I am, therefore, forced to the conclusion that this Bill should be passed into law without delay, and I accordingly move the Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The feeling I have in regard to this Bill at the present time is that the occasion for it does not exist.  The President has told us that there is in some places a shortage of coal, or there may be a shortage of coal, and that inasmuch as the coal dispute in Great Britain has not come to an end the shortage may continue. But it seems to me that the occasion, even grave as it might be, does not warrant our speaking of it as a national emergency.</P>
      <P>If the reasons the Minister has given are the reasons justifying the Bill at the present time, and that a proclamation will be issued in respect of these particular difficulties, then it strikes me the method of devising such measures as are necessary should not be, as outlined in this Bill, a declaration of national emergency.  I feel that the use of the term &ldquo;national emergency&rdquo; is misplaced when we are dealing with what are comparatively small matters.</P>
      <P>For instance, one could authorise the Ministry to purchase coal from other countries.  There is no difficulty in getting coal from places other than England. It can be got without having to declare that a national emergency had arisen.  In respect to the ordinary movement of prices arising out of hoarding, if you like, or any shortage of a particular commodity in a particular district, there again it may be desirable that the Minister should have power, but it seems to me unwise to have a declaration of national emergency before one can deal with some shortage of foodstuffs or essential commodities in a particular part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1511" /> There does not seem to be any relationship between the case made by the Minister and that for the Second Reading of a Bill empowering the Ministry to declare a national emergency.  I feel that the method by which the Government is endeavouring to secure these powers to do comparatively small things is entirely wrong.  If the intention is to have powers of this kind in abeyance, then I think it would be wiser to defer the passing of a Bill of this kind until everything is calm and quiet, and do it in cold blood at a time when there is no feeling, no heat, or possibility of panic.  Once we begin to talk about a national emergency as something that has suddenly arisen, then the state of the country's mind is going to be inflamed.  Whether we intend to do that or not that is what will happen.  If that is not the case, and if it is thought undesirable to take action which would have the effect of inflaming the public mind, then I think the methods of this Bill are quite wrong.  I would quite approve of giving extended powers to regulate the supply and distribution of essentials in a particular district or area, when it is found that that district or area is being deprived of the essentials. But I would not say that we must wait until a national emergency has arisen before we could do that.  I think there is no relationship between the proposals in the Bill and the case for the Bill which the President has made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We are told that the occasion has passed and that there is no relationship between the situation that now exists and the case made for this Bill.  Deputy Johnson has spoken of a national emergency. The Bill does not immediately create a national emergency.  The Bill looks forward, with certain information in possession of my Department, mainly to the possibility of such a crisis arising quite soon, that a proclamation declaring a national emergency would have to be issued.  Deputy Johnson speaks of avoiding panic.  I could build up a case immediately for this Bill by taking out a series of commodities and stating those openly here. <Col N="1512" /> What is going to be the effect if I say definitely that over the greater part of the South and West of this country there is a definite shortage of a particular commodity?  It is going to mean a rush on the part of people to seize whatever they can get of that commodity and hoard it up, so that we, in order to avoid any sort of panic, or any attempt at hoarding, before this Bill is, put through, deal with the whole matter in the vague.  The President referred to one item and localised the emergency with regard to that item to a particular town.  Just take that situation.  At the end of last week we were advised by a certain merchant&mdash; the main merchant&mdash;in a fairly big town that he had three weeks' supply of a particular article.  On Tuesday of this week he informed us that he had only two days' supply.  You cannot build up a case on one city.  I can say definitely that there is sufficient information at my disposal to state that that same report is likely to come in from other cities.  People who advised us that they had three or four, or even six weeks' supply of certain articles, are now writing to us that their stocks are depleted, and that the period for which these supplies would hold out against ordinary orders must be cut down.  The situation has not passed away.  There is a coal strike continuing, and the absence of coal in itself may justify a proclamation, and may lead to measures for rationing of that article.  If we had an absolute assurance that the whole situation would be confined to one article there would not be so much necessity for this proclamation.  There is a necessity for something, and this supplies the necessity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is too optimistic to consider that the situation that brought this about has passed away entirely.  One has only to read the newspapers this morning to see how many people have returned to work, how the transport services on the other side are running, and how far they have got back to normal.  Even if they have got back to normal there will be a considerable time before there is the ordinary flow of things from the other side in here. There is a clearing up period which, <Col N="1513" /> after all the disturbance and discomfort, is going to be a fairly lengthy period, and in that situation we have to face the repercussion of increased demand on the part of the English for things that should come here. Simply to say&mdash;if it were the fact&mdash; that the strike situation in England had passed away, would not clear the situation with regard to Ireland.  It is quite wrong to say that the difficulty spoken of yesterday is a difficulty that has arisen from rivalry between merchants. If anything, it might be said the difficulty has arisen from the fact that the town in question is fairly near the Border where rationing was in vogue on the other side but not here. There was, perhaps, a certain demand on this particular merchant which depleted stocks.</P>
    <P>If these instances do not amount to a situation of national emergency there need not be a proclamation.  But if the people here are going to take it, that because the strike situation in England is eased to a certain extent &mdash;it is still being maintained in regard to the mines&mdash;they can say in a mood of easy optimism there is no necessity for this, that we can wait, that the whole matter should be discussed in a calm, cool way and without panic&mdash; then they can take the responsibility for that.  This Bill can be discussed to-day and to-morrow without any danger of panic in the coolest possible way.  I have information that makes me believe that there is sufficient reason to entrust powers of this special sort to the Government; that there is a likelihood of that proclamation having to be issued next week.  But if the instances do not reach that point that the situation can be said to constitute a national emergency, the proclamation need not be issued.  That is no reason why the Dáil should be asked to refuse to pass the Bill.  I cannot see that there is any argument against it.  The powers will not be used unless required. They are powers for the benefit of the community.  The Bill is definitely and clearly and singly directed against hoarding and profiteering, and I think that alone should make the Dáil willing to pass it in its present form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorise the making of any regulations imposing any form of compulsory military service or industrial conscription, nor shall any regulation made under this Act make it an offence for any person or persons to take part in a strike or peacefully to persuade any other person or persons to take part in a strike.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments I have put down are intended to prevent the use of powers under this Act other than those indicated by the Minister.  Inasmuch as the Bill is based upon similar legislation in Great Britain&mdash;copied in Northern Ireland&mdash;and inasmuch as it leaves out certain provisions which are embodied in the British Act and which are important, I have sought to insert these provisions, not exactly in the language of the other Act but with no material alteration.  I think the Minister will probably agree to have these amendments inserted.  The amendment I now move is embodied in the British Act.  It would be unwise to allow regulations to be made&mdash; though those regulations are subject to the consideration of the Dáil&mdash;which <Col N="1515" /> would have the effect of repealing the existing law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is this point with regard to the difference between the Bill before the Dáil and the British Act&mdash;that the Bill before the Dáil was definitely limited so as to have to do merely with, and to ensure the due supply and distribution of, the essentials of life.  I do not think there is anything in the context of the Bill which would lead anybody to suppose that there is any power given to formulate regulations, say, to make it an offence for any person or persons to take part in a strike or to persuade peacefully any other person or persons to take part in a strike.  This Bill, taken in comparison with the British Act, has definitely been combed of any provision which would seem to indicate that there was any purpose of that kind intended.  Inasmuch as the British Act has provision of that kind, and inasmuch as there is no intention of having regulations under this present Bill dealing with any of those things, there is no great point in not having the section put in.  But I want to point out the reason for any section of that sort being omitted&mdash;that everything that seemed to indicate any interference with people taking part in a strike or peacefully persuading any other person to take part in a strike had been definitely combed out of this Bill, so as to make it completely and entirely one for the regulation and supply of commodities and their distribution.  There is no great matter in having the provision in, but the reason why it was omitted in the first instance should be stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been possible, in the time given, to examine the Bill with the closeness that a Bill of this kind should be examined.  But it would be possible, when powers of this kind are given to ensure the supply and distribution of the essentials of life, to restrict accumulation and to regulate and control prices, to make regulations &mdash;I am not saying there is any likelihood of it&mdash;of a much more drastic kind than are at present contemplated. When powers of this kind are given, it is surprising how widely they can be <Col N="1516" /> used and stretched in the use.  It is desirable that the Act itself should be limited in purpose to the provision of essentials.  There are, of course, certain people who would like to take advantage of powers of this kind, and it is undesirable to give that power, inasmuch as this Bill is not for a present emergency.  It is a Bill that will have permanence, and it is only the proclamations under it that will be temporary. The Bill will be always there, and a Bill empowering the Ministry to make regulations should have the limitations that I have submitted in the form of amendments.</P>

      <P>The Minister spoke against the amendment, as far as I know.  I am certainly against the amendment.  I think it would alter the character of the measure.  It would indicate that there was something in the nature of what Deputy Johnson has said&mdash;that is, that we intended to take precautions against a strike, or something of that kind.  That is not the intention.  The intention is to have an empowering Bill.  I do not believe that under the Bill it would be possible, by any stretch of the imagination, to have a regulation imposing any form of compulsory military service or industrial conscription or to make it an offence for a person to take part in a strike or peacefully to persuade any other person or persons to take part in a strike.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Conferring&rdquo; and &ldquo;obliging&rdquo; are two very different terms.  I think that this would entirely alter the character of the Bill, that it would create much the same complications as the other measure that has been referred to, and that was not the intention. This is an empowering and enabling section; it would really carry out what is in the key-note of the Bill, that is, in the Preamble.

      <P>I do not believe that any court would hold that the regulations made under this Bill could override any rights or authority that are guaranteed at present, and I believe that the right to strike is in the law; I never heard that it was not.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not able to understand the meaning of these enactments. If we authorise the Executive Council to do anything that the Executive Council thinks proper to achieve a certain desirable end, that gives the Executive Council authority to do things against what, by implication or by common law, are rights.  The right to strike may be guaranteed, but it is by practice and judgments of the courts rather than by statute, and if we pass an Act authorising the Minister to make regulations conferring powers on persons to do anything which the Executive Council thinks proper, it might well limit the rights of individuals.</P>

      <P>The way to view it properly is to anticipate what has already happened in another place&mdash;a general strike.  We do not anticipate any such thing.  We did not anticipate any such thing when we were introducing this measure.  If we were to-anticipate it we would require an Act which would enable the Executive Council of the day to deal with a situation of that kind.  It would be a situation of sufficient magnitude to require a special Act dealing with the special circumstance.  That circumstance has not arisen; I have not the faintest fear that it is likely to arise.  I do not see anything that would give rise to it, and in consequence I do not see that there is any danger to anticipate any such power being exercised, and I do not believe that any power could be exercised under this by regulation which would deal with a situation of that sort.</P>

      <P>There are many strikes, strikes which are inimical to the welfare of the community and the State, which would have to be put down with a strong hand.  Take, for instance, the amendment&mdash;&ldquo;peacefully to persuade any other person or persons.&rdquo; If you inserted that amendment could not a person approach the police, for instance, and ask them to go out on a sympathetic strike?  It might be called peaceful persuasion, but I would call it sedition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There was never such a campaign, and this brings me to another point.  If, for instance, income tax payers, in opposition to the Minister for Finance, were to form an organisation and call a strike against the payment of income tax, do you mean to say that the Government would stand powerless and not pass <Col N="1519" /> emergency legislation to deal with the situation?</P>
      <P>For instance, a sympathetic strike in the Civil Service could not be tolerated, and yet in a grave national emergency, if we were to accept Deputy Johnson's amendment, there is nothing to prevent the civil servants or the police going out on strike in sympathy and thus utterly paralysing the whole administration of affairs in the country.  I submit that the right to strike is not a sacred thing and that it is a question of expediency.  We tolerate the principle that an individual may withdraw his labour or service, but to make that unlimited is not desirable in the interests of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 23, to delete the word &ldquo;but&rdquo; and substitute the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;But may be added to, altered or revoked by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas or by regulations made in like manner and subject to the like provisions as the original regulations, and.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to make it possible for the regulations which are to come before the Oireachtas to be amended, modified, or altered by the Oireachtas; that is, instead of having absolutely to turn them down and refuse them, to make it possible for them to be modified or amended in the Dáil or Seanad.  The section as it stands practically leaves the position that if the regulations are made and presented, the Dáil then must accept them en bloc or defeat them en bloc. The proposal of the amendment is to make it possible for them to alter or revoke by resolution or by regulations made in manner similar to the original ones.  It is giving more authority to the Dáil over the regulations than they would have by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This would be a departure from what has been the practice in practically all Acts that have been passed whereby any regulations made under them would be subject to annulment by resolution. &ldquo;Added to, altered or revoked.&rdquo;  In essence it would mean that legislation would be passed by resolution.  Of course, it can be countered on the other hand by saying that legislation can be made by regulation, but I think it would be much more desirable in cases of this sort to have it definitely settled whether or not the Executive Council making those recommendations, made them to the satisfaction or dissatisfaction of the Dáil rather than they should be subject to pretty considerable debates in either House or both Houses, and that pretty considerable canvassing might take place outside as to the merits and reasons for amending them and so on.  It does not appear to me that it is likely any progress can <Col N="1522" /> be effected by amending the regulations. By revoking them, of course, in a case like this it would almost inevitably mean that the Government of the day would be confronted with the position which is provided for in the Constitution, that is, it would no longer possess the support of a majority of the House.  A situation might reasonably arise in which one House of the Oireachtas might pass an amendment to the regulation, and while it would not affect the issue it would certainly affect the public confidence of the time, and if a question of national emergency were to arise the main idea running through our mind would be to maintain public confidence, and to that extent I am satisfied that the method in the Bill is a better way to have these regulations brought up for consideration.  Either reject them by failing to pass a resolution or give them the force they ought to have from the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether other Deputies have noticed it, but there has within the last year or so been a very great addition to the number of what are in effect legislative acts that are completed by merely laying regulations on the Table&mdash;that is to say, we have added a great deal to the number of occasions when the Minister can make regulations which have the force of law by simply laying them on the Table, and we know very well that many of those regulations would, if they had undergone scrutiny, be amended in some degree.  This proposal in the Bill is intended to follow the lines that the Ministry can do no wrong or the Ministry, if it is thought to be doing even a little wrong in the formulation of a regulation, must be defeated.  By this method you are practically saying that the Ministry must be defeated on a vital issue and you are challenging the House to defeat the Ministry, and, by that way, you are running a risk or else you must accept the regulations en bloc, giving us no time whatever to call attention to errors or difficulties or unreasonable propositions.  The Dáil cannot amend a regulation.  It must defeat the Government.  I think it is very much <Col N="1523" /> better to assume that the Ministry is not infallible, that it may make mistakes and that it may ask for powers unnecessarily wide, and that the Dáil is in a position to give consideration to regulations and to suggest amendments and even to impose amendments.</P>
      <P>The position under the Bill is that we have no discretion.  We have got to defeat the regulations, which means defeating the Ministry and risking a change of Government or dissolution at a time when everyone will say: &ldquo;This is no time for changing Ministries.&rdquo;  I cannot understand why a proposition of this kind cannot be accepted.  This is the practice of the British Act, and their experience is much greater than ours.  If they found it possible to do this thing by regulation without having power to amend I think they would have done it.  If they thought there was any evil in this method they would have avoided that evil.  It seems to me that in the Dáil we are foregoing some of our responsibility if we are to hand over to the Ministry our right of amending any regulation dealing with the most vital matters.  We are inviting Ministers to add, illimitably almost, to the executive authority they have. We are giving them occasion to say: &ldquo;You have got to take it or leave it,&rdquo; or: &ldquo;If you do not accept it we go out of office.&rdquo;  That is the position the Ministry asks us to take.  I say this is a reasonable proposal.  If a regulation is made and laid before the Dáil it should not be put up to us that the only alternative is to defeat or pass it. Surely we ought to have a right to consider it and to amend it.</P>

      <P>We are told this is putting temptation before the Ministry and that the Dáil is being asked to forego its functions and hand over illimitable power to the Executive Council.  Consider the illimitable power.  A regulation is made.  The making of that regulation makes it necessary to summon the House and the regulation may be discussed. Deputy Johnson says it is presented in the manner of &ldquo;take it or leave it; accept it as it stands or the Ministry resigns and you are going to have a dissolution at a time of national emergency.&rdquo;<Col N="1524" /> You have to envisage what is going to happen to bring about a proclamation and the making of the regulation.  Something that is considered as a national emergency is considered as the occasion which warrants the bringing forward of a certain type of regulation and the House meets to discuss it.  Surely there is this power left to the Dáil to say if that regulation be not brought forward in another way we are going to defeat that regulation and going to throw, on the Ministry, the responsibility of driving the country into the throes of a revolution by sticking fast to some type of regulation which the House is not going to accept.  I think there is no question of handing over responsibility and illimitable power.  The making of every regulation operates as a summons to the House, and the House can discuss the regulation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but a period in which the House can discuss them is limited and the position in sub-section (2) is different from the British Act, because the British Act follows a procedure of its own House and not the procedure that is laid down here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that Deputy Johnson's amendment is what he claims it to be, a very reasonable proposal, because from the moment the regulation is framed and issued it operates, and under the later sub-section (3) the only thing that is left to the assembled House is to pass a resolution annulling the regulation. The only alternative is to annul or accept, and unless annulled the regulation goes its way and operates as if it never had been challenged here.  That, I hold, is to take from the Oireachtas, more particularly from this House, its rights to share in the government of the country.  This, we must remember, is an emergency measure for a national emergency, and the value of regulations issued at such time under such conditions will lie largely in the fact that the regulation was the expression of the national will on the matter as coming through the House by its representatives. <Col N="1525" /> Yet the power of the representatives to alter or modify is absolutely taken away in this measure.  It is &ldquo;a take it or leave&rdquo; that is left to the House through this declaration that it may annul or pass it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the case made by Deputy Johnson for this amendment is a good one.  The Minister has not answered that case, except to say that if the House does not like the particular regulation drafted, we can tell the Government to bring it back in another form.  I suggest that that is not dealing with the merits of Deputy Johnson's case.  If the procedure as regards amendments is recognised in the case of an ordinary Bill it should be recognised as the most suitable form of dealing with regulations made under this measure.  It is possible that the House will agree to certain matters which are included in the regulations, but it may not be disposed to agree with the regulations as a whole, and in that case it is placed in the position of saying to the Government: &ldquo;We will defeat the whole of the regulations or else take this regulation back and bring it in in another form.&rdquo;  I do not think that that is a suitable way of doing it.  I am sure the Government of the day will always be able to persuade its own party in a situation of that kind that its dignity is at stake, whereas if it is open to the House, as in the case of an ordinary Bill being amended, there would be no such fear on the part of Deputies to table an amendment to remove the objectionable features of the regulations.  The regulation operates from the time it issues, and it may mean that something irretrievable may be done under the regulations, and that damage may be done before an opportunity is given to the House of telling the Government to take back such regulation and present it again in a more suitable form.  I do not think that Deputy Johnson's amendment is unreasonable, or that it asks the Government to do anything which it could not agree to, or which would not be in accordance with ordinary democratic procedure.</P>

      <P>The Deputy stated that under the section as it stands, damage could be irretrievably done before the House met.  If the amendment is carried, the damage will be still irretrievably done, because the House must meet to pass the modifications. The Deputy referred to the procedure with regard to a Bill, but that is not an analogy.  The analogy should be that of the regulations laid on the Table in regard to a Bill.  The practice in this House is that such regulations laid on the Table cannot be amended or modified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice we have got into is so dangerous we ought to alter it.  We ought, at least, to have formal assent to regulations laid on the Table.  What may be justified with regard to ordinary administrative operations is not a fair criterion of what is proposed to be done in a Bill of this kind.  There are very extensive powers granted in this Bill, powers to make regulations which shall, while they remain in force, have effect as if enacted in this Act, but the regulations are not to be subject to any revision, amendment, or alteration.  They have to be formally annulled absolutely.  That, of course, means that in time of emergency the Ministry has the whip hand, because it can say &ldquo;We are going out.&rdquo; The proposal to allow the Dáil to revise or amend the regulations made under this Bill is a very reasonable one, and I cannot understand why it should be opposed so strongly.</P>

      <P>Everybody knows that when a national emergency arises there are many minds with many opinions as to how it should be dealt with.  The more these minds explain themselves to the public and the more criticism there is of anything that is done, the more people you have to suggest the method of dealing with a <Col N="1527" /> national emergency.  One of the difficulties of the Government is that everybody looks on as if with a microscope, to find where a regulation offends against certain delicate susceptibilities. That attitude always comes to the surface at such a time.  That has been our experience on some former occasions.  A time of emergency is a time when definite action must be taken, and the responsibility for answering for that action rests on the Executive Council. It is not a time when you can have 1,000 telephones operating with 1,000 suggestions coming from outside in order to make regulations to suit every-body's convenience.  That is not possible.</P>

In moments of national emergency the junta is to operate.  The House of representatives must be silent in the matter because, as the President says, they will have been informed by various members of the public as to what the public thinks is desirable.  In other words, the voice of the people as expressing the will of the people is to be suppressed on an occasion like this.

      <P>I have never spoken at random yet in this House. I have a fuller sense of my responsibility. I hold, and I think reasonable men will hold the same, that in a national emergency such as this measure is intended for, the greater the authority that attaches to the body that issues the regulation, the better for the public peace and public welfare.  It will command authority and respect and meet with obedience, general and whole-hearted, from the public if the public are able to realise that the regulation is not ex parte, that it does not proceed from a small body of men, but that it comes from the House of representatives who have considered the situation and have reached this decision. The argument that the President urges against Deputy Johnson's amendment is an argument against deliberation, discussion and debate on any big measure, for it is only a question of degree as to whether the situation <Col N="1529" /> that the Bill proposed is intended to meet is an emergency of such and such enormity and such and such a character, or whether it is a public necessity of a lesser kind.  The argument goes to show that when the people voice their views and demand to have them expressed through their representatives here&mdash;that there is something wrong in that arrangement is an argument against representative government root and branch.  The President has given us an example of the maxim that he who proves too much proves nothing.</P>

If that is to be called silencing the voice of the people and operating against representative government, I have failed to understand what these terms ordinarily mean.</P>

You are asked to come here, and the situation will be that if there is what I would call a small point of an amendment such as would not persuade this House to defeat the amendment altogether in a time of national emergency, then the amendment should not be allowed to go through.  You must have regulations to meet a very serious situation, and the idea here is that all the small points that might be urged on a particular measure should be urged with regard to that regulation if the thing reaches the point that, being so obnoxious, the House has the right to say, &ldquo;We are not going to take that; that is a thing that should be considered.&rdquo; If the House has the right to say that of every regulation brought forward in a national emergency, you should allow your regulations to be modified and to be subject to ordinary debate and all the numerous amendments <Col N="1530" /> that can be moved to a section of a Bill, you are getting definitely away from the whole question of emergency and the seriousness of the situation that must arise before any proclamation can be issued or any regulation made.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is arguing against what I did not put up.  I daresay he will congratulate himself on the victory of demolishing a case that was not made.  I argued purely and simply against the President's argument in which he recommended the rejection of Deputy Johnson's amendment.  We all know that this measure is intended for an emergency, and I daresay the emergency in which it would be put in operation would be one where action would have to be taken, and taken quickly and with decision.  Therefore, I am alive to all these considerations which weigh with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but I address myself solely to the argument of the President to show that if it proves anything it shows that we could deal with a grave situation and meet the national interests better by doing away with debate and discussion and giving power into the hands of a few men who would be administering the affairs of the country unchecked.  That is a different proposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there is a rapidly growing school which believes that representative institutions are <Col N="1531" /> quite impossible as governing legislative bodies, and that you should leave this sort of thing to the Executive, to the small Executive, and let them act; men of strong will and decision. Democracies and legislative assemblies are so much incumbrance and should be destroyed.  The proposition here is that in a time the Executive deems to be one of national emergency, when they make regulations, using powers and giving power to confer other powers upon individuals dealing with matters of very great importance to the country, that those regulations may be amended by the House.  They may be acceptable in principle, they may be acceptable as a whole, subject to alteration, but surely in such a time of emergency it is not too much to ask that the House should have certain rights?  The Ministers have conjured up these emergencies in great bulk, shall I say, when things must be done on the instant or the country goes to ruin, but there is also an emergency such as that which has been pictured to us by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the kind of emergency which might arise next week and go on <Col N="1532" /> growing slowly, one which might affect a particular district, and which could not be described as causing a national emergency, but something of importance to the country as a whole which they, perhaps, might call a national emergency&mdash;shall we call it grade two? Regulations that are to be made to deal with that kind of crisis, or problem, surely should be subject to the possibility of amendment without having to be utterly destroyed.  As I have said already, they let us have the alternative placed before us of changing the Government or accepting the regulations en bloc.  I must say that the attitude of the Ministers makes one suspicious that there is some other purpose in this if they are not prepared to consider a reasonable amendment of this kind proposing to give the House the right to revise.  The Government always have a majority, and by the very fact of their existence are presumed to have a majority, and yet they cannot allow the House to discuss a proposition affecting the daily lives of the people.</P>

    <P>I had hoped that it would not be necessary to put forward this amendment, because had the last one been carried the House would have had some opportunity of considering the regulations in a formal way.  The proposition in the amendment which I have now moved is that the House shall before the expiration of seven days have time to consider whether the regulations in question ought to be continued.  It is provided by this amendment that the regulations which have been promulgated shall have force for a period of seven days, unless in the meantime a resolution is passed by both Houses providing for their continuance.  Within that <Col N="1534" /> seven days we would have time to appreciate the value of the regulations, the importance of them and what they are likely to achieve, and if it is desired to continue them longer than seven days the amendment would make it necessary that they should come formally before the Dáil and the Seanad for confirmation.</P>

The effect, to my mind, is the same.  It is possible to rescind the regulation within an earlier time than seven days.  The position as far as the Oireachtas is concerned is carefully provided for in sub-section (3), and I do not see the necessity for the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the motion standing in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Gárda Síochána Allowances Order be not approved by the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that I am not referring to the Order mentioned by the Minister some days ago&mdash; the Gárda Síochána Disciplinary Order. I am referring to the Order fixing the allowances of the Gárda.  In my experience in the past I have found that very often allowances were more important than pay, and that by ingenuity, particularly if you had an ingenious subordinate clerk, you could draw as much in allowance as in pay. I want to take exception to this Order on two grounds.  The first is that of rent allowance.  This Order fixes the rate of rent allowance; it fixes the scale and it fixes the individuals who are entitled to draw rent allowance.  I <Col N="1538" /> take exception both to the scale and to the number who may conceivably be entitled to draw that rent allowance.</P>
    <P>The Order mentioned during the discussion of the Estimates last week points out that a rent allowance shall be paid at the following rates to every member of the force for whom, or, if married, for whose family, suitable official quarters are not available:&mdash; Sergeants and guards from £13 a year in country districts&mdash;5/- a week&mdash;to £30 a year in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  Those amounts will be paid as approved by the Minister.  I had occasion to compare that scale with a certain scale across the water, the scale of the London Metropolitan Police.  They are a very efficient body, a highly-paid body; they are regarded as the aristocracy of the police force in Great Britain.  London is not a cheap city to live in; it may not be quite as expensive as Dublin, but I think it is more expensive than Limerick or Waterford.  Rents are high; in fact, they are so high that civil servants stationed in London get an increased allowance to cover the cost of living there.</P>
    <P>Our scale for Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford for sergeants and guards is 30/- a week.  In the London Metropolitan Police a sergeant gets 18/- a week and a constable 15/6. Those are the figures given by the British Home Secretary in the middle of April this year.  That scale is very substantially lower than our own.  In the case of constables as against our Gárda it is virtually half, and I suggest to the Minister that our scale can bear some revision.  I have no doubt it is a scale he has inherited, as far as Dublin is concerned, from the Dublin Metropolitan Police, and it may not be possible to make an alteration in the case of persons already enjoying that scale, though allowances are more akin to the cost-of-living bonus than pay, and they are subject to revision from time to time.  If it is inexpedient to do so in regard to persons in the service, the new scale ought certainly be applied to fresh entrants.</P>
    <P>I will turn from the scale to the people who are drawing it.  The quotation I read from the Order mentions <Col N="1539" /> that rent allowance shall be paid to every member of the force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Deputy passes from the scale, I would like to be quite clear in regard to certain figures.  Where does the Deputy get the figure of 30/- a week?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Order.  It is pointed out that the figure can be increased at the discretion of the Minister for Justice.  I have not got a copy of the Order by me.  I left it in the Library because I thought other Deputies might want to refer to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Minister for the copy he has passed to me.  The rent allowance is set out at £13 per annum and the Minister for Justice shall have power to increase this to a sum not exceeding a maximum of £18.  Did I say 30/- a week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry; what I meant was £30 a year.  I withdraw the argument as to the scale; the other argument still stands&mdash;the argument as to the number of people who may enjoy it.  I am very grateful to the Minister for setting me right.  The argument regarding the number of persons who can draw the allowance still stands.  Every member of the force for whom, or, if married, for whose family, official quarters are not available, shall be made a certain allowance.  There may be other Orders modifying that by restricting permission to marry.  If the Minister can tell us that, my point will be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the face of that Order it looks as if any member of the Gárda is entitled to get married and, if there are no official quarters available, he can claim for his family from 5/- upwards.  Rent allowances increased in the current financial year from £15,000 to £21,000. Three hundred more Gárdaí are getting the allowance than in 1925, and there are 520 more getting it than there were in 1924.  At present one-sixth of the force are drawing rent allowance. Is it possible for this process to continue? Is it possible for practically <Col N="1540" /> every member of the force to get married and draw rent allowance, except of course, those for whom quarters are available?  If so, it is going to become a very serious charge on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>We are spending over £100,000 in the current financial year on the reconstruction of barracks for the Gárda. The possibility is that by the time these barracks are finished all the Gárdaí will have married and they will be living out except in those barracks where quarters are provided.  There ought to be some restriction on the process of marriage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>There is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we will hear of it from the Minister.  I hope his standard will be that not more than one-third of the force are entitled to get married on the strength.  Marriage does not altogether improve a policeman's efficiency.  It renders him too content, too apt to seek the joys of his home and not pursue the malefactor about the roads.</P>
      <P>My second point is in regard to boot allowance.  The boot allowance of the Gárda is 1/6 per week.  I am not saying that the Gárda ought not to get a boot allowance, and I am not saying that too many men are getting it; but I would like to know if the men employed at clerical work in offices get boot allowance as well as the Gárda patrolling the roads.</P>
      <P>In Northern Ireland the police get 1s. 6d. per week, but in England, as the Minister told us, the scale has been reduced to 1s. per week.  The Minister may take an example from Northern Ireland.  There they can afford all kinds of luxuries.  I was reading the leading article in a Belfast paper, and it pointed out that each member of the Cabinet in Northern Ireland costs the taxpayer £700 a year more than a Minister of the Executive Council in the Free State.  Incidentally, I do not expect to see that article quoted in one particular Dublin newspaper.  In Northern Ireland they can afford expensive shoe leather, but I suggest that the time has come here for a revision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The London pavements will wear the soles of a policeman's boots just as well as the Dublin pavements.  I do not <Col N="1541" /> know if the tariff on boots has sent up the cost of repairs to such an extent as to justify an allowance 50 per cent. more than is given in Britain.  It may seem a small thing, but 6d. per week per man amounts to £9,000 a year.  I believe we can save that £9,000 without imposing an undue hardship on the police force.  This Order should be reconsidered and a new Order brought in.  I do not want to abolish this allowance altogether, but we should endeavour to restrict its issue both in regard to amount and the number of people entitled to draw it.</P>

      <P>I was not aware of that, but in any case I am quite willing to discuss the Order in detail on its merits, and if there is a feeling that it should be amended steps can be taken to that end.  The rent allowance is challenged now, not on the scale, but merely on the question of the number of beneficiaries or possible beneficiaries.  The Deputy quite fairly admitted, I think, that there would be less force in his argument if there was a restriction on marriage within the Gárda.  The position, of course, is, as the Deputy will notice, that the disciplinary order to which he referred in passing deals with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes.  For want of a more convenient method of dealing with it, the matter is disposed of in that disciplinary order to which the Deputy referred.  Members of the force may not marry without permission. The Commissioner and Senior Officers use their discretion as to whether or not, in a particular case, <Col N="1542" /> that permission will be given.  For one thing it is not given until there seems a reasonable certainty that a man will remain in the force and that he has reached a standard of competence which is satisfactory, and that he is likely to be permanently in the force. It is a matter of policy to discourage marriage on the part of men who are still on probation, and who might be dismissed simply on the ground of conduct or general lack of suitability for the life.  Efforts are made to provide official quarters for married members, and it is possible in many stations throughout the country to arrange for accommodation of that kind.  I do not think we need envisage a case of the Gárda entering on a venture of matrimony simply for the sake of getting £13 a year extra in his pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be a bad bargain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>But taking the thing broadly you cannot recruit six or seven thousand men like that, and take the line that they must not marry or be allowed to marry.  Some limitations are imposed, but just as in the Army or in the Civil Service, or any other career if a man marries there must be some accommodation for him and for his family either in official quarters or else he must get some small allowance of this kind to live outside.  £13 a year is not, I think, too liberal an allowance, and the discretionary power invested in me to increase that sum is not lightly exercised, and not exercised without very full examination of the merits.  So I am not in favour of any alteration of that portion of the Order. Passing to the only other portion of the Order challenged, that dealing with boot allowance, the position is as the Deputy has stated.  There was a boot allowance in 1914 to the R.I.C. of 6d. a week, and the Desborough Commission recommended an increase in that to 1/6 a week.  In England and Scotland that has since been reduced to 1/- a week.  Here and in Northern Ireland it remains at 1/6 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that that allowance had been reduced elsewhere did not escape notice.  But the Minister for Finance did not press for a reduction here to <Col N="1543" /> 1/- a week on the ground that a reduction of pay had taken place here which had not taken place in the neighbouring police forces.  As I pointed out, in dealing with the Estimates, we are between 14 and 15 per cent. lower in our rates of pay than the neighbouring police forces.  If we felt that the pay was too high, or taking it generally, the remuneration, in one form or another, received by the Gárda for a period of a year, was too high, I would prefer we faced reduction in pay rather than approach it along the lines of reducing this allowance.  It is something we have allowed to stand in view of the substantial cut in pay which has been carried out.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Deputy raised anything else.  If there is a feeling that simply because the rate of the boot allowance was reduced in England and Scotland it should be reduced here, Deputies will have to weigh up that, having regard to the fact that we effected a substantial reduction in pay which has not taken place elsewhere. Personally, I am not in favour of reducing, this year, the boot allowance, and the Minister for Finance, considering the case on its merits, and having regard to the reduction in pay that has taken place, did not urge it on my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there was some point in what Deputy Cooper said.  If I understood the Minister aright, his suggestion was that he would prefer diminished pay and keep up allowances.  I doubt if that is a good plan to work upon.  The particular point I am concerned about is in reference to the boot allowance.  Would it be fair to assume that this is really one of the cases in which we are drawing from one pocket and paying into another, that because of the Customs duty on boots we are maintaining the boot allowance?  I think it ought to be considered in reference to such allowance that it is not to be regarded as the sum necessary in order to provide a particular article.  If an extra sum be required to provide a particular article owing to the use that article is put to, that is the meaning of the allowance. <Col N="1544" /> Everybody spends money on boots, but if we allow a man 1/6 extra weekly because we assume he uses his boots more than anyone else, and that it costs him that much extra, that seems to be, roughly, the way to look at the allowance.  The amount seems very high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Thrift.  I do not think it is a sound principle to maintain the allowance while reducing the pay.  I think the first pruning should be made on the allowance rather than the pay. The Minister has met me very fairly and answered most of my arguments, sound and unsound, but I would urge him to fix a definite standard for the number of married men.  Otherwise it puts any officer who has sympathy with his men, and who is anxious to help them, in an almost impossible position. He cannot very well refuse a man whom he likes and knows to be a good policeman who comes to him and asks to be allowed to get married.  If there is a definite scale he can say: &ldquo;I am afraid there is no vacancy.&rdquo;  If you have not that scale the officer is almost forced to put up the case and recommend it strongly.  I would urge the Minister to adopt a fairly liberal standard, more liberal than we have at present, because you must allow for a certain amount of married men in a force consisting of young men, most of whom have less than three or four years' service.  I consider there should be a definite limit fixed.  Considering each case on the merits may sound ideal, but it cannot be ideal because some people are more stony-hearted, while other people are more accessible to pleas of sentiment.  I believe that the fixing of a standard is the only way. At the same time the Minister has met me and explained many things not previously clear to the general public, and I ask the leave of the Dáil to withdraw this motion.</P>

      <P>On sub-head 5, I should like to ask the Minister if he has any basis for the calculation of the amount&mdash;£1,000&mdash;for conveyance of surrendered arms?  Has he any means of ascertaining whether that amount will cover the service?  Does he know exactly where these arms are, where they will be required to be conveyed to, and whether they will be lifted this year or not?  Has he anything to put before us to assure us that this sum of £1,000 will be spent this year for this service?</P>

      <P>The sum put down is an estimated sum.  I could not inform the Deputy whether 300 or 500 people will receive permits from the Gárda to get these arms returned to them or not. But I know that we have a very large quantity of arms in store.  I think there is also a large quantity still in England to be transferred.  Whether the people will come along in large numbers and whether delivery will be expedited in such a way that it will involve the sum of £1,000, I am not in a position to say.  All we can do is put down what we think, from past experience, is a reasonable sum to cover the service.  It would be impossible for <Col N="1547" /> anybody to estimate the sum with any exactness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I was under a misapprehension. I take it that this sum of £1,000 is to cover the cost of handing back arms to people who surrendered them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought your hopes were rather high.  On sub-head K, may I ask the Minister&mdash;reverting to a question I frequently ask in this connection&mdash;whether in estimating the cost of provisions per person he has taken into account what other people who are not in the Army are allowed, by way of wages, to purchase provisions? On this basis&mdash;not an unreasonable basis, I admit&mdash;we would get some clue to the amount of wages a workman should earn if he is to keep himself and his family in something like comfort, speaking dietetically.  It is useful to know that, with wholesale purchase of provisions, the men in the Army require this sum to keep them in health.  I deduce from that that a man working in an ordinary occupation in civilian life would require just as much food, purchased retail, and that, therefore, he would require wages commensurate with the sum involved in the purchase of rations.  I estimate the sum at 11/2 per week per man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to enter into the question as to the amount a man is entitled to get for the maintenance of himself and his family.  I prefer to leave that question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. We estimate that it takes 1/7 per day per man to feed our soldiers, giving them a fairly decent ration.  The other question as to wages does not concern my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the difference between one Minister and the other.  The Minister for Defence feels that it is necessary that the men in the army should be fed.  Other Ministers do not take that question into consideration, and they fix wages at a sum less than would enable the men concerned to feed themselves and their families on the scale deemed necessary for the army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I move to reduce sub-head M by £30,000, which, in fact, represents the excess of this sub-head over the previous year.  It is £123,000 this year.  Last year it was £93,000, and the year before £85,000.  When I put down this amendment I had not the advantage of having the Minister's opening statement on these Estimates, and I put it down with a view to obtaining an explanation of this considerable increase.  The Minister gave it when he was opening the general discussion on the Estimates by saying that last year the army had quantities of clothing on hands, and I suppose that was also the case in 1924.  At the same time I do not know if there are any quantities of clothing still on hand, and whether this is the highest figure that this Vote is going to reach, because it is unduly high.  The annual cost of clothing per man is a little under £8. I think that calculation is right.  I have taken it that we have 12,500 N.C.O's. and men in the army at present, and £99,400 is the item put down for their clothing.  That works out at nearly £8 a head&mdash;£7 19s.  I think.  That is considerably in excess of the British rates.  But it is very hard to get the exact British rates, because they are complicated by so many auxiliary forces, territorials and so on, who do not wear uniform all the year round. The best basis of comparison I have been able to get is the figure given me by the Minister as to the cost of clothing supplied to a soldier on enlistment. The cost of the clothing supplied to the members of our Army on enlistment is £14 15s.  The cost of clothing of the British infantry soldier&mdash; and I think that is the fairest comparison, for there is no use in comparing the National Army with the Life <Col N="1549" /> Guards or with the bandsmen in the British Army, who get scarlet tunics and all sorts of extra equipment&mdash;the cost of clothing of the British infantry soldiers, including allowances for upkeep, is £12 15s. 3d.  That is to say, our initial cost is £2 per head more than the cost of the British infantry soldier.</P>
      <P>It is natural and inevitable that our cost should be higher than the British cost, because they are buying on a larger scale, and for some of the articles required they have set up a factory.  I do not want to make an unfair comparison, but I do say that an excess of £2 is inclined to be too much of a difference in the cost of the initial outfit.  I do not want our soldiers to be badly clothed; I do not want the Minister to go out and buy shoddy material for our soldiers because it will not pay in the long run, but I am inclined to think that we are spending too much on clothing.  The expenditure is increasing and will increase if it is not drastically checked.  Therefore I move the amendment standing in my name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Cooper does admit that when putting down the amendment he had not the full facts of the case before him.  He is quite right when he compares the cost of the British Army's initial outfit and ours.  The difference is practically £2. When you come to the replacements in subsequent years, the figures do not altogether bear this out.  Our subsequent annual cost is £10 as against £9 16s. in Britain.  There is not much point in that.  The point is that our materials and our clothing are bought by the Contracts Committee, not purchased directly by the Army.  They are purchased through the Contracts Committee, who transfer the charge to us. Along with that, the reason given by Deputy Cooper is quite correct.  There was a good deal of clothing on hands last year.  At the time when we had 55,000 men in the Army, clothing had to be got for them and got hurriedly, and perhaps at that particular time it was not the very best.  Everyone, I suppose, will agree that when you have to do things in a hurry you do not do them so very well as when you have <Col N="1550" /> leisure.  That stock of clothing is practically exhausted.  We are starting a Reserve this year, and that Reserve will have to be clothed and equipped.  The reason for the abnormal sum this year is because of having to clothe and equip the Reserve.  That equipment must be got, and it might be looked upon as a capital investment because the Reserve clothing will last a man as long as he is in the Reserve, probably six or seven or ten years.</P>
      <P>That is one of the reasons why the cost seems to be so heavy this year.  I do not think that beyond that there is anything that I can say that would give an explanation that the Deputy might accept.  The reason is, as I say, that a Reserve is being formed, and this Reserve, consisting of 4,500 men, must be clothed.  The expenditure on this clothing will be a capital investment. These clothes will be kept in store to be handed out each year to the soldier going on training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us whether the surplus stocks of boots, coats, blankets, etc., that were referred to as being on hand on October 31st have been taken into account in estimating for these requirements? Or whether it is thought that these stores, having been bought in particular circumstances, are now unsatisfactory, and are to be all disposed of and new stores provided?  Perhaps the Minister does not recognise what I am referring to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I do, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 3,660 pairs of boots, supposed to be valued at £2,867, surplus on 31st October, 1925; 20,000 great-coats, valued at approximately £40,000; 85,537 blankets, valued approximately at £14,000, and so on.  What I desire to know is whether, taking those surplus stores into account, it is proposed to call upon them to make up the requirements that the Minister has now outlined, or whether it is proposed that these old stores should be disposed of at a price which it is estimated under sub-head Z&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid, at £23,000, while the value is estimated to be £77,000.  In general, what I desire to <Col N="1551" /> know is whether it is intended to call upon this old surplus for the purpose of renewing the requirements, or whether they are to be sold because of unsuitability for the new needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>The surplus of the articles that the Deputy mentions is there, with the probable exception of the boots.  A soldier gets two pairs of boots in the year, and I think that surplus must be absorbed by now from October last.  But as far as great-coats or blankets are concerned we are not purchasing any; we are keeping what is in stock, and they should last us for a couple of years more.  The clothing we are purchasing now is the ordinary regimental suit and the outfit that the soldier gets, first and foremost what the recruit gets on coming in, and then the replacements every year.  We are not purchasing great-coats or blankets, but if anyone wants to buy a couple of thousand blankets we will be very happy to consider any reasonable offer. We have considered some.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would be able to satisfy our curiosity if he would see whether there are among the Gárda Síochána any considerable number of men whom these boots would fit.  We saw some of these boots, and one might imagine that they were built for experimental voyages across the Atlantic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has met my amendment by putting forward two arguments.  The first is that though he agrees that our initial cost of outfit is about £2 above the British, our cost for renewals and replacements compares very much more favourably. I accept the statement, but I want to remind him that ours is a short-service Army, a two years' service Army, shorter service than the British, and the result is that every two years you have to give men these expensive initial outfits.  I suggest re-organisation on these lines&mdash;a cheaper initial outfit and greater latitude of replacement for these men who are prepared to stay in <Col N="1552" /> the Army for longer than two years. Surely that would be an economy on the whole.  The second argument that the Minister brought forward was that the increase in the Vote was due to meet the cost of the Army Reserve. Are we going to buy the clothes before we have a Reserve?  How many men have we enrolled in the Reserve?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>None.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore we are to provide the clothes before we have the men, and before we know the sizes of the men.  We are to buy stock sizes in the hope that the men will fit the clothes.  This is a case for a Supplementary Estimate.  We do not know what the sizes of the men will be.  You may find small men of better character than big men, and vice versa.  Also, the clothing will not be improved by being kept in store.  If you go into any mobilisation store and examine clothing you find that it needs constant care.  Let us get the men and then buy the clothes, and in any case when we have a Reserve let us not include them under sub-head M: let the Reserve come into its proper place under the Army Reserve sub-head, so that we will know exactly what it will cost. There is already an item under Army Reserve&mdash;&ldquo;Clothing, cleaning and fumigating after training.&rdquo;  You are going to put the clothes under one sub-head and to clean and fumigate them under another.  I suggest that we should have the total cost of the Army Reserve under that head, and that the Minister should not throw the clothing of the Reserve into the general Army Vote.  It makes all comparisons difficult. The clothing of the Reserve, who only come up for three weeks' training, will have a much longer life, even if it does deteriorate in store, than other clothing that is worn every day.  I am going to press my amendment, because this is bad estimating and bad policy, and I am not satisfied that this clothing is needed at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that a Deputy with the experience of Deputy Cooper should put forward the proposition that you should first get men, and when you had them you should <Col N="1553" /> clothe them.  That is a proposition that I am sure the Deputy does not put forward seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">

    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>We are establishing a Reserve, and we propose to call them up for a period this year.  If I were to take men off the street, every one of whom had a different type of suit, and some of them, perhaps, with not very much of a suit at all, put them in with people who have uniforms and send them out on the streets, I am sure the Deputy would come to the House in a tearing rage and ask what the Minister meant by sending out men to make such a show of the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason why I want to have clothing for them <Col N="1554" /> before they come in.  With regard to the point that the Deputy makes about sizes, everyone knows that no matter what force you have, you buy clothing in certain stock sizes, and it works out fairly well, taking it all round.  You do not have all small men or all big men; you have them big and little, and the clothing is bought accordingly. Size 5 fits a certain size of man and size 6 another, and so on, and surely nobody would be foolish enough to order all size 6 or all size 10.  You want a proportion of each, and I think the policy of having the clothing before you get the men to put into it is a good one.  If we waited until October to get clothing for men we would have in September that policy might then be condemned by Deputy Cooper much more than he has condemned the present one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to move my next amendment.  I want to make a few remarks under the sub-head. I do not propose to move the amendment because I put it down before the Minister explained that the increase in sub-head N was due to the fact that he has transformed part of the mechanical system in transport to horse-transport.  That is borne out by <Col N="1555" /> the fact that there is a substantial reduction on mechanical transport.  It is £29,000 this year, and it was £47,000 last year.  A saving has been effected greater than the increase in this Vote. I should like to say that so far as transport is concerned I welcome the Minister's decision.  It will make for economy and the Army will not suffer from the point of view of efficiency. To me it is a better sight to see a waggon drawn by two horses which are well looked after than to see a motor lorry going about emitting poisonous smoke.  It has an additional advantage.  The motor lorry uses imported petrol while the horse is fed on Irish hay and oats.  So far as transport is concerned, I am glad the Minister has made this change.  He said the change was due partly to that and partly to the decision to bring artillery up to strength in horses. There is at present a tendency in the armies of the world to do away with horse transport for artillery and to rely on motor transport.  There are machines called &ldquo;dragons&rdquo; which carry a crew of men and at the same time act as tractors.  They are something of the tank type, but are open. They have caterpillar tracks like tanks and can haul the guns over the ground. They are still in the experimental stage.  I cannot help thinking that the artillery is not up to strength in horses.  It is very discouraging for an artillery officer if he cannot turn out his guns because he has not sufficient horses for them.  It might be wise if the Minister experimented with horses in one battery and in the other with mechanical transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am inclined to think that so far as transport is concerned the horse is done.  Artillery has sometimes to cover great distances in a comparatively short space of time.  A horse cannot do it but a tractor can.  But in your ordinary supplies you do not need the same speed.  If you need mechanical transport in time of war, which we all hope we may not see, you can commandeer civilian lorries.  So far as artillery is concerned there is a difference.  I suggest the Minister may be unwise in still pinning his faith to <Col N="1556" /> the horse.  I am not moving the amendment, as I do not want to challenge the decision of a Minister, but I suggest, in the coming year, he might get some artillery officer to look into the question of transport.</P>
    <P>I turn from that to the fact that there is in this sub-head a sum of £3,000 for chargers.  That appears to me to be a large sum.  Assuming that you can buy a charger for £60, and I think that is an outside estimate because you can get a very good trooper for £30, that means a charger for fifty officers.  We have only sixty-four officers above the rank of commandant and I imagine some of them have chargers already.  I hope the Minister, when he deals with the Vote, will tell us what is the necessity for this comparatively large number of chargers, because if ever there was an army in which a large number of officers did not require to be mounted, it is our Army.  Our proportion of officers to men is large; our units are small, and it is when you have large bodies of men operating over a wide area that officers need chargers.  If chargers are going to be issued to infantry officers there is less justification for them in our Army than in any other European army.</P>
    <P>We have fewer men than last year, yet it is necessary to vote £3,000 for chargers as against £800 last year.  On these two points I would like to have some explanation from the Minister.</P>

      <P>As regards the Estimate for medicines, I notice that the sum put down is £1,450.  That does not include the pay of veterinary officers.  We have two of these officers at £766 per annum.  We have not been told the number of horses in the Army and I would like to know how many we have, but in any event the sum of £1,450 for medicines appears to be colossal.  For feeding, the sum is £23,200, and for shoeing and stable accessories the amount is £1,885.  Are horses going to cost us as much in medicines as in shoes?  Any farmer will tell you that a farm horse costs practically nothing for medicine.  If you have 1,500 horses the amount for medicine <Col N="1557" /> would represent £1 per horse, which seems to be grossly excessive.</P>

      <P>I notice that the Minister has increased the cost of forage very considerably.  It was £18,000 last year, and this year it is £23,200, whereas the cost of shoeing has only gone up by £85.  I presume extra forage means more horses, and if there are extra horses will not there be more shoes, unless, of course, shoeing is to be done less frequently?</P>

      <P>As regards horse transport, the greater portion of the estimate is for artillery.  Sometimes we have had to hire horses, not, perhaps, for team purposes, but for the purpose of mounting officers.  We also had to hire horses in order to mount officers who had to appear at parades and ceremonials.  This year we propose to bring the number of horses up to what are the normal requirements. Deputy Connor Hogan talks about a sum of £1,450 for medicines.  That represents a cost of £2 10s. 0d. per horse per annum, and includes veterinary attendance in places, for instance, such as Castletownbere and Buncrana.  If we were to send all the sick horses to the Curragh or to Dublin and to pay for their transport it would be very expensive. We have two veterinary surgeons, but they cannot be travelling at night all over the country from Donegal to Cork and Kerry.  They look after the horses generally, and look after the purchases, but when a horse gets sick we must call in the local veterinary surgeon.  I may say that the amount there represents the normal expenditure.  I do not think that we have any sum set aside for wastage, but I think it is quite apparent that there is bound to be some wastage where you have a number of horses.  Portion of what might be termed wastage comes in under Appropriations-in-Aid in cases where horses are sold.  The probability is <Col N="1558" /> that, from our experience last year, it was not necessary to put in any sum for wastage in the estimate.</P>

I would like to hear from the Minister what he has to say in defence of having any cavalry at all, merely for ceremony.  There is a good deal of curiosity as to the purpose for which a cavalry force, however small it may be, is required.  The question has been raised as to whether it is merely an adjunct to the police force to keep order on racecourses, or what is its purpose?  Is it a utilitarian service or merely an embroidery?  I think a little information on that point would be acceptable.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister has not a stud farm and is not breeding blood stock, so that certain operations have not to be carried out under this Vote.  You have 580 horses, and <Col N="1559" /> of that number I would like to know what percentage has been sick.  It is no information to say that you are estimating for a sum of £2 10s. for treatment for each sick horse.  What we want to know is how many sick horses are in the whole bunch.  I should say that not more than 20 of the horses would need the attention of a veterinary surgeon during the year&mdash;say, £70 or £80 a horse, for the sick ones.  There are two veterinary surgeons on the staff, holding officer rank, at a cost of £766.  What sort of treatment, I ask, must the horses be getting from those attending them if, in addition to the cost of the two veterinary surgeons on the Vote, extra veterinary attendance for the army horses costs £1,450?  The whole thing, to my mind, is a farce, and I am speaking now as a farmer who knows something about horses.  How many horses have we in Cahirciveen and Buncrana and how much per head are they costing?  What these horses cost is not detailed for us.  Horses in these outside posts are, I understand not attended by the staff veterinary surgeons who are in Dublin.  As far as I can make out, the sick horses in these outside places must be costing over £100 per horse.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gorey, as usual, has asked some very straight questions, and I think he deserves to get just as straight an answer.  He knows very well that he cannot compare a farm horse, a horse that gets six months' grass, with a horse that is stabled and hard-fed during the whole of the year.  The Deputy asked me how many sick horses we will have this year.  I cannot answer the question and neither can the Deputy tell me the number.</P>

      <P>The case I have made is that from our experience it takes £2 10s. per horse per annum for veterinary attendance and for medicines.  If Deputy Gorey thinks that the army can be run with quacks: that every time a <Col N="1560" /> horse gets sick in Cahirciveen or Buncrana or somewhere else you are simply to call in the local quack, who will simply give it a drench that may either kill or cure it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If that is the Deputy's conception as to how we should run the Army, I am afraid that if some day he should be Minister for Defence himself he will be subjected to more criticism than I am being subjected to now.  I know what horses are, because I have been reared amongst them.  I say that, taking into consideration that our horses are stabled and hard-fed the whole year round, the figure here for veterinary attendance and medicines is not an extravagant one.  The figure may work out at £2 or £2 5s. or some other sum, but the Estimate before the House is based on actual experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it based on a contract figure with veterinary surgeons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If you take into consideration that, say, we have two horses at a post, and that a veterinary surgeon has to be paid a fee for attending them when they get sick, it will be admitted, I think, that the figure put down in the Estimate is not an extravagant one.  I know there are farmers who never bring a veterinary surgeon about their place.  They are lucky enough not to require one, but there are other farmers who have a vet. about their place every week in the year.  I know that of my own knowledge, and this is a matter that you cannot make a hard and fast rule about.  This is an Estimate, and if the money is not required it will not be expended.  If, for instance, we underestimated for this service and had to come back in December with a Supplementary Estimate we would soon be told that we did not exercise much care in the preparation of the Estimate. The Estimate is, I submit, a reasonable one to enable us to provide a veterinary service for our horses.  I agree that if this figure were put down as the cost of veterinary attendance on farm horses it would be extravagant.  If any <Col N="1561" /> Deputy tells me that he has to bring a vet. to his place two or three times in the year, and that he is able to get that done for 5/- or 10/- a visit, I think he is making a great mistake, unless, of course, that vets. in some parts of the country work at a very cheap rate.  I know that has not been my experience in our part of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  You cannot do anything else except make an estimate as to what it is going to cost you per annum for horses of this class in the matter of veterinary attendance and medicine.  Deputies know very well that horses kept in towns must get medicine.  They know, too, that when anything goes wrong with a horse in a place like the Army you must call in a professional man.  If the officer or soldier in charge of the horses did not do that and if a horse died&mdash;Deputy Cooper will bear me out in this&mdash;the probability is that if the person in charge was not able to give a satisfactory explanation he would be tried for it.  That is the reason why these men must take precautions in the care of the horses.  From the nature of the case, I do not think that the estimate is an extravagant one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. CONLAN Mr. CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has explained that this particular item is divided under two headings, veterinary attendance and the cost of medicine. I contend it is a most unbusinesslike way to put the combined expenditure under the single caption of medicine. It leaves it to anyone to question the item of £1,450 for medicine.  If the items had been separated and put under different headings there might not have been so many questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the Minister's explanation, and it would convince me, even if I had not already known, that he is a townsman. I know that he is animated by the best intention in the world.  I want to know can we get the number of horses attended by these two veterinary surgeons, and how many horses are there outside of that?  The sum of £1,450 would buy 48 horses of that class, <Col N="1562" /> allowing £30 for each.  Therefore, I would suggest to the Minister that it would be more economical to kill the sick horses at once rather than spend so much for medicines and veterinary attendance on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fact.  I would advise the Minister to have a deal with the knackers.  It would be very interesting to get the number of horses attended by these two veterinary officers.  Will the Minister tell us?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>And how many outside that?  If we got the answer to these questions the thing would be so ridiculous that it would, perhaps, in other walks of life, be called a scandal.  I repeat in all seriousness the suggestion that whenever a horse shows signs of sickness he should be slaughtered. If care were taken with the feeding of the horses, an occasional feed of bran given or any ordinary precaution taken, there would not be so much sickness amongst the horses.  The Minister drew from his imagination a picture of the horses out on grass, and there is a certain amount of truth in it, but I say that if ordinary care were taken of the horse who is not out on grass there would not be such a difference between those two classes of horses as the Minister thinks. Speaking as a farmer with some experience of horses, I say that this expenditure of £1,450 cannot be justified, that it is waste of money and you get no return for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this amount, considering that it is for the entire army, is not out of the way.  Deputy Gorey says that £2 10s. per horse for medicine and veterinary attendance is extravagant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say anything of the sort.  I said that taking the number of these horses outside the veterinary jurisdiction it must amount to a much larger sum than £2 10s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I misunderstood you. <Col N="1563" /> Farm horses are, as a rule, free from disease, and give less trouble than any other class of horses, but it is a very different thing with bloodstock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my experience that the bill for any one horse might be very much in excess of £10 in the year.  If a veterinary surgeon is called to attend a horse in one of these outstations his fee may be from one guinea to two guineas per visit.  That would run up a bill pretty smartly.  On the whole, taking everything into consideration, I do not think it could be said that the expenditure is so very extravagant.  The number of horses is 580.  There might be an influenza epidemic or one hundred and one things might occur regarding the horses, which might cost a good deal of money, and the average would be much more than £2 10s. per horse.  On the whole, I do not think any case has been made for the reduction of this particular item.  It never pays to neglect the health of a horse.  If you do not take care of horses you will get no value out of them.  The two veterinary officers attached to the army could not possibly be running all over the place, but they probably have a general surveillance over all the army horses. Knowing from experience what veterinary bills can be I do not think the amount is out of the way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to remind the Dáil that the Minister took power to pay tradesmen, farriers amongst others, and I want to know whether or not the farriers are competent to deal with many of these horses.  In my experience a good farrier can deal with anything, such as a sore back, a collarbone, or a cracked heel.  I think Deputy Wolfe will agree with me in that. In a well administered mounted unit you do not see a veterinary surgeon in your stables twice a year.  Your officer or sergeant-farrier is able to look after the horses and to deal with ordinary complaints but not with epidemics, such as ring-worm or influenza.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You are not likely to have epidemics <Col N="1564" /> in the detached stations.  In the first place an officer ought to know if the horse has a simple ailment, and the veterinary surgeon should be called in only in the last resort.  I would ask the Minister if he would answer my question about chargers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to Deputy Cooper, I do not know whether it is seriously suggested that we should have a farrier every place we have two horses.  The very big bulk of our horses are shod by outside farriers. We pay so much for shoeing, the same as an ordinary individual would.  It is not possible to have a farrier in barracks to treat these horses when anything goes wrong with them.  As to chargers, certain of our officers must be mounted, artillery and others.  Nobody under the rank of Commandant gets or is allowed to keep a horse in the Army.  He is not allowed to have one even on forage.  It is only the necessary people and those who must in the ordinary way be mounted that are supplied with horses.</P>

      <P>We are buying horses this year for the purpose of bringing our mounted services&mdash;that is the officers&mdash;and the artillery up to the strength that we should have according to regulations.  On many occasions we had to hire horses, and it is not satisfactory from any point of view to have to do that.  My opinion is that we should have horses of our own for every service for which we require them, and for that reason we purpose this year to bring them up to the strength that is laid down in our regulations and no more.  I do not see that there is anything very wrong in that.  I cannot see anything wrong in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the medicines and the veterinary attendance are concerned, the estimate is, I believe, based on normal figures.  That is the best that can be done as far as estimating cost is concerned.  Deputy Gorey suggested killing them.  I am not going to take his advice.  I will not kill any horse or order it to be killed.  I will certainly <Col N="1565" /> try to cure a horse, or, if he is not suitable for the Army, I will try to sell him.  I will try to get the best price I can for him, and that will come back into the Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>

      <P>At the moment I cannot tell the Deputy the stations where horses are kept.  In the majority of stations at present there are horses, and the reason we are getting more horses is that we are breaking away from mechanical transport in towns and for going short journeys.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy thinks that we should get back to mechanical transport and that we ought to decry horse-breeding in the country, that we should bring in everything from America or somewhere else, that we should import petrol instead of buying our own oats and our own hay, of course I will think over it.  I believed when we were doing away with mechanical transport to a certain extent, or only using it where it was absolutely essential, that I was doing the right thing, that I was going to give a little fillip to horse-breeding in the country, that I was going to buy the hay and oats that the farmers tell us they cannot sell&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If he wishes to be consistent and is anxious to give a fillip to horse-breeding I think he would have taken up my suggestion. We have an estimate of £1,450 for medicine and attendance outside the areas that are attended by these particular veterinary officers.  If it costs £760 for the salaries of these two officers, would it not be as well to have a veterinary officer in every place where a horse is kept?  It would be just as economical as the present position and we would know where we were.  We would not be getting this bill for £1,450 for attendance and medicines.  We could have six officers now for that sum, and we would know that we were paying these officers.  At present we do not know what we are paying for.  I do not make this suggestion as something that ought to be carried out.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister could give us information to help us to understand the Vote, as to how many of the 580 horses are normally stationed in the Curragh and how many in Dublin.  If he could take these two stations we might draw some conclusion as to the remainder of the country. It should be noted that the £2 10s. per horse per annum that is estimated by the Minister, comes to £3 15s. when we add the salaries of the two veterinary officers, so it is a question of our dealing with the sum of £3 15s. per horse, on the average, per annum, for 580 horses.  I think Deputy Gorey has made a case for a further inquiry into this matter as to whether the experience of the past on which the Minister is now building justifies a continuance. I have no doubt the Minister is satisfied that it is costing this £3 15s. per horse per annum.  It is sufficient to justify the question as to whether the methods of administration and horse keeping in the past should be continued if it comes to so much money for medicines and veterinary services.  That is really the issue that is involved in this question.  It may be the experience all right, but does not the experience suggest to the Minister the necessity for a change?</P>

      <Col N="1567" /> I am not quite sure whether the Minister was very confident in saying that this average charge could be equalled in any ordinary horse-keeping establishment in the city.  I do not know whether there are any city horse-keepers in the House, whether horse-keepers of the present day or past days, who could give us any estimate of the veterinary cost of twenty or thirty horses in the city.  I would be very much surprised if it came to an average of £3 15s. per horse.  I wonder, for instance, if the Minister could find out by friendly inquiry what the veterinary cost was for Guinness's horses when they did all their business by horse traction, or even to-day, though I do not know if they do much horse traction at present.  I was greatly astonished to hear the Minister say that this is a normal charge for veterinary service for a large number of horses, and I think the criticism of Deputy Gorey would justify the Minister in making inquiry as to whether the experience of the past is a good one, or whether it does not indicate the necessity for a change in the administration of this particular service.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position, at the moment, to give Deputy Johnson the information he asks for.  I do not know how many horses there are in Dublin and how many horses there are at the Curragh, but I do know that we have 580 horses and that we are estimating for a certain sum of money for veterinary attendance and medicine for these horses.  Deputy Gorey says it would be cheaper to get twenty veterinary officers and to put one in every station where there are two horses.  I wonder did he take any trouble to calculate what twenty veterinary officers would cost.</P>

      <P>The Minister is inclined to take great credit to himself that because he estimates for a sum of £2 10s. 0d. per horse per annum that sum need not necessarily be incurred. I questioned him as to whether that was sound financial procedure or otherwise.  He has thrown down a challenge <Col N="1569" /> to us to show him that it is wrong.  I would refer him, first and foremost, to the several reports of the Committee of Public Accounts upon over-estimating, when the principle has been definitely laid down that an estimate should be based on the closest scrutiny, and on the nearest approach possible to what the actual requirements would be.  I speak as a member of the Public Accounts Committee of previous years.  We laid it down that all the estimating entailed the imposition of taxation and perhaps would entail a burden on the Exchequer in finding the money, either by taxation or by loan.  The Public Accounts Committee has always asked for an explanation from every accounting officer where an over-estimate came before them in the examination of the accounts. The Minister has drawn down the question of experience.  I can speak with some experience as a farmer.  I believe that no farmer would spend £2 10s. on veterinary attendance in the normal care of an animal, either for operations or attendance on an animal when foaling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. CONNOR HOGAN Mr. CONNOR HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>A farmer could not afford to do it.  To fix a sum of £2 10s. for each animal anticipates that each animal in the Army service will fall ill during the year.  Has he got what we call &ldquo;crocks&rdquo; down the country?  It appears he is putting down £2 10s. for medicines and veterinary attendance in respect of those horses outside the two stations where the officers are appointed.  We have two Veterinary Inspectors.  I presume one is stationed in Dublin and the other at the Curragh or in Cork.  How many horses are under their charge?  I presume it would not be an over-estimate to say that more than half of the 580 horses that the Minister estimates to be in the Army service at the moment are in those stations.  We have then 290 horses through the country, and yet it is on the total of 580 that the £2 10s. is based.  That represents £5 per horse outside the stations where the veterinary officers are doing duty.  If that is the <Col N="1570" /> proposal of the Minister I think it is absolutely indefensible.  Can you accept, A Chinn Comhairle, at this stage, an amendment to reduce this sub-head by £1,000?  I think £450 is ample provision, and I would be glad if you could take an amendment to reduce the Estimate accordingly.  If so I will move it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has invited us to rely on past experience of expenditure under this sub-head, and he has delivered himself into our hands.  I agree with what Deputy Connor Hogan said about over-estimating, and this particular sub-head is one in connection with which the Minister's predecessor over-estimated to a most serious extent.  I believe the process is still continuing.  I have the Appropriation Accounts for 1924-25 in my hand.  They are the most recent accounts that we have.  Under subhead&mdash;Animals and Forage&mdash;the Estimate was £48,032.  The actual expenditure was, I think, £15,152&mdash;less than one-third of the Estimate&mdash;and then the Minister asks us to rely on our experience of the expenditure in the past.</P>
      <P>The explanation given by the Department was that the upkeep charges of animals did not reach the extent anticipated.  Two years ago the Minister's predecessor applied for £15,000 to buy horses and to maintain and doctor them.  Now we are asked for £26,000 for maintenance alone, an increase of £11,000, although experience has shown that you can maintain the horses in the Army for £15,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson, Deputy Connor Hogan and I have had some experience in the Public Accounts Committee of the Minister's Department, and we have, in almost every branch of it, a violent tendency to over-estimate.  I believe that there has bee an over-estimation <Col N="1571" /> in this case, and, therefore, I wish to support Deputy Connor Hogan's amendment.</P>

While that might have been all right, it is a fact which I can stand over in this Dáil that we must estimate for the particular class of animals that we want at a particular price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>No, sir.  We purpose to buy a certain number of horses this year, and the prices set down for them <Col N="1572" /> are £35 for one class, £60 for another, and £30 for draught horses.  Is it contended that the prices are extravagant, and that they cannot be obtained by an ordinary man at a fair for a reasonable class of animal?  I do not think the prices are excessive.  I do not think the farmer would consider that he was getting too much if he got £30 for a draught horse of five years of age, and I do not think that many farmers would like to sell animals that would make chargers at £60.  I do not think they will.  As far as the medicines are concerned, that is what the whole hubbub is about, because it is a small item that people can grasp hold of.  That is the whole reason of this hour's talk.  I am standing for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That sub-head O be reduced by £5.000.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of those Votes that show a very considerable increase over last year.  Last year it was £34,035, and this year it is £52,515.  The Minister explained that to a certain extent by saying it was due to the purchase of carts.  He indicated that the increase was largely due to the purchase of carts and Army Signal Corps stores.  I confess curiosity in regard to this item of £13.631 for Army Signal Corps <Col N="1573" /> stores.  Had they no equipment in the past?  As a rule there is not much equipment beyond a few batteries and repairing apparatus for telephones; it is not equipment that deteriorates very much with use and, in the circumstances, the expenditure of £13.631 requires explanation.</P>
    <P>Deputies will notice that the stores in connection with the Aviation section show a considerable reduction.  Last year the Aviation section took £12,800 worth of stores; this year they are only given £4,900.  That is a reduction of nearly £8,000.  This Vote is increased by over £25,000, an increase of about 76 per cent. on last year's Estimate.  Any increase of that kind obviously requires justification.</P>
    <P>We get many useful things from this Vote&mdash;steel helmets, field kitchens and various other types of equipment that it is proposed to buy.  These are very useful things and they are necessary to an army; but there is one item I can lay my finger on&mdash;it is on the top of page 267&mdash;dealing with armourer's equipment, targets and miscellaneous items, and the amount is £5,578. Armourers' equipment ought not require renewal on a great scale; armourers' equipment usually is composed of tools that last a long time, such as pliers and things of that kind. They do not wear out in one or two years unless very badly used.  Targets are not expensive things.  They are made of paper and the lightest form of wood and they could be patched up by pasting fresh paper over them.</P>
    <P>I dislike the word &ldquo;miscellaneous,&rdquo; because I always think that when a Department does not specify what it wants, it is going to be extravagant.  I think we should economise to the extent of £5,000 on miscellaneous items. I suggest that this reduction should be made.  I have already accused the Department of over-estimating.  Basing myself upon the lessons of experience, as the Minister wishes me, I find his is a sub-head that has been grossly over-estimated in the past.  In 1924-25 the estimate for general stores was £114,000.  The expenditure was not £100,000, and it was not £50,000; it was £27,800.  In other words, less than one <Col N="1574" /> quarter of the amount estimated for was spent.</P>
    <P>I believe it is the practice of the Department of Defence to over-estimate strongly, under this sub-head, in order that they may have funds to meet overcharges under other sub-heads if there are unforeseen overcharges.  On other sub-heads they say, for instance, &ldquo;we will not buy limbers or G.S. wagons or some signalling stores,&rdquo; and they use their savings under sub-head O to meet these.  To my mind that is all wrong. The Department which has charges which it does not contemplate, in its Estimates, should not, except to a very limited extent, meet them out of savings on other sub-heads, but should come to the Dáil and ask for a supplementary estimate.  I am satisfied that this sub-head is inflated and that the whole of the stores estimated at £52,000 are not likely to be required this year.  I am proposing a very moderate reduction.  I believe that the total Vote can well stand a reduction of 10 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of questions which arise on this sub-head in addition to those raised by Deputy Cooper.  Perhaps it would be well to go through them now.  For instance, I would like some information about this £13,631 in respect of the Army Signal Corps' stores.  I think the caption &ldquo;watercarts&rdquo; is perhaps an error.  I do not quite understand what gymnasia equipment has to do with watercarts, but, apart from that, a large sum for Army Signal Corps' stores suggests some development of military policy.  Does this refer to any new method of signalling, or any new equipment regarding the Signal Corps?  I just ask for information.  Then, in regard to the Aviation section, the sum for stores is £4,902, as compared with £12,813 last year.  I do not know whether it is under this sub-head that one should raise the question of the purchase of aeroplanes.  Would they be considered as stores?  I presume not.</P>

      <P>I take it that under warlike stores aeroplanes might be considered. I would like further information in regard to the educational scheme.  There is a sum of £2,000 requested here in respect of initial equipment. Last year there was £300 asked for in respect of this.  I think we should have some information as to the development of this educational scheme, how far it has progressed and whether it is progressing on the lines as suggested and what is its present state.  There is obviously an increase in the equipment required and therefore I assume the scheme itself has developed rapidly and I invite the Minister to give us some more information in respect to this educational scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the heading &ldquo;School of Music&rdquo; there is a sum of £2,212 required for the equipment of bands.  I would like to know whether that is additional to the sum granted last year, or whether we are to take it that the moneys granted last year, or some of the moneys granted last year for these bands were not spent and that this is in fact a re-vote.  Perhaps the Minister would answer some of these questions and then we might get along a little better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the heading Deputy Cooper referred to, &ldquo;Armourers' equipment, targets and miscellaneous&rdquo; requires explanation.  We have an army reduced in numbers and consequently needing less attention.  It is not an army on active service.  It is not a question of assumption but of actual knowledge that the gun-shops, in the different stations were equipped and adequately equipped to deal with army stores, rifles, and so on, when the army was in an embryo state, when rifles needed attention and were in the hands of men who knew nothing about them and did not keep them clean. Now we have a fairly expert Army and it is in duty bound to attend to its arms.  Where this amount of money. £5,578, comes in I am at a loss to know. There is no doubt that we had the machinery to do armourer's work in the past, so this item must come in <Col N="1576" /> under targets or miscellaneous.  As Deputy Cooper has stated, targets can be procured in hundreds or thousands. In a Vote of this description, involving £5,578, we ought to know what &ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo; stands for, and also what the £13,661 that Deputy Johnson referred to, for the Army Signal Corps, is required for.  I think these details might be given to the Dáil.  The Minister has not given details under this sub-head.  We are at peace now and we have been at peace for three years and what is the necessity for these? This is a considerable amount of money and something that the country should have a clear explanation of.  The better explanation we have the better for the Ministry.  Can the Minister give us details of the different amounts coming under this Vote for &ldquo;armourer's equipment, targets and miscellaneous&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>I would like to address a couple of queries to the Minister.  The first query is in respect to the flags.  I see that there is £3,000 charged on the Vote for &ldquo;headquarter post and storm flags, battalion and corps colours.&rdquo;  Last year there was a charge of £1,160 for similar purposes. Surely the Minister should justify this extraordinary increase of practically £1,800.  The sum seems a colossal one.  I presume if flags are being given to the battalions that they are not worn out in the course of a year.  I believe that the flags for a battalion should last from 20 to 25 years.  That period does not seem too long.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to field-kitchens, I see there is £2,010 charged for their purchase. Last year a further sum of £2,400 was charged for field-kitchens.  Field-kitchens do not wear out in a year.  Presumably they have a fairly long life. <Col N="1577" /> Why is the Minister bringing in an annual charge of this kind?  It is roughly a stereotyped charge.  I think an explanation is due to the Dáil about these matters at a time when we have to scrutinise every penny spent on the public services.  I notice in this year's estimate a sum of £324 in respect of equipment for the Army School of Clerks, while last year £69 was spent. What is the meaning of &ldquo;equipment for the Army School of Clerks&rdquo;? Are you erecting a building for them or, as Deputy Gorey suggests, providing a few lead pencils?</P>

      <P>The Army School of Clerks is an institution that we are trying to build up within the Army.  In my opinion, it will be a very useful institution. The sum set down in the Estimate is for the purpose of providing equipment&mdash;desks and other requirements for the school.  If it is thought that we should not pay any attention to the education of the soldiers, whom we purpose putting into offices to do army clerical work, well and good.  In my opinion, this is proper expenditure and it is the right thing to do.  Soldiers may have a reasonable amount of education but may not be able to take up positions as accountants or even minor clerical workers.  We propose to make a start and to train these men as clerks in the Army, so that they will be able to do the work that civilians are doing.  When they leave the Army and go back to the world they will be able to take up positions which, I am sure, everyone would wish our soldiers to get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the field kitchens, the item was certainly in the Estimate last year, but we could not get delivery of <Col N="1578" /> the kitchens.  That is the reason the item appears again this year.  The kitchens are on order, but we have not got delivery yet.  They are not things that can be got by simply sending a post card to a manufacturer.</P>
    <P>The same remark applies to the flags. We decided last year to get colours for the battalions, but I am sorry to say we were not able to get them within the period.  We wanted to get them from manufacturers in Dublin who specialised in that particular line, but they were not able to deliver within the period.  The item again appears on the Estimates this year, but the flags were not purchased or paid for last year, and the money is part of what we had to surrender.</P>
    <P>As to the signalling item, I think it will be remembered that I stated in my opening remarks on the Estimates that the policy we intend to follow is not to have an army of riflemen.  It will be more an army of corps and services. The signalling corps of an army is one of the principal corps in it.  That corps has not been equipped.  The apparatus it has is of the very poorest description. It is not up to date in any respect. If Deputy Cooper had seen the makeshifts we had to use on manoeuvres last year he would immediately condemn the apparatus, and say, &ldquo;Wherever you get the money purchase a proper outfit.&rdquo;  We propose now to purchase proper equipment for the Army Signalling Corps, and we set down what, in our judgment, is a proper sum.  Amongst things that we want to get are wireless apparatus, direction-finding apparatus, cable wagons and wireless tenders. These are things we have not got.  All we have is some old stuff left over by the British, and that is falling to pieces. If we do not get proper equipment for this service it would be better scrap it altogether.  Anyone who knows anything about maintaining such services will agree that if they are not in a condition of reasonable efficiency it is better not to have them at all.</P>

      <P>We will leave them for the moment.  The reason I have <Col N="1579" /> given is the reason this Vote is swollen this year.  These things will last for years.  A good deal of the apparatus provided for here will not want to be replaced for years to come, but it is essential, if the corps is to be kept up to date, that these purchases should be made.</P>
      <P>The armoury equipment has been challenged.  That equipment was also of a very antiquated and dilapidated character.  It is necessary to have the arms overhauled.  It is for the purpose of having that overhaul done and keeping those weapons in the condition in which they should be kept that this apparatus is required.  To say that we should let those things lie in the store and go to waste is not good finance, as Deputy Connor Hogan would say. A good many of these arms have to be stored.  We are not using them and they are absolutely out of order. We are trying to get them back into a state of order, and that is why we must expend a reasonable sum on their repair.  We are doing nothing more than keeping them in proper repair.  I can assure the House that we are not wasting one penny on these weapons.  We are merely keeping them in a state of normal repair.  If we were to let things drift for a couple of years, the cost to the country would be considerably more than the sum that is being spent now.  The articles then might not be worth repairing.  Taking everything into consideration, I think the items that have been challenged in the Vote are justified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought we discussed the School of Music sufficiently last day.  It is our intention to have five bands.  We have three of these bands already.  A fourth is in the making.  We hope, before the end of the year, to have a fifth band.  The No. 1 band is in Dublin, there is another in Cork, and another at the Curragh.  The fourth band, when ready, will be sent to the Western Command.  There will be a band for each command and one at the Curragh as well.  We hope to get <Col N="1580" /> these bands into training this year.  We know what the actual cost of instruments and musical libraries is.  There are a number of pipe bands which we hope to have ready, too.  Some of them are now ready, so that battalions can have pipe bands in some cases.  The pipe bands do not cost very much.</P>
      <P>The scheme of education, which we have in operation, is an expansion of the scheme we started last year.  It is felt that we should try, as far as possible, to make our soldiers better citizens, by giving them some education while in the Army.  We have put down £2,000 for that purpose.  It is the intention to set up in each battalion a school for non-commissioned officers and men.  Looking at the matter from the national point of view, I think that is one of the things the Army should do.  If our soldiers are turned out better citizens by reason of the discipline they get in the Army, if they are better educated leaving than when they entered, I think the country will be well repaid for the money spent in this way. When these men go back to civil life, they will be sure of getting employment and they will be better citizens.  If we succeed in establishing these schools, and if we give our men a better education and a better outlook on life than they had, I am sure that their services will be better appreciated when they return to civil life, and that the State will benefit in the long run.</P>

      <P>The Minister has attempted to deal with the sum of £5,578 under the heading of &ldquo;Armourers' equipment, targets, and miscellaneous,&rdquo; and he has made the statement that some of the arms are in a bad condition, and that the rest of the arms are in such a condition that it will require the expenditure of this amount to set them right.  To ask us to believe that is to ask us to believe also that the officers and men and armourers neglected their duty&mdash;that there was utter neglect on their part.  We have had three years of peace since 1923. Very little ammunition was wasted even on practice since then.  Very few rifles were used for active service.  And we are to assume that the men did not pay any attention to the rifles, but allowed them to rust!  Otherwise they <Col N="1581" /> could not be in the dilapidated condition the Minister describes, because the timber casing does not deteriorate, and the rifles themselves do not deteriorate. A rifle could be as good after 50 years, with proper attention, as the day it came out of the armourer's shop.  Rifles would not deteriorate except by neglect.  I know that the soldiers' rifles were kept in fit condition by our present Army.  I know that the officers did their duty, at least in the area of Kilkenny, with which I was acquainted. To say that all the arms have been neglected and are in the condition the Minister has described, is to say that the officers and men and armourers did not do their duty, that they neglected their arms, and that we have been paying armourers for doing nothing.  I saw the armourers' shops in some places and they were well equipped, equipped to deal with their share of an army of 30,000 or 40,000 men on active service, when the men did not know how to use a rifle and when the rifles had to go to the armourers' shops twice as often as if the Army was an experienced one.  How the position that the Minister has told us of has come about, I cannot make out.  If arms are put into store they need to be literally rubbed with vaseline or some heavy oil, and then they will require no more care.  How much would that cost?  From the amount shown here it would seem to cost almost as much as the arms themselves. How many of the arms are going into store?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister justified this £13,000 odd for signalling equipment by saying that the signalling equipment at present in use is very poor.  That must be a recent discovery. Two years ago the Minister was on the Committee of Public Accounts for a time, and left it on becoming a Minister. I was not on the Committee then, but I had the curiosity to read the evidence.  I do not know whether the Minister did.  The transaction of the purchase of signalling stores was queried by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and an officer of high rank gave evidence before the Committee and said that the signalling equipment was most superior, exactly the same <Col N="1582" /> type as supplied to the British army, absolutely new and first class, and well worth the money paid for it, which was the British army's standard price.  Now we are told that it is all hopeless. What has happened?  Is it neglect, as Deputy Gorey says, or is it simply a desire for new things?  I would like to contrast this £13,000 for signalling equipment with the amount for the Irish Military College, which is to train officers of high rank&mdash;£13,000 for signalling and £10 for the Irish Military College&mdash;£13,000 for the wireless to carry the orders and £10 to train the men to give the orders.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that I know it as well as he does.  I know that you cannot buy many textbooks for £10.  Can the Minister tell us how much will be spent on the Irish Military College?  I hope that this is not a ha'porth of bread to an intolerable deal of sack, a ha'porth of brains to a wilderness of telephone wires.  I am not convinced by what the Minister has said.  I agree with all that Deputy Gorey has said, that if Army equipment is properly looked after, it lasts for years and does not deteriorate, and if, as the Minister says, it has all gone wrong, then it has not been properly looked after, and somebody ought to have been made responsible. It is not the armourers' equipment that needs to be overhauled, but the Estimate.  Every officer naturally wants to get money spent on his department. He would not be worth his salt as an officer if he did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Minister for Defence, in the kindness of his heart, has been <Col N="1583" /> accepting exaggerated Estimates.  He has not been a Minister for a very long time, and he has not been able to go into the Estimates fully and check them, and I regret that he has not the backing of the Minister for Finance at present, because the Minister for Finance has longer experience, and I would be very curious to hear his views on this subject.  I feel that this cut of £5,000 could be made in this Vote without inflicting the slightest injury to the service.  I believe that if we get questions such as Deputy Connor Hogan has put answered that some of these things that are ordered here will not be delivered this year, and in the interests of economy, in the interests of correct budgeting and correct estimating, I think we should not allow such an exaggerated Estimate to be passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. CONNOR HOGAN Mr. CONNOR HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's defence of his Estimate is singularly unconvincing; in fact, in listening to his explanation one gets lost in the wilderness.  He tells us that this sum of £3.000 for flags is in fact a revote. But last year's provision was only £1,160, and the Minister's explanation was that the Irish manufacturers to whom the contract was entrusted were unable to deliver.  So that it appears the principle is that while we wait we pay.  It was only £1,160 last year, and it is £3,000 this year, or an excess sum of £1,840.  I think that is hardly a fair proposition to put up, that because those people were unable to deliver the flags last year&mdash;for presumably the Minister must have contracted, since he put the item of £1,160 in his Estimate&mdash;they must in this year's Estimate get a sum of £1,840 more.  I submit that, not alone should Deputy Cooper's amendment be supported, but that the sub-head should be resisted altogether and that the House should refuse to pass it.  Take the matter of field kitchens. Did the Minister not definitely decide the number of field kitchens he would get last year and the price at which they were to be delivered?  Had he not this contract entered into, and, if he had not why did he come forward with this sum?  Surely he must have known his requirements, and should have had <Col N="1584" /> some knowledge in advance.  His defence was that it is not easy to get these field kitchens, but he must have taken some steps to ascertain whether they could be delivered in the year or not.  If he did not, and if he put down this Estimate in a haphazard fashion, I say that he has not treated the Dáil fairly and has not exercised a proper spirit or a correct attitude in dealing with questions of finance.  That is a very serious statement to make, I am aware, but on the Minister's own explanation I base my case.</P>
      <P>The Minister ignored the question with regard to the Army School of Clerks.  I asked why was there an increase in equipment, and he ignored the question.  He went on to state that when we send men out of the Army we should give them a chance in civilian life.  That was the gist of his statement.  I am not questioning the principle.  But what I asked was, why this sum under the head of equipment in the Army School of Clerks was £69 last year and £324 this year?  Remember it is only equipment.  It does not deal with the salary of the instructor or the teacher.  It is for small equipment, such as pencils, papers, and books.  The Minister has not put up any defence in that matter.  Now, in respect to tip-carts, there was £2,240 last year in respect to purchases, and this year there is a sum of £1,000 for maintenance of G.S. wagons, tip-carts and sundry vehicles.  Last year there was a sum of nearly £700 in respect of maintenance.  I presume the Minister's figure in respect of these wagons represents fair and correct estimating, and that there is no such thing as overestimating and undue expenditure in any aspect of it.  On a sum of £1,000 for new equipment, does not a sum of £300 for repair this year seem rather excessive?  Some explanation ought to be given to the Dáil.  One cannot express any great satisfaction at the way the Minister has handled this Estimate. I feel bound to say that publicly, and I will not alone support Deputy Cooper's amendment, but I will actually challenge a division on this sub-head as a protest.</P>

      <P>I take it that in expending £2,000 on the educational scheme as a development of the departure entered upon and discussed last year, that there is provision for teachers and instructors and that it is not merely equipment for teachers.  I take it that under the head of &ldquo;Officers N.C.O.'s and Men&rdquo; a number of those persons have been allotted to the work of instructing the soldiers.  Whether that is so or not I have not been able to find in the Estimate, but I am assuming that that is the position. Otherwise we should have some explanation as to the proposal with regard to the appointment of teachers, whether they are to be brought in from outside or from the present staffs. However I think it is quite a good thing that this educational scheme should be proceeded with and extended. With regard to the Pipers' Bands there is a charge for the equipment of five pipers' bands, £534.  That is an average of £107 or so.  Last year the Estimate was for twenty-one pipers' bands and the average price appeared to be about £73.  I gather that twenty-one pipers' bands were not equipped last year, but that the five pipers' bands are expected to be equipped this year and the cost of equipment is 33? per cent. up.  That is not in accordance with the general trend, and, unless it is decided that the bands are to be larger and better equipped, it requires some explanation. I think it will be found on reference to the numbers in the bands that it is intended that the bands shall consist of greater numbers than those referred to last year.  I think the numbers in the bands this year&mdash;certainly in the Brass and Reed bands&mdash;are 38 per band, as against 25 a year ago.  I would like to ask the Minister to give us some information as to the policy of his Department in the purchasing of these various stores of the different kinds that have been mentioned and which appear on this Estimate.  Has it been decided to continue the old policy of purchasing second-hand materials, running the risk of rapid decay and discarding many articles as being unfit after delivery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we still in the way of purchasing from the Disposals Board, or are we <Col N="1586" /> going directly to the manufacturers for new material?  I would like to know whether there has been any regularised policy in that respect, whether the purchase of equipment for the Army stores is regularly and after consideration all of new material, or whether we are still in the stage of purchasing any considerable quantity of second-hand material or old Disposals Board material?  The information that we have gathered would, I think, rather lead to the conclusion that the policy of purchasing Disposals Board materials or second-hand stores was really not economical.  I am anxious to know from the Minister whether the old policy has been discarded, as this question has some relation to the next Vote, that is, sub-head Q, in respect of warlike stores.</P>

      <P>In the School of Music I regret to find that provision does not seem to have been made for cadets to be trained as band instructors. I understand when the School of Music was first conceived, the intention was to have it more than a school of instructors for instrumentalists; that it was hoped to have trained young men, perhaps of superior education, who would propose to make music a profession, and to have them trained as conductors of bands.  The Army were fortunate in obtaining the services of an outstanding man as director, a man who both in his profound knowledge of music and his mastery of the art of conducting, has reflected an extraordinary amount of credit on the Army and on the whole Service.  I feel that the best use is not being made of that outstanding personality if we are merely turning out instrumentalists. There is no doubt the School of Music is performing very good work in the sense that practically every man who becomes a qualified bandsman is one that is recognised as a master of a particular instrument, and you will have the position later on that for many of our musical combinations you will have a fund of instrumentalists of outstanding qualities to call upon, and the men who are trained in the School of Music will be able to earn a very sound livelihood by taking advantage of the <Col N="1587" /> training that is given to them.  The Minister has informed us that he is providing for new bands, and I would be anxious that those who take charge as conductors of those bands would be Irishmen, if possible, young men trained under our own director.  I think the opportunities are there, and perhaps a greater use could be made of the services of the director of the School of Music if his services were well availed of to train young men as cadet bandmasters.  I think the young men can be found, men of temperament, prepared to take up music as a profession with, perhaps, more than a primary education, with sufficient education to become masters and to take out a degree in music, and who, by some kind of working arrangement with our universities, could qualify themselves in the other sections of musical education required to get a man a degree in music.  If that were done, if provision were made for three or four or five more cadetships, we would be in a position in a few years, if through any misfortune we were ever to lose the services of our present outstanding director, that we would have the beginnings, at least, of a definite School of Music in Ireland, young men trained under one who was undoubtedly a master of his profession with a profound and wide knowledge of music, who has made very great strides in the adaptation of Irish music for the wider instrumentation of military bands. Young men so trained would lay the foundations for a definite School of Music with undoubted advantage, in fact, unplumbed advantage for the future of music in this country.  I hope the Minister will bear in mind this suggestion, and that it may be found possible to make some provision for securing such young men as I have suggested, to be trained as bandmasters who can be entrusted with the charge of the various bands who will go to the commands.</P>

He has not, but nobody could.  If the Minister for Defence had the eloquence of Demosthenes, the parliamentary ability of Gladstone and the vocabulary of Deputy Connor Hogan he could not have defended this Estimate.  Did anyone ever see such a hotch-potch accounted for to the last pound?  Here we have a figure of exactly £478 and then you have got a token vote of £10. The thing is not an estimate but a jumble sale.

      <P>The policy I have always adopted is to purchase new materials.  I have not advocated the purchasing of old materials.  I found in the Department the legacy that was left from the British when they were leaving the country.  I found scrap of all sorts and kinds and the reason, perhaps, that some of those estimates are so large to-day, or appear so large, is on account of that heap of scrap which was left behind for which we had to pay.  That policy is not my policy. My policy is to buy new materials on every occasion.  There were one or two occasions when we could not get the new article we wanted and we had to get articles re-conditioned.  We could not get the specific article we required new but, on the whole, all the goods we purchase at present are new.  That is my policy and will continue to be my policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCullough raised the question of cadets.  I am glad to say we have at present cadets in the Army School of Music.  I think we have three.  One of them has been there for nearly eighteen months and he is now able to go out and conduct a band.  I do not mean to say his musical education is finished.  It is not, but he is able to take charge of a band.  At present he is attending certain musical colleges and the other two men have been recommended by the best musical <Col N="1589" /> authorities.  I hope we will be able to train our young men and give them such a musical education as will be a credit to the country and the people who have the privilege of giving them tuition.  We expect to find teachers in the Army.  By giving them proficiency pay we will be in a position to carry on the school.  I might say, in connection with that that we have at the moment in the School of Music where there are a good many boys, an officer who has taken such an interest in the lads and who wishes so much to give them a better education, that he has devoted his time, about three evenings a week, to teaching them.  In fact he went out of his way to purchase materials in order to teach those boys and give them a better education than they had.  That is just an example of what some of our officers do.  I want to let Deputies know that he has done that at present without any remuneration whatever.  He has sacrificed his time in the evening by taking them in and giving them two or three hours' <Col N="1590" /> work in the school.  We shall be able to get men of that type without taking on whole-time teachers which would not be an economic proposition.</P>

Deputy Gorey made a great point about officers, arms, and all the rest, but he forgets that there were, perhaps, more than fifty-five thousand rifles in the country, and these were not all left in first-class condition.  There were bolts broken and missing, etc.  All these things require money to put them right.  They will not go to waste.  I do not believe in allowing anything to go to waste.</P>

      <P>I have been asked by Deputies from various parts of the House to suggest that we should adjourn over to-morrow.  Several Deputies find that they have not had the facilities which they needed to explore all sections of the Spring Show, and, perhaps, under the circumstances, it would be wise to adjourn until Tuesday.</P>

      <P>I want to demur.  I think that the practice of subordinating the national legislature to even educational institutions of great value such as the Spring Show is an unwise proceeding from the point of view of the prestige of the Dáil.  I think the old habit that another Parliament had of adjourning over Derby Day was very wisely abandoned, to the credit of that Parliament.  We adjourned to-day and lost practically two hours.  I raised no objection to that, but to continue the practice of subordinating the work of the Dáil to the convenience of members who want to attend a valuable function is very unwise.  It is a habit that could very easily grow, and it is one that we should not encourage.</P>

      <P>I suggest that if we can afford to lose a sitting on Tuesday and another on Friday, the state of public business must be such that I think it is a great hardship we should be asked to sit late on three nights in the week.  I admit that great value is to be gained from a visit to the Show. For instance, the Whips of the Government Party might learn a lesson from the display of the sheep dogs in the way <Col N="1592" /> of getting their followers into the division lobby.</P>

      <P>I am quite prepared to leave this question to an open vote.  The case put up by Deputy Gorey is one that I find very hard to resist.  It is made in respect of an industry the most important in the country.  A visit to the Show is of the very greatest educational value.  I certainly cannot afford to stand against this application, but I put it to Deputy Gorey and the House that we have now spent fifteen or twenty hours on two Estimates.  I suggest that public business should be done with more expedition, even allowing for the fullest consideration of the Estimates.  I think that in no Parliament in the world do the Estimates for public services get such a riddling as they get here.  I think we should make up our minds for an early adjournment.  As far as I am concerned, I am prepared to leave this question to an open vote.</P>

      <P>I think that Deputy Johnson has put the position rather unfairly.  He said that two hours had been lost to-day.  That is not so.  The Dáil met two hours later than usual, but there was no adjournment for tea, which meant that there was only one hour lost.  When I heard the point made that this great educational institution should not be availed of by Deputies it surprised me that it should come from a quarter of the House not closely interested in agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. MURPHY Mr. T. MURPHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice to-day that I would raise, on the motion for the adjournment, the dismissal of Mr. Maguire, a civil servant. When I raised this case at question time yesterday, I was given very considerable latitude in asking supplementary questions, but yet I feel that the position has not been made clear.  I am not satisfied that the man whose case I am raising has been fairly treated.  The facts are that Mr. Maguire was a civil servant with 25 or 26 years service.  He was practically the whole of that time in London. About the year 1923 he was brought over here, I think, at the request of the late General Collins.  He took up work in the Dublin Post Office as a sorter, and was afterwards promoted to the Secretary's office.  On 13th December, 1924, he was dismissed by order of the Executive Council.  The order dismissing him reads:&mdash;&ldquo;The Ministry of Finance is instructed by the Executive Council to inform you that you are <Col N="1595" /> instantly dismissed the public service, and you are now therefore relieved of duty.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>From that date until yesterday he has had no intimation of the charges that were made against him.  He has never seen the evidence on which he was dismissed, and he claims that the charges made against him were made for personal reasons.  He further claims that the people who are likely to have made the charges against him have since been found out, as it were, and have been dismissed themselves from any positions they held at the time, and have been entirely discredited. That would lead one to believe that the evidence forthcoming against him was evidence that was rather badly tainted and could not be relied on.  The President, yesterday, in his reply, said that the Executive Council found the performance of their duty in dismissing this official a very painful one, and that for that reason he had a very fair and impartial trial.  I am suggesting to the President that there is the possibility, and perhaps more than the possibility, that the Executive Council made a very serious mistake in this case.  There is the fact that this man denies absolutely the charges outlined in the President's answer yesterday. He denies that he was guilty of any attempt to overthrow the State.  He has made, and still makes, the demand that he should be heard in his own defence, and then he will be willing to accept whatever verdict is come to. Yesterday, when dealing with the case, I stressed the point that if this man had been a civil servant in Ireland before the Treaty was passed, he would have had very considerable protection under Article X of the Treaty.  The President replied, and very properly no doubt, that Article X did not absolutely define the position of any civil servant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you bear in mind the fact that this man claims to have carried out his work properly, and to have done nothing as a citizen that he was not entitled to do, I suggest that if he had been in employment in this country as a civil servant at the time of the Treaty the decision so hurriedly come to in his case would not, I imagine, have <Col N="1596" /> been arrived at so quickly Admitting that he was dismissed in connection with the Army troubles, I would like to come back to what happened then. The House will remember that the Army troubles took place in March of 1924, but this man was not dismissed until December, 1924.  I can understand the action of the Executive Council at that time, because all of us who were here will remember the position pretty well.  We can understand that quick action had to be taken in a matter of that kind, but action was not taken in this case until seven or eight months had passed, and it is rather hard to understand how that man, going into his office in the morning to perform his work, should receive a notice that he was instantly dismissed. I am making the point that this man's activities, allowing that they called for some action, were not, and could not have been, of so serious a character that action of this kind should be taken instantly.  I am suggesting to the President that the security of the State could not be endangered by having this case investigated at the time.  I am also suggesting that it was within the discretion of the Executive Council or this man's superiors to suspend him and tell him that certain charges had been made against him, that he would get an opportunity of answering them, and that he was suspended until he could disprove them.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the case is that he spent twenty-six years in the Civil Service and he is now in very poor health.  As a matter of fact, he is a physical wreck, and were it not for this particular matter, in the ordinary way, he would be now enjoying the pension he probably looked forward to as the result of long service.  I submit that the proper thing to have done would have been to allow this man the option of retiring on pension, or in the alternative to allow him to return to the service in England, where he came from.  He may not have gone there, but I think he ought to have been given the option of going back.  He is walking the streets of Dublin at the present time, sad to relate, practically penniless and absolutely broken up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> I am raising this question for no other reason than to try and have the case of this man cleared up.  He is a native of the constituency I represent, and I feel that I would be lacking in my duty as a representative of that constituency if I did not endeavour to secure the fullest investigation of his case and the fullest measure of justice for him.  I am not defending the action of any man engaged in a conspiracy to overthrow the State.  I think there could be no defence of such action.  He contends that he took no part in any such action.  He has been willing at all times to defend himself against a charge if made against him, and he is willing to give any undertaking that he might be called on to give.  I referred yesterday to the procedure adopted by the English authorities when dealing with political cases.  A copy of the charges is sent to the person accused, and he is asked to reply.  I think you have in the Department that this man was dismissed from, a remarkable case of the kind, the case of the Secretary, Mr. P. S. O'Hegarty.  I think that was the procedure adopted in his case, and also in the case of Mr. Diarmuid O'Hegarty, who was dismissed from the Civil Service, and who is now Secretary to the Executive Council.  I respectfully suggest that that procedure might have been adopted in this case, more especially because he was a man who had given&mdash;I think there will be no question about this&mdash;very considerable service to the country.  I know in the part of the country that I come from, Sam Maguire was known 25 years ago as a man who was working in the interests of this country, and he worked under very considerable difficulties. Coming from the class he did, perhaps he might be excused for not giving the service that he gave to the country, but all the time, by reason of the position he was in, he gave very considerable service, and was one of the people who did a very big lot in helping to set up this State.  I am not going to refer to that matter further.  The facts in connection with that aspect of the case are very much better known to the members of the Executive Council than they are to me.</P>
    <P>I will come now to another aspect of <Col N="1598" /> the case.  In connection with the Army troubles you had a large number of Army officers dismissed.  It is a fact that at the present time a great number of these people, if not all of them, are enjoying Army pensions.  I am not objecting to that.  I think it is right that the bitterness that existed at the time should be wiped out.  I am only mentioning that matter to point out that that policy could have been followed with very good effect in this case also.  During the civil war many civil servants and other public officials were taken in arms in this country.  In the case of national teachers, some of them are now back in their schools.  I am not quarrelling at all with that decision. I am quarrelling because that line of action has not been followed in this particular case.  I do appeal to the President and the Executive Council to be as generous in this case as they were in other matters.  They were generous in extending an amnesty to their opponents by resolution of the Executive Council some time ago, and they have been generous in awarding pensions to people who took up arms against them, and who were wounded in the struggle which took place prior to the civil war. I am asking, with all the sincerity I can command, to have this case reconsidered before it is too late, and if this man is not to go to his grave a sour and embittered man.  Even if there is any doubt in the case, I ask the Executive Council to reconsider it, and give the man the benefit of any doubt there is.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down I would like to refer to our discussion yesterday when the precedent that this line of action might give rise to was pointed out.  If it is followed out unduly and if other people than the present Government come into power and if men are dismissed because of actions they might have taken or because of views they might have held it will not be for the benefit of the Government or the benefit of the country.  It will be a dangerous headline for other people, perhaps less responsible, who will follow the Government in charge of this country.  This man feels that he has not got a fair trial; he feels that he has a reasonable answer to put up to the charge or charges that are made <Col N="1599" /> against him and if in future people are dismissed as a result of their political activities perhaps the position that has been created now will not be for the benefit of this Government or for the benefit of the Civil Service, because, after all, efficiency&mdash;and it was admitted yesterday by the President that this man was highly efficient&mdash;is rather the biggest consideration that can be mentioned in connection with the Service. I repeat the appeal I made yesterday to the President that there are two aspects of this case that might be considered; one is that if there are charges made against this man he has not had an opportunity of answering them, and even if the Executive Council will not adopt the policy of putting this man in possession of the details of the charges made against him and even if they feel that there is a certain doubt as to whether he did things, surely they might have given him the benefit of the doubt, if they are to save his body in the grave from being a reproach to their administration.</P>

      <P>This matter was raised by question yesterday and undoubtedly from the case put up in the question, from the reply and from further replies to supplementary questions this appears to be a very hard case.  Sitting here as an independent member, it appears to me that the Deputy who has spoken and whose statements always command respect has been speaking with two voices.  If this man had 26 years' service and was unjustly deprived of his position for a political reason I do not think there is a man on either side of this House who will not support him in his demand to have the case reconsidered.  He speaks with a second voice that this man is down and out because of the circumstances which have befallen him in being dismissed from the Service, and he makes an <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeal to the President. In that he has my strong sympathy, too.  Last evening the Deputy stated that this man had 26 years of approved service.  The President went further and said that he was a man of the highest character and of the highest efficiency.  Leaving out altogether the justice and injustice of this, <Col N="1600" /> I think the Deputy has made a strong case and I support him in his appeal to the Executive Council to reconsider the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCURTAIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to enter at great length into the circumstances connected with this man's dismissal.  Deputy Murphy has covered that ground very fully, but I would like to urge on the consideration of the Executive Council one aspect of the case.  Here we find a civil servant in an assured position with a long service, summarily dismissed.  No charge is brought against him and no reason for his dismissal is given, and when he applies for an inquiry he is refused. That refusal can only be explained, to my mind, on one ground, on the ground of public policy.  If the Executive Council found themselves in a position that a public inquiry was impossible for that reason, I take it that they were debarred from putting that man on the streets without some monetary help, without, in fact, retiring him on pension.  I am not going to enter into the question of the man's guilt or innocence. Guilty or innocent, if the Executive Council found themselves in that position, they could not justly refuse him a pension.  A further consideration in connection with the pension is that when this man was transferred to this country there was transferred, I am led to believe, his portion of his superannuation allowance, a sum of between £3,000 or £4,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the report of the British Royal Commission of 1903 on Superannuation, I find that the Commission was of opinion that superannuation in those cases was deferred pay.  The Army officers who were implicated in the same movement were granted pensions. These were pensions of which they had no previous expectation.  The pension scheme was drafted after they had committed their offences and had been driven out of the Army or had been dismissed from it.  Here was a man who had a reasonable expectation of a pension, who, it was alleged, committed the same crime, but who perhaps was not as guilty, because do you expect from a civil servant a greater <Col N="1601" /> test of loyalty, particularly in the time at which these offences occurred, than you do from prominent officers of the Army?  Deputy Murphy has stated that this man considers that he has a grievance.  I would go a little further and say that there are numbers of people besides this man, who consider he has a grievance, and I do not think the Executive Council can afford to disregard a feeling of that kind.  I would then make a suggestion to the Executive Council.  I would express the hope that they would do something to meet the case of this man.  As Deputy Murphy has said, he is in bad health and his pre-Truce services were undoubtedly of a useful nature.  There were other civil servants who had no pre-Truce services, and to whom the country is in no way indebted, and they are still retained in their positions. I believe these men were implicated, perhaps not to the same extent, in the same political movement, and were offered an opportunity of explanation, and they are still here.  This man, who had undoubtedly a record, a record which very few men outside the outstanding figures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>From the nature of the case Deputy MacCurtain could have no personal or direct knowledge of the circumstances which gave rise to this dismissal.  He could know nothing of the Army crisis in March, 1924, and, generally, the disturbed and unsettled conditions which prevailed throughout the remainder of that year.  This dismissal did not arise directly from the troubles in the spring of 1924, though beyond question this man was implicated, and deeply implicated, in those troubles.  When there was a question of arms which had been stolen from various garrisons throughout the country being returned, his name appeared in the public newspapers, together with those, I think, of two others, ordering the restoration of these arms.  He was a figure, a very prominent and authoritative figure, in that particular crisis, but the fact that he figured in that crisis, did not lead to his dismissal.  His name was noted at the foot of this document purporting to be a document of the &ldquo;Executive Council,&rdquo; as it was called, of the mutinous section of the Army, and that fact was ignored for reasons which were stated clearly enough here in the Dáil at the time.</P>
      <P>It was felt that the Executive Council ought not simply to adopt a doctrinaire attitude in the face of those troubles in the Army.  For one thing, we held the view and stated the view, that it was not just a question of 100 per cent. wrong on one side, and 100 per cent. right on the other, that there was light and shade in the affair, and that generally we were content to say to those who had participated, that they could go in peace as civilians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no attempt at punitive action against officers who took an active part in those troubles, and the resignations which they had tendered were merely accepted.  Many will probably hold the view that that was an absurdly lenient and light treatment for what was in essence a mutiny, but rightly or wrongly&mdash;as I think rightly &mdash;that was the line that was taken by the Executive Council.  We even went the length of not deeming these men ineligible for benefits under the Military <Col N="1603" /> Service Pensions Act.  That was March.  This dismissal, as Deputy Murphy pointed out, took place on the 29th December.  In that month information of a very definite kind, of quite an official kind, reached the Executive Council, that attempts were on foot to bring about a recrudescence of trouble within the Army, that the view had been formed that March only failed because it was confined to the officers. They would be wiser next time: they would draw in the N.C.O.'s and men. The N.C.O.'s were, after all, pivetal people in the organisation of the Army and it was important to get them.  The privates also were not to be ignored in this new attempt, and we had information that people were following out that line of thought and of action in a very persistent and a very energetic way.  About twenty N.C.O.'s and men and two majors were summarily dismissed from the Army.  At that time there were also dismissed two civil servants, one of them being Mr. Maguire, whose case is now under discussion.</P>

      <P>No.  We may have to listen to strong expressions of opinion, such as Deputy MacCurtain's opinion on this matter, but, gauging the situation at the time, gauging all the possibilities of the time.  I cannot conceive that any other course of action was open to the Executive Council, than the action which they took in December, 1924.  Here was a renewal of the attempt to make the army not the army of the people, but the army of a subterranean group or junta.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>No, for the good and sufficient reason, as the Deputy ought to know, and will know, if he brings his mind back to the period I speak of, that there was no point in simply making a charge in general terms, when it was inadvisable, impossible in fact, to table evidence in support of that charge, because to table evidence would reveal the source, and to reveal the source would lead to casualties, and the Deputy knows it. This is a new tenure, that is suggested for civil servants, public trial or pension. We are not prepared to accept that.  I am prepared to accept the proposition that only very special circumstances would justify a dismissal without the formulation of a charge, and an opportunity of commenting in reply to that charge, on the part of the person whose dismissal is at issue but these conditions existed at the time. They were very special circumstances, indeed, and the Deputy ought to take my word for that much. There was information available to the Executive Council that men were acting in combination, in conspiracy, men trying, at any rate, with very ruthless, desperate and irresponsible intentions, men talking and thinking in terms of assassination, in terms of a <i>coup d'état</i>, in terms of suborning the forces of the State, civil and military, and it was that kind of situation we had to meet, a situation which for all we knew was no less contrary than that which we faced and outfaced in March, 1924.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is suggested that these men should have been interviewed, that the information that was available in regard to them ought to be tabled before them and that they ought be invited to comment on that information.  Table the information and these men knew at once the source of that information.  We could not take the responsibility of answering for the result of imparting that knowledge to these persons.  Mr. Maguire's years of service and present condition of his health are scarcely relevant unless we are to take the view that once a civil servant attains twenty-five or twenty-six years' service, he has immunity to do what he likes or unless we ought take the view that because an ex-civil servant has the misfortune to fall into bad health, he is thereby entitled to re-instatement.  We do not take that view; there must be finality somewhere. A man who takes the pay of the State and then in a spirit of exploiting or trading upon past services, sets out to intrigue and conspire towards undermining that State must be willing to take the consequences. There must be finality somewhere.  We cannot be dismissing men and whistling <Col N="1606" /> them back after a couple of months in a spirit of capricious and ill-considered leniency.</P>
      <P>I answer this matter this evening because I was presiding at the Executive Council when this dismissal took place, the dismissal of the twenty odd privates and N.C.O.'s, the two majors and the two civil servants.  I have now been a member of the Executive Council for some years and there were few decisions taken there regarding which I hold so firmly the conviction that they were right, and sound and necessary, as I do in the case of this particular decision.  The accuracy of the information, the definiteness of the action taken on the information, saved the Army and the country from a recurrence of the troubles which had taken place in the early portion of that year. The accuracy of the information, the definiteness of the action taken on the information, discouraged any further attempts to suborn the uniformed servants of the State.  The privates and the N.C.O.'s before leaving the Curragh for their homes admitted the accuracy of the information.  I am aware that the officers and the civil servants did not, but I then believed and I now believe in the accuracy of the information, and so believing, I believe in the justice of the action taken on it.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.15 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 18th May.</P>
