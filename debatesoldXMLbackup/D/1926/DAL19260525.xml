      <P>The total amount expended on paper manufactured in the Saorstát and used either for the public service generally or for the Stamping Department of the Revenue Commissioners was:&mdash;1923-24, £3,387 14s. 6d.; 1924-25, £3,711 8s. 3d.; 1925-26, £6,669 18s. 9d.

      <P>If the Deputy wants a detailed answer it would be necessary to give me due notice.  It is obvious, however, that all sorts of paper are not manufactured in the Saorstát, and if we did try to use the classes of paper made here for all purposes, it would mean a greatly increased charge.</P>

      <P>As a result of certain inquiries made in connection with a subsequent claim it appeared that the claimant was employed on the days for which he had received benefit on his previous claim. Investigation of that claim disclosed certain facts which led to the disallowance of the benefit paid.  The claimant has appealed against the decision disallowing the claim in question, and his appeal will come before the Court of Referees on Wednesday, the 26th instant, after which his second claim, with which it has not been possible to deal in the meantime, will be disposed of.</P>

William Menton &amp; Co., solicitors for Gallaghan, during 1925 and 1926, and that no reply has been made, and if it is intended to compensate Gallaghan for the injury he has suffered and for loss of employment owing to the injury, and what sum it is proposed to grant.</P>

      <P>A claim for compensation in respect of injuries due to a collision with a military motor car has been received from Mr. Gallaghan, through his solicitors.  The accident was investigated by a Court of Inquiry which found that there was not sufficient evidence to show how it occurred.  Essential witnesses were not immediately available and considerable delay was experienced in ascertaining the facts, The case has been the subject of correspondence with the claimant's solicitors and it is not correct to say that no reply has been given to their letters.  The question of compensation is under consideration, and it is hoped to dispose of the matter at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the delay is that it was not possible to identify either the driver or the motor car.  The driver was not a military driver but a civilian, and the names given at the time were not the names of the driver and any person who was in the motor.  In January last the names were ascertained.  The delay <Col N="2034" /> is not due to anything connected with my office.</P>

      <P>May I suggest that unless there is very great urgency&mdash; and I cannot see that there is&mdash;this Bill might be deferred until to-morrow?

      <P>I desire to join in Deputy Johnson's appeal.  I got these amendments a little after 9 o'clock this morning, and I had to be at the Public Accounts Committee at 11 o'clock.  I had little time in which to read and consider the amendments. They involve very technical matters, as <Col N="2036" /> the President knows.  If we could go on with the Estimates to-day and deal with this Bill to-morrow, I do not think much time would be lost.  The Minister's proposal to take the Fifth Stage of the Bill simultaneously with the Report Stage would receive very much less opposition if we were given an additional day to study the amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="MINISTER for DEFENCE (Mr. Hughes) Peter Hughes">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for DEFENCE (Mr. Hughes)</NameTxt>
      <P>In submitting this Estimate, I should like to say a couple of words in explanation.  There is not much, really, to be said, as the amounts are all statutory.  There is a considerable savings under some of the heads on last year.  There is a decrease of £20,500 under sub-head A&mdash;Wound Pensions and Gratuities.  The reason for that is that a good many have been worked off, and, in some cases, paid off, and, consequently, there will be found to be a decrease under that head. Under sub-head D&mdash;Allowances to Widows and Children&mdash;there is a reduction of £12,000, which is accounted for by the fact that a considerable number of the children are coming of age, and are no longer entitled to get pensions. The expenditure under C&mdash;Artificial Appliances&mdash;is reduced by a sum of £500, and sub-head D&mdash;Vocational Training&mdash;is reduced also by £500.  The reason for that is that there are very few people making applications to get vocational training.  There were two or three applicants in the past year, and I do not know if any of these people filled the requirements.  I think, at the moment, we have no applicant under that head.  We put in this sum so that if people come in, in the financial year, we will be able to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Travelling and incidental expenses under sub-head E are down by £800. The reason of that is that we did not anticipate there would be so few people travelling to attend medical boards and so on; so many of them have got pensions or gratuities that they will not have to come up again for examination. The sum of £1,000 is down for specialists' fees in connection with the fixing of awards.  That sum was under a <Col N="2038" /> different head last year.  It should have been in the Army Pensions Vote, but it was not.  It was in the ordinary Army estimates.  As regards extra statutory provision of hospital treatment for ex-members of the forces, the amount is £9,000; no provision was made for this sum last year.  It was thought necessary that it should be brought under this separate account this year, and hence the increase.</P>
    <P>Sub-head H. deals with pensions granted under Section 4 (1) of the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924. This Vote shows a nett increase.  It is thought that a great many of these cases, practically all of them, will be finished during the coming financial year.  The reason of the increase is that the pensions were granted, as far back as October, 1924, so that the total accrued in those years.  It is hoped that practically all those cases will be finished in the coming financial year.</P>

      <P>In connection with my reference to the administration, I wanted to have some information from the Minister as to whether he has attempted, through his Departmental chiefs and staffs, to find out what needs there are in respect of disablement through sickness pensions.

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>That arises on the Vote for the Department of Defence, surely, and not on this Vote.  Now that I remember it in the light of his arguments the Deputy's question was: Did questions of administration arise?  They do, but only in so far as they concern these Army pensions. The only question that arises on this Vote is as to how the Acts, namely, the Army Pensions Act, 1923, and the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924, are administered.  But the provisions of the Acts do not come up for review, nor can amendments to the Acts be advocated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might skip over A, B and C, I would ask the Minister whether he has made public, or at least, whether he has made it clear to the wounded pensioners, what their oppertunities for vocational training are.  I do not think it has been well explained. I do not know whether the Dáil has been made familiar with the provisions for training of this kind, and I think that too little attention has been paid to the question of the training of wounded soldiers for vocations and the terms on which they will be trained. The matter was raised rather perfunctorily last year.  I think that the need is very considerable and that opportunities should be made known if there are regular schemes in hand.  I gathered last year that the Minister was prepared to do certain things in this respect, but I am not at all satisfied that any real scheme of training was set out in the Minister's statement or in any official publication.  If proper schemes do exist I believe that it <Col N="2040" /> would be of great advantage to have these schemes brought directly to the attention of every wounded man in receipt of a pension.  It would be of interest and of great importance to the people concerned if the Minister could outline in detail what are the schemes for vocational training that are referred to in this Vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>On A there is the matter of the inadequate amounts of the pensions granted to wounded soldiers. In some cases where men have lost the use of a right leg or arm they have been granted something like 12/6 a week, notwithstanding the fact that they are totally disabled for life.  Some of them were members of the Irish Volunteers and were wounded after joining the National Army.  Their little ones are dependent on them, and still the best thing the State can do for them is to give them 12/6 per week. I think that under this heading some provision should be made for the dependents of those men who died as a result of their wounds.</P>

He cannot pay any more under this particular heading.  The Deputy can only go into the question of the way in which the Act is administered, and in a case where the Minister has a discretion he can go into the manner in which the Minister exercises that discretion.

      <P>At what particular stage does the question arise?  It is a well-known fact that there are hundreds of such cases in the Saorstát, cases of men who are in receipt of inadequate allowances.  You have here an Estimate for £430,000.  That, of course, covers the Wounds Pensions Act and the Army Service Pensions Act, and I presume at this stage, and under this sub-head A, I would not be in order in discussing the Army Pensions Act, sub-head H.  But the £430,000 is required to meet both.  I do maintain that the Minister should consider more seriously the cases, particularly of the dependents of those men.  Deputy Byrne asked a question a moment ago on this subject, and we have been promised&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As regards vocational training, there is no set scheme laid down.  We have had only eight applications since the Act was passed, and they were mostly for grants to enable the men to learn a trade or to go into some business.  Each case is examined on its merits, and if it is found that the applicant is a person who can earn his living if he gets a reasonable chance to do so, he will get assistance.  But it has not been published in any way except that it was raised by Deputy Johnson on the Estimates last year.  No advertisement has been issued and no set scheme was made out.  When an application comes along the case is examined, and if it is found that the applicant is a fit and suitable person the grant will be given, but if he is not a fit and suitable person the money is not expended.  Indeed, very few applications have come in. There have been only eight applications sent in since the Act came into force.  Practically none of these was found to be suitable.  Though the money had been taken, nothing has been done, but if cases come up during the present financial year they will be dealt with, and if they are found suitable, grants will be made from this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That justifies my complaint.  It is because of my feeling <Col N="2043" /> that that was the situation that I was prompted to raise this matter.  It is quite unreasonable to imagine that wounded soldiers will submit claims and representations with respect to their desire to be trained to this or that or the other occupation unless they have some belief or knowledge that such schemes are available.  I do not think the opportunities are stated here. I would be greatly astonished if there were not a considerable proportion of those who are receiving wound pensions who have been deprived of their opportunities by virtue of their wound to follow occupations such as they might be expected to follow if they had not been wounded.  I think it is quite a good thing to put to those men the proposition that they may be trained for a useful or productive work&mdash;certainly such useful work as their wounds would not disable them from performing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had experience of the fact that under the British and continental schemes wonders have been performed in the way of training men who have been wounded and making them competent to do something towards earning their livelihood, and, more important still, making them competent to live a life with some self-respect, and to enable them to feel that they are not entirely a burden upon their relatives. I do not mean a financial burden only. When a man is wounded and simply has to hang about the house or village or the streets of a town, lounging and wasting his time, it is a moral disorder that is created, and it would be very well worth the State's while to spend even more than these sums in bringing into effect schemes of vocational training and giving opportunities to these men of securing something like useful occupations.  That might take some time.  The State would not get economic service out of them, but there would be a great improvement in the <i>morale</i> of these men, and it would be doing a really valuable public service. I think it is almost the duty of the Minister to formulate proposals suitable for meeting the particular types of wounded men&mdash;men suffering from the different types of wounds and <Col N="2044" /> different classes of disablement.  If opportunities for undergoing training in specific callings were available, I do not think it would be very difficult for the Minister to find out very close to this city schemes of vocational training which would help him to judge of the kind of thing that could be offered to the soldiers of the National Army.</P>

      <P>Without discussing what has taken place, I would like to ask the Minister what method he intends to adopt in the future to make known to wounded men that vocational training is available?  Surely if some circular is not sent to these men, or if some advertisement is not put into the newspapers as to the terms under which this vocational training can be got, the men cannot know of it.  They cannot know of it when it is hidden away in the pigeon-holes in the office.  That state of things is not helpful to the wounded men.  I am not surprised that there have not been more than eight applicants in view of the fact that there was no effort made to make known to the men that this vocational training was available.  I would suggest that some notification, either by circular or newspaper advertisement, should be given to the men in order to bring this matter before them and to make known to them that this vocational training was available.</P>

If wounded soldiers send in applications, and if it is found that these are suitable cases to be put to learn any particular trade or business for which they are adapted, I can assure the Dáil that every effort will be made to place them in whatever trade they are looking for.  Sometimes some of these men came along and, from what I can gather, after being medically examined they were not found to be suited or fit for the positions they wanted to take up.</P>

But where cases come along, if they are found suitable, as far as this Vote goes the money will be spent on them.  I guarantee that. Beyond that I do not think it is proper that I should go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I have not got Section 5 of this Act before me.  I am very disappointed at the line the Minister has taken with regard to this matter.  He informs us that he has only received eight applications since the Act was passed, and I dare guess that six were from men who wanted to learn motor driving.  Quite rightly the Minister says that they are not prepared to give assistance towards training men who, the medical advisers say, would not be fit for that occupation.  That is quite right, but I think the Minister is not fulfilling his duty and responsibility by simply saying, &ldquo;We will consider an application for money on the part of a wounded soldier, if the money is to be used to enable him to learn a trade, and if we are satisfied that that particular trade will suit the man.&rdquo;  That is not enough.  There is an obligation, in my view, on the Ministry to have schemes of training suitable to men who have lost an arm, who have lost their sight, or lost a leg, and are incapable of following the occupation which they followed, or were accustomed to follow, before going into the Army.  I maintain that it is the duty of the Ministry to formulate definite proposals of classes of training they are prepared to advise men to go for, and that some initiative should be taken by the Army Pension authorities in this matter.  It may turn out that the number of applications from persons disabled would be too small to allow for any considerable scheme, but I think, at least, the opportunity should be provided in the first instance, before further procedure <Col N="2047" /> under this Section ceases.  I do not think in the procedure the Minister has outlined that the Ministry has fulfilled its part of the requirements.  On the other hand, I think the initiative in proposing classes of training should be taken by the Ministry, and that the men should be invited to follow this, that, or the other course of training. I make that point, notwithstanding the fact that I know that difficulties did arise under the British system regarding men who had learned trades.  I believe the moral value of keeping these men in some kind of useful occupation, and giving them some interest in life, would be worth a great deal of money, and a great deal of risk to the labour market.  I think the Minister should look into this matter with a little more care, and should keep in mind the fact that he has some responsibility for the after-life of men who have been wounded in the Army.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Johnson that these men would be much better off if they had some employment at which they could earn a little money rather than depending entirely on their pensions and, as the Deputy said, hovering around corners where they would not, perhaps, be doing any good to themselves or to the community. After considering the matter, if I can see any way to devise a number of schemes I will do so.  My experience is that you will get every single one of these men coming up wanting to do something peculiar to himself, and if he is not allowed to do that he is not going to go to anything else.  If you want to devise schemes to fit every case you would want to devise a scheme for every trade.  If it was only a question of putting forward one, two, or three particular branches that men could go to, it could be done, but, as a rule, these men want to follow their own particular hobby and nothing else.  I will have the matter inquired into, and if a scheme can be put up, embracing a number of trades or businesses, it will be done, if it is feasible.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister give any estimate of the number of persons who can be treated under the provisions of this Vote in hospitals in respect to sickness which they have suffered as a consequence of or arising out of their service in the Army?  We have no indication of the limits which the Minister for Finance proposes to define.  I take it the Minister for Defence has some figure in his mind as to the number of persons who might be provided for under this sub-head, apart from those who have already been provided for in the past.</P>

      <P>This figure of £9,000 might cover up to 100 cases in the year, or it might cover more.  In every case the whole position must go before the Department of Finance and get its sanction.  It is not simply a case of a man coming along and being sent into hospital until his case is decided.  The case must be set down on paper and sent to the Department of Finance.  It would be impossible to say what number will come along or what the expense of each case will be.  We might send on a case to the Department of Finance and it might be turned down. Each individual case will have to be examined.</P>

      <P>The provision of £9,000 under this sub-head does not legalise the expenditure in the past. There must be other sanctions.  This is presumably intended to provide for hospital treatment within this financial year, in the absence of statutory provision. In respect to payments in the past outside the statute, some further authority will be required besides this sub-head.  I am putting this forward rather from the point of view of procedure than from the point of view of objection.  I am very doubtful whether this provision will suffice to make regular the extra statutory payments in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed in the Bill to be introduced to have the provisions apply to past, present and future payments.  There were certain cases that cropped up and, if you only look at them from the humanitarian point of view, you will see that we could not find ourselves justified in letting them loose and letting them remain in that <Col N="2052" /> position until their pensions could be granted.  That treatment was given in order that the disability might be reduced, and that probably in the long run it would be a saving to the State, because some of these men who got this extra special treatment were in a bad way.  It was for the purpose of allaying their sufferings that we sent them into hospital.  So far as I can gather, the treatment they got there minimised the amount of the pensions to which they would have been entitled if they were allowed to wander about and get worse.  We took the best course we could.  We found, in a great many cases, on the recommendations of medical officers and others, that if they had not got that treatment they would probably have died.  Under the circumstances I think we were entitled to do what we have done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to sub-head H, I want to give the Minister an opportunity of explaining the procedure adopted by the Committee charged with the responsibility of considering applications under the Military Pensions Act.  When the Committee was first set up it was composed, amongst others, of the Minister for Fisheries and Deputy Duggan, now Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Finance.  It has been brought under my notice, in cases of complaints which have reached me, that only the Chairman, who, I think, is a District Justice, and the Secretary, were present when claims were investigated.  I want to make it clear that I am not taking exception to the absence of the Minister for Fisheries and Deputy Duggan, because I realise the unpopular task with which they have been charged and, perhaps, they are not under any obligation to be present on all occasions. I think, however, that the Minister should explain for the benefit of those people who have complained whether there is any regulation making it committee to be present when claims are pulsory on any members of the Comgone into.  There is another point with which I wish to deal, and that is as regards groups of individuals who requested that they should be accompanied, or their case stated to the Committee, <Col N="2053" /> by solicitors.  I passed on a communication to the Secretary of the Committee in reference to a request that a number of applications under the Act should be put before the Committee by a solicitor, either in the presence or absence of the applicants. That request was, however, turned down.  I want to know whether the Minister has tied down the Committee by any regulation which would debar them hearing applications on behalf of persons with the aid of a solicitor.</P>
      <P>I also have in mind the case of one individual who took a very prominent part in the pre-Truce struggle and who subsequently became an officer in the National Army.  He told me that when he went before the Committee in Waterford there were only the Chairman and Secretary present.  He did not get a long hearing, but I do not complain about that owing to the large number of claims.  He asked the Committee, however, to hear in support of his claim statements of high officers of the old Irish Republican Army.  His claim has been turned down without these statements being given in support of it.  These officers were prepared to go before the Committee and give evidence in regard to his pre-Truce service.  The individual submitted his case to the Minister for Defence by way of appeal, but, so far as I am aware, up to the last eight or ten days he has not got an answer from the Minister.  I am certain that thousands of claims have been submitted under this particular Act without any justification whatever, and I merely raise the question to give the Minister for Defence an opportunity of stating what is the regular procedure set out by the Committee, and why there should be any justification in refusing to hear a solicitor who is acting for individuals.  Personally, I think it would be helpful to the Committee to hear a solicitor rather than have several individuals presenting their claims personally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would give us some more information than has been given so far. I would like to know whether this Committee has finished its labours or how far it has gone with them.  I would <Col N="2054" /> also like to know what will be the annual charge to the State when this Committee has finished its labours, because the amount estimated here includes arrears of pensions.  I am speaking from memory, but I think an estimate was given some time ago as to the annual cost, and I think it was very much lower than the amount we are now asked to pay.  I think it was not even half the amount stated here in the Estimates.  We should also be entitled to some information as to the qualifications required for securing a pension. What is the qualification in regard to pre-Truce service?  It seems to me that there is a good deal of uncertainty as to what pre-Truce service consists of. I know one instance in which there was pre-Truce service of a kind, but whether it was sufficient to warrant the granting of a pension or not is more than I can say.  I do not think that the Act contains any precise definition as to the pre-Truce service required, but I know that this man gave pretty valuable service pre-Truce.  Apparently service is not confined to actual fighting, as other kinds are recognised.  I do not want to make a very strong protest against the amount mentioned here, but I feel that that amount is very high and that there should be no pensions given unless they are fully justified by the service of applicants.  There is a feeling in the country that the pension list of the State, generally speaking, is excessive.  I, and I am sure the Dáil, would like to be satisfied that every penny under this sub-head is fully justified.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to state what is the nature and duration of service necessary to qualify for the award of a military service pension.  I have been asked by a number of persons to find this out as some of them allege that men awarded pensions have not given good service, and that in the case of others who have, their claims have beenturned down.  I think it would allay anxiety if those people were informed that they had not service of the kind required by the Minister for Defence.  Then they would not bother any more about pushing their claims.</P>

      <P>They must have inclusive service, otherwise they would not get a pension.  If the pension was to be given, as is alleged, to everyone who would apply for it, it is not £361,000 you would want, but many millions, before you could pay pensions to those who looked for them. I agree a large number of men applied for the pension who had not pre-Truce service, but I should like to know from the Minister what the Board of Assessors mean by &ldquo;active service.&rdquo; Those words are puzzling the greatest lawyers in the Free State.  One lawyer says that &ldquo;active service&rdquo; means men who were on the run.  Another maintains it means a man who has taken part in ambushes, blowing up bridges or burning down police barracks. Another man maintains that &ldquo;active service&rdquo; means you are not entitled to a pension unless you have succeeded in closing somebody's eyes.  I want to know what interpretation the Minister for Defence puts on the words, as I have known men to be turned down who gave service since the time of the Redmond Volunteers in 1913 and on towards 1916.  They took part in 1916.  They were on active service.  At least they were out of their employment. They were serving the State. They joined the National Forces in 1922 and those men have been turned down.  They received letters saying: &ldquo;Your claim for a pension has been forwarded by the Minister to the Board of Assessors, who will report on the matter.&rdquo;  Then another letter comes: &ldquo;Your case has been considered and the Board of Assessors have reported on your case and decided that your service does not entitle you to a pension.  You have been a Volunteer since April, 1920, but you have not been on active service.  Consequently <Col N="2056" /> the Minister regrets that a pension cannot be granted to you.&rdquo;</P>

What does the Minister or the Board of Assessors mean by the words &ldquo;active service&rdquo;?  The man who applies for a pension, according to the Act, must have had service in the forces of Saorstát Eireann, either the Irish Volunteers, the Citizen Army, or anything else, and he must have been a member of the National Army for some time.

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Vote a sum of over £361,000 is to be paid out to people in pensions, some of whom never took an active part in the struggle for the freedom of this country.  They were given these pensions because certain people certified that they had active service, but I can say they never had active service.  The Board of Assessors approved of the forms sent in on behalf of these people, but they ignored and turned down forms signed by members of this House.  Why are Deputies asked to certify that certain men had been engaged on active service and were, in their opinion, entitled to a pension, and then afterwards to have these forms turned down?  In my opinion, the turning down of these forms is making as little as dirt of the Deputies who signed them, as far as the Board of Assessors and the Minister are concerned.  I want the Minister to explain what interpretation he puts on the words &ldquo;active service.&rdquo;  If the Minister is not able to do that I will have to raise the matter in the House later and have it discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to attempt to define the words &ldquo;active service.&rdquo;  That is a matter for the Board of Assessors.  If the Deputy thought as much about the matter when the Bill was going through as he appears to think now, he would have had a definition inserted in the Bill.  The Board of Assessors is the body to determine &ldquo;active service&rdquo; after having the applicant before them and after examining him on oath, as well as the people he calls to certify that he had active service.  If it is not proved that the man had active service according to the interpretation put on the words &ldquo;active service&rdquo; by the Board, then that man is not entitled to a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should make that point a little bit clearer.  I think he probably said what he did not intend to say.  I gathered <Col N="2059" /> from what the Minister said that when the applicant had come before the Board, and stated his case, then the Board of Assessors defined what active service was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but after hearing the applicant and after hearing what he had done, whether it was brave or otherwise, and after hearing the people whom the applicant had given as a reference&mdash;these things are all done on oath&mdash;the Board of Assessors decide whether or not the applicant had active service.  If the evidence submitted does not support the applicant's claim that he had active service, then the Board of Assessors decide accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point raised on which every Deputy would like to have an answer.  It is as to whether there has been any formulation of a definition of active service to guide the Board of Assessors.

    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>They have a formula for themselves, but they have not put that formula before me.  They are a statutory body, and they are there to administer the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>When an appeal is made to the Minister on that point what guides him?  Is it the formula of the Board of Assessors, which has not been divulged to him, or is it his own formula?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>The guidance to the Minister is additional evidence that had not been before the Board of Assessors previously.  As far as the Board are concerned, when they send a case to the Minister it means that it is disposed of and cannot be reopened again by them, but if an appeal is made to the Minister on the grounds that further evidence is going to be produced, the Minister may send the case back to the Board for further consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>If an appeal is made by an individual on this question of active service, and that further evidence <Col N="2060" /> is produced, how can the Minister, seeing that he is not aware of the definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo; which the Board of Assessors act upon, say whether it was right for him or not to send the case back to the Board of Assessors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say because I have not the person who is going to tender the evidence before me.  A case, for instance, comes before me like this: a man says: &ldquo;I have additional evidence to give from Lieutenant, Captain or Colonel So-and-So, who can testify as to certain things that I did not state in my original testimony.&rdquo;  If the case seems reasonable to me and that this new evidence is likely to throw more light on the case of the applicant before the Board, I think that I am justified in sending a case like that back to the Board of Assessors for further consideration.  That is what I invariably do in such cases.  The evidence put forward in the first instance may be of the flimsiest character, but if that evidence is strengthened by responsible people, by people who are able to testify on oath that the applicant did certain things, then the Board of Assessors will take the whole of the evidence into account.  If they are satisfied that the new evidence brings the man within the provisions of the Military Service Pensions Act they will decide the case in accordance with the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister contending that the only appeal to him is as to whether the evidence that is now adduced to him is new?</P>

      <P>Well, I have not got a copy of the Act with me, but that seems to me to be a trivial ground for appeal&mdash;to say whether this evidence is different from that evidence.  If the Minister's jurisdiction is confined to saying whether the evidence that is now adduced is different from, and additional to, the evidence which was adduced before the Board of Assessors, that is a minor jurisdiction for the Minister as a court of appeal.  I would like to get something more convincing before I would accept that view.</P>

      <P>The findings of the Board of Assessors set out in their report shall in all cases be final and conclusive and binding upon the applicant, provided however that the Board may at any time reopen any or all of their findings at the request of the Minister on the ground that evidence not available prior to the making of their report had since become available, and upon hearing such additional evidence the Board of Assessors may amend their report and alter or discharge any findings therein as may seem to them just having regard to such further evidence.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister has not made himself clear on the definition of &ldquo;active service.&rdquo;  As I understand the Minister, an applicant has the right of appeal only on the grounds that he is able to give additional evidence, but he is not able to appeal on the decision of the Board of Assessors on the evidence.  The applicant may say: &ldquo;I had active service and the evidence I gave proves that,&rdquo; but the Board of Assessors may say: &ldquo;This man has not given service which could be defined as &lsquo;active service&rsquo; according to our definition.&rdquo;  The Minister has given no indication of the definition upon which the Board of Assessors act regarding &ldquo;active service.&rdquo; It is very important that an applicant going forward should know this so that he may not be wasting his time, energies and money in putting forward a claim for a pension if he does not come within the definition&mdash;a definition at present which he does not know.  There is no definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo; in the Act, and there is no definition whatever as far as the public are aware.  I think this is a good opportunity for giving an explanation of what the Board of Assessors regard as &ldquo;active service.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It has been brought to my notice that several applicants have unsuccessfully applied for pensions, and some of these men truly and honestly had good service to their credit.  It is not so much a question of money or pension with these men as being turned down and told that they did not come within the terms of the Act, and that they had not sufficient active service.  They would like to have on record their service, so that they could have that record in their houses, in order that their children could see their fathers did something in the time when Ireland wanted men. Some of the men I have been speaking to would be satisfied with a military service certificate such as that, though of course many of them are anxious to get the pensions.  For example, take a man who joined the Volunteers in 1917 and who rendered service from that <Col N="2063" /> date to 1920, when he was arrested and interned until after the Truce, and then joined the National Army in 1922, would that count for &ldquo;active service&rdquo; for that man?  Cases such as that have been turned down.  Why?  Because such a man was not at liberty to shoot somebody.  Apparently no man has had active service but the man who pulled the trigger.  As far as the Board of Assessors and the Minister are concerned, a pension shall not be granted to men who had been on the run from 1916 and 1917, but only to men who have been in an ambush, or who may have been directing from behind walls.  A man who happened to get in with a few of the boys on the road and went to a place of ambush, may be like a piece of blancmange on a plate, and who never did anything more, is all right and is to get credit for active service.  I want to see justice done to the men who, as was intended, should benefit by the Act.  I admit that it was never anticipated by any man who took part as a Volunteer in the movement in this country that he would get a pension.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy is making a speech which he should have made on the Bill when it was becoming an Act rather than a speech on this Estimate.  He is discussing a matter that cannot be raised on this Estimate.  On a point of order made to me on this matter I allowed the Deputy to proceed, but I cannot allow the Deputy to make a speech bearing on the Military Service Pensions Act and the meaning of it.  The Deputy has made it clear that he wants a definition of &ldquo;active service.&rdquo;  I think we could leave it at that&mdash;as far as the Deputy is concerned he has made that clear several times.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say if intelligence work, police work, and the carrying of despatches would be considered an Army service qualification for a pension?  We all know that during these troublous times many men gave consistent, and I might say brilliant, service as intelligence and police officers and in carrying despatches, and I think cases like these should be carefully and sympathetically <Col N="2064" /> considered.  Even if these men have not taken part in any actual fighting, they have risked their lives perhaps oftener than those who have been in the fighting line.</P>

      <P>The House is asked in this Vote to make provision for £361,300 to cover the payment of pensions to 4,000 men who, it is to be assumed, had pre-Truce service as well as subsequent service in the National Army.  I remember the Minister for External Affairs during the Army crisis debate in this House stating that the total number of men who had pre-Truce service, and who could be considered to have done anything in the shape of active service, would not exceed 3,000 men.  Let us assume that 1,500 of these 3,000&mdash;and it would not be an unfair assumption&mdash;to whom the Minister for External Affairs referred went Irregular, then there is some explanation to be given for the excessive number who are being provided with Army pensions under this section.  I think that has something to do with the demand by the House for a definition of the words &ldquo;active service.&rdquo;  The Minister is a very frank man, and I think he realises that himself, as Minister, perhaps more than anyone else, has got a good deal of trouble with correspondence and demands arising out of this matter.  It would be only fair to the House, to the country, and to people who demand pensions, even if they are not entitled to them, that a clear explanation should be given with regard to these words &ldquo;active service.&rdquo;  I stated reasons why I think it should be given.  I think members of the House who are called upon to vote money to such a large extent as this are entitled to an explanation as to why claims which they have supported have been turned down.  So far the definition of the words &ldquo;active service&rdquo; is known apparently only to the Board of Assessors.</P>

      <P>Many questions have been raised under this sub-head.  Deputy Davin, I think, raised the first one, and to my mind it is a question that deserves consideration, and that is that the chairman and the secretary were the only persons who took part in giving pensions in certain cases.  What <Col N="2065" /> happens in a good many cases is that the chairman and secretary are the people who are there when the evidence on oath is taken, but there is no pension granted to anybody until the evidence is submitted to a full Board.  It would not be possible to have a full Board there whenever an applicant comes along to get his case heard or when any of the referees comes to give evidence.  The Chairman is a lawyer and the Secretary is capable and competent to take any evidence that is tendered, and to submit that evidence in a proper manner to the Board, when it comes to consider whether an applicant is entitled to a pension or not.  As far as the members of the Board are concerned, they have done their work &mdash;and it is not work of a very pleasant nature&mdash;to my satisfaction and, I think, to the satisfaction of the Executive Council and, generally, to the satisfaction of the members of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I understand that, but I do know that there are people who think that the members of the Board should do everything that a Deputy asks them to do.  Representations are sometimes made by Deputies about people in their own constituencies whom they declare to have been extra good men in the Volunteer days, but when they are asked to swear to the truth of their statements, they decline to do so.  Yet statements are made, day after day, that people are not getting justice from this Board.  If people would come along with cases that they could stand over and that they were prepared to give evidence on oath about, I am sure the majority of these cases would be heard, and pensions would be granted, but when people come along and try to bolster up a case where there is no case, that is what gives rise to the trouble and annoyance that I get sometimes, and that Deputies get.  I think in justice to the Board, to the Department and to myself, that I should read a statement that I have here in connection with the matter. The statement is:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Military Service Pensions Act, <Col N="2066" /> 1924, was passed on 5th August, 1924.  The Board of Assessors under the Act was set up by the President and Minister for Defence by Minute dated 4th October, 1924.  The Board's immediate work was to draft and recommend Rules and Regulations under the Act.  These were signed by the Minister on the 20th October, 1924.  Forms of application were then issued to all requiring them.  The date within which application could be made was ultimately extended from 1/3/'25 to 31/12/'25. The importance and extent of the Board's work may be gauged from the fact that applications were received from no less than 21,500 persons. These represented claims for pensions estimated to amount to between two and two and a quarter millions per annum.  With the knowledge of the enormous amount of this claim, and the absence of official records of the pre-Truce and early National Army days, the Board was faced with the problem of producing a machinery of investigation which, while sufficient to enable the work of assessment to be carried out to their satisfaction, would not be unduly expensive on the individual or on the State.  A very large proportion of the application forms received had to be returned to applicants for amendment in respect of one or more of the following points:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  Incomplete particulars given as to the periods of Volunteer Service claimed.</P>
    <P>2.  Failure of applicant to sign his application or to have his signature witnessed.</P>
    <P>3.  Failure of applicant to name the prescribed number of references, or to name references from the prescribed classes.</P>
    <P>4.  Insufficient particulars given of service in the National Forces or Defence Forces to enable search to be made in Army records, etc.</P>
    <P>All applications were minutely examined, and where it appeared on the face of any that the applicant did not prima facie give the service which entitled him to any consideration under the Act, he was notified <Col N="2067" /> accordingly, and a correspondence opened on his eligibility or otherwise. On final review of all such applications and correspondence, ultimately between 13,000 and 14,000 were segregated where the Board were satisfied that the service claimed was sufficient to bring applicant within scope of Act.</P>
    <P>Investigation of these claims then proceeded on the following lines:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  References for pre-Truce service were issued with an exhaustive questionnaire regarding applicant's activities during the different periods set out in the Act&mdash;an average of eight references were communicated with per applicant.  (b) Even with reference to service in the National Forces, a large volume of correspondence by forms and typed letters is necessary.  In a great many cases the Army Departments are unable to certify service, especially of those applicants whose service terminated prior to the 1st January, 1923.  (c) In the cases of applicants claiming service between 1/7/22 and 30/9/23 in the Criminal Investigation Department, Protective Corps, Citizen Defence Force, etc., special correspondence is conducted with the applicants and with the Department of Justice before the preliminary investigation of any such case can be completed.  (d) When the preliminary investigation of an application is completed, arrangements for the oral examination of the applicant are made.  Applicants, except those serving in the Army, have been given a list of thirty-seven Provincial Centres and Dublin, from which to choose the place at which they desired to have their oral evidence taken.  Arrangements for attendance before the Board of applicants still serving in the Army are made through the Army Authorities.  In some thousands of cases the invitation to choose a centre had to be issued twice, and in about two thousand cases a third time before the final lists of applicants who wished to be examined at each of the Provincial Centres and at Dublin <Col N="2068" /> could be completed.  Some hundreds of applicants, however, had no sooner notified their choice and office arrangements had been made accordingly, than they wished to be examined at some other centre.  The preparation of lists of applicants, of files, etc., for hearings was much impeded both by delay of applicants in making a choice of centre and by desire to change subsequently.</P>
    <P>Particulars of the places at which oral evidence was taken, the order in which the sittings were held, the number of applicants examined, and the total examined up to and including the 17/4/'26 are as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>When replies are received to queries issued to applicants, references and Army Departments and the oral examination of the applicant is completed, an examination of the evidence in the file is made.  If necessary, further correspondence is initiated to complete the file for submission to the Board for decision. About 75 per cent. of the applications classed as &ldquo;eligible&rdquo; have been received from persons who in fact are not able to establish their claims to have rendered military service in accordance with the terms of the Military Service Pensions, Act, 1924.  Following the ordinary investigation of each case and its submismission to the Board, notice of the intention of the Board to report against an applicant must, in accordance with paragraph 8 (a) of the Military Service Pensions Regulations, 1925, be issued to him.  Practically all to whom this notice is issued reply thereto naming additional references, giving further details of military service, etc.. and a large volume of queries have then to be issued before the case can be resubmitted to the Board for final decision. This notice of the intention of the Board to report &ldquo;Nil&rdquo; in respect of military service has been issued to 6,010 applicants up to and including the 17/4/26.  Very few of them in replying have named less than five additional references, and a majority of them have named <Col N="2070" /> twice that number.  To date, in about three thousand cases, special difficulties have arisen in connection with the speedy and adequate investigation of the applications, e.g., in cases of applicants who have died since making application; in cases of applicants now resident overseas; in cases where the statements of applicants and references are contradictory; and in cases where the ranks held, e.g., in Criminal Investigation Department or in the Marine Investigation Department are not included in those mentioned in the Military Service Pensions Act.  Much correspondence and special investigation is required in such cases before they can be made ready for submission to the Board for decision.  To meet the difficulty in the cases of applicants resident overseas a form of affidavit has been prepared and is issued to such applicants.  They are invited to testify specifically as to the military services rendered by them, with necessary dates.  The despatch of forms, etc., to applicants resident in certain counties has entailed many difficulties, and called for special arrangements outside the ordinary postal facilities.  In those cases where the available evidence satisfies the Board, a draft report is prepared setting out the periods of service assessed, the name of the force in which service was rendered, the rank of the applicant, and the total (in years) for pension purposes of the service awarded by the Board. Two copies of this draft are made and, when carefully checked, are submitted to the Board for signature by at least two members.  One signed copy is then passed to the Minister for Defence, and a notification of this fact is immediately issued to the applicant, and also to any persons, e.g., Solicitors, T.D.'s etc., who have been writing in reference to the particular application.  The second signed copy is retained on the file in the Board's Office.  Meetings of the Board have been held for the purpose of final decision of applications on 118 days.  At these meetings questions of policy, of procedure to be followed, etc., were also discussed and decided.  Of the 13,606 applicants <Col N="2071" /> whose cases are classed as &ldquo;eligible&rdquo; 9,870 have been orally examined before the Board.  In a good many cases the applicants and references have also been orally examined by the Board, on a second and third occasion, because of the contradictory nature of the evidence submitted.</P>
    <P>The reports which have been passed to the Minister up to and including 17/4/26 may be classified as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The number of &ldquo;eligible&rdquo; applicants whose cases have not yet been reported on is 9,561.  Of this number approximately 4,000 applicants have been notified that the Board propose to report &ldquo;Nil&rdquo; in respect of military service, in the absence of more satisfactory evidence to be furnished within twenty-one days of the date of issue of the notification referred to.</P>
    <P>Some idea of the volume of work involved in the correspondence already referred to may be obtained after consideration of the following particulars.  Two series of forms are in use.  One series&mdash;all of which are printed&mdash;includes thirteen separate forms continuously in use in this office.  The second series&mdash;stencil forms&mdash;total twenty separate forms which are in daily use.  The total number of all kinds issued between the 4/10/24 and the 17/4/26 is not less than 180,000.  In addition about 12,000 typed letters have been issued to applicants, references, solicitors, T.D's., Department of Defence, etc., many of which were of a highly important and confidential nature, involving careful consideration of the principles and policy guiding the Board in their procedure.  Throughout the period since the appointment of the Board, the volume of correspondence received and issued each <Col N="2072" /> day has been considerable.  The average number of letters received has not been less than 500 a day, and during some months the total received averaged over 1,000 a day; all of which required attention, e.g., acknowledgment, attachment to relative file, reply by forms or typed letters. The outgoing correspondence during most of the period since the Board's appointment has averaged slightly over 500 letters a day, frequently exceeding six hundred letters a day, and for short periods averaging as high as seven hundred and fifty letters a day.  To summarise, a very large number of persons to whom the Military Service Pensions Act did not apply made applications. Quite a large proportion even of those classified as &ldquo;eligible&rdquo; have proved on investigation not to be qualified for pension under the Act.  In respect of service in the Volunteers of which no official records exist, the investigation of applications involves very serious difficulty, and a huge volume of correspondence. Proof of service in the National Army in the months following the 1/7/22 is not available in a large number of cases, and much correspondence is usually necessary before the matter can be definitely determined.  It is to be noted that outside military centres much difficulty was experienced in acquiring accommodation suitable to the large number of witnesses.  Applicants who receive notification of the intention of the Board to report against them make very exhaustive efforts to establish their claims to have rendered military service within the meaning of the Act.  This is the starting point of what in fact is a reinvestigation of each applicant's case, calling for the issue of many queries and subsequently very careful sifting of all the evidence submitted.</P>
    <P>In addition, questions of policy; difficulties as to the rank of applicants in special cases; appeals against the Board's decisions; Dáil Questions; service outside Saorstát Eireann; investigation of the applications of persons at present resident <Col N="2073" /> in the Six Counties; interpretation of the Military Service Pensions Act and Regulations, etc., etc., frequently occupy the attention of the Board.</P>
    <P>That statement gives a rough idea of what the Board has got to do and what it has been doing since it was inaugurated. I merely present that to show the House and the public the amount of work and the class of work the Board has to attend to.  It is very exacting work.  The Board is there standing between the taxpayer and the individual in all those cases, and it takes an amount of perseverance and a good deal of time to get exactly at the position as regards each case.  I suppose there are very few cases that are just quite similar.  In every case they must take first and foremost the evidence of the applicant, his demeanour, and the evidence of people he brings forward.  I may say that in a great many cases the applicants give references to people who can testify to their services, and these references when sent out for verification are never returned to the Board.  I have come across that time and time again myself.  It is the fault in many cases of the people to whom these forms are sent.  They do not fill them. Perhaps they cannot fill them if they are to do it conscientiously; therefore they never fill them up.  If these references were sent back immediately, and if everything that the Board asks were done, the work would be made considerably lighter for the Board, and the whole machinery could be expedited; but while all this juggling is going on&mdash;people trying by all manner of means to get their cases heard and to get pensions&mdash;it is very hard for the Board, acting as it is between the State and the individual, to come to conclusions in these cases.  I do not know that there is anything further I have got to say on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement was very interesting, and I am sure it will read very well; but he did not deal with the question seriously raised by several Deputies.  It is known that men have applied for service certificates, and their applications were submitted to the Board of Assessors. The case for service certificates was proved and admitted, but they have been denied military service certificates under the Act because the particular service they gave in the Volunteers was not deemed to be the kind of service called for in the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2075" /> I cannot speak with any definite form of authority on this matter, but I imagine it all depends on the definition of active service.  It is known that men were in the Volunteers in the years after 1916, and they remained in the Volunteers, and subsequently joined the National Army.  Their applications have been inquired into, and all those facts which I have indicated are admitted; but they are refused certificates because their particular class of service was not satisfactory in the opinion of the Board of Assessors.  I think it is due to the Dáil and to the people who have been turned down that they should have some explanation as to what constitutes the essential feature of service which would entitle men to a military service pension.</P>
    <P>I gather from the Act that the expression &ldquo;military service&rdquo; means active service in any rank among the Volunteers, the Citizen Army, Fianna Eireann, the Hibernian Rifles, and the national forces or defence forces of Saorstát Eireann.  Active service in the National Army does not necessarily mean that a man should have been firing from a rifle.  There is plenty of work to be done, besides firing from a rifle, which would constitute active service in the National Army.  If I understand the meaning of this definition clause, what applies to the National Army, in respect of military service, applies also to any of the pre-National Army forces.  But notwithstanding the fact that men have given that particular kind of service in the pre-Treaty forces and have subsequently joined the National Army, there is some flaw in their service; that is to say, there is some condition required before their service shall be deemed to warrant the Minister in giving a certificate.  It has not been made clear, and nobody, as a matter of fact, knows what that condition is, and I think it is due that some explanation should be made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In the statement introducing the Act.  We are now asked by two members of one Party, first, why did we not give more pensions, and second, why have we given so many?  The position with regard to service is this: If a person had active service in Easter Week, 1916, he is entitled to a military certificate if he joined the National Army.  No case has been made in respect to any person who served in 1916, and who subsequently joined the National Army, that he was refused a pension.  There is a gap between Easter Week, 1916, and the establishment of Dáil Eireann in 1919.</P>
      <P>I think it will be admitted that very little in the nature of military service was indulged in from the 1st May, 1916, until 1919.  Only those who had active service in Easter Week, 1916, would qualify in respect of that particular period.  Attendance at Volunteer parades and at drill from 1916 up to 1919 or 1920, or perhaps up to 1922, would not constitute military service, in my opinion.  I do not know whether it is contended that it should, but at any rate it would not fulfil one of the conditions which this Act on its introduction was stated to fulfil; that was some compensation in respect of the interruption of people's lives.</P>
      <P>In cases where persons were wholly employed in respect of military service from 1919 up to the formation of the National Army in 1922, I do not think there would be any great difficulty in proving active service.  It is for the Board of Assessors to determine that; but I am perfectly satisfied that there would be numberless applications supported by a great many people claiming that persons, because of their membership of the Volunteers, were entitled to pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity of saying that the Board of Assessors is in a rather defenceless position.  No member of the Board of Assessors can come here and give an account of his administration.  As Deputy Davin said, it is an unpopular administration to have to perform.  There were twenty-one or twenty-two thousand applications, and sixteen hundred pensions <Col N="2077" /> were granted, and I presume that most of the dissatisfaction will be vented on those people.  I think it would not be possible to give any information regarding the Board of Assessors, who have a statutory duty to perform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I advise you to amend the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The President referred to Deputies of different Parties putting forward conflicting opinions.  I did not make any suggestion purely from the point of view of not giving pensions.  I am interested in certain persons getting pensions if they are entitled to receive them; I do not want to prevent people, who are entitled to them, from getting pensions. It has not been made clear what service is required in order to enable a man to receive a pension.  Deputy Colohan raised the point with regard to men on intelligence work and police work, and the President answered that the Act governed the service.  The Act does not govern the service; it does not mention service of that kind.  It is obvious the service intended is not merely to be service of the kind that involves the actual firing of rifles.  As Deputy Johnson puts it, there may be other service in addition to actual participation in the fighting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want some definition as to what is meant by service apart from that.  I know one person who put in a claim, and has been refused a certificate of service in respect of pension.  I know personally, although I could not swear it, from information given me before the Pensions Act was under consideration, that that man was engaged on intelligence work and on such work as conveying persons from place to place.  He was refused a pension. I want to know what the definition of service is that would be considered in the nature of active service. I believe that man risked his life in the service he engaged in.  We have statements made about people getting pensions who gave no service that would warrant them getting such pensions. I can support the statement made by Deputy Davin that the number of pensions already granted seems almost to be in excess of the number <Col N="2078" /> of people who were on active service, as we understand it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not use these words.  What I had in my mind was this: I was trying to draw a comparison between the pre-Truce active service men and the number provided for here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>How can we understand the number entitled to active service pensions if we do not understand what active service means?  That is the whole difficulty.  Men might be on the run, and men might be carrying rifles, but the number of pensions granted is altogether in excess of the number of men who were on the run at that time.  That is my point of view for what it is worth.  Would the Minister answer my question with regard to the estimate of the future liability of the State for pensions.  Can he give us an estimate of that kind, or can he tell us whether this £361,000 is likely to be an annual item or is there likely to be an increase or a decrease in the expenditure? Another question, in regard to the administration of the Act, is this. I know some people who made claims, and one of the difficulties they found in proving their claims arose from the fact that they were members of battalions or columns that went Irregular since.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in South Tipperary.  On that account those men found it difficult to get evidence of the kind that would satisfy the Board of Assessors as to their service in pre-Truce days.  That places them in great difficulty.  Practically all their former comrades went Irregular, and I ask whether the information that might be given by these officers, who held rank in the old pre-Truce Army, and afterwards turned Irregular, would be received as some confirmation of the services of such men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister a question?  He referred to a number of forms that were sent to Deputies and other people and were not returned. I think he rightly made a case that there was a very large number of these <Col N="2079" /> cases that could not be attributed to the Board of Assessors.  That is quite true.  I represent my native constituency in this House.  I have resided in Dublin for close on 20 years.  I was sent a very large number of forms to sign, but I felt I could not, conscientiously, sign forms as to the activities of people with whom I was not thoroughly acquainted. I scarcely sent in any forms, and I may be included in the category mentioned by the Minister.  I have been told, in my own constituency, that a number of forms were sent to officers in the service of the National Army who were pre-Truce officers, and that none of those officers returned them to the Board of Assessors.  Is there any obligation on officers now in the service of the National Army, who were pre-Truce officers in the Irish Republican Army, not to sign these documents or was any injunction given to them that they should not do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not.  The only obligation put upon these men in regard to these forms is an obligation of honour.  If a man knows anything against an applicant he is in honour bound to indicate it, but I know of cases where people, sooner than do a bad turn, did not return the forms. There never was any suggestion that officers should not sign, or that they should not give all the information they could in reference to these applicants.</P>

      <P>The moneys which are estimated in this Vote are, of course, all statutory.  They are all under the various heads of the Railways Act, 1924, and very little need be said about them at this stage.  It will be noticed that the increased expenditure which is estimated for under sub-head A definitely arises from increments to the Registrar and the lower executive officer, and some slight increase in the case of shorthand typist, and the bonus, also, makes a corresponding increase.  Under sub-head B there is an increased estimate of £120 due entirely to the estimated increased expenditure that will be likely in connection with the standard charges.  Sub-head C is only varied by £10.  The cost of the telegrams is the same.  The telephones this year have been increased by £10.  Last year the Estimate was <Col N="2081" /> rather short of what it might have been.  This year is based upon the result of experience.  The increases in this Vote are accordingly purely automatic, except so far as sub-head B is concerned.  Sub-head B is on account of the increase in the advertising for the following year.  It is to be noted of course, in connection with this Vote that the nett sum required is only £4,150.  The Estimate that was put down, £8,162, is decreased by payments by the Amalgamated Company under Section 15 (4) of the Railways Act, 1924, of £4,000.  There is also a small appropriation-in-aid of £50.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to put the Minister to any great trouble in connection with this Vote.  But I think he might give to the Dáil something in the nature of a brief history of the work of this particular Tribunal during the past twelve months, and how far they have gone to complete the classification which is the principal work engaged in during the past year.  I would like also if he would let the Dáil know what is the present position in regard to the preparation of the standard charges.  I understand that a good deal of the work of this Tribunal has been carried on in committee, <i>in camera</i> if you like, and that possibly the people who might benefit by the knowledge, if they were in the position to gain some idea of the work performed, have got no information as to what is being done; that there is practically nothing on record that will be available for the future so far as any body within the country, appealing to this Tribunal in the future, will be concerned with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised a question here before as to the reason why a verbatim report of the proceedings was not being made available.  I quite realise that it would probably mean the expenditure of a fairly large amount of money, but seeing that the Tribunal is now engaged upon the preparation of the first classification, which is the foundation and will be the foundation for future classifications of goods and merchandise, I think that the provision of the money for supplying a verbatim report, and printing and circulating such report might be a very useful expenditure. <Col N="2082" /> For instance, the farmers' and co-operative societies who may think it wise and right to go before the Tribunal in regard to appeals, will not have at their disposal the grounds on which the Tribunal decided that such-and-such a class of goods was provided for under such-and-such a classification. Presumably the work has gone on too far now to rectify this particular matter, but the Minister might tell the Dáil how far the Tribunal has gone in regard to the work of classification and how soon it will be possible to have the classification in its final form sanctioned by the Railway Tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point which I want to raise in connection with this Vote.  I am not quite clear whether it would come under this Vote or the Vote of the Minister.  It arises out of the appointment of a panel, the members of which were to be brought into consultation with the Tribunal in fixing of charges in the carrying of specific products.  I want to ask the Minister why it is that representatives of agriculture nominated to this panel have never, up to the present, been called into consultation by the Railway Tribunal.  It seems, to say the least of it, an extraordinary procedure that where the Tribunal was to fix charges, in an agricultural country, where by far the greater part of the traffic would be from that industry, that the representatives of the industry, nominated on this panel, were never called into consultation by the Tribunal.  I want to know in how far the Tribunal are responsible, or what authority has the Minister in this matter or has he any authority whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to draw attention to the fact that although in 1924 our organisation nominated certain representatives on this panel, they have never been called into consultation by the Tribunal. Although they have been ignored we have the &ldquo;Irish Trade Journal,&rdquo; in December, 1925, writing deploring the fact that the farming community and those interested in the live stock trade have taken no part in the proceedings before the Railway Tribunal.  Now, the first act of the farming community was to nominate certain representatives <Col N="2083" /> who were to be called into consultation when the rates to be charged were being fixed.  These representatives have never, up to the present, been called into consultation, and before the &ldquo;Irish Trade Journal&rdquo; rushed to a conclusion and deplored the fact that nothing has been done they should have looked round to see what part those responsible played in inviting opinions from people who were appointed to assist when the charges on agricultural products were being fixed. I want to hear from the Minister if he can give a reason why these men were never called into consultation, and if he will tell us who was responsible for writing in the &ldquo;Irish Trade Journal,&rdquo; the official organ, that it was regrettable that the farming community had taken no part in the proceedings before the Railway Tribunal?  How is it expected that they would when their representatives were not consulted?</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin has inquired as to the doings of the Railway Tribunal.  A report was tabled some time ago giving a survey, covering the period of a year of the activities of the Railway Tribunal.  That was placed on the Table and I presume it is in the Members' Room.  In that the Deputy can get an account up to date of all the activities of the Tribunal. That, of course, is produced in accordance with the 1924 Act, which provides that there is to be laid before the members of the Oireachtas such a report, and the report was duly filed. The Deputy raised a question as to a verbatim report of the proceedings.  I gave previously, I think, a fairly lengthy and what I considered was a reasoned answer, that the cost seemed to be out of all proportion to the value that could be got from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not give any estimate in the answer, but there was a sufficient estimate given to enable me to form the conclusion that undoubtedly the expenditure would be far in advance of any value that could be derived from it.  The classification <Col N="2084" /> question was also raised by Deputy Davin.  That matter has just been completed. I believe that as far as the Tribunal are concerned they have finished their report.  It is in the hands of the printers, but it has not yet made its appearance.  Deputy Baxter talked of the panel, and wanted to know who was responsible for the farmers not taking a better interest in the doings of the Railway Tribunal.  The farmers themselves are, of course, responsible &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me finish the sentence.  They have no right to be called into consultation except in so far as the panel is set up under Section 17 (1) (a), and Section 17 (1) (a) gives what is called the general panel, as opposed to the railway and canal panel.  If the Deputy remembers what was said in the Railway Act debates on (b) he will recall that it was declared that the difference between these panels was that one was the general purposes panel and the other was for particular business.  To get people appointed or to nominate people to serve on that when they are called upon, is what the farmers&mdash;I do not know whether it is the Farmers' Union or some farmers' representatives&mdash;have done.  They have established their four, the four whom they would like to be called.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But as to when these people are to be called, that is set out in Section 17, which states that whenever &ldquo;the Railway Tribunal either upon application by any of the parties or otherwise so request, or the Minister thinks it expedient there shall be added....&rdquo;  The Railway Tribunal made no application to me to put these people on.  Presumably that was because the parties concerned in this case did not make application, and in the absence of that application I certainly did not think it <Col N="2085" /> expedient that people who were not alive to their own interests should be called up by me to serve.  There is nothing inconsistent in people not being summoned when they could themselves have set that summons in motion by application for the purpose of the panel; and with regard to the complaint that was made in the &ldquo;Trade Journal&rdquo; that the farmers as a whole had not taken any part in, or any interest in the matter, there are other ways in which the farming community could show an interest in the doings of the Railway Tribunal.  A question was raised by Deputy Heffernan when the 1924 Act was going through, and it was later raised to me in a Supplementary Question put on a Question set down by some other Deputy with regard to the matter of classification. It was with reference to that particular point that the &ldquo;Trade Journal&rdquo; made the comment, and that comment, that the farming community had not shown any interest in the proceedings of the Railway Tribunal, was perfectly sound. So that there is no dereliction of duty on anybody's part, as far as I can see, except on the part of the parties interested, in not making application for the purposes of the panel.  Whether that application, if made, could have been acceded to in the particular case would have been a matter for the Railway Tribunal, because the general panel, the second panel set out in paragraph (4) was a panel with which the farming interests had nothing to do, and it would be very difficult to take a person from one group of four and fill that single place on the Tribunal for some general question, such as classification, in which a great many more interests had to be represented than the farming interests.  However that may be, in so far as there was failure, the failure was on the part of the people themselves, who could have raised the matter by making application.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £5,477 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1927, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Marine Service (Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894-1921, Crown Lands Acts, 1829-1866).</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is completely ruled by statute.  Sub-head A, dealing with salaries, wages and allowances, shows in so far as the two sub-heads, Mercantile Marine Offices and Survey Services, are concerned, an increase of about £300.  Deputies will notice that there has been an increase of one in the personnel attached to the Mercantile Marine Office. That one is an extra clerical officer, and that represents an increase in the Vote of about £250.  There are, of course, savings on the Vote, the savings being equalled by certain other advances.  Of the two clerical officers, one is attached to the superintendent and the other to the deputy superintendent, the superintendent having to deal with Dublin, and the deputy superintendent being located in Cork. The other increases, with the exception of that £250 due to the extra clerical officer, are due entirely to annual increases in salaries and bonuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other service, the Survey service, while keeping the same numbers, shows a saving of about £10.  Sub-head B also shows a decrease from £968 to £730 this year.  It includes a miscellaneous collection of items such as the provision of uniforms, payment of legal expenses, medals for presentation for gallantry at sea, technical newspapers and matters of that type.  On sub-head BB <Col N="2088" /> £10 is set down to cover possible cost of any inquiry that may arise into any accident to shipping.  There was one such big inquiry, and the actual cost was much more than £10.  That was an inquiry into the loss of the &ldquo;Lismore&rdquo; some years ago.  The £10 would represent the nominal sum likely to be brought into payment in any year in the case of an accident. If there were more than one or two accidents in a year that sum would require to be very definitely increased. Sub-head C shows somewhat of a saving on the Estimate, but it is not very much; it amounts to only £17.  It is founded on the experience of what the ordinary cost is.  Sub-head D stands at the same figure as last year. It is an item largely recoverable and the other side is shown in sub-head G. The same remarks apply to sub-head E, relief of distressed seamen.  Most of it is recoverable, and would be represented by portion of the money indicated in sub-head G.</P>
    <P>Coast Life-Saving Service stands pretty much as last year's figures with one exception.  The cost of telephones shows an increase of about £56, due to the fact that there has been a better linking up of the various officers in connection with the Coast Life-Saving Service.  More stations are joined up than last year, and that accounts for the increase.  All the other items stand as they were, except that there is a saving of £30 in rents for rocket houses, watch huts and exercise grounds, but against that there is an increase in the allowance paid to the store-keeper. The amount mentioned, £1,700, represents what is paid for the main charges of the Coast Life-Saving Service.  It is mainly a volunteer service, but the No. 1 and No. 2 men at all stations are paid.  I think the No. 1 man gets £15 and the No. 2, £10, but in some stations the figures fall to £12 and £6. The other payments are for drills that are done by the volunteer crews, so that the £1,700 represents pretty well the expenditure on the Coast Life-Saving Service in so far as payments to the personnel are concerned.  I omit the separate payments to the Inspector, two superintendents and the store-keeper, which are set out in the Estimate. <Col N="2089" /> The appropriations-in-aid are estimated to bring in a larger amount this year than last year owing to the fact that the fee for the survey of ships has been raised.</P>
    <P>This Vote shows a net decrease of £2,000.  I understand that the £4,600 set aside as the estimate for the cost of the Coast Life-Saving is to be compared with an item of £20,000 which was the cost for a similar service before the Free State took it over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hopeful that the Minister would give more detail with regard to the Coast Life-Saving Service and Coastal Preventive Work dealing with life or property saving. I think the public are not very well aware&mdash;and I wonder if Deputies are any better informed&mdash;as to what is the position of the Free State in regard to life-saving services in general, including the lights.  I think the Minister will be well advised to avail of this opportunity to inform the Dáil and the public on this subject.  The lighthouse service is, no doubt, mainly a life-saving one and should have some relationship, I think, to the coastwise service ashore.  I do not know whether there is in contemplation any new agreement with regard to the maintenance of the lights, lighthouses or lightships, but I think if the Minister gave, in some general way, an outline of the present position and whether there is any change contemplated it would be an advantage.  A question has arisen more than once as to the adequacy of the life-saving service, rocket service, coast-watching and, incidental thereto, the lifeboat service. We realise that the lifeboat service is a voluntary service, but apparently we are paying a certain sum of money to maintain or keep the crews in training. I take it that refers to the lifeboat crews?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have made clear the relationship, if any, between the lifeboat service and the coast-watching service, rocket crews and so on.  There is a feeling abroad that there is not adequate service&mdash; that while there may have been a big saving we are not doing as well in that <Col N="2090" /> regard as the old regime.  I think it must be recognised as against that, that while from the purely humanitarian point of view we are bound to do all that is necessary in case of a wreck. or the danger of wreck, the charge upon the Irish funds, if we were to do that adequately, would be, in respect to shipping other than Irish shipping, Obviously, in our case, the great bulk of the shipping around our coast which would be served by the Irish Coastal Life-Saving Service, would be British shipping.  It is because of that, that I think there should be some public statement of the position, and whether any intention is in mind in regard to a change of policy in this matter.  There is sufficient public interest in it to warrant the Minister making a fuller statement than has been yet made.  If the Minister is in a position to do that it would be well to do it this afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised three questions.  One was in reference to the Irish lighthouses.  That is to be the subject of a convention, but that convention has not been agreed to yet.  Negotiations are in progress, but they are being carried on by the Department of Finance and not by my Department.  I am concerned here merely with the coast life-saving service, and the moneys shown here do not include any expenditure for lifeboat service.  That is a different matter altogether.  We have, of course, very harmonious and cordial relations with them, and the amount here which indicates the further installation of telephone facilities is for the purpose of conveying information as to vessels in distress around the coast to any apparatus station or to any lifeboat station. We are linked up with them, but no part of the moneys estimated here is to be spent on the training of lifeboat crews.  The crews I spoke of were volunteer crews kept for the purpose of our coast life-saving service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if the telephone service is always available or if it depends on any local post office arrangement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not depend on local arrangements.  It is to be always available.  So far&mdash;although <Col N="2091" /> there have been newspaper statements to the contrary&mdash;there has been no failure.  Where there was a telephone service they were able to link up with the headquarter staff in connection with the marine service and to have vessels in distress reported at once and all the necessary precautions taken. Two or three instances were indicated by the Press of people outside the Department who had picked up signals during the winter.  There is no denying that these signals might have been picked up by other people, but they had been previously picked up by the headquarters staff of my Department and the whole machinery had been set in motion.</P>
      <P>As to the question of enlarged services, there has been no evidence yet put forward as to the need for greater expenditure on coast watching.  No evidence has been put forward sufficient to found a case with which we might go to the British Government or whatever Government would be represented by most of the shipping that circulates around our shores.  Deputy Johnson, I think, suggested two years ago that inasmuch as most of the shipping around the coast was not registered here, and as most of the service would be for the benefit of shipping companies, the shipping companies might have some levy made for this purpose.  Until there is evidence of a failure, or evidence to show that some greater provision is necessary in this regard, I do not think we could reasonably approach the shipping companies or the British Government.  If that case is made and if evidence is brought forward, then there is very good reason for having the money paid by those whose property, with the lives aboard, is dependent upon shipping services outside this country.  There has been no case, I think, in which there has been any complaint raised with regard to the inadequacy of the coast life-saving service except possibly in the case of the lamentable occurrence at Dun Laoghaire, where two hobblers lost their lives.  In that case, no possible provision in the way of coast watching could have made any difference whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2092" /> With regard to the work actually done by this service for the year ended 31st March, 1926, there are 51 of these stations around the coast.  There are about 12 along the Eastern coast, 26 along the Southern coast, and the remainder along the Western and Northern coasts.  There were over two hundred exercise or drills held during the year and there was attendance at twelve shipwrecks.  The rocket apparatus was instrumental in saving four lives.  Twenty-five vessels foundered or standard.  The total number of persons on board was 313, of whom 302 were saved, 11 lives being lost.  Nine of the boats became total wrecks and the remainder were refloated. I should say that in addition to the four saved through the instrumentality of the rocket apparatus, there were 30 persons saved from a vessel by means of ropes stretching from the ship to the shore.  Thirty-six, stations had telephone apparatus installed during the year.  Arrangements have been made to have all the stations connected with the telephone system, and that connection will be independent, as far as possible, of any local conditions, and will be always available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>We all recognise that the Irish Lights have been carried on at substantial loss.  I do not know what the financial condition of the Irish Lights is at the moment, but I know there has been a substantial deficit in the working in the past.  If we are not making any provision for a contribution this year, does it mean that our liabilities will accumulate and that we will have to pay the accumulated amount later on?  The Minister says there is a Convention in the air in connection with the whole service. The lights maintained around our <Col N="2093" /> coast in connection with the Irish Lights Commissioners are only partially for ships of the Free State.  It brings us to a realisation of the small amount of shipping emanating from ports of the Free State.  It is very regrettable that the home marine service should be adequately covered by a Vote of something like £12,000 or a net Vote of £8,000 odd.  One is forced to regret that a much bigger Vote is not required. That brings home to us the fact that home tonnage is practically non-existent.  There is very little shipping owned in the Free State at present.  I suppose it would be premature to ask the Minister if the Government have any definite policy on that matter nor could I really advocate the adoption of any policy in this direction at the moment, because it will have to settle itself by the evolution of time.  I think there is no more material for criticisism in connection with this service, but it seems to me to be beneath our dignity to carry on our whole marine service with the inadequate sum of £8,000.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hewat has spoken of the Irish Lights Service. I fear I must have misunderstood him when I thought I heard him say that generally the Lighthouse Fund has not been able to meet the charges.  If he meant the funds derived from Irish shipping would not pay for the protection of Irish shipping that is quite right, but there is a general lighthouse fund levied on ships.  That is far from being inadequate, and it is from that fund that the Irish Lights Service is being maintained.  The report of the Convention was not ready for this year's Estimates, but will be here before next year's Estimates are under discussion.

I maintain the lighthouse service is not local but actually international.  The lighthouses should be in one fund and should not be even confined to Great Britain. They are for the service of every vessel that uses the ocean.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to call attention at the beginning to one entry which was discovered to be put down in an inaccurate way on the Vote of the Ministry of Justice.  The same difficulty arises here.  It is on page 218 of those Estimates in sub-head A in reference to a certain branch of the Department, &ldquo;the proportion of the cost of messengers, cleaners and protective force in Government Buildings.&rdquo;  The error, such as it was, was magnified out of all proportion.  The words &ldquo;and protective force&rdquo; should have been italicised to show that the force no longer exists. It is clear that the difference between £312 this year and £723 for last year shows definitely that no money was being asked for the payment of these forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make a clear distinction at the beginning of this Vote as between the different sub-heads and to apportion the expenditure between one large item and all other items.  It will be noticed that the net total given for <Col N="2096" /> this Vote for this year is £351,777. Deputies should keep that figure in mind as the net total, and make the following deduction: the Vote under sub-head L, contributions to the Unemployment Fund and to Special Schemes, £225,000, and add to that the sum set aside for the Employment branch, a total of £98,259, and make the additions I will mention to the total of these two.  These items I am going to speak of represent in part an estimate of the amount of the various sub-heads debited to some matters in connection with unemployment insurance.  Some of them are clearly for that purpose, and for no other purpose.  It was estimated that two-thirds of the expenditure to be incurred under D is due to matters arising out of the administration of the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  That is to say, two-thirds of that was £3,333.  About two-thirds of sub-head C has also to be debited to the same cause, that is, a sum of £1,266. Again, two-thirds of the telegrams and telephones costs has to be taken, or a sum of £1,620.  G is obviously in its entirety for the purpose of the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  For that a sum of £1,500 must also be added in. The same remarks will apply to H&mdash; to M the full payment of £350, and to N the full payment of £150.  In addition it is reckoned, but here there is less certainty, that one-tenth of the work of the statistics branch comes from the same quarter.  That is, about £2,967 would be put into this addition. Two-thirds of the work in connection with the Finance and Establishment Branch are also to be debited to the question of unemployment.  There is a Finance Branch, which is £10,500, and there is an item given as Establishment, £19,043.  The Claims and Records is entirely unemployment.  It is £19,852, and about £19,700, excluding Claims and Record Office.  That is £39,500 between the two.</P>
    <P>That would mean that there is from this Vote a sum of about £374,271 due to matters in connection with the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  From that must be taken Appropriations-in-Aid: sub-head O (a) the whole of that £107,000; (b) the whole of the £125; and in (f), &ldquo;Miscellaneous Receipts,&rdquo;<Col N="2097" /> £45 out of the £50 may be taken.  From this Vote of £374,271 you must deduct Appropriations-in-Aid amounting to £107,170, so that the nett cost of the work and Exchanges in connection with the Unemployment Insurance Acts amounts to £267,100.  If that be taken from the total Vote of £351,777, it leaves a sum of £84,676, which is the amount of the Vote for services other than those in connection with the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  I can go into details again if any questions arise as to the appropriateness of the apportionment of any or all of that money in reference to the Unemployment Insurance Vote.  It therefore comes to this, that £84,676 is the Vote being asked for for purposes other than those of the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  I propose to take the work of the Department under the headings of the different branches, namely: Transport and Marine, Commerce and Technical, Industry and Statistics, and to show exactly what is the work that is being carried out which is estimated to cost the country this year £84,676.  The Transport and Marine Branch is the first that calls for consideration, and I propose, in the briefest possible way, to give a general survey of the work done in the past financial year by this branch.  It will arise under a different heading in connection with the general railway legislation and administration work in connection with the Railways Act, 1924. There fell to this Department the work of preparing and publishing the financial returns of the railway companies for the year 1924, and the returns in connection with railway accidents and casualties, which included the inspecting officer's inquiries and his reports on such accidents.  There was attendance before and assisting at the Railway Tribunal in connection with the schemes for amalgamation and absorption; standard terms and conditions of the carriage of merchandise; regulations for addressing merchandise; forms of schedules, etc; and revision of classification of merchandise.</P>
    <P>Figures had to be complied relating to the average nett revenue of the several companies comprising the Great Southern Railways Company for the <Col N="2098" /> years 1911-12-13, and these had to be submitted with reports thereon to the Railway Tribunal.  The Castlecomer, Wolfhill, and Arigna colliery railways had to have their accounts and workings investigated, and certain matters, of which I spoke on the other Vote had to be inquired into in connection with claims for the acquisition of land in connection with Castlecomer and Wolfhill.  A matter which was raised by a Deputy on the other Votes was also the subject of inquiry by the Transport Section, that is to say, investigation and attendance in respect of matters in connection with the baronial guaranteed railways.  The financial position of the Great Southern Railways Company had to be examined and a report presented.  There was an inquiry into the accounts and working of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Company, including the three Government railways worked by that company, and in connection with which there may, and possibly will, be an additional Vote required for the purpose of carrying on these Government-owned railways worked by the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company. Claims for malicious damage on railways had to be investigated and reports made to the Compensation Commission. Work arose in connection with liquidation accounts arising under the British Government control of the Irish railway system.  Agreements under certain sections of the Railways Act had to be examined into and then collated for the purposes of the Railway Tribunal.  There was the ordinary general correspondence regarding transport charges, respecting which complaints have been forwarded by Deputies, and train facilities, in connection with which there is a great volume of correspondence, and, moreover, all sorts of miscellaneous inquiries can be made.</P>
    <P>On the marine side, there was an investigation into various matters in connection with harbours, docks and piers, the receipt and examination of the annual accounts and sinking fund returns of various harbour authorities. There had then to be submitted to the Rates Advisory Committee appointed in 1925 under the Harbours, <Col N="2099" /> Docks and Piers (Temporary Increase of Charges) Act, 1920, applications for powers to increase the statutory charges.  These applications came from Waterford, Galway, Wexford, and Youghal.  Public inquiries were held in connection with the first three authorities.  These inquiries had to be attended by representatives of the Department. An order was issued in the case of Waterford, and orders have been recommended in the case of Galway and Wexford, and the preparation of these is in hands.  In the fourth case, that of Youghal, the matter is still before the Rates Advisory Committee.  Work had also to be undertaken in connection with the Dundalk Harbour and Port Act of 1925, and a report had to be prepared and presented to the Oireachtas dealing with the Limerick Harbour Bill. There was then a public inquiry into the application for a Provisional Order from the Tralee and Fenit Pier and Harbour Commissioners on which a report had to be procured and considered. That application, incidentally, was not acceded to.  Further to this there was general work in connection with the appointment of harbour commissioners and auditors, and miscellaneous applications for financial assistance.</P>
    <P>The annual accounts and reports of accidents in connection with tramways had also to be undertaken.  The examination of these accounts was a matter that lasted for a considerable portion of the year.  The Dublin United Tramway Company's powers, and the Cork Tramways statutory charging powers, had been increased under the 1920 Act, so that consequently close attention had to be given to the financial results of these allowed increases and to the financial position of these undertakings.  The Sligo and Belmullet steamer service, which was only taken over by this Department late last year, caused a certain amount of work which I detailed on the last Vote. Inquiries had to be instituted to see what were the effects, if any, in the working of that steam service, and of the alternative methods to provide the people of Belmullet with ready access to Sligo, and some method of getting <Col N="2100" /> supplies from Sligo.  The investigation that I spoke of on Friday last is still pending.  What the result will be I cannot forecast.  This was a service that was taken over from the office of Public Works.  When taken over it was found to be running on terms that it was felt the Oireachtas would not readily submit to for many years to come.  Consequently an immediate inquiry was instituted, but, as I have said, the result has not yet been ascertained.</P>
    <P>Then there is the matter of inland navigation.  Certain matters fell for consideration, such as the proposed abandonment of the Ulster canal; the proposed abandonment of navigation on the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell canal; the third item I hesitate to mention, because I fear it is going to give rise to remarks outside the scope of what I intend.  There had to be certain works by the transport branch in relation to the improvement of the Barrow navigation which I would distinguish from the Barrow drainage.  In addition there is the question of the development of transport services on the Royal Canal.  This would represent the ordinary administrative work of the officers of this Department, but there was, of course, work in connection with what is put down in the separate Vote, Vote 59, which we have just discussed &mdash;marine service.  The differentiation which was made with regard to the two Votes is that Vote 59 deals with the out-officers in connection with this marine service.  There is, of course, borne on the main Vote&mdash;Vote 56&mdash;the salaries of the headquarters people in connection with that.</P>
    <P>There has been under consideration for many months, one might almost say for years, a piece of legislation which has been found to be much heavier than ever was anticipated, and that is the question of merchant shipping.  There is some hope that that legislation may be ready for presentation in the autumn or in the winter of this year.  It entailed a considerable amount of work on certain people in the Department and finally led to the appointment of extra help in the draftsman's office so as to have that legislation brought reasonably near.  Legislation has been promised from time to time, and always <Col N="2101" /> without any proper forecast of what the burden of the work was.  It was only recently that the full amount of work necessitated was really appreciated, and steps were taken to meet a further delay that seemed to be involved when the full burden of the work was realised.  I cannot even yet say when that legislation will be ready, but it is certainly engaging a great deal of attention and is causing a tremendous amount of labour to those concerned with it.</P>
    <P>Sitting suspended at 6.30 and resumed at 7.15,</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The work of the Commerce and Technical Branch is the next in order of these sub-divisions on Vote 56.  It has a variety of work to do, and could be best described under the headings of the various Acts which have to be administered.  The Assurance Companies Act of 1909 throws a certain amount of work on the officials of this section.  The accounts of 76 companies were furnished and had to be examined during the course of the year, and it had to be seen that the cash securities as required by the Act had been deposited with the court.  A sum of £880,000 was deposited by 43 companies during the year, and in addition to that there was the annual statutory report presented lately to the Oireachtas.  Under the Companies Acts from 1890 to 1924 various applications may be made through the Department to me, and these have to be dealt with. These arise under various heads, such as an application for a change of name, permission to omit the name of a director, the appointment of auditors, etc., and then there were other applications under various sections of these Acts where various small concessions were sought.  About 20 of these applications were received and dealt with during the course of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Offences then had to be looked to, and where necessary, prosecutions instituted. During the year 1925 about 300 companies were reported by the registrar as having failed in some provisions of these Acts.  That matter had to be taken up with all of these, and in about <Col N="2102" /> four cases the State Solicitor was applied to and prosecutions put forward. In addition, there is the annual statutory report required under these Acts, which was prepared and presented. There was an Act passed by the Oireachtas about two years ago called the Companies (Reconstitution of Records) Act.  This applied to about 2,000 companies whose records had been destroyed in the Custom House fire.  Under the operations of that Act, about the end of the year 1925, the records of every company then on the register had been restored.</P>
    <P>Then there was the Industrial Insurance Act and other Acts.  The main work of the Department under this heading can be very briefly described, but the brevity of the description in no way corresponds to the amount of work done by the branch in that connection. That description may simply be put in this way: that the Departmental Committee's Report had to be examined, conferences held with the people concerned, and the consideration of a draft Bill taken up.  The position with regard to that draft Bill is somewhat unsettled at the moment. A Bill actually was prepared and is in draft.  Its presentation is going to be delayed until the autumn, and by that time there may have to be a discussion as to whether it is right to go ahead with the old system, about which the Committee did not seem to be very enthusiastic, and the consideration of alternatives seemed to them to have been ruled out by their terms of reference. That matter will have to be discussed here if and when that draft Bill is introduced, or in the alternative, a discussion that may arise if it is decided not to have a draft Bill is, is it wise to perpetuate a system about which nobody seems to be enthusiastic, and about which there is tremendous doubt as to the control that can in various circumstances be exercised?  If it is decided to perpetuate the old system, and improve it as much as possible, there falls for consideration the changes that will be necessary in the law to ensure better safeguards in the interests of policy-holders.  That is a matter I do not propose to speak much on at the moment, because it is still subject to inquiry, and may <Col N="2103" /> necessitate reference back to that Committee, or reference of a wider matter altogether to another Committee for their consideration.</P>
    <P>There is then a series of Acts limiting partnership, Money Lenders' Act. Registration of Business Names Act, and Newspaper Libel Registration Act. Their administration rests with this Department.  One can only say a variety of matters arose in this connection during the course of the year, and they were dealt with by this Branch.  In the matter of supplying commercial information to trade representatives abroad, and to the office of the High Commissioner, particulars were sent in respect to about 200 firms interested in various products, such as, textiles, hosiery, hides, skins, bacon, hams, fish, cereals, etc.  These particulars had to be and were communicated to exporters in the Free State likely to be interested.  In addition there was the other side of that which had to be attended to, inquiries by Sáorstat exporters who desired to be put in touch with agents and buyers abroad and in Great Britain.  In connection with the sale of commodities, about 70 firms put inquiries to us of that nature, and information was supplied so far as it was possible.  Information was then collected as to the condition of foreign markets, and as to import duties, and there occasionally arises an inquiry as to the standing of firms abroad, which is a matter that has to be dealt with according to the circumstances in which the inquiry comes.  The administration of the Merchandise (Marks) Acts did not call for a great deal of trouble during the year.  Some two dozen matters arose in connection with these Acts, matters dealing with the use of Irish names on foreign goods where complaints had to be investigated, and inquiries made as to the markings required on imported and foreign goods.</P>
    <P>Then there were a similar series of inquiries on the matter of the detention of goods by the Customs authorities, and representations had to be considered when received from certain Saorstát firms to the effect that imported goods should be made to bear <Col N="2104" /> the name of the country of origin.  In that connection, Bills had recently to be introduced into the British parliament, and reports of various committees set up by Great Britain and Northern Ireland had to be examined with a view to drafting here legislation more suitable to the conditions in the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>The patents, trades marks and copyright matters are somewhat at a standstill here owing to the delay that has been caused in the passage of the Industrial and Property Protection Bill through the Oireachtas.  A Second Reading was given to that Bill about this time last year, but a variety of matters intervened to prevent its consideration as rapidly as we could have wished.  There was, first of all, reference to a Joint Committee to make recommendations before the Committee Stage.  It took some time to get that committee established here.  The question of the Seanad election then intervened to prevent the other House making its selections to that committee prior to the result of the elections being known.  It was then found rather difficult to get people who were sufficiently interested to serve on the committee and certain changes in the personnel were necessitated with regard to those chosen by the Dáil.  However, a committee got working before Easter and that Select Committee's deliberations have pretty well concluded.  There is one other meeting to be held, at which the committee's recommendations will be put in final order, and that Bill will then be reported back to this House to make progress in the ordinary way.  Without such a Bill all that we have been able to do with applications in regard to patents, trades marks and copyright matters was to have them filed.  Over 4,000 such applications were received and duly registered in the Department.  Over 1,700 of these were applications for patents, and 2,200 odd were for trades marks and in respect of designs.  Certain particulars have to be taken out, and each application is indexed with a view to having action expedited when the Industrial and Commercial Property Protection Bill becomes law.  That refers to new applications and the filing of <Col N="2105" /> new applications.  In addition to that, there was a considerable amount of work&mdash;correspondence and other matters&mdash;to be dealt with in conjunction with the other ordinary general matters that arise dealing with patents, trades marks and designs.</P>
    <P>I may say, in regard to the Bill that is at present before that Joint Committee, that the delay has not been at all to the detriment of the Bill, as there has been a considerable amount of information acquired in the meantime through international conferences and through other conferences here at home as to certain improvements that were considered desirable in connection with the Bill.  Most of these have been considered and I do not think I am breaking any secret when I say that most of them have been accepted by the Joint Committee of the two Houses and will, in due course, come before the Dáil for the Dáil's acceptance.  Through this branch also detailed information is available for publication in the &ldquo;Trade Journal,&rdquo; and information is supplied to inquirers in the ordinary course.  In addition to that, certain communiques are issued occasionally to the Press throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It will be noticed through the details of the Commerce and Technical Branch that there is a technical officer dealing with gas, electricity, weights and measures.  There is a verification officer, a chief gas examiner as well as a gas referee.  Those really would indicate what used to be known as the Power Branch of this Ministry.  The work that the Power Section has dealt with has been, to a certain extent, held up by the reactions of the Shannon scheme, because it was not considered advisable that there should be leave given to expend substantial amounts on generating systems, seeing that these would not be required within a short period.  Accordingly the proposals that came before the Commissioners for new electricity orders had to be postponed until it was discovered that the promoters of these orders, or the applicants for these orders, would so arrange them as to fit in with the general national electricity scheme in a few years' time.  The general rule has been that expenditure on generating <Col N="2106" /> plants from this year forward cannot be taken into account in any future policy dealing with the amalgamation of small undertakings.  Possibly due to that fact there was only one new electricity order made during the past year, the one issued in respect of Blackrock.  It was an enabling order to authorise the local council to transfer its rights and obligations as authorised suppliers of electricity.  I have referred to certain delays with regard to new orders.  Of course, in many minor matters the powers of the Ministry have been exercised in connection with the Electricity Supply Acts.  Applications have been received for sanction to raise loans for the purpose of extending some of the existing undertakings and for the extension of distributing mains beyond the area of supply originally contemplated, or originally authorised.</P>
    <P>The administration of the Gas Acts was carried out in a great many matters of ordinary routine.  There were no special developments, however, in connection with the gas industry during the past year, and no new special gas orders were applied for.</P>
    <P>The operation of the Weights and Measures Acts has made certain substantial progress.  The arrears which had accumulated owing to the suspension, for almost four years, of the work of the weights and measures inspectors outside the Dublin area have now been cleared up in most of the areas in the Free State, and the application of statutory regulations has been tightened up considerably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that in respect of administration by the Guards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána found it necessary to increase the number of ex-officio inspectors to carry out inspections under the Weights and Measures Act on behalf of the local authorities.  An examination was held about February for a number of Gárda Sergeants who had undergone training in the special duties required.  The special subjects required for this examination were made more comprehensive, and the practical tests were definitely much more difficult than they had been previously at any other examination <Col N="2107" /> held under the Weights and Measures Act in this country.  Nevertheless, out of a total of 32 who sat for this examination, 22 were passed as fully qualified.  The ordinary work of the section is well enough known in this connection.  Any patents for weighing and measuring instruments have to be certified either for general or special use after examination to see if they comply with certain conditions. In the past 12 months somewhere over 30 new types of such instruments were submitted for examination.  A few of these, not more than two, were rejected. A certain number are still undergoing tests.</P>
      <P>One special point which arose for consideration was the matter of petrol pumps that are becoming such common objects nowadays.  Special tests were imposed on these within a radius of about 50 miles of Dublin, but it appears to be necessary to have legislation to allow for the special supervision that will be necessary with regard to this particular type of measuring instrument.  Certain examinations were also held as to standard gas holders and standard gas meters, and an examination of the milk weighing machines used in creameries, to see if any more uniform use could not be obtained of some approved design of a strict type of machine.  There was also work thrown on this particular branch by the Standardisation Order with regard to bottles issued by the Minister for Justice under the Intoxicating Liquor Act of 1924.  The new regulations were made in February and the operation of the Weights and Measures Act and the application of this Order is now proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industry branch has a variety of activities in contemplation, which again I can set out under certain rather well defined headings.  The principal work to be done by this Department is work in connection with the Trade Loans Guarantee Act.  A tremendous number of applications were received in connection with the Trade Loans Act.  Some of them were quite clearly outside the scope of the Act.  Certain others were withdrawn by the applicants themselves.  Ninety-four were finally considered by the Advisory Committee <Col N="2108" /> set up under the Act, of which 28 were recommended and 52 rejected, 3 still being under consideration by the Advisory Committee.  That would cover applications from the beginning of the period until the end of last month, but it has to be noted that the Advisory Committee was not established for some time after the date of the coming into operation of the Act and no guarantee was in fact given until after 1st April, 1925.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say if figures are available stating the amount of the guarantees in the case of the 28 passed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount, say, where the guarantee is actually given?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been six cases in which guarantees have been actually given, and the amounts are: £28,500; £11,100; £8,000; £50,000; £3,500; and £6,000.  These are where the guarantees have been actually given.  They are in various stages of completion on account of the operations of the Act.</P>
      <P>There are then ten cases which have passed the Advisory Committee and the two Departments concerned, where certain legal formalities are still due and the amounts there would be about £110,000 all told.  There are six others which have passed certain of the hurdles prior to legal formalities being entered on, and which cannot yet be said to be sanctioned under the Act. There are six of these cases, and the amount of money they would represent would be very big.  It would come to almost £400,000.  There were certain others which were recommended, but where the application was withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the earliest operations of this branch was to establish Advisory Committees, in various group industries in the country, so as to have these meet for the purpose of getting in touch with the various industries so that information might be given by them to the Department and received by them from the Department.  There are about thirty-seven of these committees, and there can be said to have been about fifty general meetings of these during the year.  There was a lot of minor <Col N="2109" /> meetings.  You might have a group of firms, and a group of allied industries associated in factories; individual firms and various subdivisions of that group might come to the Department for certain information or to give certain information.  There were about fifty meetings held during the year, outside these smaller meetings.  During 1925-26 what might be described as Conciliation Conferences to the number of forty-nine were held, and settlements were reached in twenty-five cases.  In a number of other cases settlements were eventually arrived at, following proposals made at the conferences, but the settlement was not reached at the conferences except in twenty-five cases.</P>
    <P>With regard to work under the Factories and Workshops Act, as between factories, workshops, certain premises, warehouses, and certain other institutions which fell to be visited under Sections 5 and 6 of the Act, there were almost 9,000 of the type which necessitated visits under the Act, and almost 6,000 of these were visited in the year. Roughly there was a 70 per cent. visitation, taking it on the number of visits for the number of establishments that might call for these inspections. That is in the calendar year 1925, which was the basis on which the statistics were compiled.  That shows a very definite advance on what had been done previously.  About one-third of the establishments had been visited in 1923, and about one-half in 1924, so that this shows a very considerable advance on the two earlier years.  In addition to that inspections had to be made under the Trade Boards Act.  In the calendar year there were over 2,600 of these inspections.  The work of administering the Shops Act and the Workmen's Compensation Acts also falls to this branch, and in the case of Workmen's Compensation there has been proceeding a Departmental inquiry during the greater part of the financial year.  A considerable amount of evidence has been heard and a very big number of meetings held.  The Committee is at present completing its report.  A forecast of that report was recently published, but it is as likely to be as inaccurate as most of those forecasts are.</P>
    <P>The inspection of mines and quarries <Col N="2110" /> is carried on through an inspector appointed under the Mines and Quarries Act and under the supervision of a geologist who is also responsible for investigating and advising on the many projects from time to time brought before the Department in regard to the development of mineral resources.  This branch is also responsible for the work that arises at the International Labour Conference under the auspices of the League of Nations.  It supplied a certain number of delegates that represented the Free State at meetings in Geneva during the last three years.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to deal with the employment branch in any detail at this moment.  I have set aside certain figures showing the estimated amount of expenditure that has to be apportioned in regard to the question of employment. The headquarters office and the out-stations offices form part of that division in the Estimate, and if there is any point arising in regard to them later it can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The statistics branch is one in regard to which questions generally arise and I have got certain detailed information as to the subjects upon which statistics have been complied.  It must be remembered that the work of this branch was taken over from the Department of Agriculture which previously dealt with a very limited amount of matter. It is quite clear from the Estimates that the numbers connected with the statistics branch have grown and, consequently, the expenditure has increased.</P>
    <P>A point was raised here in regard to what public advantage was being reaped from the extra officials serving in this branch, and the extra expenditure of money involved.  I had to ask for a certain amount of patience, point ing out that the whole question of the proper establishment of this branch was under consideration and, until the Statistics Bill was introduced and passed, it was not possible to forecast with any degree of accuracy what the work of the branch in future was likely to be, as observed by the information issued to the public.  The Statistics Bill has since become an Act, and the branch more or less knows where it stands.</P>
    <P>This year there has been a further upset because of the fact that the census of population had to be taken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2111" /> Preparations had been made to take a census of production also.  That census of production was not taken this year, but it will be taken as soon as possible. The census of population occupied to a very big extent the attention of the statistics branch, and this has prevented the publication of additional matter; but there has been publication of some additional matter through the &ldquo;Trade Journal,&rdquo; and that will increase from month to month, and in the end there will be given to the public, in as much detail as possible, all the information the public seems to display an interest in, or the information that some Deputies appear to be interested in as having a bearing upon legislation or projected legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It should have been taken this year, but it was ruled out by the census of population.  Most likely it will be taken next year.  If Deputies desire, I can give here an indication of the subjects upon which statistics have been compiled.  Most Deputies are familiar with the import and export returns.  All those statistics are given in the returns that are properly prepared and placed in the hands of Deputies.  There are inquiries made into the number and description of live stock exported to Britain and the Isle of Man.  Weekly, monthly, and annual statements in regard to these exports are printed and published.  Then there is a condensed return published each month from particulars furnished for the official import and export list, excluding parcels post.  There is a detailed quarterly report of all exports and imports, including parcels post, printed and published, and at the end of the year-during the last quarter-there is published a review of the year's trade.  There was a change made&mdash; Deputies know about it and I am aware they have complained&mdash;in the way in which these monthly returns have been published.  It was suggested to me that we should return to the printed instead of the stencilled publication; but again the question of expense came in.  It was recognised that the <Col N="2112" /> stencilled returns were not the clearest, and an attempt was made to improve the form and have the stencilled matter made more clear.  It was not, however, considered advisable to go back to the printed form.</P>
      <P>With regard to shipping, the quarterly trade report contains statistics as to the number and tonnage of vessels entering and clearing Free State ports. These are received monthly, and the quarterly details of the monthly totals are published.  There are, in addition, compiled monthly returns of the number of passengers arriving at and departing from Free State ports, including the number of persons arriving at or departing from Free State ports from or to any ports outside Europe. An attempt is made to distinguish migrants from ordinary travellers. These are published in the &ldquo;Trade Journal&rdquo; and copies are furnished to the Board of Trade and to the League of Nations.</P>
      <P>In the matter of agriculture, there are collected statistics in regard to the numbers of live-stock and the produce of crops.  These are collected by Gárda Síochána enumerators.  Printed statements are published in regard to the quantity of crops, and comparisons are made with the corresponding period of the previous year.  There are also printed statements relating to the total yield of crops.  There are stencilled returns as to the number of pigs secured by bacon-curers, and particulars touching on live-stock exports are issued to the Press.  There is a weekly stencilled report made in regard to the Dublin cattle and sheep market, and there are monthly stencilled reports containing details of fairs and markets in the country.  There is a quarterly return of fairs and markets published in the Journal of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will have noticed, that in answer to questions put in the Dáil, statements have been issued covering agricultural produce statistics for the whole of Ireland for each year from 1881 to 1925, and for the Free State from 1911 to 1925.  As regards prices, there are prepared daily stencilled reports of prices and supplies.  While I am on the matter of prices I may <Col N="2113" /> mention that a report is published containing the retail prices existing, and also containing statistics&mdash;index figures&mdash;touching on the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Railway statistics take the form of operations compiled and issued monthly in the form of stencilled reports to the railway companies and individual members of the public, and other statistics are compiled for inclusion in the annual printed returns of the railway companies.  There are compilations made weekly and fortnightly and monthly from the Labour Exchange offices with regard to labour and these are issued officially for administrative purposes.  Last year there was prepared by the branch a very big amount of statistical matter, extracted from the Census of 1911, in regard to Irish-speaking people and non-Irish speaking people, for the use of the Gaelteacht Commission.  This branch acted as agents for the Commission; it provided forms and instructions and circulars for the Civic Guards, who returned the number of persons in any area speaking Irish. Afterwards the branch compiled certain returns from these statistics for the Gaelteacht Commission itself.</P>
    <P>The census of population was undertaken on the 18th April last.  That involved a tremendous amount of preparatory work, in devising the forms, and in preparation as to how the questions should be put, and as to what was the most suitable manner as to getting the information required.  In addition to that, instructions had to be prepared and issued to all those appointed as enumerators in the various districts and a certain amount of publicity and guidance was given, or undertaken, by the preparation of posters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard many arguments about that, and I am having that matter officially gone into. <Col N="2114" /> I was told that the last return was collected on Thursday of last week; I understood that was the latest.  I did not know that there were any forms not yet collected.  There are two points there.  If it were simply a matter of sending round enumerators and telling them to take up forms, that could be done very speedily.  But if you give them strict instructions to see, to the best of their ability, that the papers are filled in properly, and that the forms are, as far as can be seen upon the surface, fairly accurate returns and that the questions have been properly attended to-that is work in which it will take a much longer time to collect the papers.  In this matter it is far better to give instructions, in details, rather than to have the collectors going round, and simply collecting up the forms.  If you have a lot of scamped census returns, that would entail a very considerable amount of labour afterwards, if enumerators that have gone round have to be sent back again to the houses to see if the missing information could not be supplied later.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooper raised the matter, once, as to the time that was spent in the collection of those forms.  On the whole, I think it is better to have the forms dealt with by the enumerators in a detailed way, and have some care taken in the collection of them, rather than to have further to approach householders.  When I said a month, or when I made the statement that in about a month the first collected information with regard to the census might be ready, I said a month, under the impression that all the forms had been collected.  If the collection is not yet completed, then the month may not run from to-day.  I spoke under the impression that the forms had been collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a considerable amount of preparatory work already done in connection with the proposed census of industrial production for the year 1926.  Preparatory work was also undertaken in connection with the census of agricultural production for the twelve months, April, 1926, to May, 1927.  Preparatory matter would include the getting together of lists of producers from whom returns will be required, and the nature of the inquiry to <Col N="2115" /> be first made in agricultural production is under consideration.  Modifications have been included in the forms to be used in the collection of agricultural statistics of the present year.  There are certain other minor particulars which will have to be collated afterwards as to the general census of industrial and agricultural production, and these are being obtained throughout the year.</P>
    <P>There are a certain number of miscellaneous statistics that have been collected in connection with the Workmen's Compensation and certain Banking statistics.  From time to time individual firms and individuals make application for returns of particulars of certain articles imported, and these are compiled and furnished to the firms or the individuals.  Returns have to be furnished every month, in accordance with commitments, to the League of Nations, the International Labour Office, the International Institute of Agriculture, and the International Institute of Statistics.  Further to that there have been a great many contributions from this branch to the &ldquo;Irish Trade Journal.&rdquo;  The Finance and Establishment Branch I think explains itself.  It may seem a big item, but it is to be noted that Part 2 is included in Finance and Establishment Branch. That is to say, under this particular head are collected the estimated payments to all the typists, messengers, cleaners, etc.  They are all collected under the head of Finance and Establishment Branch.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with a certain number of sub-heads, from B to the Appropriations-in-Aid, in connection with the apportionment I made as to the expenditure on Unemployment Insurance and other matters.  But there are those that I did not speak of.  There is a small Vote under E as to a certifying Surgeon, and the amount is not big that is paid under this head.  That remark would apply also to F&mdash;Expenses of Medical Referees&mdash;although the cost is considerably bigger than what falls under E. Item I &ldquo;Special Services Inquiries,&rdquo; has gone up this year, as compared with last year. Certain items of the total remain as <Col N="2116" /> before.  Item 1 is the only one which remains at the exact figure as before. No. 2 &ldquo;Subscriptions and Delegations to Conference Parliamentaire Inter-nationale du Commerce,&rdquo; is less.  This Parliamentary Conference is being held in London this year whereas it was held on the Continent last year.  Item 3, &ldquo;Subscription and Delegation to the International Railway Congress Association,&rdquo; shows a decrease because this year we only allowed for subscriptions and no delegation is being sent. Item 4, &ldquo;Subscription and Delegation to International Union for Protection of Industrial Property and Delegation to the International Conference of Labour Statisticians,&rdquo; is new, and is rendered necessary because it is pretty well incumbent upon us to become subscribers to the International Union for the Protection of Industrial Property. There was a delegation sent in October to one meeting of the International Union for the Protection of Industrial Property, from which a very big amount of information was got, the result of which will be seen when the Industrial Property Protection Bill comes back from the Joint Committee.</P>
    <P>J is an item in respect of which one would like to see expenditure instead of estimated expenditure, because if anyone could win this £1,500 prize the results would be immeasurable in comparison with the amount of the prize.  Item K 1, Grant-in-Aid of the expenses of the International Labour Organisation, shows an advance this year, and that advance is automatic. I do not mean that it will go on increasing by this amount from year to year, but whatever be the increase it is more or less outside our control.  It rests upon the basis on which contributions in regard to the whole League of Nations are fixed.  That is built up in a way which I would not like to have to describe; it is a matter of great complexity, and if there is anyone sufficiently interested who wants to know how the sum is built up I can supply to him a publication which gives the calculations.  K 2 remains as before, because it is considered, especially this year, when the International Labour Conference is dealing with matters affecting shipping, and with the shipping <Col N="2117" /> legislation in prospect for the Autumn, that it is more than ever necessary that a delegation should be sent to Geneva at this time.</P>
    <P>In connection with J K, a new International Labour Office has been built at Geneva, and most of the nations which are members of the International Labour Organisation have subscribed in the way of gifts towards the furnishing and equipment of the office. This matter was raised when our delegates were at Geneva last year.  It was taken up after their return home, and since then correspondence has been going on with a view to discovering what would be the most appropriate gift to the new office from this State. The amount set down is not very large, and it very definitely limits the choice of a gift.  But even with the limited choice, it has not yet been found possible to decide on the exact nature of that gift; the only thing we are sure about is that it cannot go beyond £300. At the same time, there has had to be a delay in determining the exact nature of the gift, because it was represented to us that until some of the other gifts were known, no proper decision could be taken with regard to the expenditure of this £300.  If this Vote passes, the statement is likely to be made at Geneva this year that there is in prospect a gift, the nature of which has still to be ascertained, of £300 worth towards this office.</P>
    <P>The other matters do not call for much in the way of comment.  Under Item N, there is a decrease of £100 this year.  That, again, is founded on the experience of the working of last year.  Under Item M, there is also a decrease of £250, but it is considered that the £350 will meet any expenditure likely to be incurred under that head.  There is on the other side, corresponding to N, a decrease in the Appropriation-in-Aid under sub-head (a).  The two are somewhat complementary. Appropriation-in-Aid (e), &ldquo;Fees payable under Section 5 of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, 1924,&rdquo; has been put down at £100.  To a certain extent that is due to the fact that we were in doubt as to whether there would be any extension of the Trade</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2118" /> Loans (Guarantee) Act for another year.  It has now been considered desirable that that should be carried on, and a Bill will probably be introduced for the purpose of extending it for another year.  If that be done, that Appropriation-in-Aid may rise to something more than £100.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister explained that under the various heads that were concerned with unemployment and other insurance there was a large share of the expenditure that is covered by this Vote accounted for.  I think it is a pity that the accounts should be confused in that way, because I rather maintain that Unemployment and Health Insurance, although they are under the Minister, should be separate organisations, and that they are not, perhaps, very rightly described as Industry and Commerce, although one can hardly altogether detach them from the Ministry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, with Unemployment Insurance then.  Unemployment Insurance of course is a section which comes under the Minister, but as far as employers and the conduct of industry are concerned, the provision of</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2119" /> Unemployment Insurance is a charge, and a charge which I think ought to be taken into consideration as a separate organisation altogether.  The remarks that I wish to make are directed largely to the Vote as a whole. I think the Minister said that the amount for all purposes, exclusive of what might be called the Unemployment figures, is comparatively small. We find a great many things in the Vote that take away from the usefulness of the Ministry in promoting trade and commerce.  The amount that is spent in that direction is a comparatively small proportion of the total amount of the Vote.  What I would like to say generally is, that we have to recognise that the purely commercial side of the Minister's work is very, very small within our borders.</P>
    <P>It includes, as far as the statistical branch is concerned, apparently, the collection of statistics in connection with farming.  I would like to say that we ought to recognise, and I would like the Minister to recognise, and get the Dáil to recognise, that this House occupies a very large amount of its time and attention in connection with culture to the detriment entirely of its industrial possibilities.  I want at this stage to ask the Dáil not to accept altogether the outlook which is put before us on every possible occasion, that the future of the Saorstát holds nothing for trade or commerce or industry except what arises out of agriculture.  I think the Dáil might take a broader view of the possibilities, and I would like to see the Minister stand up for his own Department in connection with what I might call that end of the stick&mdash;the possibilities of the future of the Saorstát industrially.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>J.J. will look after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>He might look after it in a wrong direction.  The possibilities of the development of industries in the Free State are not negligible.  So far from their being negligible I maintain that they are practically unlimited; and that through the operation of our <Col N="2120" /> ports, and the introduction of raw material, there are very few directions in which the Free State might not expect and hope to advance very materially its prosperity through the channels of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I therefore deprecate the comparatively small and insignificant operations that are carried on under the office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and largely, in my judgment, including a number of things that are not properly within the purview of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister said very little about anything in connection with industry, I would like him to have said more in that direction, even if he had found it necessary to touch on the Shannon Scheme.  To-day under the Minister, there is no doubt about it, commerce generally and industry in particular are languishing in the Saorstát to an extent that is almost unprecedented.  So far from the urge of nationality focussing our people's minds on industry in the broad sense of the term, it seems to me to-day that there is less confidence in commercial operations than ever before. Practically most of our older industries are languishing, and if one might look at the general policy of the Government in a casual sort of way, I think they have given less consideration to the maintenance and development of industries that are there, than they have given to the setting up of what one might call new industries on a bolstered basis.  I would like to see the Minister urging that his Department is more important than is shown by these accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the various items in this Vote are complicated, and there will be considerable difficulty in analysing them. I know also that the urge and the general anxiety outside is to cut down expenses.  The necessity for economy is very considerable.  I have myself advocated the need for economy in every direction.  But in this particular case, while it is very hard, for instance, to tackle questions of unemployment, and to say that unemployment grants are not necessary, or that the Department as a whole could be cut down <Col N="2121" /> very considerably, I do press that this particular Department should in the future get more consideration from the Dáil than it has got in the past.  I say that even with the Farmers' representatives present to uphold their particular industry, the development of other industries is more important and worthy of more consideration than it has got from the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Shipping comes under this Vote The Minister, I think, is sending a delegation to the International Labour Conference at Geneva this year, and after that Conference I hope he will be in a position to say to the Dáil that there is some hope for the development of shipping within the Free State.  On some other occasion I hope that we will hear of some possible developments in other directions.  In future I would suggest that the Minister should separate in the accounts items referring to the operations of the industrial and commercial side of his Department from such questions as unemployment, statistics, etc.</P>

What is the view of the Department with regard to what has been done in this direction? Is the work that has already been done accepted as a standard? What are the possibilities for further inquiry, and what has been the attitude of the Department to suggestions made as to the possibility of developing industries, at least to an extent not done at present, if we had a more correct and a more extensive geological survey than we have now?  We have <Col N="2122" /> one economic geologist and one inspector of mines and quarries.  I do not exactly know what is the work of the Inspector of Mines&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise one or two questions, and I think the time to do so is on the Minister's salary, because they are more matters of policy than of detailed administration. In his lengthy statement, the Minister gave a detailed review of the industrial work of his Department during the past year, rather than, as I expected, something in the nature of a statement of policy, or an indication of how the industrial outlook had improved since we discussed a similar estimate twelve months ago.  The first question I want to raise concerns the attitude of the Ministry in refusing to sanction the payment of unemployment insurance benefit to workers who are thrown out of employment because of the fact that they have holdings of two or three acres with a few pounds valuation. The subject has been raised from this side of the Dáil on more than one occasion by way of Questions.  I have a few cases in mind at present that I think the Minister is dealing with, but I have not yet had an answer. In my constituency a quarry which employed 120 men was closed down on 20th March last, and a number of the men who were compulsorily thrown out of work happened to have two, three, four or even eight acres of land. Their claims were submitted in the ordinary way for unemployment insurance benefit on the ground that the cards were stamped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some cases the Minister has refused to sanction payment of the unemployment insurance benefit.  The law that exists now insists on employers in this and other cases stamping <Col N="2123" /> the cards.  By his attitude in these cases-which from the number of Questions that I hear answered are not exceptional-the Minister declines to give the individual the benefit of the unemployment insurance, although the number of stamps is on the cards.  I consider that is not a correct attitude for the Department to adopt.  The Minister, I think, might reconsider the policy he has been pursuing in regard to such cases, and pay the unemployment insurance benefit to those who have small holdings, in the same way as it is paid to other workers who are thrown out of employment.  I have an idea that the Minister may put up as a defence that the individuals suit their own convenience, and remain out of work at certain periods of the year, in order to till the small plots of land they have.  From that point of view there may be some justification for the Minister's attitude, but where people are thrown out of employment through no fault of their own I think they should be treated like others, and paid the unemployment benefit that, in my opinion, they are legally entitled to.</P>
    <P>In passing, the Minister referred to some inquiry held by the Transport and Marine Department into the financial position of the Great Southern Railways and the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Co., and indicated that in the case of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Co., it might be necessary in the near future to ask for a Supplementary Estimate, for some reason that he did not state.  Perhaps the Minister would go into a little more detail about the inquiry held by the officers of the Transport and Marine Department into the working of the Great Southern Railways Company and the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Co., and tell the Dáil if the position of the Great Southern Railways Company has improved as a result of the passing of the Railways Amalgamation Act of 1924.  The Minister might also state the reasons why he thinks it may be necessary to ask for a Supplementary Estimate for the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company, and when that</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2124" /> Supplementary Estimate is likely to be brought forward.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hewat spoke of the operations of the Department and the way in which it is endeavouring to bolster up industries.  I presume what the Deputy refers and objects to is the operation of the Trade Loans Guarantee Act.  Personally I welcome the statement made by the Minister, that it has been decided to extend the operations of that Act for another year.  I believe that anything that can be done to build up industries or to keep alive some of the industries that are now in a bad way, can be best done through the operations of an Act of that kind. While supporting the operations of the Department, I agree that the tariff policy can give equal help in that direction.  I think it is a sound policy for the Department to pursue to continue the operations of the Act, and to give more help to people who may be disposed to invest their money and give the benefit of their brains to the promotion of industries.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the examination of harbours and docks.  I did not follow what the Minister meant when he said that such examination had been carried out by the Transport and Marine Department.  I am anxious to know what was the nature of the examination, in view of the fact that the Minister has recently announced the appointment of a Harbours and Docks Commission, to inquire into the standardisation of harbour law.  The Minister also referred to the question of inland navigation.  Perhaps he would indicate to the Dail if there has been any change in the attitude of the Ministry in that matter.  I would like to know what was the nature of the investigation, and what effect it had on the policy of the Ministry, as against the negative policy pursued up to the present.</P>

      <P>He puts all his goods in the window, and I hope he will continue to do so, because, in Industry and Commerce, it is very desirable that all the goods should be put in the window.  I will not blame the Minister for that, and I will not accuse him of failing to institute, shall I call it a &ldquo;geological survey,&rdquo; or a post mortem of the present state of Irish industry and commerce.  Personally, I think that Irish industry and commerce is a plant which may thrive, but it will not thrive if, periodically, we dig it up and examine the condition of its roots.  I think the Minister is justified in his failure to go into a general survey of the present position of Irish industry.  I do not know that as a consultant he would add anything to the advice of general practitioners like Deputy Hewat, and the mere fact of his being called in might cause people to believe that the patient was in extremis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with one point, and that is in connection with the Statistics Branch.  So far as the Statistics Branch is concerned, there is a reduction in cost, and that reduction in cost must be welcomed.  I am not going, like Deputy Hewat, to upbraid the Minister for the fact that he is not spending enough money.  I will always congratulate any Minister who is spending less money than heretofore and doing his work effectually.  The reduction in the cost of the Statistics Branch is the more notable because, during the current year, we have taken a census, and the tabulation and publication of the results of that census will fall on the Statistics Branch.  The fact that the Minister has been able to do that, without additional expenditure, is a fact on which he can be congratulated.  He has told us that he hopes to get the preliminary results of the census published within a month.  I must say I wish it could have been done earlier.  I am very sorry Northern Ireland has got ahead of us in this respect.  It would be very interesting to be able to see by comparative figures whether the drift to the towns, that appears in the preliminary census of Northern Ireland, is paralleled here, and whether <Col N="2126" /> the shrinkage of the rural population, that appears in the census of Northern Ireland, also appears here.</P>
    <P>The Minister has justified the delay in publishing the census returns by the additional care given by the enumerators in calling for every paper and examining every paper.  I should like, if I may, to give the Minister my experience of that care on the part of the enumerators.  It happened that the Committee of Public Accounts was not sitting, and that I was, consequently, at home when a very earnest young member of the Gárdaí called to take up my census paper.  He got to work on it before I discovered he was there.  On the night the census was taken I happened to have a Russian Baron staying with me as my guest.  I will disarm the hostility of the Labour Party by saying that I do not, habitually, entertain Russian Barons.  He was staying with me because his wife was a friend of my wife.  His one desire in life was to have an interview with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and I arranged that interview the following day.  My guest was a married man with children.  I filled in a good part of the form beforehand, and as I knew he was coming I entered him at the bottom of the entry relating to my own family, and immediately above the servants. My cook, who appeared at the head of the servants, is also a married woman.  I do not quite know, and I do not know if she knows, where her husband is.  The Gárda who called, seeing the two people next each other on the form, and noticing that both were entered as married, insisted that they were married to each other, and entered the Russian nobleman's children as my cook's step-children.  That was the additional accuracy obtained by the enumerator going into every case. I came on the scene before it was too late.  I checked the Gárda, and I was firm with him, and the result is that my census form is accurate.</P>
    <P>If they have gone on the same lines elsewhere with weak women and people who were puzzled by the whole return I am not at all sure that the additional accuracy that has been obtained by the enumerators going into every form in detail has at all compensated <Col N="2127" /> for the delay in issuing the complete results.  I hope it has not been thought that I have been blaming the enumerators.  This young Gárda was most anxious to do his duty, but I do not know that he had had quite sufficient instruction as to how the duty of enumeration should be performed.  It is a little different carrying out this duty with a young force, and with men of three or four years' service, from carrying it out with the R.I.C.  In England the police force never carried it out at all.  They had special people trained for it.  An R.I.C. Sergeant of 15 or 20 years' service would have previous experience, and he could carry out the work better than a young Gárda could.  I think the Minister would have done better, on the whole, to take the form in the raw condition as filled up by the householder, deferring for inquiry only forms in which the householder was illiterate, or in which there were serious defects, rather than having a detailed examination of the form in every house.</P>
    <P>I leave that point and come to the general position of statistics.  We are voting about £30,000 for the collection of statistics.  I do not grudge the money.  Good government requires accurate information, and I do not grudge spending £30,000 on getting accurate statistics.  But I do think these statistics ought to be made more readily available to the public than they are at present.  There ought to be better machinery for circulating them to the public and to the Press than exists at the present time.  Outside the Saorstát there is an impression among newspaper men that we are living in a state of chaos, and that the proceedings of this Dáil closely resemble the more violent excesses of the French Revolution as pictured in the most sensational films.</P>

      <P>I think, as an antidote to the prevalent impression that we are living in a state of chaos, we should publish some year-book representing the activities of the State. Every other Dominion does so.  Even Northern Ireland, which is not a Dominion, but a subordinate parliament, publishes a year-book, and if we could codify our statistics and get them into readable form, it would be of great value.  The Minister may say there is the &ldquo;Irish Trade Journal.&rdquo;  It is an interesting publication, but has a lot of superfluous matter.  It contains many illustrations of the working of the Shannon Scheme, interesting to the general reader, but you do not want to file those illustrations for a year or two years.  You have statistics published on one side of the page in the &ldquo;Irish Trade Journal&rdquo; and statistics on the other side.  If you cut them out you have to sacrifice one set of the statistics.  If you have them codified in a journal you do not need to cut them out at all.  If you want to make a comparison for a number of years a proper journal would give you statistics for 1924, 1925 and so on.  I have, on my shelves, choc-à-bloc with different figures, export figures, railway statistics, and so on.  If you get them all complied into one book it would be a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not lay as much stress on that as I do on the Press outside.  I worked for a while on a newspaper in England. The average journalist knows very little but he knows how to find out everything.  Every big newspaper keeps a reference library with a librarian, and the journalist who wants to know the exports of Saorstát Eireann for 1924-25, will go to that library and <Col N="2129" /> the librarian will help him to get it in ten minutes.  Those libraries are limited in size and scope.  They will not take our statistics as we issue them but they will take our Year Book. They have already the Australian and the Canadian Year Book, and they would buy a further Year Book.  I do not think this Year Book will be any cost to the State.  We have statistics already, The cost of printing and publishing is not enormous, and it would be bought by people interested, by newspaper men, by professional writers, publicists, and people of that kind, in order to have the latest, most accurate and authoritative figures.  I agree it requires some arrangement. There are people in this world who have a morbid appetite for statistics like the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and myself.  We have not an appetite for the same statistics.  We discriminate in our diet.  The average man requires to be led to the river to make him drink.  A Year Book, presented with a certain amount of comment and illuminated illustration, is a means for inducing further knowledge. The people who will dig into a varied number of publications in order to get certain statistics are very few, and they all want to prove a case.  I think a collective epitome of the statistics of the Free State would fill a want, give information where information is needed, and would clear up a great many misunderstandings.</P>
    <P>I went two years ago to an inter-parliamentary conference in Switzerland. The best propaganda I took with me was a copy of the Official Report containing the Budget Speech of the Minister for Finance in 1924, not that I agree with that speech, but the mere facts and figures in that speech persuaded people that we were facing facts on business lines.  That is the greatest need of the present day, so far as the State is concerned, to show that we are not chasing rainbows, pursuing will-o'-the-wisp ideas that land us in bogs, but that we are facing facts on business-like lines, that we know what our imports and exports are, that we are dealing with realities and not with illusions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>On this question of the Statistics Branch I want to say <Col N="2130" /> there is very good work being done at present.  I have recently come across a paper produced by that office on agricultural prices in 1840, and I must confess it was a revelation not alone to agriculturists, but to non-agriculturists, and I wish it were put into the hands of every member of the community. With regard to the statement of the Minister, that we are to have a census of production, we welcome that very heartily.  Side by side with the census of population, the census of production is not one whit less important to the State.  We will have from the census of population an indication of the producers and from the census of production we will have an idea of quantity, of what really the effects of our labours are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose we are to assume that the census of production will be taken in the same manner as that of the census of population. The Minister has not indicated that.  On that point I would like to say, if that work is to be done effectively, it is, in my opinion, going to present a much more difficult task than the work of taking the census of population.  If we are to judge by the collection of tillage figures, the experience in years past has been that the enumerator took the returns for a townland, and these were the figures supplied to the Department, on which was based the return of the operations of our farmers. I tried to satisfy myself from the collection of tillage returns last year that the work was done more effectively than usual.  I was particularly interested in seeing that in one district a correct return of live stock would be made, and I was surprised to learn from many farmers that sufficient efforts were not made by the enumerator to ensure that he had a correct return. I would urge on the Minister that stress should be laid on the importance of getting accurate returns of production, as the methods of the past will not suffice now.  As regards the collection of tillage statistics, I think that there are undoubtedly cases where sufficient trouble has not been taken by the enumerator to interview all the people interested and to do his work to the entire satisfaction of those who <Col N="2131" /> demand that these returns shall be supplied. A census of production is undoubtedly overdue, and, until we have it, we will feel that the taxpayer will not know correctly where he stands. We are glad to hear from the Minister that this work is going to be undertaken at the earliest possible moment. I am satisfied from inquiries made that, if effective steps are not taken to see that the census of production is carefully compiled, it will not give us what is required, but will, in fact, give us a false basis on which to start.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the suggestion put forward by Deputy Cooper with regard to the compilation of a year-book.  I also have found in my endeavours to obtain figures which are required, and not having a secretary to keep a file of my papers, that it is very difficult to get exact statistics when required.  I think it would be an excellent idea if all the statistics compiled by the Department of Industry and Commerce were got together in a book which would be available in handy form.  I congratulate the Ministry on the efforts which are being made to produce statistics of a suitable kind, and I believe that the work which is being done by the Statistical Department is, so far as it goes, excellent.  With regard to the statistics dealing with farm products, I agree with Deputy Baxter that greater care is necessary in obtaining information, because, judging by some of my experiences, I am inclined to think that the information obtained, except in so far as it is a general average and that one error may counterbalance another, is not often quite accurate.  One of the reasons for that is, in my opinion, the fact that the Gárda in each district is expected to collect information with regard to farm produce, live stock and so forth only for his own district.  That I know was the arrangement some years ago, and I think it still prevails. Some years ago when at home I was questioned by an old R.I.C. man as to the amount of live stock, crops, poultry and so forth, on the farm, and I gave him all the information necessary. Later on, however, I found that he was only collecting information for that <Col N="2132" /> portion of the farm which came within his own district.  Probably another man interviewed the herd on the other portion of the farm and got a duplication of the facts which I had previously given.</P>
      <P>If that is still the system, I think it is a matter which should be carefully looked into, because the enumerators used to get information casually from anyone they met, not necessarily from the farmer, but, perhaps, from his wife or children, so that those statistics could not be regarded as reliable.  I think that we should aim at having our agricultural statistics as accurate as they possibly can be.  I do not know if the Minister could give information regarding the system of getting the prevailing prices at fairs.  Who gets the information?  Is it the Gárda?  I find it extremely difficult to get accurate figures in that connection.  I often doubt the figures which I see in the newspapers.  I see different prices for cattle in different parts of the country. I know that these figures are not compiled by the Ministry, but by newspaper men.  I often notice big differences, even in the price per hundred weight, in similar type of cattle.  If figures are not approximately accurate they are not worth having.  I would also like to know whether the book which is published annually, giving the figures with regard to our imports and exports, has yet been issued for the year 1925.  At any rate, I have not yet got a copy.  It is a very useful and instructive book, and I think it is time that it was in the hands of Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Baxter spoke about the view of my Department as to the Geological Survey, how far it was adequate, and how far there was going to be further inquiry made. The Deputy should understand that no part of the cost of the Geological Survey comes within the Vote of my Department. It falls under the Vote of the Ministry of Education.  Personally, I have had representations made to me regarding the inadequacy of the old survey, and there is a belief that it was far from accurate in its final stage. The story goes that in the end it was so rushed that it was done by people going round in dog-carts and using <Col N="2133" /> telescopes, and that they had to write down what they saw from that superficial examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to that I cannot say.  I do know this, however, that apart from the question whether the geological survey in the past was adequate or not, there has been such a change in the technical method of dealing with, say, mineral resources brought about during the course of the war, that the information available with regard to the deposits of minerals might be regarded as useless for present-day purposes. May I put it in this way: that in the old days, whatever was the technical way of dealing with minerals, it was not considered, unless the minerals were easily accessible, and in certain quantities, an economic proposition to have them worked; but with the new aids of science revealed in the last five or six years, things that would have been looked upon as uneconomic some years ago, might easily be regarded as economic and might be worked now. That has been impressed upon me more than once by several groups that have, in the last couple of years, been prospecting in this country for their own purposes.  Certainly, the reports I have got from some of these people, reports made to me in confidence, would seem to show that there is a great deal to be done in regard to a new geological survey.  I have had certain discussions on this with other Ministers.  I cannot say that there has been any decision taken on this, because I have not had any discussions with the Minister for Education on the matter; but there is a feeling, at any rate, that some forward move should be got on foot with regard to a new survey in the direction of filling in the gaps of the old survey.  It seems to be the common idea that this should not be something in the nature of an ad hoc Commission appointed to do a certain amount of work and then cease its labours, but rather that there should be located somewhere, say, in some Department, the work that used to be done by the College of Science and that has recently been taken over by University College, Dublin: that there should be some people whose duty it would be to keep in touch with <Col N="2134" /> the new developments and methods of dealing with mineral resources and try to readjust all the information, and all the methods of working minerals founded on the old geological survey and have all this brought up to date in accordance with the new information as it comes to hand.  That, however, is not for me, except that I can put certain suggestions that have been made to me with regard to it before the Minister for Education and see what could be done in the matter.  The Deputy also asked as to suggestions that have been made to my Department from time to time, whether these suggestions have dealt with a particular area and whether the preliminary observations and inquiries seemed to indicate that there was value to be got from a new inquiry in a particular district. I referred here on one of my earlier Votes to an inquiry which has just been concluded with regard to the Arigna area, the results of which are not yet in my hand.  Where suggestions of that kind are made, and where they seem to show a definite prospect of value accruing to the State, these inquiries will be entered into.  The Deputy must realise that the funds at my disposal from this Vote for any purpose of that sort are very limited. All I can do is simply to have the assistance of this geologist put at the disposal of whatever body or commission is set up.  The inspector of mines is, of course, mainly an inspector for safety purposes, and not an inspector in the sense of a prospector.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin raised the old question of what he described as the refusal to sanction unemployment insurance benefit to people because they had certain holdings of land.  He has raised this in a peculiar way.  He said he raised it on the Minister's salary and as a question of policy.  I can tell him, and I want to be quite frank about it, that there is no policy in refusing unemployment insurance benefit to people who have contributions and who happen to have some holding of land. There could not be any policy that way. There are certain statutes which have to be administered, and there is always an appeal against anything an insurance officer may do.  I went into this <Col N="2135" /> on the Unemployment Insurance Bill which recently passed its Second Reading in the Dáil.  I was glad to see in a later remark of the Deputy's that he corrected his language and said that in some cases there had been refusals. I tried to impress on the Dáil when speaking on the Second Reading of the Unemployment Insurance Bill, that the Dáil only hears by means of Parliamentary questions of the cases in which there have been refusals.  It hears very little of the cases in which people with holdings of land have got payments of benefit where, of course, all the statutory provisions of the Act are complied with.  I put it to the Deputy, as I put it to several of his colleagues before, that if they can give me concrete cases where, having taken into consideration all the circumstances such as the size of the holding, the season of the year, the applicant's previous industrial history, and where Deputies think there is a case of hardship, such cases in which they can say, definitely, that it leads to the conclusion that the refusal was due to the fact that the person simply held land, then I will get these concrete cases inquired into.</P>

      <P>What the law states is that if a person goes into an occupation which is insurable, contributions must be deducted from his pay. The employer is bound to make those deductions, and in that way the fund is built up.  As to whether insured persons can draw from that fund depends on a variety of circumstances.  I am afraid, although Deputies always deny it when I make the statement, that the impression is current in this House that the unemployment insurance fund is a sort of savings bank arrangement in which people have money on which they can draw when they get out of work.  That is not the case, of course, but questions proceed on that basis and questions have been framed on the lines of saying that a man has so many contributions to his credit, that he is not working at a particular time, and then it is asked why is he not getting insurance benefit.  There are a great many more things to be looked to than whether a person has contributions to his credit and is not working.  You have to decide could that person get employment.  If that person had a particular holding of land which, at a particular time of the year, offered employment, then under the statutes unemployment insurance benefit could not be paid.</P>

It says, provided certain statutory regulations are complied with, Unemployment Benefit may be paid.  Take the case the Deputy puts.  If a person has a holding and he goes to till that holding, he is not available for work, and fails to comply <Col N="2137" /> with the statutory requirements.  The point Deputies have raised and are arguing against is the requirements of the Statutes.  I do not think that can be argued at this stage.  I am asking for certain money for administration purposes under certain Statutes.  If there are complaints against the Statutes there must be some other way of raising points than on an estimate. I am putting it to Deputy Davin that he has admitted in some cases there were refusals.  I think he admits definitely there are a great many cases in which benefit has been paid to people who have holdings of land, so that the case is not clear-cut.  The case was presented by other Deputies that because a person has a holding unemployment benefit would not be paid to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Not on that general ground.  I say there is no regulation in any Statute and no policy of having benefit refused to people simply because they have land.  I say if cases are brought to me in the light of day in the Dáil we can have the whole thing examined as to the season of the year, the type of land, and the applicant's previous industrial history. If there are clear-cut cases why do not Deputies search for them, bring them up here and expose them?  As to the financial inquiry into railway companies, there has been a financial inquiry into the position of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway for each of the last two or three years, I <Col N="2139" /> think for all the years during which the Free State has been set up, because there were moneys given to and provided for the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway for working the three Government lines.  It has not been quite decided, but it looks as if money will have to be provided for the company which works these lines again this year. That will have to be brought forward by way of a supplementary estimate. I cannot say that has been decided, but I give warning that most likely there will have to be some supplementary estimate, something smaller than last year, looked for this year again.  The inquiry into the Southern Railways Company is an inquiry that will have to be undertaken by my Department for certain purposes of its own, and one might say for the special purpose of preparing for the case that will likely be made before the Railway Tribunal with regard to rates and fares. The Deputy asked a question as to how far could one arrive at a conclusion as to the effect on the railway company's finances of the amalgamation scheme. One does not need a financial inquiry for that.  One has only to read the speech made by the Chairman of the Board of Directors to the proprietors of the railway company some months ago to see what benefit he thought had accrued to the railway company from amalgamation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, I think, misunderstood me with regard to inquiries into harbours, docks and piers.  All that I said was that the annual accounts and sinking fund returns of the various harbour authorities had to be examined.  They fall for examination pretty well every year. There have been public inquiries which were attended by representatives of the Department in connection with applications that were made under the Harbours, Docks and Piers (Temporary Increase of Charges) Act, 1920, for powers to increase the statutory charges made by the Harbour Commissioners in four cases, Waterford, Galway, Wexford and Youghal, and there was no general harbour inquiry.  I think the Deputy may have misunderstood me with regard to that.  Similarly with regard to inland navigation, I gave the four questions that really have been dealt with under the heading of &ldquo;Inland Navigation&rdquo; during the course of the financial year by the Marine Branch&mdash;the proposed abandonment of the Ulster Canal; the proposed abandonment of navigation on the Ballymore and Ballyconnell Canal; the improvement of the Barrow navigation, and the development of transport services on the Royal Canal.  The transport branch in charge of administrative work during the year had nothing to do with any decision as to policy with regard to, say, the report of the Canal and Inland Waterways Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because the first two to which I referred could not be said to have come to a definite conclusion yet.  The third question is that of the improvement of the Barrow navigation&mdash;I might almost change it, for the purposes of deputations with <Col N="2141" /> which Deputy Davin and Deputy Colohan were associated, to disimprovement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>And other Deputies&mdash;in order to lighten the cost of our proposed scheme, which is not to be mentioned here.  The fourth matter&mdash; the transport service on the Royal Canal&mdash;is a matter about which I am not giving any details at the moment because, to a certain extent, it is bound up with inquiries that are proceeding. The most important of these, of course, from my point of view, is the question of the Barrow navigation, because I am trying to see what force there is in certain complaints that have been made with regard to the Barrow Drainage scheme.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooper spoke of statistics, and referred to the delay.  I do not see how, in any circumstances, it would have been possible to have a preliminary return from the results of the census of population here earlier than in Northern Ireland.  They would always have an advantage in the smaller area and the larger number of enumerators in that area.  One might also say, having a greater number in their service of people who did this work before, they would also have an advantage that way.  Even although the Deputy gave one example where the delay might not have resulted in an accurate return from the census, I do not think that that could be considered as a normal or typical example.  There are not many places where they have Russian barons and married cooks so as to cause confusion in the minds of the simple enumerator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the Year Book, the aim here is towards the production of a Year Book. I doubt very much if that can be carried on with the staff that is available. It would require, certainly, one extra officer whose duty it would be to take the material that was coming out month by month and prepare it for inclusion in the Year Book, as is done in the cases the Deputy quoted of Australia and South Africa.  The aim is towards that and it is only a matter of when the Statistics Branch will have reached such a normal period that they can set to work with some degree <Col N="2142" /> of accuracy and see what extra help is required for that particular purpose. I might enter a note of warning here to Deputy Cooper.  I have no hope whatever that the census of population will prove to have been got through without some additional expenditure to the £29,000 here.  I can see very definitely that a supplementary Vote will have to be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to certain work in connection with the census of population which had been done by the Census Branch.  Extra money will be required for extra work in the way of compilation, and there may have to be payments of special allowances to people who are already in the Statistics Branch for special and extra work done in connection with the census, but I have no hope, whatever, of being able to have the Statistics Branch with its ordinary normal allocation of, say, £30,000 do the work of the census of population without additional money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the Deputy's view in regard to publication.  I do not say that publication in greater detail by the Statistics Branch could cause or would have the result of having a better impression created as to normal work carried on in the country, but I do think if the newspapers and publications here, generally, took the information supplied by the Statistics Branch, and gave it a certain amount of space, instead of the sensationalism that is, apparently, so popular, you would get a better impression.  Nobody can ever say that newspapers give a correct impression of a country.  Newspapers always look for the abnormal and exciting things.  I do not see where anybody seeking tranquillity and rest would go to live if they took the newspaper accounts all over the world of the countries about which they report. I am afraid I cannot go into the details that Deputy Baxter requires about a census of agricultural production. There will be plenty of time to have that question raised in the next six months.  The Deputy can rely on it that the information collected with regard to agriculture will be got in the most accurate way, in a way that will <Col N="2143" /> be approved by the Statistics Branch, and will certainly be in line with the International Statistics Bureau.  It would be rather difficult for me, at this moment, particularly as only preparatory work has been done in connection with it&mdash;and that has been interrupted by work on the census of population&mdash; to supply the information.  There will be quite time enough, say, in the next session, if the Deputy likes to have questions raised on this, to have some information given to him and to put forward suggestions, if it seems proper for Deputies to put forward suggestions, as to the manner in which information would be collected.  Suggestions will be received and considered. It will not be a matter so much in the agricultural census production of forms as for enumerators going about in their areas.  A considerable amount of trouble will devolve on the enumerators rather than on the actual land owner or actual producer.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Heffernan's question as to statistics regarding prices, ordinarily speaking there is a market reporter, who furnishes information as regards prices.  The reporter will be paid a retaining fee.  He will be a local person who will attend all markets and make whatever investigation as to prices that is necessary and send up the results.  The ordinary review of the imports and exports return for 1925 has been delayed owing to the pre-occupation of the Director of Statistics with the census of population. It is in the Press at the moment and will shortly be issued.  There has been delay, but the delay has been due to the amount of work entailed on the Director as regards the census of population.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point I wish to raise in connection with the Appropriations-in-Aid. The Minister has intimated that the £100 shown is an indication that there is to be an extension of the Trade Loans Guarantee Act.  I do not know whether I am quite in order in this, but as I understand it the operations of the Act at the moment are, I should say, limited.  If I understand the matter aright, the position is that the loan can be secured only through the National Land Bank.  Is that the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say further that, while I appreciate the fact that all possible precautions have to be taken in the operations of this Act, the demands that are made seem to be so difficult to fulfil that in a number of cases where this matter has been under consideration of applications for loans, people have cried off.  They have made up their mind that the demands that <Col N="2145" /> were made in the matter of guarantees were such that it was almost an impossibility to conform to the regulations. I want to make the point that if there is to be an extension of this as indicated here, there should be consideration as to whether or not the facilities afforded will not be more easily afforded than they have been up to the present.  That is in the matter of guarantees, mortgages, etc.  We might say that the effort on the part of the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Department of Finance to get these is such that organisation societies and people desiring to obtain the benefits of this Act have been compelled actually to abandon their efforts or to abandon hope of coming within the scope of the Act.  If there is any reason at all for the Act being in existence I feel that the Department will have to consider whether or not they should see their way to make loans more easily obtained in the future, if the Act is to be extended, than they have been up to the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The small amount of the appropriation-in-aid&mdash; £100&mdash;is due to the fact that when this Estimate was being made out it was not decided that the Trade Loans Guarantee Act should be continued for another year.  I cannot say even yet that that decision has been formally taken, but I think the Deputy can rely upon it that there will be a Bill introduced to extend the operations of the Act for another year.  There may have to be certain minor changes.  £100 only represents what was likely to accrue as between the end of the last financial year and the date of the expiry of the Act, which will be somewhere about June or July of this year.  That appropriation-in-aid in the new conditions might be expected to bring in a bigger sum if the Act be renewed as it is likely to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy then speaks of difficulties. There will have to be difficulties. There has to be inquiries as to how far a scheme is sound.  If for instance a scheme is put up, a soundly conceived scheme, and that it is properly guaranteed by a bank, there is very little <Col N="2146" /> difficulty even before the Advisory Committe or the two Departments who have to pronounce upon it.  The Deputy may have noticed that in a recent publication it was called in question whether moneys that had been loaned had fallen within the scope of the Act. Of course, on that, the highest legal opinion open to the Department and to the Government had been taken, and the opinion had been definitely on one side&mdash;that it was quite within the scope of the Act.  The Deputy used the phrase&mdash;I do not know whether he insisted on that so much&mdash;that there is difficulty in bringing things within the scope of the Act.  I would hardly like it to go out that there is a sort of insistence, or attempt at bringing things within the Act.  The Advisory Committee has to consult on that, in the first instance, and it would be really for the two Departments to say&mdash;they are unquestionably expected to say&mdash; whether it did fall within the scope of the Act.  If there is a case outside the scope of the Act, no matter how sound the scheme may be, there is certainly no guarantee given.  It has to be definitely within the scope of the Act. Where it is a matter that is within the scope of the Act, and where the scheme is sound and properly conceived, there is no difficulty.</P>
    <P>In the operations of this Act, viewing the whole thing retrospectively from the date of the original Act, there seems to have been a great delay&mdash;that matter was right at the start&mdash;due to certain dissensions which arose at the beginning.  That need not be gone into now, but recently there has been no undue delay in the operations of the Advisory Committee, and I do not think that anybody can say with very much justice that there has been delay owing to the two Departments.  I hope the Act will be renewed for a further year, and the Deputy can rely upon it that good schemes will get as speedy consideration as the importance of the schemes warrants, provided always, that there is a definite appreciation of the fact that where public money is being voted&mdash;even though it is only a secondary liability&mdash;there has to be an assurance by the Advisory Committee to the Department and by the Departments <Col N="2147" /> themselves, as to the soundness of the schemes put up.</P>

I calculated the sums guaranteed amounted to over £600,000, and the probable resulting employment is estimated at about 2,000 people.
