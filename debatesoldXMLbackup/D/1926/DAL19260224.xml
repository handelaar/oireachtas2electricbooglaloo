      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that breakfast foods such as Post Toasties and Frame Food are classified by the Revenue Commissioners as confectionery on the ground that they contain about five per cent. of sweetening matter, and if he can state whether the duty on confectionery is levied on them; also, whether, in view of the facts that proprietary articles of this character are not manufactured in the Saorstát, and that the imposition of this duty tends to increase the cost of living, he will consider the desirability of exempting these articles from duty.</P>

      <P>Post Toasties and Frame Food are both properly chargeable with Customs duty as sugar confectionery under Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1924.  It is not proposed to take any steps to exempt these articles from duty.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if several applications were received from Edward McDermott, an ex-National Army man, and now engine attendant at Malin Head, County Donegal, Wireless Station, for a vacant house in the unoccupied Coastguard Station at Malin Head; if he will state if this man's application will be promptly dealt with in view of the housing shortage in that area.</P>

      <P>It was originally intended to offer the whole of this station on lease to the County Council, and for that reason it was not possible to <Col N="958" /> consider applications for individual tenancies of cottages.  The Gárda Síochána now, however, require four of the six cottages, and the proposal to offer the whole station to the County Council will be dropped and steps will be taken to let the remaining two cottages on weekly tenancies.  The application for a cottage made by Mr. Daniel McDermott, engine attendant at Malin Head Wireless Station, will receive consideration with the other applications.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that a sum of £1 0s. 0d. was awarded to Mr. Michael McGrath, formerly of Broadleas, BallymoreEustace, and now of Ballymount, Colbinstown Co. Kildare, on the 16th February, 1926, as compensation in respect of one sporting gun, one miniature rifle and seventy-five rounds of sporting ammunition taken up from him on the 18th November, 1921, by Lieutenant O'Neill, at present serving in the National Army, and certified by receipt of the 25th February, 1925, and whether, in view of the fact that Mr. McGrath can produce this receipt, and having regard to the smallness of the award, which seems inadequate, he will give instructions to have this case reconsidered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the affirmative, but I am unable to agree that the award referred to is inadequate.  The Indemnity Act empowers me to make payment of a sum not exceeding the amount recommended by the Committee and in this case the full amount of the recommendation has been paid.  I am not, therefore, in a position to have the case re-considered.</P>

Does the Minister consider that it is fair or right to be raising false hopes in the unemployed by announcing schemes which apparently, the Government have no immediate intention of putting into operation?</P>

It was only done upon repeated requests from the Labour Party as to what was the view of my Department at the time.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This, I think, is the case of a small-holding owned by a woman named Mrs. Gishford; a holding, moreover, subject to a Land Commission annuity&mdash;a purchased holding. Apparently, she has made a letting of some portion of it, or the whole of it, and there is a dispute on the title between the two people.  The Land Commission could not interfere in that dispute.  It is not the function of the Land Commission to interfere between litigants as such, but to acquire land for distribution.  It is certainly not its function to interfere between litigants where there are proceedings on a pure question of title.</P>

Does he not agree that she is using very arbitrary measures in the case I have referred to?  This poor woman, who holds only one and a quarter acres, has been paying rates there since 1878.  The Minister should acquire that holding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission do not acquire a farm because it happens to be of a certain area.  They acquire land for the purpose of relieving congestion and for the other purposes set out under the Land Act, when the land is suitable.  This land is subject to a Land Commission annuity, and there is a section in the Land Act which provides that land subject to a Land Commission annuity &mdash;purchased land&mdash;cannot be taken except the Land Commission are prepared to give the owner an equally suitable and not less valuable holding <Col N="965" /> elsewhere.

      <P>Go ndcontar suim bhreise ná raghaich thar £10 chun íochta an mhuirir a thiocfidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1926, chun tuarastail agus costaisí an Oireachtais.</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1926, for the salaries and expenses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The first sub-head of this Vote deals with an additional grant to the Saorstát group of the inter-Parliamentary Union.  The original Estimate provided for a sum of £80, representing the annual subscription to the Union.  The conference was held this year in America and in view of the very large Irish population there, and the special importance, from the Saorstát point of view, which attached to the conference, it was thought desirable that representatives of the Saorstát group should be enabled to travel to America.  An additional sum of £400 was, therefore, provided out of the Contingency Fund towards the expenses of the delegates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second sub-head is a grant-in-aid for the carrying on of the restaurant. It is described here as a final contribution, <Col N="967" /> but I have a slight suspicion that we may have to have an extra final contribution at some later date.  I do not know that that could be avoided.  It is certainly necessary that the restaurant should be maintained and that it should be possible for Deputies to have food and refreshment in the building and so avoid going outside.  Owing to the fact that the membership of the House is small, that there are considerable intervals during which the House does not sit, that the staff cannot be dispensed with and the establishment cannot be closed down, losses are likely to occur. The losses so far have not been very serious, considering the fairly long adjournments that have taken place. For a considerable time when the Oireachtas was sitting steadily the restaurant was able to pay its way, but last year there were fewer sittings and losses were incurred.</P>
    <P>The last sub-head in the Vote deals with the subscription to the proposed Saorstát branch of the inter-Parliamentary Association.  The purpose of this subscription is to have the Journal of the inter-Parliamentary Association circulated to members of the Oireachtas and to have reports of our proceedings inserted in it.  Considerable subscriptions are given by other States of the Commonwealth to this Association. The British Parliament votes £4,000 a year: Australia, £250: Canada, 2,000 dollars; Newfoundland, £200; New Zealand, £200; and South Africa, £250. The Quarterly Journal which is published by the Association gives a <i>resumé</i> of the most important matters that come before the different Parliaments. The Journal will be of value to members of the Oireachtas, having regard to the almost special place that we have in the Commonwealth and the strong interest we have in development within the Commonwealth.  It will be of value to members of the Oireachtas to have that Journal supplied to them. They can see what is going on in the other Parliaments included in the Commonwealth. The Journal will contain reports of what is being done here: what we are doing will be brought to the notice of members of the other Parliaments. I think Deputies will realise <Col N="968" /> the very real value that can be obtained through the circulation of this Journal and by the insertion in it of reports of the proceedings of the Oireachtas.  I do not think that the proposed Saorstát branch contemplates, for the present at any rate, any other activity.  It will be responsible simply for the selection and editing of the matter that we wish to have inserted in the Quarterly Journal.</P>

      <P>With regard to Sub-head (H)&mdash;a grant in aid of £400 to the inter-Allied Union group, or rather the inter-Parliamentary Union group&mdash; it is the opinion of quite a number of citizens that the inter-Parliamentary Union groups should have defrayed the expenses of their own delegates.  Public funds should not have been drawn upon to any extent in connection with the attendance of delegates in any place, Washington or otherwise.  Inter-Parliamentary Union groups should be sufficiently strong to defray the expenses of their own delegates.  While we are very pleased that we were represented at Washington, still I think it is a bad precedent to adopt to meet expenses in this way, particularly in view of our existing financial conditions and the public discussions that are going on about expenses.  I do not say that those public discussions are real; I believe they are more or less engineered. At the same time, this is one item that will strengthen the trend of those discussions, and for that reason I am opposed to the item contained in the sub-head.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that Deputy Wilson's second thoughts are best.  I believe if the Deputy thought a second time about making the speech that he has just made, his second thought would have been best. I think, on the whole, that we did derive value from the £400 expended. I am the treasurer of the Saorstát branch of the inter-Parliamentary Union.  Our total income is altogether less than about £150 a year, including a contribution of £80 from the Government. How many people can you send to the United States for £70 odd?</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson's policy is that delegates should pay their own expenses. That means that you would only be able to send as representatives those men who would be in a position to put down £150 or £170.  Would that make for a representative delegation of the Oireachtas?  I do not think so.  Though I was not one of the delegation I was in some way responsible for it, and to my mind the necessity of it was to mark to the forty-one Parliaments represented in this Congress the true quality of the Oireachtas.  The delegates were carefully chosen for that purpose.  Two were in a position to pay their own expenses&mdash;the Minister for Industry and Commerce and Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde, but the latter, through illness, could not go. We had to find three representatives, and I humbly suggest that we could not have done better than send the representatives we did, namely, An Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Johnson and Deputy Mulcahy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that Deputy Wilson will admit that such a delegation was calculated to impress on the United States and the Parliaments of the world represented there, that we are not merely a retrogressive force, chewing and breaking the bones of old quarrels, but that we are a progressive Parliament, <Col N="970" /> a Parliament that is doing things and trying to do things.  Our representatives took an active part in the debates. Deputy Johnson moved a motion.  There is nothing very surprising in that.  It was a motion which was opposed by the leader of the British Empire Delegation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>What is a little more surprising is, that Deputy Johnson was reinforced by Deputy Mulcahy. They succeeded in having the Saorstát point of view emphasised and placed on record, before not merely the United States, but before Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, and in fact, before practically all the Parliaments of the world.  What else was done? To begin with, our delegates came into association with other delegates of the British Commonwealth.  They met, and were the guests of, the Canadian and Newfoundland delegates.  They met the Prime Minister of Newfoundland, and they discovered that he was born in Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin. They met the Minister for Justice of Newfoundland, and they discovered that he went by the name of Higgins&mdash; he had shed the &ldquo;O&rdquo; in crossing the ocean.  They found that out of four delegates from Newfoundland, three were of Irish birth.  You, sir, were able to interview the Clerk of the House of Representatives, the Clerk of the Senate at Washington, and the Clerk of the Canadian Parliament, and to learn various things as to procedure, which, I think, will be of value, though I do not think that there is much about procedure that anybody could teach you.  They were able to come into contact with men of every point of view.  At various social and other gatherings the delegates of Saorstát Eireann were in the forefront.  So great was the mark they made, that when it was necessary to pass an official vote of thanks to the American people and Congress for their kindness and hospitality, it was moved by a representative of Poland, and the Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Eireann was selected to second it.  That, I think, is some cause for pride.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="971" /> I think that to stand up amongst the representatives of forty-one Parliaments and uphold our rights as a Parliament of our own is worth £400.  The fact that we were able to make our status plain to the United States and to the people of the world is worth £400. Where any conference is held within reasonable limits of this State I would agree with Deputy Wilson that the delegates, or the groups which they represent, should pay their own expenses. That occurred last year in Switzerland, where groups paid the expenses of two delegates, while one delegate paid his own expenses.  If such conferences were held somewhere in Europe economy might triumph, and we ought not ask for a grant of this kind.  I do not know if it would be reasonable to ask the Minister for Finance for funds to send a delegation to Warsaw or Budapest where we have few interests, but we have enormous interests in the United States where we have a special representative.  I think that this delegation, by backing up the work of our representative there, is well worth the sum which we are now asked to vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in agreement with nearly everything which Deputy Cooper has said.  The only point of difference is that I believe in self-help.  I believe, as a member of the Hierarchy said the other day, that we should not be wailing daily at the door of the Treasury for funds.  If the Union here had only £70 it must be weak and it could not possibly represent this Parliament.</P>

      <P>I want to point out that the only objection I have is that, while I believe the delegation was of great value so far as it went, we, as a Parliament, should not have been asked to expend public money upon a representation which should have been paid for by ourselves from our own personal means.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask Deputy Wilson not to persevere in his objection. I had the distinction of shepherding <Col N="972" /> this recommendation to the Executive Council.  I invite the attention of Deputies to the fact that in connection with the reception of these delegates the American Government provided a vote of 50,000 dollars, and that amount was subsequently increased. I do not know anything about the personnel of the American Government, but I take it that the members of the House of Representatives and Congress are endowed with the possession of more worldly goods than the members of the Oireachtas.  I agree with Deputy Major Cooper that it was necessary to supplement the funds of the Union with a Government subsidy. I am personally satisfied that, apart from the subscription which may have been given by the Union and apart from the subscription given by the Government, the members of the delegation were themselves at considerable loss, to say nothing of the time involved by reason of their attendance at this session.  I think that it would be unreasonable to object to our participation in it, apart from the question of its being held in America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there be a branch of that organisation here, I think we ought to accept the responsibility of membership, as well as any advantages that are derived.  Of all the institutions of which I have been a member in this country, this one represents a very much bigger outlook than any of the others.  There is nothing parochial, nothing small, about it.  In other institutions in the country arrangements are made for sending delegations to other countries to see certain activities of a character similar to those of the administration in which they are taking part.  This particular Union has immense possibilities for the future.  The members who attend have a great privilege.  They shoulder, in fact, a big responsibility in attending, and the personal cost and effort is considerable. I should say that normally, if it were not for the peculiar character of this assembly and the fact that it was held in America and was attended by such people, the members who attended could not have justified to themselves the personal expenditure which attendance there entailed.  In <Col N="973" /> view of these circumstances, I do not think that Deputy Wilson should persevere in his objection.</P>

I would resent any thought that might arise out of this discussion that any Vote that may be made was in the nature of a gift, or privilege, to the delegates.  If that is the thought of any Deputy, I hope that he will vote against this motion.  I think I am right in saying in regard to all the delegates that it was a matter of public duty and very arduous work, and if there is any suggestion in anybody's mind that there is any gift, testimonial, or privilege given, or granted, to the delegates who were present by making a Vote of this kind, I hope that he will vote decisively against this motion.</P>

      <P>There are one or two points to which I wish to draw attention in connection with this Vote.  With one of them the Deputies are possibly familiar, that is, the sum of £1,000 which we are asking.  That is in connection with the setting up of seven preparatory training colleges.  That is fully explained in the White Paper <Col N="974" /> which was put into the hands of Deputies yesterday.  The other matter has already been before the House so it will not take the Deputies by surprise, namely, the increase of £26,000 under the heading &ldquo;Principals, Assistants,&rdquo; and their salaries.  That is, of course, due to the fact that for the present year for the first time, the Christian Brothers have elected to come under the Department of Primary Education.  There was a general concensus of opinion in the Dáil that that was a step that should be taken without undue delay.  £26,000 is the sum which the Brothers will be paid for portion of this year.  It is not the normal annual sum.  The normal annual sum will probably amount to about £75,000.</P>

      <P>You will remember that there was an understanding that the whole question of the training of teachers might be discussed on this Supplementary Estimate, and it is with regard to the general question of the training of teachers, of which this scheme is a part, that I propose to say a few words.  I want first to draw the attention of the Dáil to the statement contained in this White Paper to the effect that there is, and has been for some time past, considerable difficulty in maintaining the supply of teachers.  I do that because I think there is a feeling to the contrary, in some quarters in any case.  An article appeared in a Dublin weekly paper a few weeks ago which dealt with the question of married women who were teaching, and gave the impression to readers who did not know the facts, that quite a considerable number of fully qualified and trained young women were out of employment because the married women continued to occupy these posts.  Nothing could <Col N="975" /> be further from the facts, as no doubt the Minister will tell us.  There are no qualified women teachers, or men teachers for that matter, out of employment, and there is indeed at the moment a shortage, so much so that many teachers, who are compelled, according to the regulations, to secure and appoint substitutes in the case of illness&mdash;not like other public servants, who get their substitutes appointed for them&mdash;have very great difficulty in procuring qualified substitutes.  At the moment one might expect conditions to be otherwise, in view of the fact that generally there are not vacant positions available elsewhere.</P>
      <P>In spite of the fact that the Minister for Finance thought some years ago that teachers were overpaid, there has not been that rush to enter the profession that one might have expected. There has not been any great rush to join the new aristocracy, as Deputy Gorey thinks them, or to go along the road towards the possession of a motor car.  I would point out to the Minister that there must be something that is accountable for this, outside the facts that have yet been considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently been looking over the Report of a Special Committee in England dealing with the training of teachers.  They have drawn attention to a somewhat similar shortage, and I think that we should give some consideration to one of their recommendations. They say: &ldquo;In considering the question of the supply of teachers regard should be had not only to the adequacy and stability of salaries, proper conditions of tenure, and satisfactory pension arrangements, but also to the actual conditions of school life and work, and to the teacher's freedom from undue administrative control.&rdquo;  I have been giving a good deal of thought this problem.  I have asked myself how it was that there have not been more candidates for positions as teachers, and I do not think that it can altogether be ascribed to questions of salary or pensions or the conditions of tenure, but rather to the conditions of service, and especially to that want of freedom to the teacher in his profession, the cramping of initiative, a <Col N="976" /> matter to which I referred at some length on the discussion of the Estimates and on which I do not want to enter now.  But I do want to say this, that the conditions under which a teacher has to work, his feeling that he is always working, as it were, under the eye of an inspector and that he has not that control which a man in his position and with his qualifications and training ought to have is, I believe, more responsible than anything else for the difficulty of procuring a suitable type of candidate for the teaching profession.  I think the Minister would be well advised if he would look into that and see if it would not be possible, with great advantage to education, to adopt a system whereby the teacher, after it is seen that he is fully qualified and fully competent to perform his duties, would be trusted more to use his own initiative in performing these duties, without feeling that the hand of the administration is always stretched out over him to chide or to lead, which seems to be the impression at present.</P>
    <P>With regard to this new scheme of preparatory colleges which it is proposed to substitute for the present arrangements I would like to say a few words.  It is proposed to take boys and girls of approximately fourteen or fifteen and put them into institutions or preparatory colleges with a view to training them to be teachers.  Such a scheme has its advantages, of course, but I am not clear that there is not a disadvantage in segregating boys and girls at that age and having them specialise, giving them the impression that from that age onwards they are to be teachers.  I do not know whether that is good or wise.  I have my doubts as to its wisdom.  I think that if they were left freer up to the age of seventeen or eighteen to decide whether or not they would go in for the profession of teaching it would be better, and I think it would be better also if they carried on the secondary education with other boys and girls who were going for different professions.  I think that there would be an advantage in it. I know, of course, that under the present circumstances that is not easy. We may not have the right type of secondary schools to which these boys <Col N="977" /> and girls could be sent.  I do see that that is a practical difficulty, but I am not satisfied that the best thing to do is to segregate these boys and girls at such an age as is proposed.</P>
    <P>It is complained at present that members of the teaching profession are inclined, from their very training, and especially from the nature of their occupation, to get into a groove and have matters.  If there is any substance in that complaint I do not think that this scheme will improve matters.  I almost feel that if there were some system of bursaries and maintenance allowances given for intermediate schools, where children intended for other professions, for business, or for agriculture were being educated it would be advantageous. I think that the lessons and lectures that these boys and girls will get right from the age of thirteen or fourteen will all be in one particular groove, and I do not think that that will tend to the broadening of their views on other matters.  However, while saying that, I do recognise that there are certain practical difficulties in the way of what I suggest, and that it is perhaps an advantage to get boys and girls at a certain age and, as it were, give them the type of education that it is thought a person who will afterwards engage in the teaching profession should get.</P>
    <P>It is not made clear in this document, although I think it is the intention from the wording, that children other than those in the Gaeltacht will be eligible for entrance, although the colleges will be situated mainly in the Gaeltacht.  I gather in a general way that that is the intention of the Minister, but a superficial reading of this would rather give the impression that entrance to the colleges in the Gaeltacht will be confined to children in the Gaeltacht.  I hope that the Minister will make it plain that it is the intention that they will be open to children from all parts of Ireland, provided, of course, that they are able to pass the examinations.</P>
    <P>With reference to the further training of the student teachers after they leave these training colleges, I am not satisfied that the present system is giving <Col N="978" /> us the right type, and I would like the Minister to tell us what, if anything, his Department proposes to do in the way of linking up the present training colleges with the university, or using the university for the training of teachers.  We pay a considerable sum of money one way or another for the upkeep of our universities, and of course only a very small percentage of the people can ever hope actually to attend a university.  But in my opinion the next best thing would be that those who are engaged in teaching in all classes of schools should have the advantage of university education and thus be in a position to impart it, indirectly, to those who are under their care, so that the advantages&mdash;if there are advantages, and there ought to be&mdash;of a university education should percolate in that way to the whole people.  I often think that it is rather a strange thing that we use the universities to train our doctors, our engineers, and others, and that we do not use them to any extent to train our teachers.  One would think that that would be the first duty of a university.</P>
    <P>This question of the connection of the training colleges with the university is a matter the Ministry ought to look into.  It has been raised more than once in this House.  On one occasion the late Minister for Education took the view that it was a matter between the teaching bodies and the universities to arrange a scheme.  That hint was taken, and so far back as 1923 the teaching bodies and the universities came to an agreement about a scheme.  The matter was brought before the Minister for Education, and in view of the hint that had been given, these bodies thought that there would be no trouble in getting him to put their scheme into operation.  They found, however, that was not quite so easy, and, as a matter of fact, nothing has been done in this connection since 1923.  There is some temporary arrangement, I understand, whereby a student who has left the training college and passed a certain examination acquires a certain status as a university student.  This does not appear to be very well known, and I would like to hear what the Minister has to say on it.  Some people seem to think that <Col N="979" /> a student who passes his final examination is to be taken as having passed, as a matter of course, his first examination in the university, but it appears that is not the case.  I think some statement ought to be made on this matter so that students would know exactly what position they occupy.</P>
    <P>It was intended, and at one time argued, that the best thing to do would be to keep the students in a training college for two years to do their ordinary professional course, and then let them go to the university afterwards. I think, in practice, that is what is being done in a great many cases: that the teachers leave the training college at the end of two years, and then teach in their schools for two, three or four years.  After they have passed their period of probation and got their full training diplomas they go to the university and do their course there.  That, I think, is the best course to adopt: that the young student who proves himself a good teacher should get the preference in being called up to the university.  I think it is only when he has given two, three or four years in actual teaching that he will benefit to the full from a course such as the university can give.</P>
    <P>I hope that the facilities for taking advantage of these University courses will be extended.  It will be to the benefit of education as a whole if that is done.  The more highly qualified and the more skilled your teacher is, the wider the course he has read, the better will he be as a teacher.  You may take it as a general rule&mdash;there will be exceptions, of course&mdash;that teaching is an art which is not easily acquired.  On the whole it can be said that the man who is well qualified and who has read a wide course will be all the better teacher for it.  It is in the interests of the State that everything possible should be done to encourage teachers to get a University training.  It is sometimes thought that anybody can teach the simpler things that are taught in the National Schools.  That is quite a common belief, but it is well-known that the simpler the things to be taught are, and the younger the <Col N="980" /> people that have to be dealt with are, the harder and the more difficult it is to teach, and therefore, the more skill is required to teach.  It seems to me that the universities in this country will not be fulfilling their duty to the State until they make more provision for the training of teachers&mdash;teachers for every class of school.  It is only by the making of such provision that the people can hope to reap the advantages of University education which costs them so much.</P>

      <P>In dealing with this Estimate.  I must take some cognisance of the White Paper that has been issued and of some other matters that have appeared in the public Press.  The White Paper refers to the setting up of seven preparatory colleges.  It is stated that the intention is to have five of these colleges in the Gaeltacht and the remaining two, one for Catholic and one for Protestant students, probably in Dublin.  With the issue of this White Paper we have this announcement made at a meeting in Kilkenny recently and published in the Press: &ldquo;To drive the English language out of Ireland.&rdquo;  I understand that announcement was made by an officer of the Educational Authority here.  So far as the members on these benches are concerned, and the people we represent, we have always been sympathetic and helpful towards the Gaelic language.  We have never stood in the way of it.  But while that is so, we want to have the air cleared by a statement from the Minister for Education in view of the announcement made by this gentleman, Mr. Seoirse MacNiocaill.  Why should English, he said, be on an equal footing with Irish?  We are going to see, he is also reported as having said, that every child born in Ireland will speak its mother tongue.  Further, there was the statement that they were going to undertake the task of driving the English language out of Ireland.  That, I think, will be a rather big task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considering our location geographically, and considering the position we occupy in other ways, it is, and always will be, essential that our people know and speak and write the English language. <Col N="981" /> I make that announcement here, and I take full responsibility for it.  Our business, economic, social and other relations with America, Australia, South Africa, and all the rest, demand that we must have in the future as good a knowledge as we have to-day of the English language.  That may not be the view of the fanatic or of the extreme Irish-Irelander.  I do not think that the fanatic is a sound man in anything.  I do not think that his reasoning is sound, but if I were given a choice of individuals, I should prefer the fanatic to the man who is secretly inspired by the commercial value of his own accomplishments&mdash; what he can make out of them. There has been a leading article in one of our papers on this matter, and I think that we ought to have an authoritative statement from the Minister for Education as to what is his policy with regard to this question. If the policy announced in Kilkenny is the policy of the Minister for Education, I, for one, am prepared to come to grips with it, and I think the members of the party I belong to are also prepared to come to grips with it.  As I said earlier, we have always been sympathetic and helpful towards the Gaelic language, and wish to see this country bi-lingual.  We wish to see the Gaelic language occupy the position that it ought to occupy in this country.  We think that every child in the country should be taught it, but if the question is to be to make a choice between the two languages, then let us have that issue out here, and we are prepared to meet it.</P>
    <P>The English language means bread and butter to the people of this country, and will mean that for future generations in this country.  I hope we are not going to be driven into the position of making a choice as between the two languages.  I do not believe in splendid isolation or in the doctrines of fanatics, and I cannot imagine anything more harmful than propaganda of this description, whether done by men in authority or by men with no authority, whether done by wise men or by fools.  Even an announcement by a fool couched in language like that would be harmful. How much more harmful is it when it <Col N="982" /> comes from a man placed in a position of authority?  I cannot conceive anything more likely to raise a storm against the language that we all want to help than nonsense of this description, or anything more calculated to defer the date of national unity in this island.  I think it is meant not to help national unity.  I think it is charitable to assume that it is only a fanatic or some silly, irresponsible individual who would utter such nonsense.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I wish to refer to in connection with this estimate. I refer to the question of scholarships.  I want to make a protest in connection with this matter.  It is well-known that in some counties scholarships have been given on the basis of valuation, regardless altogether of the income received by the parents of the children concerned.  We have retired civil servants of one description or another; army officers, school teachers and others in receipt of pensions, some of them with pensions of £1,500, £2,000 and £3,000 a year, living in nice little villas which, of course, have a very small valuation. The result is that their children are eligible for these County Council scholarships, whereas the child of the small farmer&mdash;the valuation of this man is, say, £35 or £36 a year, and he is living in poverty&mdash;is not eligible for them.  We want that system of valuations removed altogether.  The child, say, of a retired school teacher is in a better position to qualify for these scholarships than, say, the child of a poor farmer, for the reason that the former can get a home grinding.  If such a child has any intelligence at all he is bound, of course, to do well at these scholarship examinations.  The point I am making is that the children of these retired civil servants are eligible for scholarships, while the child of the farmer is not.</P>

That view is that the education the children are now receiving in the primary schools is not anything like what it was when the teachers were paid by results.  Since this system of payment by results was abolished, there is almost unanimous opinion that there has been a marked decrease in the progress of the children at the primary schools.  I touch on this subject in the hope that the Minister may see his way to restore the system of results and enable us to get back to the position we lost by its abolition.</P>

      <P>Many matters have been raised in this debate. Some of those are of general importance and others possess only a passing importance.

      <P>I will deal with the matter if the Deputy allows me.  May I point out, on the general position, that I think it is highly improper if this report represents the statement of the official in question&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will allow me to proceed. I think it is highly improper for any civil servant, no matter how highly placed&mdash;and particularly for a highly-placed civil servant&mdash;to make statements on policy, not merely in regard to this matter, but in respect of any other matter.  I should object very strongly if the Minister of another Department, for instance, made a statement that a certain class of the community should be got rid of because he did not like them.  I think it is highly improper&mdash;if the practice became general it would be intolerable, from the general point of view of the Civil Service&mdash;that statements of this kind on policy should be made.  As regards the actual question itself, it was never put forward as the policy of the Government that the English language should be driven from this country.  Everybody knows that.  I was never present when any such statement as to policy was made here.  The policy of the Ministry was defined last November and was approved by the great bulk of the Dáil.  I venture to say that of the people who voted on that occasion against the policy of the Ministry very few voted against it on the question of Irish.  I might almost say that on that particular question there would have been a very strong vote of the House&mdash;not on the question of driving English out of the country but on the question that English and Irish are our official languages as defined by the Constitution.  I think I will have, in taking up that position, the support of the great bulk of the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the bad habit of trying to deal with one point at a time.  If the Deputy will bear with my weakness in that respect, I will try to meet him.  I am not nimble enough to deal with four or five things at the same moment.  Two other questions have been raised on this Estimate.  One is the question of the preparatory colleges; the other is the question of the general training of the teachers.  We will take these two points in turn, in order to meet Deputy Wilson.  Apart altogether from the question of Irish, secondary colleges are probably badly wanted in that part of the country.  I should say that it would be highly desirable that secondary colleges should be established there.  Deputy Gorey and the other Deputies who take up a similar line are, I am convinced, absolutely sincere when they say that they are anxious to do as much as they can for Irish.  We have been criticised because we have tried&mdash;if I may use slang&mdash;&ldquo;to stuff Irish down the throats&rdquo; of people who are too old, easily to tolerate that particular kind of forcible feeding.  It has been urged in debates here that that is not the proper way to set about the task confronting us.  I suggest that this is a much better way to do it.  Apart from the question of Irish, there is the general question of meeting our educational needs, so far as teachers are concerned. We hope in the future, as Deputies may have observed from a perusal of the White Paper issued yesterday, to recruit our teachers from two classes.  The first class is that of the pupil teachers&mdash;teachers in secondary schools, who will get a certain amount of technical training there, and then come on to our training colleges in Dublin.  That will enable us to get in touch with a large proportion of our population.  So much for the <Col N="986" /> pupil-teacher class.  The other class is the class we hope to tap by means of these colleges.  Deputy O'Connell was quite correct in assuming that these colleges would be open to people from the whole of the country.  As he wanted a definite statement on that point, and as there is apparently some ambiguity in the White Paper, I want to make that perfectly clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the position.  Apart altogether from the question of Irish, it would be necessary to set up colleges of this type.  The particular training college in which Professor Thrift is specially interested&mdash;if I can say he is interested in one more than another&mdash; or the particular college he is most closely in contact with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That college, I hope, will benefit considerably. There is, I think, a certain amount of difficulty in getting teachers for that college at the moment.  I hope that college will benefit, and I hope the particular portion of the community which that college caters for will, so far as the Irish side is concerned, not be at any disadvantage in the future.  The cost, I am glad to say, was not referred to.  Beyond the initial cost of the buildings, I do not think the cost will be very much.  That may seem a strange statement.  What I mean is that we will save a certain amount, otherwise, as a result of this scheme.  At present the monitorial system costs us&mdash;if I may trust my memory&mdash;about £22,000.  We expect to save about £15,000 of that, and to devote £7,000 of it to the pupil teachers. Perhaps I may hark back to the matter I referred to incidentally already &mdash;the question as to how we have dealt with the problem, up to the present, of finding Irish teachers.  Our method was the method that has been criticised &mdash;getting people advanced in years to do this work.  Gradually the money <Col N="987" /> spent on that&mdash;the amount in the Estimate for the present year is £47,000&mdash;will be saved, so that in reality I calculate that the yearly running of these colleges will cost us nothing&mdash;that the balance will be in our favour rather than otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the general question of the training of teachers, I am not, I confess, quite clear as to what is wanted.  As Deputy O'Connell knows, there is a departmental inquiry dealing with that matter, and I hope the members of the Inquiring Committee will be able to give me information without undue delay.  Recently, I asked the Committee to get the different bodies interested in this matter to place their views before them.  Reference was also made to the question of University training.  The Deputy, I think, referred to the proposition put forward at a conference between the different teaching bodies, in which they proposed a four-year course for national teachers. I think I am correct in saying that that is practically what it amounts to. In this connection, it is well to bear in mind what such a proposal might involve in expense, however desirable it might be in the abstract.  The expense might be considerable.  At the present time, there are turned out yearly from 300 to 350 national teachers.  The two-year course costs about £200 for each teacher.  If you increase that to four years, you will have double the expense.  That is a consideration that must be attended to before jumping into any enterprise of that type.  As to the facilities that exist at present for national teachers to take part in university studies and to get university degrees, I understand that Kildare Street Training College is rather intimately connected with Trinity College.  That is apart from the technical training.  There is close association between the professorial bodies of the one and the other institution. So far as University College is concerned, the position is that students, say, of St. Patrick's Training College, Drumcondra, who have done a two year's course, are eligible to present themselves for examination, and in the passing of that examination they will be accounted by the University as having <Col N="988" /> passed the First University Examination in Arts.  Then, what normally happens is: the teacher goes down the country; after some time, if he is efficient, he puts in an application to attend for another year at the University. In that case, he gets his salary and pays his substitute.  He lives in one of the hostels here in Dublin&mdash;in St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, or in De La Salle Hall, in Ely Place.  He attends the University for one year, and that is accounted another year in his University course.  He will then go back again, and, if he is highly effcient, he can send in an application to attend again the University for another year, in this instance paying a substitute. His salary possibly would be from £200 to £250.  He will have to pay his substitute for that year, which will cost him anything up to £150.  He is eligible to go on for what would be his fourth year of training.  That is the actual system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister says, the whole question is one of money, and at present it must depend on the teacher's own ability and on his financial resources as to whether he is able to get this very desirable thing, that is to take advantage of University <Col N="989" /> education and to get a University degree.  As the Minister says, there is a scheme which has been at work for not far short of five years, but which has been limited very much in operation by this financial difficulty.  It will come up shortly for ratification, and from the knowledge we have of it, after five years, it may be possible to modify it or to make it more available.  But, with Deputy O'Connell, I would like to emphasise the very desirable thing that it is for our national teachers to have their outlook widened by getting the advantage of a University education.  Of course the difficulty is finance.  It is very largely the case that a teacher, after taking two years' training, must begin immediately to earn his living. He must begin that before he is in a position to pay his fees and it is in that respect the difficulty lies rather than in the University.</P>
      <P>I do not agree that it is the function of a University to train teachers, just as it is not the function to train engineers.  Its primary function is the seeking after knowledge for its own sake, but it is undoubtedly the case that one of the valuable works of a university is the training of men for different departments in life.  I quite agree with Deputy O'Connell that it is just as necessary that we should train teachers of primary schools and secondary schools as that we should train doctors or engineers.  I do hope that one of the objects we shall have in view in our deliberations is to make university education more and more available for our national teachers.  We shall have to secure a system which will be satisfactory and under which our national teachers will get the benefit of a university education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of Irish has been raised. I have always spoken about this in a very limited and moderate way.  I think still that all that is necessary to say now is that there are mistaken ideas underlying this pushing of Irish.  There will come a sane policy with regard to Irish.  I do not think we have arrived at it yet, but I think we are on our way, perhaps, to it.  I agree with Deputy Gorey quite strongly that if we are to keep in contact with the <Col N="990" /> rest of the world, we must maintain our study of English.  That I do not think interferes at all with it being possible that there should be a sane policy with regard to Irish.  I am quite prepared to admit that a bilingual study may lead to better education of the child than a single-language study only.  But if the study of Irish was to be pushed so as to lead to what Deputy Gorey is thinking of, a policy of isolation, I think it would be an insane policy.  There is little that is political in this.  Still that sort of feeling is often introduced.  If the question is discussed in a cool atmosphere I believe that we shall discover quite a sane policy with regard to the whole thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">

      <P>I just want to point out some of the limits of discussion, without saying that anyone has gone outside the limits.  The discussion of Supplementary Estimates is, normally, confined to the object for which the money is asked.  But in this case an agreement was come to by Deputies with the Minister's predecessor and myself that when this particular Estimate was under discussion the whole question of the training of teachers might be raised.  Therefore, any question concerning the training of teachers can be raised, including of course the one of preparatory colleges. Other questions, particularly questions of detail, cannot be raised.  There was only one such question already touched on, the question of county scholarships, which I do not think is under the jurisdiction of the Department of Education at all.  In any case it is not in order under this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesOMara" hpid="Mr. O'MARA Mr. O'MARA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'MARA</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very pleased to learn from the Minister, who was the only one to touch on the financial aspect of this proposal, that it would not involve additional expenditure.  I gather that the abolition of the monitorial system will save £22,000, and by the abolition of special teachers for Irish £47,000 will be saved.  But the White Paper says that the preparatory colleges later on will cost about £51,000 a year.  It seems to me that the Minister was somewhat sanguine in thinking that he would save the whole cost of the monitorial system, because <Col N="991" /> when these teachers are trained in the colleges and there are to be 650 of them trained every year, of whom the White Paper says 150 are to find positions, they will really be paid more during their time at the schools afterwards than the monitors are paid now. This proposal is really a radical change in the whole system of education, abolishing the monitorial system and creating really a new class of teacher in addition to the present teachers, whom Deputy O'Connell thinks are underpaid.  I am glad that the teachers will be specially trained for their positions and I hope, with this special training, we will have a great deal more efficiency in the education of the country than we have had up to the present, and we ought to have it because education in this country is costing an enormous sum of money. This Vote alone is for £3,400,050.  In addition, we are to pay £50,000 a year, which, capitalised, would mean one million pounds.  We are creating a whole townland of preparatory colleges. Just imagine seven colleges and 650 pupils for a scheme the details of which the Department of Education and the representatives of the teaching profession in this House are not agreed upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the future career of this second class of teachers, they will go to the colleges for four years and then they will come back to the schools, but the Department and the teaching profession do not agree as to what their future course will be.  After all that preparation they will be fit for nothing but school teachers, and they will have to be provided for.  The Dáil, now in Committee, is undertaking this serious matter of providing for the future of these young men.  I think the expenditure that is involved in this Vote will not stop at £50,000 a year.  In view of the fact that the Minister already has a college in Dublin and some other Departments have two colleges in the Gaeltacht which, I understand, are to be placed free of charge, at the disposal of the Department of Education, perhaps it would be useless for me to beseech the Minister before he reaches the wider scheme, not to buy further colleges until this scheme <Col N="992" /> is tested.  He has Marlborough Hall at Glasnevin, which will require no alterations or improvements, and there are two other buildings in Irish-speaking districts which are in the hands of Departments of State, and which can be made available at a comparatively small cost.  Try the scheme there.  I am quite sure the monitorial system is not the best in the world, but I am not quite sure that the scheme proposed by the Minister is going to be the best.  Before all this money is spent I would ask him not to go further&mdash;because it lies with him, even though the Vote is passed&mdash;but to test the three colleges that are available and at his disposal.  I am very much afraid of these new schemes&mdash;(Deputies: &ldquo;The Shannon scheme&rdquo;)&mdash;and the Vote that we are now discussing does not lessen my fear.  We have three Preparatory Colleges and before students enter them £1,000 has to be spent, not to provide maps or books or ordinary educational appliances, but for the cropping of lands attached to certain of the proposed Preparatory College buildings.  The Minister has not even told us what lands are to be cropped or who is to do the cropping.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether it is possible for Deputy O'Mara to mislead any other Deputy in the House.  Some things that he said, of course, are quite easily explained. I am quite sure that if Deputy O'Mara were here during the debate on compulsory education he would not make some of the mistakes he did. I am not referring to the Preparatory Colleges, but to the necessity of an increased number of teachers.  When the compulsory Bill was debated here, on one amendment especially, that fact was pointed out specially from this side of the House and minimised perhaps by Deputy O'Connell.  I confess that I did not follow some of the things Deputy O'Mara said.  It may be my newness to the Department.  But I really could not make out what he meant.  He spoke of putting teachers in place of monitors.</P>

      <P>Early in this debate Deputy Gorey asked that he should not be driven to make a choice as between Irish and English.  Certainly no Deputy wants to be driven to make any such choice.  We all appreciate very much his attitude on the matter, but unfortunately the Minister finds himself in the position from time to time in which he must make a choice, just as anybody placed in an executive position finds himself.  In fairness to the Minister and his responsibility, and in order that there may be a proper understanding of the <Col N="994" /> situation, there are some matters I should like to mention with regard to the Irish-speaking districts.  Any Deputy here speaking for his own constituency would feel that his constituents had a very great grievance if he could say that ten per cent. of the teachers in his area were entirely inefficient on general educational grounds, and that, say, 70 per cent. of them were unable to teach through the language spoken by his constituents. There are districts in the country where the people find themselves in that position, and the Minister, as soon as he has time to look around and see what the conditions are, will find himself in the position of having to provide for districts like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one part of the country in which there are 164,000 people living&mdash; in round numbers, one-twentieth of the entire population.  The language of 89 per cent. of those people is Irish, and in that district there are 32,000 children of school-going age whose language is Irish and 4,000 children whose language is English.  The Minister will find that in that district there are 867 teachers, and that 8.9 of these are departmentally reported as inefficient&mdash; that is on general educational grounds. He will find that 13.7 of them know nothing of the Irish language.  He will find that 35.8 of them cannot teach through Irish, and, while the positive statement is not made that the remaining 64.2 of them cannot teach through Irish, he will probably find that thirty per cent. of them have not anything like the command of the native vernacular of this district that the average national school teacher in the English-speaking part of the Saorstát has of English.  He will find that there is another district in which there are 306,000 people living&mdash;an additional one-tenth of our population&mdash;in which 37.5 of the whole population are Irish-speaking. He will find that there are about 25,000 children of school-going age who are Irish speakers, and 42,000 children who are English speakers.  He will find that 10.2 of the teachers there are inefficient from the point of view of general educational qualifications; that 42.2 of them know nothing of the second language of the district&mdash;that <Col N="995" /> is, know nothing of the language spoken by 25,000 children.  He will find that 70.5 of the teachers cannot teach through the language that is the language of 25,000 children, and that of the 29.5 per cent. who are certified to be able to teach something through Irish, perhaps even 10 per cent. have nothing like the command of Irish as a vernacular that the average teacher has of the English language in the English-speaking districts in Ireland.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is to do justice to the remnant of our Irish-speaking population&mdash;a population provided with primary education only with these very serious drawbacks in teaching power and having no higher education in their own language&mdash;he will probably find himself driven into the position of saying that out of the 2,492 teachers in these areas something like 800 may have to be regarded as people who, in an Irish-speaking district, cannot be regarded as qualified to impart primary education.  The Irish-speaking population is deprived of all education, except primary education under the disabilities I have mentioned.  Those people living on the western seaboard are more dependent on education as a means of livelihood than the people in the greater portion, at any rate, of the English-speaking parts of the country. In order to do justice to those people, the Minister must take steps to look after their very long-neglected education, and within a few years he may have to find 800 teachers capable of imparting primary education through Irish to our Irish-speaking population.</P>
    <P>I mention these facts in order that Deputies who realise that additional educational facilities are required in their own constituency will also realise that there are other parts of the country that can be regarded as having practically no educational facilities at all, and that, as a consequence, the Minister, in selecting candidates for the new preparatory college for teachers, will have to take a very large number of people whose vernacular is Irish&mdash;if, as a result of the very poor facilities for education available in the Irish-speaking districts, he can find children there <Col N="996" /> whose education is such that he can take them right away into those preparatory colleges.  There is a very peculiar problem before the Minister in providing teachers who have a vernacular knowledge of the language, and it is very urgent that the setting up of these colleges should be gone on with at once. It is also very urgent that in taking in the first batch of pupils to train as teachers he should realise the conditions that he is faced with in the Irish-speaking districts.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the Minister has not given us a little more information as to the position of the boys and girls who are to go into these colleges. I regret that he has not dealt with the fundamental question from an educational standpoint that Deputy O'Connell raised, as to assuming that boys and girls of from 13 to 15 years of age can be chosen for the teaching profession, trained more or less in a groove and unable to get the contacts which would be desirable for one who is to become a teacher, that is, contacts with other elements of the public life and the consequent broadening views. The question is the age at which specialisation should begin in education. I think the Minister should tell us whether he is satisfied that the age of from 13 to 14 is the appropriate age at which boys or girls must choose their future career.  I am inclined to think it is too young.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that I should like to know what is the scheme regarding the entrance to those Colleges.  We learn that the entrance is to be by open competitive examination.  I take it there is implied in that some kind of scholarship and that those who succeed would have two, three or four years' training and, although it is not definitely implied, maintenance during that period. Possibly that is advantageous; but are we to expect that every boy or girls who succeeds in this examination and enters a college is, by that fact, to become a teacher, or is it to be that those who succeed in the examination and go through two or three years' training in the college may then decide that teaching <Col N="997" /> is not their vocation and they will choose another profession, having had the advantage of the college training? If that is the position, then I am prepared to swallow a good deal, and I would like the system to be extended very considerably.</P>
    <P>I think we are entitled to a little information on the general proposal beyond what is given here.  I rose mainly to invite the Minister to give the views of his Department regarding the desirability of taking boys and girls from the age of thirteen years into those colleges on the assumption that, having entered the college, they are to become teachers, and that, at that age, they are in a position to choose their future careers.  I am inclined to think that the age is too early, and it would be better to have a general training for an additional year or two before entering on specialised instruction.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to think that the picture Deputy Mulcahy painted of conditions in certain districts in Ireland was somewhat on the gloomy side.

      <P>We have heard them for the first time.  We have no means of checking them or examining them.  We have the Deputy's statement that they were carefully compiled and I have no doubt whatsoever on that point.  If so few of the teachers, even in the Irish-speaking districts, are able to deal fully and completely with Irish, then there is no case for making Irish compulsory in the schools until we have <Col N="998" /> our new teachers.  I do not accept that position.  The proportion of teachers shown by the Department's own figures, as presented to another Commission of which the Deputy is also a member, indicates that a much larger percentage of the teachers than is shown by the Deputy's figures is in a position to deal with the present Irish programme.  It appeared as if there was some implication in the Deputy's statement; I do not say that it was intentional, but undoubtedly it will be gathered from what he said that in some way or other it was the fault of the teachers.  Those teachers were trained; they qualified and were certified as having all the necessary qualifications for their positions.</P>

      <P>Perhaps we had better leave it at that for the moment. If that is the position, then one of the conclusions that is being come to by another Commission will have to be radically altered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was referring to the condition of affairs we had up to 1922-23, whereby it was possible for a teacher to leave a training college and be fully qualified, <Col N="999" /> according to the regulations then existing, without knowing any Irish.  The teachers were not responsible for that. The programme was set out for them. It was the policy of the Government and the Department at the time.  If it were necessary for teachers to get certificates, they did so at their own expense; a very large number of them did get certificates.  Although the Department did not make Irish compulsory in the training college at the time, they did insist, for a number of years before this Government came into existence, that teachers could not get employment in what were scheduled as Irish-speaking districts unless they had a certificate in Irish.  In view of that, I cannot understand Deputy Mulcahy's representation of the state of affairs that exists.  I accept his figures, because I know they have been compiled with great care.</P>
    <P>I would like to explain one point, lest there might be a wrong impression created.  The Deputy spoke of eight per cent. or ten per cent. of teachers being reported as inefficient.  There is no Departmental report in which a teacher is described as inefficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Non-efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'CONNELL Mr. T. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>No report refers to a non-efficient teacher; it should be &ldquo;not efficient.&rdquo;  It is a technicality, and I want to point out the foolishness of it.  It has led to misapprehensions before this.  Three reports are given by inspectors&mdash;highly efficient, efficient, and not efficient.  &ldquo;Not efficient&rdquo; has been declared to be a different thing to &ldquo;inefficient.&rdquo;  It is a technical term which means that a teacher does not qualify in a particular year for his increment. We had a case in which nine subjects were examined.  A great proportion of the subjects were marked &ldquo;highly efficient.&rdquo;  One subject did not get the attention the Inspector thought it should get and the teacher was marked &ldquo;not efficient.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be supposed from Deputy Mulcahy's statement that ten per cent. of the teachers were inefficient.  There should be no inefficient teacher in the service; I do not think there is.  A small percentage of teachers may be reported as having neglected one or <Col N="1000" /> two subjects; their pupils, perhaps, did not come up to the standard in one or two subjects and those teachers are not recommended for increment.  It is recognised by the officers of the Department that &ldquo;not efficient&rdquo; is a different thing from &ldquo;inefficient.&rdquo;  I raised this point more than once before with the Department and I pointed to the misapprehension that arose.  Not unnaturally managers might take it to mean that a teacher is inefficient and the time had come to get rid of the man. In reality it could be shown that &ldquo;not efficient&rdquo; referred to a small technical matter the inspector had reported.  I want to make that clear lest the statement that eight or ten per cent. are inefficient would lead to a misapprehension. It would be quite a natural misapprehension, I admit.</P>
    <P>Going back to the question of the scheme of preparatory colleges, the Minister referred to a Departmental Committee and said he hoped to give an opportunity to other bodies to place their views before this Committee.  The Committee appointed is not a Departmental Committee in the accepted sense of the word.  It is composed entirely from within the Department.  Possibly that is strictly Departmental, but we sometimes think of Departmental Committees as bodies including people outside the Department whose duty it would be to examine particular questions.  I believe the people composing this Committee are entirely under the Minister for Education.  They have been examining this matter for over twelve months and up to the present they have not given anybody else an opportunity of putting forward views.  They have not invited the views of the teaching body.  Before bringing this scheme of preparatory colleges before the Dáil they should have got the views of outside bodies.  As far as I know this scheme has been put up by the Departmental Committee I have referred to. That is my impression, and if I am wrong, the Minister will correct me. Those who naturally claim a privilege to express their views on this matter have not had any opportunity of doing so, up to the present in any case.</P>
    <P>I understand that the whole question of the training of teachers is under consideration <Col N="1001" /> by this Committee.  I think it would have been better if the Committee were enlarged and if representatives of other bodies interested would, at least, get an early opportunity of putting their views before that Committee. I see Deputy O'Mara still in his place, and I think we are all glad of his new-found zeal for economy of the right kind.  I would like to enlarge upon what the Minister said about monitors, because that mistake crept into the leading articles of the &ldquo;Independent,&rdquo; and, I think, the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; of to-day.  I do not know whether Deputy O'Mara took his information from these sources or not, but I would advise him in future to make more sure of his facts before he ventures on suggestions of this kind.  A monitor is not a teacher, although both morning papers and Deputy O'Mara assume that he is, and that if you do away with monitors you must pay qualified teachers to do their work. The fact is that where a monitor is engaged the teacher has to spend a good portion of his time in looking after his training.  If the monitor engages in teaching, he does so only under the supervision of the teacher.</P>

I do not see how I could have made an impression on any Deputy's mind that I was criticising individual teachers or a body of teachers.  I made it my business recently to know a good deal of their work and of the conditions of their work.  I know very well that they are the products of the training colleges, and it is because I feel that the present products of the training colleges are being subject to the same disabilities and being turned out in, perhaps, the same wrong way as the former generation of teachers that I urge a change in the method of training at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>It was pure inadvertence that I forgot to deal with the point raised, first by Deputy O'Connell, afterwards by Deputy Johnson, and now by Deputy Dr. MacNeill.  I admit that there will be certain disadvantages. I do not think that in any scheme which could be put forward there will not be disadvantages to a certain extent, but I think, on the whole, that in this case the advantages greatly outweigh the disadvantages.  If you take the class of students upon whom we will have to draw they would, from our point of view, be much worse if they did not get this education.  From their own point of view, they would be in a much worse position if they did not attend these institutions.  There will be nothing narrow in the education there. It will be along certain lines of <Col N="1003" /> secondary education&mdash;not perhaps in subjects like Latin and Greek, but otherwise it will not be a narrow education. It will be much wider, in fact, than the education they are receiving at present, and they will have opportunities which otherwise they would not have, to counteract any narrowing there might otherwise be.</P>
      <P>You will have a number of them living together in college, and that in itself will do more to counteract any narrowing effect than any other scheme of specialisation which might be devised.  Admission will be, as I have said, by competitive examination. The bulk of the students will not have to pay.  A number of them will have to pay if they can afford it.  That is the idea at present.  We must have an undertaking from them that they are going to take up teaching as a profession. We could not give them education and then let them have a free hand.  In this particular matter we are not introducing a revolutionary proposal.  We require a somewhat similar undertaking from monitors at present.  In reality they will serve an apprenticeship to the State in this particular profession.  I think it is an advantage to get people, who otherwise would be neglected to a large extent and who would not have an opportunity of going to secondary colleges, to live in a preparatory training college.</P>

I doubt whether the material which we are getting at present is, on an average, up to the standard you would expect from a person who has done the first year's course in a university.

We are called upon the day following the receipt of the White Paper to pass an estimate for £1,000.  It appears on this list as an estimate of £1,000 for preparatory training colleges.  I take it that if we approve of that estimate of £1,000 we practically bind the House and the country to this scheme which, the White Paper informs us in the second last paragraph, costs the country £150,000, for the erection of these colleges, and the cost under this head for the financial years 1926 and 1927 is estimated at £59,000.  We are asked to approve of a scheme of that magnitude on an estimate of £1,000 contained in the White Paper received only yesterday. With all respect to the Ministry, I do not think that that is quite fair. It is a proceeding to which we have objected time after time&mdash;rushing schemes of this magnitude on such short notice.  I hope at the beginning of the work of the new Minister for Education that we will not have a similar complaint of that character to make in connection with his Department in the future.  I protest on behalf of the House that it is unfair to bind us to a scheme of that magnitude. That is my first protest.  My second protest is one which I have made here on previous occasions.  Up to a comparatively short time ago education in this country was dealt with departmentally. We had technical education under one Department, and primary education under another Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A scheme was introduced whereby these different Departments were <Col N="1005" /> unified and brought under the one head.  That scheme met with approval from all parts of the House.  I am sorry to see, in the proposals under consideration, that while we have the principle of unification of the different departments of education embodied under one Minister, we still have the different proposals considered departmentally. I want that scheme of education to deal with primary education, to deal with secondary education, to deal with technical education, and to deal with university education, and I want the different parts to be considered as parts of a whole scheme. That, I think, is a proposal that has met with a certain amount of approval from the different parties here.</P>
    <P>What is the effect of what we are proposing to do?  We are considering one department of education.  We have been doing that for the last week in connection with the School Attendance Bill.  We have been considering one department of education quite irrespective of its connection with the other departments.  In other words, we are still adhering to the system of considering education in what one might call water-tight compartments instead of as part of a general scheme.  That, I think, is very unfortunate.  It has been brought out to-day by different Deputies.  One Deputy after another wanted to know why no opportunity was given to those becoming teachers in national schools to acquire a university education.  And let me say that I know of nothing more desirable for national school teachers than that they should have a university education whenever possible.  It would be a most desirable thing.  I would like to see university training and university education brought more closely into touch not alone with national teachers but with many of our industries.  Our industries to-day are languishing.  If we had in them men more highly trained&mdash;I speak of masters just as much as of workmen; the fault is to be found just as much amongst one as amongst the other&mdash;and more highly educated, these industries would not be in their present condition.  Therefore I would urge on the House and on the Ministry of Education that this subject <Col N="1006" /> of education ought to be considered as a whole and not as a part.</P>
    <P>Doubt has been expressed as to whether it is advisable to ask a boy or a girl between the ages of thirteen and fifteen to make up their minds as to their future career.  That is a proposal set out in the first paragraph of the scheme that we are asked to approve of.  I think a proposal that would ask a boy or a girl to make up his or her mind as to what career he or she would follow at that stage is a very unfortunate one.  I am strongly opposed to ask a boy or a girl in any department of life, or to ask the parents, to make up their minds as to a career before the child is sixteen.  In very few cases do we know sufficiently the aptitudes of a boy or a girl before the age of sixteen to say what is the wisest course for them to follow.  Therefore, from that point of view, I am entirely opposed to the proposals contained in the first paragraph.</P>
    <P>There are many other points that I would like to discuss, but I do not want to take up the time of the House in dealing with them, and they have already been dealt with to some extent by other Deputies.  But I had occasion in November last to draw attention to what I thought was an unfortunate feature in connection with teaching in our national schools.  I pointed out that it was laid down in the curriculum for these schools, as outlined in the programme of the National Conference, which supplies the curriculum that is to be followed, that in the infant's division instruction was only to be carried out through the medium of Irish.  That was news to many Deputies, and it was news to many citizens.  It was agreed that it was not altogether a desirable method and that it should and would be altered.  I have made inquiries in the last few days as to whether any new instruction on the question of curriculum had been issued to managers and teachers, and I was informed that none has been issued&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong &mdash;so that the curriculum to-day in the infants' division of our national schools requires that these infants should be taught through the medium of Irish only.  What is the effect of that?  I do <Col N="1007" /> not want to stress the point unduly, but it has been pointed out by Deputies on different benches that one of the reasons why we are unable to meet that world-wide and keen competition that we have to face in Great Britain, the market to which practically all our exports go, was owing to the low standard of education of our workers in comparison with the standard of the workers in the countries which are competing with us in this market.  I hope that the Minister will bear this in mind.  It is an important matter from the point of view of commerce.  It has been pointed out that a higher technical skill, which can only be based on a higher standard of primary education, was also an essential quality if we were to hold these markets.</P>
    <P>These are very important matters. We commercial men look on them as factors of the greatest importance to the life of the nation.  Looking at these factors and viewing in conjunction with them the instruction that these children are to be taught only through the medium of Irish, are we not putting too big a burden on our boys and girls? I cannot see that this burden will be lightened in any way by this White Paper.  I find in it that five of the training colleges are to be in Irish-speaking districts.  We know the influences that such districts will have on the teachers and we can gather from the placing of five colleges in these districts what the views of the students in these colleges will be likely to be in regard to Irish.  If you take in conjunction with that the first paragraph on page 2 you will see that it points out that one of the possible successes of placing these colleges there will be that &ldquo;The teaching staffs of these colleges will be persons with high qualifications who are competent to teach the secondary school programme up to the standard of the leaving certificate, and who are&rdquo;&mdash;and this is the important point &mdash;&ldquo;in addition, fluent speakers of Irish and able to give instruction entirely through the medium of Irish in the subjects of the curriculum to be taught by them.&rdquo;  That means that the teaching of Irish is still to occupy a very important position and that the language is to occupy a large amount of the time <Col N="1008" /> of these students.  I urge, in view of the importance of a higher standard of primary education amongst the workers and of a higher standard of technical education amongst them, whether we are not expecting too much of these children in asking that they should also be experts in a knowledge of Irish.  I am afraid that in asking so much from our boys and girls of the future that we are looking for too much.  The result will be a failure in a knowledge of one language or the other.  If there is a failure in the standard of the English language that will be followed, I take it, by a lower standard of technical training, because, as I pointed out on a previous occasion, no provision whatever is made in the technical schools, so far as I know, for the teaching of technical subjects through the medium of Irish.  Provision is made in the technical schools for the teaching of the Irish language, but there is no provision for the teaching of technical subjects through the medium of Irish, so that it is obvious, if we are expecting our boys and girls of the future to possess these particular qualifications, then we are asking too much, and the result will be disappointment.  Before that happens I would like to see this whole question considered carefully and thoroughly.  I am afraid that consideration cannot be given to this proposal in view of the shortness of the time that it has been in our hands.  If possible I should like that this Estimate, which binds us to this proposal, should be deferred in order that a scheme of this importance should have greater consideration than it has had up to the present.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with Deputy Good to some extent in his appreciation of the difficulties placed in the way of infants learning Irish.  He told us that this will impose a serious hardship on them&mdash;to ask them to bear the burden of learning Irish.  The Deputy seems to forget that this is an endeavour to lighten the burden of teaching them Irish when they are young&mdash;of teaching them two languages when they are young.  He tells us at the same time that it is because of our inefficiency that we are losing trade and not keeping a grip on <Col N="1009" /> the markets.  Yet when it is proposed to improve our education by having two languages taught to the children of the country at a time when it is easy for them to study them, the Minister is to be thwarted in his proposal. The Deputy also told us that there is no provision made at the present time for the teaching of technical subjects through Irish.  How, I ask, are you going to proceed to teach technical subjects through the medium of Irish until you first prepare teachers who will be able to teach technical subjects through the medium of Irish?  That is what the training colleges proposed to be set up will aim at&mdash;to turn out teachers with such a knowledge of the Irish language that they will be able to teach technical subjects through the medium of Irish.  When the Minister proposes to put into Irish-speaking districts where Irish is a living language, where it expresses every function of the life of the people and where it can be easily applied to every activity in the life of the people, boys and girls to be trained as teachers amid natural surroundings so that they may be able afterwards to bring back the qualifications required in order to teach people in other parts of the country, it is suggested that we must reconsider that, that we must postpone it, and must not go ahead with it.</P>

      <P>The boys and girls educated in these colleges will teach those who will afterwards become technical teachers.  You must make a start somewhere.  When the Minister proposes to start in an Irish-speaking district, I suggest that he is starting in the right quarter.  If we are to postpone this because, as Deputy Good suggests, our trade or our education will be seriously affected, I ask him to explain how it is that our trade is at present so much depreciated, even though we understand English so thoroughly.  The arguments of Deputy Good are retrogressive and reactionary and the Minister's endeavour in this <Col N="1010" /> matter ought to be expedited and helped by the House.</P>

      <P>I feel as innocent as if I had come out of the baptismal font, as if I had got my baptism from Deputy Good.  I got the inevitable lecture from him pointing out to me the evil path.  Does the Deputy suggest that we should do nothing until we can have a unified scheme of education embracing primary, secondary, technical and university?  Does he think for a moment that it is practical politics at any time to equate a primary system, which essentially is almost a State-aided system, and a secondary system which for many reasons is mostly a private system? Does he think that he can so lightly equate the two and bring them into the one system?  There are many difficulties in the way of doing that that, possibly, he is not aware of.  In the case of primary education, as we understand it, it involves a system of secondary education for the teachers until we are ready with a universal system that will link both up and bring them into one system.  The universities, remember, are rather jealous of their independence.  They will not be very keen to be brought under State control.  Does the Deputy want to abolish the present University of Dublin and bring it under State control? The Deputy entered into a rather elaborate argument which, I think, was rather beyond the bounds of the discussion prescribed earlier in the evening by the Ceann Comhairle.  I gathered from his speech that we were entering into a discussion on education in general.  That was the impression left on me, and I do not propose to follow him out of bounds in that particular way.  But even if what the Deputy said was relevant, what was it to prove?  The very alarming conclusion that Irish was to have an important place in the education of this country in the future.  He was afraid that would be the result.  The Deputy need not have gone into an elaborate argument if that was what he wanted to prove.  He could have got it by asking a plain question.  The inevitable answer would be &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and that, in <Col N="1011" /> his own words, it will have a very important part in the education of this country in the future.  Deputy Hogan understood Deputy Good's objection to the scheme.  His objection to it is, and there was no disguise about it, that Irish was occupying too important a place in the educational system of this country.  Deputy Good made one other remark with which I would like to deal.  He is afraid that a knowledge of Irish will mean a weakness in English. I do not think anything of the kind. My experience has been in the opposite direction.  It is well known that even in some of the bigger schools in Dublin children who up to 9 or 10 years of age knew no English whatever left them with a thoroughly good knowledge of English, so from that point of view the Deputy need not be uneasy about the fate of the commercial language with which we are bound up.</P>

      <P>It is well known to Deputies and I think the wish was general that those Christian Brothers who have been doing primary education work up to the present should be recognised by the State.  On that particular matter there is no disagreement, I understand, from any part of the House.  On a previous occasion fault was found for a certain amount of delay that had taken place and expressions of opinion on the matter came from Deputy O'Connell and other members of the House.  In June, 1924, after certain preliminary inquiries had been made, applications were put up by us to the Department of Finance.  That was because financial considerations were involved.  As I said at the beginning, the yearly cost will probably be about £75,000 per annum.  The Ministry of Finance agreed with our proposal on the understanding that the schools were ready to conform to such requirements as were laid down and as are necessary for getting State aid under the primary education system. There should be, first of all, a suitable <Col N="1012" /> agreement on the question of the managership.  Then the school buildings should be sufficient and provision should also be made that no ill effect was to follow, from the recognition of the Christian Brothers, as regards a neighbouring national school that was already in existence.  Then we were to be satisfied as to the transition arrangements by inspectors from our Department: that the teaching in the school and the staff of the school was of sufficient standard to justify the recognition of the school as a primary school.  These were the main transitional arrangements come to.  For the present the payment of the Christian Brothers will be on the basis of capitation, just as is done at present, for instance, in the case of monastery schools. I think there are about 67 schools altogether for which recognition is sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'CONNELL Mr. T. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose that in a matter of history, above all things, I should not venture to correct the Minister.  But I think he will find that the statement made in the early portion of his speech&mdash;that the Christian Brothers are now, for the first time, coming under the National system&mdash;is not correct.  I think he will find that the Christian Brothers were under the National system for a few years after it was established&mdash;from 1831 until about 1836.  The Minister will find, too&mdash;as Deputy Johnson reminds me&mdash;that there was only a passing reference made to this matter in the House in one debate on education.  There was not the stress laid upon it that the Minister seems to think.  It was only referred to in one debate incidentally.  But I think it was generally recognised that under an Irish Government the Christian Brothers would come under the Irish system of education.  They are a body that has done great work during the past 80 or 90 years for education in Ireland, at no expense to the State. That is pretty generally recognised, and I desire to pay them that tribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not dwell to any great extent on the conditions on which the Christian Brothers were coming in. He has made clear, however, that they are coming in on what is known as the &ldquo;capitation system.&rdquo;  I want to enter my objection to the capitation system. <Col N="1013" /> Deputies know that the vast majority of the teachers are paid what is known as a personal salary.  Each teacher has a certain qualification, and he is graded and paid a personal salary by the State. That is so in the case of about 12,000 of the teachers engaged in the national schools.  There are some schools, conducted by communities of nuns, which are under the Department at present and which are paid on the capitation system.  That implies that instead of the person who is teaching being required to have a standard qualification, and being paid a personal salary, the community is paid, as a whole, per head of the pupils on the actual average attendance. That has many disadvantages, and I do not know what its advantages are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it could be called that.  The position was up to some years ago&mdash;to a large extent it is so up to the present &mdash;that so long as a person was a member of a religious community she might engage in the work of teaching.  That is the only qualification required. Within the last twelve months or so there is, I understand, a qualification in Irish required.  Before that, no qualification was required.  So far as the other subjects are concerned, no qualification&mdash;I stand again to be corrected if I am wrong&mdash;is yet required, except that the person teaching be a member of the religious community.  I think that whether a person is a member of a religious community or not, he or she ought to have the specified standard qualification before being allowed to engage in the work of teaching.  I do not know any other profession in which a person would be allowed to engage merely because of membership of a religious community.  I do not think that would be allowed, for instance, by the Local Government Department in the case of nurses.  I am not sure of that, but I do not think religious would be permitted to act as nurses except they were qualified as nurses.  However, there were a certain number of those schools in operation when this Government took over.  I should have hoped that the tendency would be against these <Col N="1014" /> capitation schools when new schools were being taken on.</P>
      <P>There are quite a number of nuns who are fully qualified and fully trained teachers.  They have their personal certificates and are paid personal salaries.  Some of the religious teaching Orders make it a condition that all the sisters in their schools be trained teachers and have their certificates, same as lay teachers.  I should have hoped that that would be encouraged. Again, there are quite a number of monastery schools under the Department. There are other teaching Orders of Brothers working under the Department. There are De la Salle Brothers and Patrician Brothers and one or two other Orders, and in all these schools the Brothers are qualified teachers and are paid personal salaries.  There are only two monastery schools in Ireland &mdash;one in Cork&mdash;paid on the capitation system.  That is why I enter my objection to the taking over and paying of new schools on this capitation system, which does not ensure that the teachers engaged in the schools are qualified and certified teachers.  If I am assured that every person engaged in the schools will be a fully qualified and certified teacher, whether he be a member of a religious body or not&mdash; and it is quite possible for that to be done&mdash;my objection will disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a practice in some of the capitation schools at present that I would not like to see carried into those new schools.  The community must have a certain number of teachers on the staff, but, outside those, they can take in anybody they like to work in the schools, whether qualified or not, and pay them out of their own resources. In an ordinary national school, if the principal teacher feels that he would require more help and that it would be worth his while to take in some young man and pay him out of his own pocket, he is not allowed to do so.  And quite rightly! There is a certain number of teachers apportioned to a certain number of children, and it is insisted upon that every person engaged in the school shall have certain definite qualifications. But in a capitation school conducted by a religious community, two <Col N="1015" /> or three or four persons, who are called &ldquo;supernumeraries,&rdquo; may be engaged as teachers and paid out of the resources of the community.  The State has no knowledge of those people.  I do not think that it is right that that system should be allowed.  It is very often a means of leading people into blind-alley occupations.  It ought to be looked upon as a general principle that teaching is a skilled profession and that anybody who engages in the work of teaching should have certain definite, specified qualifications.</P>
    <P>There is another difficulty which arises from the fact that these schools are to be capitation schools.  In a school paid by capitation the lay teachers are not supposed to be teachers in the strict sense, and they are not pensionable.  A lay teacher who works in a convent school is not eligible for a pension, although she is doing exactly the same work as she would do in the ordinary national school.  That is the position at the present time.  I never could understand the reason.  We have not been able to induce the Minister for Finance to right that difficulty.  I am anxious to know what will be the position of the considerable number of lay teachers at present engaged in the Christian Brothers' schools when these schools are taken over.  Will they be in the position in which lay teachers are in the convent schools?  The Minister has not told us what the position will be, but I fear, since these are to be capitation schools, that the same difficulty will arise as has arisen in the case of the convent schools.  I would like the Minister to tell us what arrangement, if any, has been made with regard to the lay teachers engaged in those schools.  There are two classes of lay teachers engaged in them.  I would like to know whether the two classes are to get the same treatment or what treatment they are to get.  There is the qualified teacher&mdash;the man fully trained.  There is, then, the man who has not the specified qualifications which would make him eligible for appointment in the ordinary school. Many of these men have long service in the Christian Brothers' schools&mdash;<Col N="1016" /> from six to ten years, and perhaps more.  They may have given good service, although they have not the qualifications required by the Department. If these men were giving reasonably efficient service, it would be a great hardship that they should lose their positions when the schools are taken over.  I hope the Minister will consider that matter.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which the Minister did not make quite clear. When these schools are taken into connection, will the children be entitled to attend free, as they attend the national schools I gather that from a remark the Minister made, but it was more or less incidental.  At present, the children attending these schools usually pay a small fee.  Will they have the right without payment of any fee to attend in the future?  Perhaps the Minister would make that clear when replying.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister's argument&mdash;if there is any argument&mdash; in support of the paying of these schools on the capitation system rather than on the personal basis, as teachers in the ordinary national schools are paid and as I hold that every teacher should be paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I did not emphasise strongly enough that, so far as the incidence of the capitation system is concerned, it is a transitional arrangement.  After a few years perhaps the assistants in the schools would have to be qualified, just as the laymen are qualified at present. The Deputy will.  I am sure, recognise the necessity of having some transitional arrangement.  It would be impossible to make requirements of that kind at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason I said that the question in one of its aspects&mdash;the capitation system&mdash; was transitional.  The desire of those who are now coming under this scheme <Col N="1017" /> is that there should not be a personal payment.  We have met the desire of this particular Order that the particular lay members of their Order should not be paid.  At least the payment will be on the capitation system, but the appointment will be on the classification system in future.  That is the arrangement as it is at present.  So far as pensions are concerned, I am afraid they are precisely as Deputy O'Connell has diagnosed.  They will be in the same position&mdash;I am speaking now of trained and qualified teachers&mdash;as the trained and qualified teachers in the convent schools, for instance, at present. Their position will be considered when the position of the junior assistant mistresses and the lay teachers in convent schools is being considered.  I indicated to the Deputy that I hoped after a short time a decision might be reached on that point.  I confess I have not had an opportunity of going into the matter yet with the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>As regards the unqualified teachers with long service, each of these, if it is desired to keep them on the staff of the school, will have to be individually considered and their case put forward.</P>
      <P>As regards another point raised by the Deputy, I do not think in the future, legally, when the Christian Brothers come into this system, that they will have any power to charge any fee to any student attending their schools, that is, the primary schools in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to a point made by Deputy O'Connell in regard to men displaced, I have had representations made to me in respect of young men&mdash;I do not know whether it is right to call them monitors or not&mdash; of an average service of five years. They have been displaced, to enable qualified teachers to be employed in their stead.  I am the last who will argue in favour of retaining monitors or unqualified teachers for teaching purposes, but where there has been an action by the State which inevitably involves the dismissal of young men who have started their career as monitors in Christian Brothers' schools, and they are dismissed, at least their case should be taken into account.  I gather <Col N="1018" /> that these young men have been now walking the streets for about four months, because the Government had intervened and were responsible for their discharge.  So they were informed by the Superior, who added that in the circumstances the Government would probably compensate them.  They got one week's notice.</P>
      <P>A point I want to make further is that, probably quite legally, there was no such thing as unemployment cards for these young men, and consequently they were dismissed with a week's notice and have very little prospects unless they can enter colleges and be trained for some time.  At any rate they have been displaced and they have no unemployment benefit.  I wonder if the Minister has taken that fact into account and if he has made himself aware of the position of probably a considerable number of such men in the country?  If he has not done so, I would beg of him to inquire into the matter and to find out what are the facts in regard to this class of man.</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary Sum not exceeding Ten Pounds be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1926, for expenditure in respect of Public Buildings, for the maintenance of certain Parks and Public Works, for the maintenance of Drainage Works on the River Shannon, for Barrow Drainage and Sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will see that there are two sub-heads, one in respect of new works and the other in respect of expenditure on the Barrow Drainage Scheme.  The expenditure in respect of new works falls under two heads.  First there is an expenditure of £500 required in connection with the Preparatory Colleges. The total estimate shown for the work <Col N="1020" /> is £150,000.  That is an outside figure. It might, quite possibly, be considerably less than that.  To some extent, whether it would be considerably less than that would depend on the possibility of getting over colleges which could be fairly easily adapted.  If in any case colleges had to be built from the ground, it would probably run to double £150,000.  That sum of £150,000 is an estimate which covers not merely buildings but also necessary furnishing of the colleges.  It is, as I say, an outside figure and some lesser expenditure might be anticipated.</P>
    <P>The second item under that sub-head B is the expenditure which will be incurred in connection with the erection of the 1916 Memorial in Glasnevin. £750 is now asked for.  The total expenditure will be £1,050.  Towards that there is an Appropriation-in-Aid available of £550, so that the total net expenditure of the State in connection with the memorial will be a sum of £500.  The memorial is one that was designed and sculptured by a very distinguished Irishwoman, the late Dora Sigerson Shorter.  It was her desire, which was seconded very warmly by the late General Collins and by the late President Griffith, that the memorial should be erected in Dublin.  However, owing to events which intervened, no steps could be taken before Mrs. Shorter's death.  She left by her will a sum of £1,000 for the purpose of providing the actual memorial and for its erection.  As long ago as December, 1923, the Executive Council intimated to Mr. Shorter that they were prepared to accept the offer of the memorial and were prepared to find the site.  It was thought at that time that perhaps the sum provided might be sufficient for its erection.  Until recently, however, no steps were taken in the matter, but it has now been gone into fully, and it has been found possible to carry out the entire work that is necessary to be done here at the sum of £1,050, of which £550 will be available from Mr. Shorter.  The expenditure will really be on the plot; because of the object for which it is desired, the Cemeteries Committee are giving it for a sum of £300.  In the ordinary way the plot would be considerably <Col N="1021" /> more than that.  The Cemeteries Committee will also undertake the perpetual care of the memorial for a sum of £150.  There remains really the cost of erecting the foundation and the canopy for the memorial, which will be about £550.  There will be a sum required for the transfer of the memorial to Dublin. The actual figures are being carved in Italy, the cost being paid out of the bequest left by the late Dora Sigerson. As I say, this matter has been before the Government for a very considerable time.  The discussion of it was begun during the lifetime of the late General Collins and the late President Griffith.</P>
    <P>The Barrow drainage is the remaining sub-head under which expenditure will be incurred.  This is one of the most difficult problems that has come before us.  Deputies are aware that it has a very long history.  The Government some time ago employed Professor Meyer Peter to examine the very imperfect plans that were in existence and to proceed to prepare a scheme.  He reported on 31st March, 1925, and estimated that the total cost of the work would be £1,130,000.  The Government, in examining the matter, felt that one-half of the cost would have to be provided from the Exchequer if the scheme was to be proceeded with at all.  Even so, it is a scheme which could only be justified on the ground that it provided a great deal of employment during this period of depression, when the giving of employment is a consideration of very great importance.  It is a scheme which it is difficult to decide to go on with, and it is necessary that the greatest possible care shall be taken with in its examination.  Professor Meyer Peter only embodied in his report a general design which would have to be worked out in detail by means of surveys on the ground and further examination following those surveys.  The work which Professor Meyer Peter indicated as work remaining to be done was begun in July, 1925, and it is proceeding as far as weather conditions permit.  It cannot be completed for some time.  In addition to the surveys and the flow measurements which are taking place, valuation of land is proceeding with a view to getting an up-to-date and reliable estimate <Col N="1022" /> of the benefits which will accrue from the carrying out of this drainage work.</P>
    <P>As indicating the somewhat sketchy manner in which this whole matter was dealt with in previous times, it may be said that up to the present there have been no measurements of the actual flow of water into the Barrow.  When the Shannon scheme was being examined in the first instance, there were gaugings available taken over a long period of years.  So far as the Barrow is concerned, these details were not available.  They are just being taken now.  Sufficient has not been done to provide firm results, but to some extent they seem likely to modify the estimate of the flow which has hitherto been worked upon.  That estimate was simply based on the catchment area of the river and on rainfall calculations.  The close examination which is being given to the matter may result in a decision to omit certain parts of the work, if they can be omitted without serious damage to the scheme. Because of the expensive nature of the work, it is very necessary to reduce the works in any way possible, if they can be reduced, without doing a great deal of damage.</P>
    <P>One of the things which require very serious consideration is the amount of work which requires to be done below Athy.  In the first schemes that were submitted there was practically no provision for work below Athy.  Later on there was provision for some larger sums, but Professor Meyer Peter attached even greater importance to the work below Athy than those who had been previously dealing with the scheme, and provided, I think, for almost half of the expenditure below Athy.  Some of that expenditure arose out of considerations concerning the preserving of existing facilities for navigation, and, perhaps, improving them very slightly.  At any rate, the matter is being gone on with.</P>
    <P>As the localities concerned and the benefited lands will have to pay half of the cost, it is necessary that we should do everything possible to make the scheme as cheap and economic as possible, that we should have the firmest possible figures as to what the total cost of the scheme would be and should <Col N="1023" /> know as far as possible what is going to be the actual benefit to the land by the scheme as carried out.  The scheme is such a big one that last summer it was decided, after a great deal of consideration, that no work should be undertaken on the river which would oblige us to adopt any particular scheme or tie our hands in deciding what was the best way of dealing with the problem.  The scheme is still in the condition that while we are providing under the Board of Works Estimate for the coming year for a certain sum that may be expended on works on the Barrow, those works will have to be very carefully selected and will be of a preliminary nature.  They must be works that, no matter what shape the scheme afterwards takes and what possible eliminations may be made, will have to be done.</P>
    <P>I feel that there is no scheme which requires greater scrutiny than this.  If it were going to be a profitable scheme that would benefit the lands up to or beyond the extent of the expenditure, it would be easy to go ahead with it. As it is, it is not a scheme which can benefit the lands to the extent of the expenditure as far as anybody can see.  We must take into consideration what effect it will have on the health of the district and on the contentment and industry of the people in the district; and what benefit will accrue from relieving people of the uncertainty that exists as well as from loss. We must take into consideration all the advantages that may accrue from carrying out works of this kind at a time when employment is needed before we can be justified in proceeding with it.</P>
    <P>The view of the Government, after very careful consideration, is that the scheme should be gone on with, but it is absolutely necessary that the work which is now being done should be brought to its conclusion before legislation is brought before the Dáil.  We must have the most complete examination and survey, both from the engineering and land-valuing point of view, that can be carried out before we commit not only the State, but also the <Col N="1024" /> localities concerned and the owners of the benefited lands, to the expenditure and to the charges which will ensue from the expenditure.</P>

      <P>As to the proposed new colleges, the Minister spoke of utilising possible buildings that may be available in some of those districts. I hope that in searching for possible buildings that may exist already, the Minister will not allow himself to be drawn away from the most suitable locations for these buildings and that he will not run the risk of a college being set up in a building that in actual practice will be found not to be suitable for the work of a college. There is also the point that if a building is not quite suitable, if it is an old building, the maintenance may very soon entail an expenditure that will be much greater than the cost of setting up a building in the most suitable location and that will be architecturally suited to the needs of the college.</P>
      <P>As to the 1916 memorial, at first blush I question whether such a memorial should be put up in Glasnevin. If the intention is to set up the memorial in a graveyard, the question arises: Why not in Arbour Hill?  The question of where the memorial should be put is a matter that requires a great deal of consideration, and I should like to know from the Minister if a definite decision as to the particular site has been taken and, if so, on what grounds?</P>

      <P>On this question of the 1916 memorial, I feel that the Ministry ought to take the Dáil into its confidence a little more, even in regard to the design of the memorial itself.  I can quite imagine that a particular bequest should be supplemented for a memorial in Glasnevin, quite apart from its being called the &ldquo;1916 Memorial.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wherever there is money asked for in connection with such a project, I think that at least the proposal itself should be made known to the Dáil.  We may feel when it is all over that it is a memorial entirely unsuitable.  I am not pretending for a moment that the design would not be something most beautiful, and that the judgment of the Ministry in approving of it would not <Col N="1025" /> be quite sound; but this kind of proposal should not be arranged in the dark, and then ask the Dáil to provide the funds, or any of the funds.  I think the drawings, at least, might have been exhibited and we might be let know a little bit of the story that is intended to be perpetuated in stone, or whatever it may be.</P>
    <P>We have knowledge, those of us who read the newspapers, that memorials in other places have created a tremendous amount of trouble for Ministers and others, because large numbers of people have considered them most unsuitable. If we wake up some morning when this memorial is established and find that in the public view it is most unsuitable, we will be all sorry we did not ask for some information as to the character of the memorial.  We learn from the Minister that it is a statue&mdash;what of we do not know&mdash;with a canopy.  That is the utmost information we have on the matter.  I think a little more information might have been given before we are asked to vote the money.</P>

      <P>I had not the advantage of being present when the Minister was making his statement regarding the Barrow drainage.  I understand he has informed the House that half of the entire cost would require to be made up from local sources.  I think the Government should take into consideration the ability of the local people to pay such a large amount as half the cost would involve.  As the Minister must be well aware, at the present time the rates are abnormally high.  In the county I represent it is considered that it will be exceedingly hard to collect the rates.  At the same time, I welcome the statement of the Minister that the problem of the Barrow drainage is about to be tackled in earnest.</P>

      <P>I hope it is being considered seriously this time.  It was a long-standing reproach to the British Government that they allowed vast tracts of land to be flooded and rendered practically useless by reason of the want of a proper system of drainage of the Barrow.  The annual flooding affects not alone the land, but also the health of the people living in the districts alongside the river.  The unfortunate people who are forced to live near the flooded areas are injuriously affected, as are also the inhabitants of the towns through which the Barrow passes.

I understood from the Minister that one thing that will determine them in coming to a conclusion as to whether the work will be started in whole or in part will be the position from the point of view of unemployment in the catchment area.  The Minister used the words &ldquo;if employment is improved,&rdquo; and I was disposed to conclude from his language that the decision in regard to the work would depend on whatever unemployment existed in the area.</P>

The people in the counties of Leix, Offaly and Kildare&mdash;Deputy Conlan is very much alarmed in regard to the position in Kildare&mdash;have made the claim for years that if this work is to be carried out, and portion of the charge is to be put on a certain area, that charge should be placed on the people living in the catchment area and not on the people in the three counties, large portions of which would not benefit to any extent as a result of this drainage.</P>

How long will it take to carry out the work?  I dare-say it is somewhat unfair to ask how long it will take to carry out the work. I think the Minister has stated that all the reports in connection with the valuations and surveys have not been received.  The Minister should have some idea as to the number of unemployed likely to be absorbed during the coming financial year, if it is decided to proceed with the work.

Accordingly, I availed of the opportunity afforded by the recess to see the draftsman in connection with the measure.  I have had to-day from him an intimation that the Bill, as it is drawn, would require something like 14 amendments.  I think the Dáil should be made aware of the fact.  In the circumstances, I do not think I would be overstepping my own duty if I ask you, a Chinn Comhairle, for your view on the matter.  It would not be possible for me to put the amendments before the House now, and it would be undesirable that the Bill as it is drawn should pass the Report Stage and go through the Dáil in its existing form.</P>

      <P>In view of the difficulty that seems to have arisen regarding the construction of the sections in the Bill that came from the Committee, and the meaning of certain amendments proposed, I am very strongly of opinion that, apart altogether from the purposes desired to be achieved, we should take some steps to see that the Bill, as it would leave the House, would be a properly constructed Bill.  I have only had an opportunity of glancing at the amendments suggested by the draftsman. The amendments suggested are amendments which, while preserving what is in the Bill, present it in the proper form, without in any way effecting a change in the purpose of the Bill as it appears at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to have some time to consider what the best course would <Col N="1030" /> be.  It would be difficult to proceed now with the Bill, take 14 amendments to it and make it something completely different in form.  Perhaps it might be better to withdraw the Bill and introduce a new Bill, but then there is the point of view of the promoter.  That would mean that unless he got agreement on the matter he would have to run the whole course of the five stages in the Dáil again.</P>
    <P>The suggestion I would like to make now is that the Order for the Report Stage for to-day should be discharged. In the interval I will look into the matter, and at the meeting of the Committee on Procedure to-morrow I may make a suggestion as to what might be done, because the object is not to defeat or alter the Bill in a particular way but to see that it will be in proper form when passed.  I think that we ought not proceed with it now in view of the circumstances, and I would like to have until to-morrow, seeing that I only heard of this this afternoon, to suggest a course and consult with the Committee on Procedure. Deputy Hennessy would also be consulted.</P>

I am agreeable to the suggestion that has been put forward, but I would like to say that if the Opposition are prepared to take the new Bill, as introduced, at the Fourth Stage, it would spare a lot of time and would obviate going over the same ground again.  I do not see what is to be gained by going over the whole ground again.  I suppose the result would be the same.</P>

      <P>So far as I can speak for the Opposition, I may say that I accept Deputy Dr. Hennessy's proposal that he should not be prejudiced by the withdrawal of the Bill and the introduction of a new Bill, and that Deputy Nagle, Deputy Johnson, and other Deputies who have put down amendments, should be allowed to move them as if they had reached the same stage.  I think it is only fair to Deputy <Col N="1031" /> Dr. Hennessy to show that we recognise that he has facilitated the Dáil by allowing the new Bill to reach the same stage as the present Bill had reached. I moved various amendments in Committee, but I was beaten, and I do not want to move them again.  I will take my beating.  I suggest to Deputy Johnson, in the interests of all parties and in order to get a workable measure, even though it is not that which the Deputy desires, that he might give an undertaking to Deputy Dr. Hennessy in that regard.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Dr. Hennessy thinks that he has a grievance against the Government I may say that I do not appreciate his point of view in that respect.  Regulations are laid down in regard to Private Bill procedure and I presume that the Deputy went through them.  We have done a generous act in preventing him putting on the Statute Book a measure which would be a discredit to the Dáil. Our action is unusual, but it is in the best interests of the House, and I do not apologise for it.  I was satisfied, having canvassed other views, that the measure, as before us, was a measure which would discredit the Dáil.  I am sure that Deputy Dr. Hennessy did not intend that.  This action is not taken by reason of my opposition to the measure.  If I were, in fact, to have regard to my own opposition I would let it go and not bother.</P>

      <P>I know that the President has acted in the best of good faith, but my contention is that the parliamentary draftsman should have been put at the disposal of the Special Committee when the Bill was before it.  I think it is only due to the draftsmen who prepared this Bill for the small traders to say that they still hold that it is good law.  However, when the parliamentary draftsman <Col N="1032" /> thinks differently, I think it is wiser to let it go, but I think that some people's reputations are at stake.</P>

      <P>I have not had an opportunity of considering the amendments.  I think a word should be said for draftsmen in general. The Bill, as originally introduced, may have been quite properly drafted and there may be a great deal of honour due to the original draftsman, but it is a very different Bill now.  If there is any defect in its present form I think there are a great many guilty parties. It is not easy, I fear, to put the parliamentary draftsman at the disposal of a Committee.  He is a very overworked person.  For my own part, I think that when a Bill, which has been introduced by a private Deputy, has succeeded in passing Second Reading it would be good procedure for the responsible Executive Government to submit the Bill to their advisers, from the point of view of form and general law, in order to ensure that if it became law it would become law in proper form.  That, I hope, will be the procedure adopted in future.  Deputy Hewat asks whether such a procedure as that which Deputy Hennessy suggests could be adopted.  Deputies could promise that they would, or would not, do a particular thing when certain circumstances arose, but no Deputy could bind another not to move an amendment when he had the right to do so. I would like to have an opportunity of considering the matter and consulting with the Committee on Procedure to-morrow. If we discharge the Order and put it down for next Wednesday we might by that time be able to make up our minds and produce something which will be satisfactory.</P>

    <Title>BANKING COMMISSION. - MOTION BY DEPUTY HEFFERNAN (RESUMED).</Title>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil is of opinion that agricultural interests in the Saorstát should have been given direct representation on the Banking Commission and that the terms of reference should have specifically provided for an examination of the agricultural credit problems of the Saorstát.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion seeks to increase the membership of the Banking Commission so as to include a member <Col N="1034" /> who, while having a knowledge of banking, will also be conversant with the needs of agricultural credit.  I do not intend to detain the House very long.  I desire to direct attention to what I consider would be a matter of vital importance to the considerations of a banking commission.  Banking in this country is at present conducted on what are known as short-term loans. While a banker, when approached by a farmer, would consider it very good business to lend him money to stock his land on a short-term loan, he would consider it outside banking practice to grant a long-term loan.  In one case he considers it to be good banking practice, but in the other case he considers it outside his duty.  There should be other means by which a farmer can become possessed of his land.  In that connection this country is different to many other countries on account of its land tenure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In England and Scotland a farmer can take a farm of 200 or 300 acres and the capital required would be merely the sum which would supply him with implements, stock and so forth.  He has to pay nothing for the holding, and if he has a sum of money to provide implements and stock he can carry on. In this country, however, the occupier is the owner and, to get possession of land, a farmer requires a considerable amount of capital.  The result is that in this country farmers are starved for want of capital, as all their capital is sunk in their holdings.  Sometimes they are short of money for implements and stock.  Our banking system is not conducted in such a way as to have that business catered for.  Therefore, we consider that this particular point, which is so vital to the agricultural industry, should be definitely provided for in the terms of reference in connection with the Banking Commission, and by the addition of somebody well informed upon such matters.  The Minister can say, of course, that we are at liberty to go before the Commission and submit our views.  It is, however, well known that unless there is somebody on the Commission who will keep the idea before him of the necessity for providing for agricultural credit it will be allowed to go by the board.  We feel <Col N="1035" /> that in considering such vital matters an additional member with the necessary qualifications should be added to the Commission.  From the terms of reference it can be conceived that the intention is to deal with matters different from those with which we think it should deal.</P>
    <P>It is to deal with questions, I take it, of high finance, the technique of the law of banking, and other such things, and the Minister might say that the credit that we require could be dealt with better by trust companies and so forth.  But these trust companies are not coming forward; nobody is willing to advance money to the farmers.  That may be as a result of the action of farmers themselves in the past; I am not questioning the reasons at all, but the fact remains that the land is starved of cattle and on that account production is not up to its maximum, is not as high as it might be were the farmers supplied with sufficient capital at a low rate of interest.  It is with that idea in view that we say that it is the duty of the State to try to find a means for getting greater production and that greater production can only come from, amongst other things, the provision of the necessary capital at a cheap rate.  In England long-term loans have been given to farmers, particularly in the case of those who, during the war period, were foolish enough to purchase holdings at war prices and who are now practically insolvent owing to the depreciation in value of the holdings.  The Government there has made provision to tide these people over a long period.  We have numberless cases of that kind, where men sold their farms at what they considered an exorbitant price and bought other land for double the capital that they had, having borrowed from the banks.  These men are now on the verge of bankruptcy.  The problem of providing these long-term loans is the problem that ought to be before the State, the problem of trying to get the maximum production from the land, and this is bound up with the question of credit.  I believe that it would be a good stroke of policy and a stroke of statesmanship if the Minister directed the members of the Banking <Col N="1036" /> Commission to bring their minds to bear on the problem that exists here and which can only be dealt with by them by giving them a direction in their terms of reference.</P>
    <P>If the Minister thinks it would serve his purpose better to have an addendum to the terms of reference bringing in the idea embodied in Deputy Heffernan's motion we would have no objection to it.  The main thing that we require is the addition to the Commission of a person who will have the necessary banking experience and at the same time be conversant with the needs of the farming population.  If you examine the record of bank managers through the country you will find that they are estimable men, very decent men, and so forth, but none of them has any idea as to the needs of the farmers around them.  Their ideas are based more on industry and so forth. They cannot understand why, if a man obtains a loan to help him to purchase his farm, he is not able to repay it in four months or six months.  They say that it must be paid.  Banks can deal effectively with industry and commerce, but they are absolutely unsuited to the needs of the farming population. For these reasons I think that the Minister ought either to amend the terms of reference or agree to the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wilson's argument is, as it always is, a forcible and cogent one.  The only trouble was that he convinced me in the wrong direction, at any rate as far as the first part of the motion is concerned.  Deputy Wilson talked about the unwillingness of the banks to advance money on the security of holdings.  You do not want a farmer on the Commission to investigate that; you want a historian.  That is an argument for putting Deputy Professor MacNeill or Professor Curtis, or some other historian, on it, because there are historical reasons why land is a marketable security in Great Britain and is not a marketable security in Saorstát Eireann.  It is that there is no free market in land here, that when land is put up for sale there is always the possibility that someone will say that fifty years ago his ancestors were evicted from it.  That is why banks will not advance money on the security of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1037" /> With the second portion of Deputy Heffernan's amendment I would be in agreement were it not for the fact that I think it is stating what must be obvious.  I do not believe that any Banking Commission, however it may be composed, wherever its members are drawn from, could look into the problem of banking in the Saorstát without considering agricultural conditions. Take the case of any bank you like.  If you look into it you will find that for one branch in Dublin, Cork or Waterford, there are ten branches in small country towns mainly dealing with farmers' business.  You will find, in addition, that there are another ten sub-branches open on fair days.  I do not think that any commission of educated men, of men with any knowledge of banking, could overlook the importance of the agricultural side of banking and of credit in the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>With regard to the criticism that has been expressed as to the personnel of this Commission, no Commission is perfect, but I think that the personnel of this Commission has sufficient knowledge and sufficient experience to take all these factors into account, that one member at least has a good knowledge of agricultural conditions and of advances of money on land, possibly a somewhat pessimistic knowledge, but a knowledge born of experience, and I hope and believe that they will find&mdash; I think they must find&mdash;that the one salient problem, whether it is in their terms of reference or not in their terms of reference, is how to re-equip the farmer financially.  That is the problem, not only for this Commission, but for this House and for the country.  That is at the bottom of most of our present troubles.</P>
    <P>During the war the farmer made money, made a good deal of money in some cases.  He improved his standard of living and the standard of living of his family, and now that money is made with much greater difficulty, that markets have gone down, that he has to face greater competition, Canadian competition, New Zealand competition, such as he had never had to face during the war, he still, naturally, and I think on the whole, correctly, seeks to maintain the old standard of living.  If he wanted to let it down his womenfolk <Col N="1038" /> would not let him.  But in that endeavour he has gradually exhausted his capital and is now in a very bad position indeed.  He has barely capital enough&mdash;in some cases it is enough, in some cases it is not enough&mdash;to stock his land to its fullest economic advantage. This Commission will not solve that problem.  It may indicate the direction in which we may achieve solution, but the problem for the Executive Council and for the Dáil is to put the farmer on his feet economically.  I believe that if we could do that we should have solved most of our problems, not perhaps constitutional problems, but I believe that this is at the back of the problem of unemployment, the fact that the farmer cannot afford to employ on any big scale, that he cannot even support his children, who are flocking into and flooding the labour market.</P>
    <P>I do urge the Minister for Finance to go, if possible, beyond the terms of this motion and indicate if he has any idea of a direction in which this problem of setting the farmer on his feet can be solved.  It is not easy and it is not a problem purely for the Government. I have no sympathy with the people who say: &ldquo;This is the Government's business,&rdquo; but I do think that the Government, even if it does not give money, ought to be able to give ideas and directions, ought to indicate the basis, whether by credit societies, whether by a corporation which will give loans for longer terms, supported by the security of the Gárda Síochána, by which the farmers may be helped to get out of the rut.  It is partly his own fault that he is in the rut.  He carried on the old standard of living too long, in my opinion, but at the same time he is in the rut, and in some counties he is very badly in the rut.  I do not think that the country can prosper as we wish it to prosper until he can be pulled out of the rut.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDoyle" hpid="Mr. M. DOYLE Mr. M. DOYLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not entirely agree with Deputy Cooper's exposition with regard to the insecurity of land in this country, and the security of land in England.  I think the reason to which he has put it down is not at all correct. For instance, in the years 1920, 1921 and 1922, when we had practically no <Col N="1039" /> security, no law, the times were prosperous and farmers could get any advances from the banks they wanted.  Therefore the present position is not due to insecurity.  There was more insecurity in these years, more cattle driving, more opposition to law, than there has been since or than there is at present. Deputy Wilson's point was much more correct.  The reason why banks at present refuse to advance money to farmers is because there is no money in land.  The people who are in it cannot get anything out of it.  If a farmer wants a loan of £100 to-day, he must offer security amounting almost to £1,000 before he can get it.  Therefore, I hold that we should have on this Commission somebody who has an interest, and a big interest, in agriculture, as well as people interested in banking, so that the needs of the farmers may be well and carefully considered. I say that if some reasonable credit facilities were given there would be a probability that many would get out of the rut referred to by Deputy Cooper.  But with the present banking facilities and the short term loans prevailing&mdash;three months is about all that the biggest farmer in the country will get at present, with a security of £1,000 for a £100 loan&mdash;he certainly cannot get out of the rut, and with a sympathetic Commission, a Commission of which one at least of the members should know something about practical agriculture, the problem would be better dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the personnel and of the terms of reference of this Commission were very carefully considered.  It was decided that it was not desirable that there should be sectional representation, that we should not try to get representation for the various interests that would be concerned, directly or indirectly, with a change in the banking system, but rather that we should make it, as far as we could, an expert Commission. We realised quite fully, just as fully as Deputies on the Farmers' Benches, the importance of the whole question of agricultural credit, but we did not believe that the getting of a report from <Col N="1040" /> this Commission that would enable us to take action would be in any way facilitated by the addition desired by Deputy Heffernan.  The Commission is really already&mdash;though this is not an argument that I am using against Deputy Heffernan's motion&mdash;rather too large a body, but we were not able, owing to the interests that had to be represented, to make it smaller than it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, for instance, four members representing the existing banks here, and it might be argued that that is a large number.  It is a large number, but the interests concerning the different classes of banks will come under review, and each of these four members represents a different class of bank.  One, for instance, represents a bank which has its headquarters in the Saorstát and a note issue; another represents a bank with its headquarters here but with no note issue; another represents a bank which has many branches here but which has its headquarters in London; while another represents a bank with branches in Northern Ireland. Arrangements may have to be made which may affect these banks.  It was felt to be desirable that where they were to be intimately affected by the Commission their different points of view should be directly represented. There are other members of the Commission who have given attention to the whole question of agricultural credit.  There is one member of it, whose name I mentioned already, who certainly has given a tremendous amount of time and study to the question of agricultural credit.  He has practical experience of it.  He has more knowledge of it&mdash;mind you we are dealing with banking and not with a commission on agriculture&mdash;than I think anybody in this country.  The Chairman of the Commission, Professor Parker Willis, has done investigation work on rural credit, while Mr. Campion has been connected with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. That is a bank which made special arrangements for agricultural credit, or at any rate for advances on market produce.  We have therefore three people who have given special study <Col N="1041" /> to the question of agricultural credit. Representations will be made to the Commission by the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Industry and Commerce and other Departments concerned, and if the Commission thinks it necessary it can call, not only outside people, but the officials of these Departments, for the purpose of having laid before it any information that can possibly be got. There might come a time when you would want the help of practical farmers.  For instance, if the Commission were to recommend the setting up of some type of a Land Mortgage Bank &mdash;I do not know whether it will or not, but that is a thing that will occur to anyone as a likely recommendation&mdash; a specially constituted body which would give loans on long terms to farmers, and which might perhaps have certain special privileges, it might then be necessary, when we came to frame a law setting up such a bank, to have practical farmers on the Committee.  That would be the time when we would come to work out the recommendation in detail.  Deputies have got to remember that this is a Banking Commission which is to review the whole banking position here as well as the laws relating to banking and note issue in this country.</P>
    <P>There are a great number of very important problems, some purely financial, that will come before the Commission. For instance, at the present time in this country we have no gold.  It is, I believe, the decision of the British Government that British currency notes should be withdrawn.  That obviously creates a situation which people of great theoretical and practical knowledge, from the financial side, have got to consider.  You would not put practical agriculturists on a Commission that is to examine a question of that sort any more than you would put them on the expert Commission which examined the scheme of Messrs.  Siemens-Schuckert.  Then there are other problems.  Take the question of note issue of banks.  We have banks here with a certain authorised note issue.  That note issue refers to the whole of Ireland.  The setting up of the Saorstát as a separate <Col N="1042" /> entity requires that that matter be reviewed and that the note issue be adjusted to the Saorstát area and be apportioned in some way.  You have banks here which have not the right to have a note issue and which are desirous of getting that right.  That is a matter that would have to be considered by the Commission.  Another point that might be considered is that instead of having a number of banks with a note issue, whether you should have a Consolidated Bank, as is done in other places, with a note issue.  That is another of the problems, that is highly technical.  Then you have the position that you have nothing here that fulfills the functions of a Central Bank.  The Bank of Ireland, except in minor details, does not occupy or fulfill the function that the Bank of England does in Great Britain.  As a matter of fact, as far as our banks are concerned, the Central Bank is the Bank of England.  You have the position&mdash;I am not saying this by way of criticism of the banks and I do not want to be taken as making any attack on them&mdash;where our banking system is largely a conduit pipe for the bringing of money out of the country for employment outside it.  That is a matter, not for a practical agriculturist to consider, but for banking experts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think you can overload a committee in that way. If anything the Committee is big enough already, and I do not think it would be at all desirable to enter on a discussion of this question of the representation of interests on it.  The Commission will have to keep its eye open to the whole agricultural position.  The people on it would be incompetent if they did not realise that this is an agricultural country and that the agricultural needs are of paramount importance. This is a difficult and a very delicate subject to speak on.  We know the way things are magnified and how attempts are made to create feelings of <Col N="1043" /> uncertainty and alarm when there is not the slightest need for that.  This is a subject, as I say, that it is difficult to speak on or to discuss with any sort of freedom.  I can assure Deputies that the Government realise what the position is and have given it the most careful study.  They feel that the best results, and the most practical results for agriculturists and others will be got by maintaining the constitution of the Commission as it stands.  I do not want to suggest any drastic action, but there is no doubt that agriculture and everybody else in the community would benefit if the direction which is given to the flow of money by the existing bank system, or lack of system, were altered.  There are quite a number of problems of a highly technical and difficult character to be considered by the Commission.  I put it to the Dáil in the most serious way that this is a matter that has been most fully considered.  It is a matter that bristles with difficulties, with certain elements of danger in it, and I suggest that the Commission should be left as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, this Commission will survey the whole field.  It will make its recommendations, and these recommendations will probably be in outline.  It is not my view of this Commission that if it recommended such a thing as a Land Mortgage Bank or some special institution for giving loans to farmers, it should work out itself that recommendation in detail. Once it reported in general terms in favour of it, it would be for the Government to work out the recommendation in detail.  That would be the point where you would want the man from the land, the man carrying on the farming business, to assist you in getting your details right.  But he would not be of assistance in the consideration of the matter in the way it came under review by the Commission.  He would not be nearly of so much value as a man, say, like Mr. Smith Gordon &mdash;I do not want to particularise amongst members of the Commission&mdash; who has given a tremendous amount of study to this question and who has a knowledge of economics and financial matters that perhaps a special representative <Col N="1044" /> put on would not have.  It is not usual to discuss here the personnel or terms of reference of a Commission, because it is not a matter that can well be discussed without doing harm.  You cannot discuss it in detail. I can assure the Deputy, however, that the matter has had the fullest possible consideration.  The Government feel as strongly as any member on the Farmers' Benches that agricultural credit, and the making of the best arrangements that can be made for agricultural credit, is of primary importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks on this motion must necessarily be rather brief.  Notwithstanding what the Minister for Finance has said, I must draw the attention of the House to the terms of reference of this banking commission. They are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To consider and report to the Minister for Finance what changes, if any, in the law relative to banking and note issue are necessary or desirable, regard being had to the altered circumstances arising from the establishment of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I desire to draw special attention to the words &ldquo;To report and to consider ...what changes, if any, in the law relative to banking and note issue are necessary or desirable.&rdquo;  The banks in Ireland are regulated largely by an Act passed in 1845.  It permitted notes to be issued for sums not less than 20/-. In England there was an Act passed about the same time which made the minimum note issue £5.  In other words, it would be a gold standard, whereas in Ireland they effectively substituted paper for gold.  The effect was to drive currency out of the country, leaving us with this paper substitute.  There is no mention in these terms of reference of credit.  From first to last, the word &ldquo;credit&rdquo; is not mentioned.  The Commission is to inquire into changes in the law relative to banking and note issue.  In the Act of 1845, there is no reference whatever to the question of credit.  It only deals with such questions as note issue, who may or may not be directors of banks, etc.  It appears that in the year 1840 or 1841, notes were issued without restriction by banks and associations of persons in <Col N="1045" /> Ireland.  That was prohibited after the Act of 1845, and no company or bank which was not then issuing notes had power to issue afterwards.  It appears that it was laid down by statute what amount they could actually issue, that being based on the issue of 1841.  That was made a standard.  Over and above that, all banks with note-issuing powers were allowed to issue notes (in excess) equivalent to the amount of gold and silver they had in their possession. That is really what, in my opinion, this Commission will have to deal with, changes in the law relative to banking and note issue.  There is no mention of the extension of credit or the granting of credit facilities to agriculture or any kindred industry.  It is confined to this water-tight compartment set out in the terms of reference.  The subsequent part of the terms of reference is, of course, merely political and refers to the altered conditions brought about by the setting-up of the Saorstát.  The Minister cannot, I think, fairly tell us that this Commission will deal with the question of credit.  That may be his intention, but let us remember that this Commission will enjoy autonomy and that they will read directly into their terms of reference.  There is nothing in the terms of reference to compel consideration of credit, and if the Minister wanted them to consider that question, why did he not insert words to that effect?</P>
    <P>The gentlemen who constitute this Commission will have regard only to the litera scripta and act accordingly. It is everywhere admitted that the economic conditions in Ireland are bad and it cannot be disputed that the banks, even in those bad times, are doing very well.  The gentlemen who are to constitute this Commission are, no doubt, eminent in their own walks of life, but they have no sympathetic outlook on the economic conditions here.  They are men trained in a certain groove in the banking profession, and, naturally, they are not men of liberal sympathies or sentiments.  Yet you ask these men to sit in judgment on a system which, by restriction of credit, has maintained itself.  I do not want to prejudge this Commission, but you have on the Commission men who <Col N="1046" /> have been all their lives bent to a certain system and who can see no other.  How is it expected that these men would admit the principle of extension of credit?  Again, some of them are representatives of banks whose headquarters are outside this country.  Even from the political point of view, if we are to have anything in the nature of a distinct credit system here, how can men who are officials of banks with headquarters in London or Belfast assist in the work? I contend that it is not possible and that it is not in accord with human nature.  Other men have come from abroad.  They have no intimate knowledge of the conditions in this country. These men are to sit in judgement on a system which, while not helpful to the extension of credit in the country, has been successful in securing large dividends for the shareholders.  In other words, you are asking these men to stultify themselves, and I do not believe they will do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the way the Minister for Finance has met our demand in regard to this Commission.  We did not ask for majority representation on the Commission.  We only asked for reasonable representation of the farming interests.  The Minister refers to our demand as a &ldquo;sectional&rdquo; demand. Surely, in this State of ours, with agriculture occupying the position it does in the economic fabric, our demand cannot be regarded as sectional.  The economic and financial interests of the State are bound up with the financial and economic interest of agriculture, and any Commission set up to deal with the conditions of banking which does not directly deal with the question of agricultural credits will not be satisfactory and will not have the confidence of the farming community.  We are told that agricultural credit interests are represented, and we find that the banks in Ireland have four representatives on the Commission.  They have those four representatives for reasons given by the Minister, which I consider simply trifling.  One bank happens to have headquarters in London <Col N="1047" /> and note issue in Ireland.  Another has headquarters in Ireland and note issue in Ireland.  Another has headquarters in Belfast and note issue in Ireland.  Another has representation because of some special circumstances which make it different from the other banks.  These are the reasons why the Minister has appointed four representatives of banking interests on the Commission.  Surely such representation is redundant.  I cannot speak off-hand as to the exact connection between the banking representatives and industry.  But we may take it for granted that the majority of them are directly concerned with industry and finance apart altogether from the question of banking.  It cannot be denied, I think, that industry is represented&mdash;if anything over-represented&mdash; on the Banking Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like to make any personal reference to any member of the Commission. But I fear that I cannot make my statement without dealing to a certain extent, personally, with one member who was said to have such an intimate knowledge of agricultural credit as to represent adequately the farming interests on this Commission. I refer to Mr. Smith-Gordon.  I do not want to belittle his ability or knowledge of agricultural credit but my contention is that the knowledge of gentlemen of the type of Mr. Smith-Gordon is largely theoretical and that he cannot have any real knowledge of the practical credit problems of agriculture which exist at present.  We cannot expect that representation by theorists and men who have not got a practical knowledge of farming conditions will lead to the adequate attention to these problems.  I am aware that Commissions sat in the past and went very minutely into this question of agricultural credit in Ireland.  The report of the latest Commission on Agricultural Credit in Ireland is practically regarded as a standard work all over the world.  It will be within the power of this Commission to refer to that report and to deal with agricultural problems in the light of the findings of that report. But unless the Commission is going to sit for a long time and give a <Col N="1048" /> great deal of time to the consideration of the problems which will face it, it will be almost impossible to get adequate attention for the findings of that Commission.  We do not suggest that a new inquiry be instituted into the question of agricultural credit, but we want to see that a definite bias is given to the inquiry in that direction.  We have no indication from the terms of reference or from the personnel of the Commission that that bias will be given.  Except for this debate, we should have no assurance that this question of agricultural credit would have been touched upon at all.  If touched upon, it probably would be only so far as it would affect technical banking questions.</P>
    <P>I am not inclined to place anything like the importance the Minister has placed on technical banking problems in Ireland as distinct from other countries. The technical banking problems all over the world are more or less standardised.  They do not differ much in one State and in another State, and they do not require consideration by so many technical experts.  But I maintain that the agricultural credit problem of the Saorstát is almost unique. Our agricultural credit problems are different from those of practically every other country.  They bear no comparison with the agricultural credit problems in the Commonwealth of Australia or in the Dominion of Canada or in the United States.  In my opening statement, I said it was not my intention to make an attack upon the present banking system in this State, for the reason that this is neither the time nor the place to make such attack.</P>
    <P>First of all, we must not condemn the present banking institutions in advance.  We must find out if they are at fault, and if we find out that they are at fault then it will be time to condemn them. It is evident to anybody that banking in this country is much too easy.  It is much too easy for the banks in this country to make their money. They have not to take the risks which, in my opinion, banks which are adequately fulfilling the duty that they owe to the State ought to take.  They are acting, as the Minister has said, as conduits for the purpose of collecting Irish money and transferring it to <Col N="1049" /> the English money market, where it can be safely invested, while the banks can continue to draw their profit and pay their shareholders increased profits from year to year.  It is an extraordinary thing that the worse economic conditions become in this country the greater the profits of the banks. Economic conditions and agricultural conditions are now, probably, at a lower ebb than they have been at for a great number of years.  Yet we find that the banking profits are still increasing.</P>
    <P>I have no desire to say anything that might in any way cause panic or cause people not to have reliance in the banking system of the country.  I believe our banking system, as it exists at present, is thoroughly reliable and that the depositors' money is perfectly safe. But I maintain that the banks owe a duty to the country, apart from the duty to their shareholders and depositors. They have certain privileges and rights in regard to which they owe an obligation, and it must not be regarded in the future that a bank is fulfilling its duty to the State when it takes a depositor's money and keeps it safely, regardless of the manner in which that money is invested.  Some of the Deputies who spoke here went into questions of detail which, in my opinion, are questions to be considered by the Commission set up&mdash;the question of a free market for land and matters of that kind.  I am confident that there will, in the future, be a more or less free market for land in Ireland.  There is not any great reason for fear that the agricultural credit system in Ireland will fail because of not having a free market for land.  Finally, I want to say that we believe that the agricultural credit problems should be again examined into, in view of the changes which have taken place since the time of the Great War.  We believe that the findings of the Commission on Agricultural Credit, voluminous though they be, are not up to date.  We believe that new problems have arisen, problems that did not exist at the time of the setting up of that Commission.</P>
    <P>In connection with that matter, I must refer to the remarks of Deputy Wilson, as regards land which was purchased at an excessive price <Col N="1050" /> throughout the country and purchased largely by the aid of the banks&mdash;the credit given by the banks to the farmers who bought the land.  It may seem that I am making an argument against myself when I speak of the banks having advanced money to the farmers, but I maintain that the advances were made in the wrong way, that the farmers got the wrong kind of credit, and that the real banking credit that is required by farmers is not available. The cry is going up that farming is being strangled for lack of credit facilities.  We say that farmers cannot get money from the banks unless they can give excellent personal security.  I am not of the opinion that the whole agricultural problem of this State can be met by credit, but I am of opinion that the question of credit is one of the problems we have in connection with agriculture, and it must be dealt with amongst other problems which the Commission has to deal with.  It is scarcely necessary for me to point out that the whole welfare of the State must depend on the prosperity of agriculture. I think it is not necessary for me to point out that agricultural conditions have not been worse for a great many years than they now are, and that still worse prospects are facing farmers. Agriculturists are less hopeful now than they have been for a long time. I think it is the duty of the Dáil and of all concerned to set their minds to the problem and see if we cannot devise something which will be of aid to agriculture. I believe one of the first things which we have got to devise, one of the first helps we have to give to agriculture, is to improve the credit system.  I am convinced that the system that exists at the present time is not suitable to the peculiar conditions existing in the Saorstát.  I am not convinced that the Commission which has been set up by the Executive Council will inquire into the agricultural credit conditions to the extent that is necessary, nor am I convinced, even if it did, that the agricultural conditions are such that they will enable them to deal adequately with the question of agricultural credit. I might say, speaking from the Farmers' Benches, that we are not satisfied with the way the Minister has met us.  We have not asked for a majority <Col N="1051" /> representation on this Commission. We would be satisfied with two representatives&mdash;Deputy Doyle said one.  We certainly will insist on getting one representative of practical agriculture, and if the Minister does not agree to give that representation which we demand, I say that we, as <Col N="1052" /> representing the farming interests, will not have any confidence whatever in the results of this Commission, and the results will be no real tangible benefit to the agricultural community of the Saorstát.</P>
