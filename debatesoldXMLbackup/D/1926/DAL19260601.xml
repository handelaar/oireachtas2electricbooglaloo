      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the number of drainage schemes under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, received from the Cork County Council, the districts in respect of which such schemes have been formulated, and the amount of preliminary work already undertaken in connection with such schemes.</P>

      <P>Two petitions for schemes under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, were received by the Commissioners of Public Works from the Cork County Council.  One was in respect of small streams in the Skibbereen district, and was sent to the county secretary for amendment on the 5th November, 1925, and has not yet been returned.  The second was for the Awbeg River, and the position of this case was fully explained in the reply given to Deputy Hennessy on the 28th April.  No change in the position has since taken place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. CONLAN (for Pádraig O hOgáin) (Luimneach)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will state <Col N="2" /> what was the total amount of Estate Duty collected or due for the year ending March 31st, 1926, for County Limerick, whether the whole of this sum was allocated to the County Council, and whether there is any liability on this grant under the Guarantee Fund on account of the liabilities of defaulting annuitants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is apparently under the impression that there is a direct relationship between the amount of Estate Duty collected for a county and the amount of Estate Duty Grant allocated to that county. This is not so.  The basis of allocation in respect of any county has reference not to the amount of Estate Duty collected for that county, but to certain expenditure incurred in the year 1887&mdash; that is to say, the Estate Duty Grant is payable to the extent of one-half to county, county borough and urban district councils, as road authorities, in proportion to the amounts certified to have been expended out of any cess or rate upon the maintenance of roads or bridges during the year ended 31st December, 1887, and as to the remaining one-half to county and county borough councils on behalf of Poor Law Authorities in proportion to the sums spent on salaries, remuneration and superannuation of officers of Poor Law Unions during the financial year ended 29th September, 1887.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is besides an ambiguity in the expression used by the Deputy, &ldquo;collected or due ... for the County Limerick.&rdquo;  It may mean Estate Duty in respect of property situate in the county or the property of persons dying in the county.  No figures of either kind are available, and in view of the explanation already given are, I take it, not required by the Deputy. <Col N="3" /> In any event to compile them would involve an unjustifiable expenditure of time and labour.</P>
    <P>The Estate Duty Grant passes through the Guarantee Fund and County Limerick's share of the full grant will not be known until the end of June, but up to 31st March last its share was £3,436 10s. 4d., from which £2,693 18s. 6d. was drawn on account of arrears of Land Purchase Annuities, the balance of £742 11s. 10d. being paid to the Board of Works to discharge arrears of loan instalments due by subsidiary local bodies in the county.</P>
    <P>I might add that the County Council recently asked for and were furnished by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health with a full statement of the position of the county in regard to Estate Duty Grant.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if any payment has been made to Mr. John Connole, Ballmalacken, Lisdoonvarna, Co. Clare, in respect of cattle seized by National troops in Clare in June, 1924; if he will state the amount paid; the amount realised for the sale of the cattle; the number of cattle seized, and the basis upon which the amount paid was calculated.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Twelve cattle, the property of John Connole, Ballinahoun, Lisdoonvarna, were seized by National troops for illegal trespass on the lands of Mrs. Gore, Ballyreem, Co. Clare, in June of 1923.  The gross selling price of these cattle amounted to £120.  On the general distribution of the monies derived from these cattle, Mr. Connole was offered £66 as an <i>ex-gratia</i> award. Mr. Connole refused to accept this sum, and has consequently received no payment in respect of his cattle.  The sum of £66 represents 11-20th of the gross selling price of the cattle seized. This was the fraction of the money which it was found possible to pay to wilful trespassers after the expenses in connection with the seizure and sale of the cattle as well as the claims of innocent <Col N="4" /> trespassers had been deducted in full from the money realised.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state why John Ryan, of Ballydehob, Co. Cork, an employee of the Cork County Council, who was unemployed from March 10th to April 9th, 1926, was refused unemployment benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>John Ryan, of Ballydehob, Co. Cork, made a claim to unemployment benefit on the 22nd March, 1926.  In accordance with the statutory regulations governing the making of claims, the claimant should have lodged his unemployment book on the occasion, but he failed to do so, alleging that he had not yet received it from his last employers.  In the circumstances, the condition requiring the book to be lodged was waived in the claimant's favour, but he has not since lodged the book, nor given any evidence that he continued to be unemployed after the date on which he made his claim.  In the circumstances, the claim became ineffective, and no benefit can be paid on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of that.  In that event, I presume the claim would be revived, inasmuch as there was a waiver of the statutory necessity for the lodgment of the book. Until evidence is produced showing unemployment, the claim is, of course, ineffective.</P>

I could not say definitely now whether there would be more than one or two migrants, but I know far the largest proportion of it would go to such a man.  I got no indication in the question that the Deputy would want information of that sort, that is, the number of people likely to be dealt with afterwards, but he can take it generally that far the largest proportion of the land was taken in order to give land to migrants.</P>

      <P>A communication has been received by the Land Commission from the Secretary of the Meath County Council complaining of delay in the payment of rates due in respect of lands held by the Commissioners in County Meath.  It is not the practice of the Land Commission to take possession of untenanted lands proposed to be acquired by them for distribution under the Land Act, 1923, until all arrears of poor rates due thereon are paid.  Rates subsequently struck are payable by the Land Commission if the lands are kept in their hands pending distribution, or by the persons amongst whom the lands are divided. Each poor rate collector is bound, under a penalty of £5 in each case, to send to the secretary of the county council before the 15th June in each year a list of all tenements and hereditaments in his district, the valuation of which requires revision.  The secretary of the council must leave these lists open for inspection at his office for 10 days and permit extracts to be made therefrom and the lists <Col N="13" /> must then be transmitted to the Commissioner of Valuation on or before the 27th June.  To facilitate the parties, however, the Land Commission, when they allot untenanted land, furnish to the Commissioner of Valuation a tracing of the resale map showing the allotments and a schedule giving particulars thereof, and at the same time they notify the county council that this has been done and that the council should make application to the Commissioner of Valuation for a revision of the lands.  The Commissioner of Valuation will, on the application of the county council, list the lands for the next annual revision, and pending revision being made, will furnish, if required, a provisional apportionment of the poor law assessment.  All rates for which the Land Commission are liable in County Meath have been dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. NOLAN Mr. NOLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words.  Generally the cry through the country is to divide the land.  Nobody thinks of the price the owner has to get.  I do not suggest that the land Commission or any other Department of the Government should confiscate the owners' rights, but I suggest when the land is being taken over that the owners should not get such a price as that the tenant who is put into occupation should have to pay an uneconomic rent.  The annuity fixed on the holdings of the allottees is entirely beyond what they are able to pay.  I know some cases in Leinster where those who have got the land have not tilled it, as they are not able.  They are now setting it on something like the same principle as that which was carried on by the ranchers previously.  What they are getting on the eleven months system is, in some cases, less than what they are paying to the Land Commission, and out of that the local rate has to be found and other expenses.  Those lands taken over by the Land Commission are no better than derelict farms.  The drains were not clear.  The passages were in a bad state.  The Land Commission are giving for this land something like £40 an acre, which means an annuity of £2 an acre from the tenant.  The tenant does not mind what the price is when he is getting it, but when he is in for a few years I am afraid there will be more land trouble for another Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a tenant gets a holding there are no dwelling houses, out-offices, gates or passages in it.  He has to build a house, out-offices, drain the land, buy all the necessary implements for the farm and utensils for the house.  All over the country an amount of arrears is due in the way of Land Commission annuities by those people who have taken over the land who have only the <Col N="20" /> landlord's interest to redeem and who are paying only an annuity of 12/- to 14/- per Irish acre.  At present we have, I am sorry to say, about forty thousand pounds worth of arrears of annuities in County Limerick due to the Land Commission.  Very little of that is land divided recently.  It was the landlord's interest that had to be bought.  The Land Commission is dividing now land which is costing the tenant about £2 10s. an acre.  It has been said that it is not essential for the allottee to have finance enough to work the land.  I say it is essential because without finance you are only making a bad case worse.  Those people must be in arrears in future.  It will be hard to expect one body of men to be paying rates and annuities for another.  Generally the Government have got credit for doing the right thing regardless of popularity.</P>
    <P>People who are interested in the division of land are crying out for it all over the country.  I am sorry that the Department have given way to that popular cry.  It is up to the Government not to give too high a price for the land.  As I said before, I do not suggest that there should be confiscation. There should be proper value, but how to arrive at that value is a difficulty. Recently an estate was taken over in Enfield.  The Land Commission offered £48,000.  The owner appealed, and the Judicial Commissioner increased the offer to £51,000, on the ground that the owner was able to show his average figure for the previous five years.  There is no comparison between the value of agricultural produce five years ago and to-day.  Those who set the land at that time were getting more than three times per acre what they are now getting.  The value of cattle was about 100/- a cwt. at that time for all classes, whereas now it is only about 50/- for the best beef.  Land has gone down in value by about 50 per cent. during the past twelve months, and it is not down to bedrock yet. What I would advise the Land Commission to do is to concentrate on the land in their hands for the last fifteen years, divide that, and take over no other land until the land that they possess is divided.  I do not know how <Col N="21" /> much land there is in the Land Commission which is not yet vested under the 1903 Act.  I put a question in regard to that some time ago, but the Land Commission did not answer.  I do not know whether they were afraid to answer, but I asked for information as to how many estates were in their hands under the Act of 1903.</P>
    <P>I was told that in order to compile these statistics it would take a considerable time, with the result that the staff would have to be taken off more useful work.  If there were anything like proper accounts in the Land Commission I do not think that it would take a man ten minutes to find that information out.  In any case, when the question was put down, I think it should have been answered.  It is evident that they did not want to disclose the actual loss sustained by the State in regard to holdings which have not yet been vested, and which are paying interest in lieu of rent at 3½ instead of 3¼ per cent.  That would nearly meet the income tax of the owner, but that in itself is a loss.  Not being able to get the figures from the Land Commission, I got figures from my own area in connection with the Dixon estate, where there are sixty tenants who signed an agreement to purchase nearly twenty years ago.  The average annuity that they are paying by interest in lieu of rent is £14.  They are paying £840 a year, and in twenty years they would have paid £16,800, which is a dead loss to the State.  I would suggest to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, if he were here, that that is blood and money going out of the country without protection to the farmer.  It is free trade blood and money.  Some of the tenants, as a protest, refused to pay their annuities in the last few years.  One man was brought to court, and, having given his reasons for not paying, the judge refused to give a decree against him. The excuse given by the State solicitor was that the landlord was not able to prove title.  A landlord who is not able to prove title in twenty years has no title to prove.  I would suggest that that estate be taken over.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government is correct, and I am also correct.  The Deputy knows that February is the month in which the draw is taken from the Guarantee Fund after the December gale, and in that time the arrears from the previous gale are at their highest.  A large amount of arrears exists up to the end of February, but then money begins to come in, and the amount of arrears is generally reduced, after a month or so, and recouped to the Guarantee Fund, so that there is no loss to anybody.  I have explained that frequently, and if the Deputy wants to make a case he should quote facts.  The Deputy knows that after the gale day the arrears are at their highest, but, later on, they are reduced and paid into the Guarantee Fund.  It is no use, when you want to make a case, to flourish figures which are not accurate.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government, in the letter referred to, <Col N="23" /> when he stated that at the end of February, on the draw from the Guarantee Fund, the arrears were so much, was perfectly right, but the Deputy understands the implication of that quite well, and knows that the arrears are always biggest a month after gale day.  He knows also that these arrears begin to be paid in the months of March and April, and that as they are paid in they are immediately recouped to the Guarantee Fund, so that nobody suffers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. NOLAN Mr. NOLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NOLAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another red herring.  There are people in arrears for three, four or five years, as the Deputy knows well.  I have not said anything in the last five minutes that is contrary to that.  What I have said is that the arrears are £29,000 now, and that they were something like £40,000 on the date of the withdrawal from the Guarantee Fund.  I was never on the question of whether these arrears were made up of half-years, one and a half-years, or two years.</P>

      <P>Actually £97,000 of rates are due, though, of course, that does not come into this matter.  The reason why a good many of them are not paying is because they do not want to pay their neighbours' annuities.  As I said before, a good deal of that land is set in grazing for less than the owners have to pay the Land Commission by way of annuities, and that is certainly not a happy position to be in. There are a good many cases in the country of farmers, men who are not dairy farmers but who might be described to a certain extent as ranchers, who will get an agent to take the names of those who are anxious to get land in their districts.  That list is sent to the Land Commission, which in turn gets in touch with the owner of the land, and gives him the actual value of the land.  That is engineered by the owners themselves.  The Land Commission should not take over any land from these people without considering its value better.</P>

      <P>The owners of big farms throughout the country, particularly in the poor districts, get an agent of theirs to take the names of neighbours who are desirous of getting land.  These neighbours claim to be uneconomic holders or landless men. They send a list of names to the Land <Col N="25" /> Commission, and the Land Commission gets in touch with the owner of the land who has taken this step.  The owner pretends that he is not anxious to sell, but the Land Commission say there is a demand for the land, and they send down an inspector to value it.  They make an offer for the land, and they promise to give the owner a farm, very often twice as good as the land he has, as well as giving him a price.  That is a fact, no matter how much the Minister shakes his head.  I know it, and I know that the Land Commission inspectors are going round the country asking people if there are any areas that might be divided.</P>

      <P>Yes, it is done.  There is no use in the Minister denying it. Why should they be anxious to lose a good job?  A good job is worth minding, and there are a good many unemployed. I impress upon the Minister and the Government the need for not being too anxious at present to take land from the ranchers, not to concentrate principally on the land they have divided, where agreements have been signed, but where the land has not been vested, and on the land that has come to the Land Commission from the Congested Districts Board.  I think when they have that done they will be able to get other land at lower prices, because the much-abused rancher is, like the publican, dying a natural death. He is not able to make ends meet with the price he pays for store cattle and the price he sells them at.</P>

      <P>I have very little to say on this Vote.  A good deal of what Deputy Nolan has said with regard to the Land Commission going slow is sense.  Unfortunately, in response to the widespread demand, perhaps an ill-considered demand, of a few years ago to break up the land, the Government was induced to put the machinery in <Col N="26" /> motion, and then paid too much for land.  Not alone was too much paid for land, but the land did not find its way to the people who desired to have it broken up.  I know several estates, some in my own county, on which the workmen were induced to join in the demand for breaking them up, and the result is that they have found themselves with practically nothing.  If the people who get the land have not capital they get nothing to do, practically speaking, so that their last state is very much worse than their first; they are neither workmen nor farmers.  I know cases where they have been given houses and plots of about four statute acres, and now, when they have no employment and are not able to live on the four acres, their condition is pitiable.  I do not know how they will get along.  The men I have in mind are only about six months in possession of these four acres, and what their position will be in a few years time I do not know.  These people were induced to join in the demand for the breaking up of all land, even land that was fairly well farmed and employing a couple of hands.  I think that that was an ill-considered procedure, a procedure that was engineered by people who wanted to get popularity. We heard a series of questions to-day about breaking up everything.  I do not know what the conditions in these cases are, but I say this publicly to the labourers, that they should consider well the position before they join in these demands for the breaking up of properties, giving decent employment, in order to accommodate a few people by the cross-roads who want land.</P>

      <P>Well, I think the same advice would be good for both.  At present you have people who were in employment and whose family had the means of subsistence, but who have not it to-day.  I speak now of people whom Deputies on those benches are supposed to represent.  Where farming is carried on as it is in Meath, and certainly in Westmeath, it may be well to speed up operations under the 1923 Act.  But where these conditions do <Col N="27" /> not apply, the Land Commission ought to go very slowly.  When the Land Commission breaks up large farms I say that the labourers on the estate deserve more consideration than the people who are trying to get the land by talk and speeches at cross-roads, by agitation and by what was known formerly as the use of the hazel.  I think that if too much money is paid for this land it will entail too large an annuity, thus putting a millstone round the necks of future occupiers that they will not be able to bear.</P>

      <P>I was listening to this debate for a couple of hours last night and for some time to-day, and it has been very interesting.  I may point out one thing in connection with the division of land, and that is that in the county of Carlow there are about 9,000 acres of land registered as untenanted, and not one acre of that land has been divided.  There are something like 551 acres of land on which the price has been agreed.  These are the figures I got from the Land Commission some time ago.  I was rather surprised when I heard Deputy Gorey saying that some of the people who have got land are neither workmen nor farmers.  I agree that these people could not live on four acres of land.  That is what we want to end&mdash;uneconomic holdings. I think there is plenty of land in the Deputy's constituency to give land to the uneconomic holders.  I have here correspondence from a number of <Col N="28" /> people dealing with cases where farms are being divided.  On the Harvey Flood Estate at Farmley, Cuffesgrange, where there were 1,100 acres, one farmer, who had one hundred acres of land, got ten acres.  The gardener got two acres only, and the man in the lodge two acres only.</P>
      <P>In a different farm that was to be divided, Deputy Gorey has got a large part for grazing, notwithstanding that the Deputy has 200 acres of land of his own.  The Deputy is right when he says the land is not being properly divided. If the Land Commission does not try to have the land, especially in my constituency, divided as soon as possible, and not to have the people driven out of this country to seek bread, there is only one thing that will bring about a division of the land, and that will be a revolution.  I see no other way out of it when I hear sentiments such as were expressed by some Deputies.</P>

      <P>Might I intervene to say that a portion of this land on this particular estate to which the Deputy refers was advertised to be let by auction? The Land Commission is retaining a portion of it for migrants.  I happened to want some of it, and I bought it at a public auction.  In fact, there was nobody else to bid.  These are the facts of the case.  I do not know what message the Deputy wanted to convey to the public, but that is the position.  With regard to the uneconomic holdings to which I have referred, they are uneconomic holdings of a new creation&mdash;created within the last six months.  These uneconomic holdings were not there before.  They were created, and they are there now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make an appeal to the Minister in respect to a different type of tenant from the kind that we have heard discussed here.  In my constituency, in fact in the entire counties of Mayo and Galway, the majority <Col N="29" /> of the tenants live on holdings under a valuation of £5.  In the more western portions of these counties the average valuation is down to £4, £3, and even 30s. valuation.  Now, imagine the sort of living these people have to make out of holdings of that sort.  There is practically no living there at all for them, and they are in a very poor way.  They have been for years and years hoping and hoping that their lot would be improved.  Their hopes appeared very bright when the Land Act of 1923 was passed.  We told them that that Act would come into operation in 1924, or at least in 1925, and now we are in the year 1926.  Perhaps we were all very much to blame.  We did not understand the amount of work involved in the dividing up of the ranches, and that of necessity it would be very slow.  We now understand that it is very slow work, indeed.  But the people are getting impatient, and they do not understand that.  Their impatience is very natural.  I am convinced that the Land Commission is working at high pressure at this very difficult work.  I would appeal to the Minister to keep that pressure up, and I would appeal to the Land Commission to do one thing that I do not think they have yet done&mdash;they should have selected the poorer areas to be dealt with first.  If they find one area where the average holding is under £4 valuation, and they find another area where the holdings are under £6 valuation, or £7 valuation, I think certainly that, as a matter of fair play, they should give a preference to the poorer areas first.  They should send down their inspectors and concentrate on the poorer areas first, and release these people from the very terrible state in which they are.  I regret very much to hear that there is a movement in some parts of the country to obstruct the work of finding land in these better-off areas&mdash;those thinly-populated areas&mdash;land to which large farmers in Mayo and Galway could be transplanted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw where Colonel O'Callaghan Westropp said at a meeting that it would be far better for those small farmers if they allowed those large ranches near Dublin to remain undivided, as the land would be more useful for fattening <Col N="30" /> store cattle.  The land is too good for the people and is only good enough for the bullocks.  There is something, of course, to be said for the argument that some land may be good for fattening store cattle, but if a man wants that land to fatten his cattle, let him not say that he is doing it in the interests of the poor people who want larger farms.  To say that is hypocrisy. The holdings that I have been referring to are not only very small, but the land on them is very bad.  Some of them are crop sick.  They have not been laid down in grass for over 100 years, and some of them for more than 200 years. When you hear a man promoting an agitation to obstruct the release of people from these holdings on the grounds that the land near Dublin is too good for the people, and that it is wanted for the cattle, all one can say is that that sort of opposition is sure to stir up very bad feeling, and in the end will not serve the interests of those who want the ranches retained for fattening store cattle.  I urge on the Minister to speed up as much as possible the work of dividing the land in the western counties.  We have not any fault to find with the inspectors down there at present. They are working very hard sending forward schemes, and I only hope that the schemes will be returned promptly, and that the remainder of the work will be speedily undertaken.</P>

      <P>Colonel O'Callaghan Westropp may have been speaking in the interests of those congests to whom Deputy Sears refers when he warned them off the County Clare.  They might not get a very good reception there.  I think Deputy Nolan has given fairly good advice to the Land Commission with regard to their action at present. If land is divided, and the new holders have to pay an excessive rate per acre for the land they get, then their last condition will be worse than their first. I know cases where land has been divided and where the annuity comes to £2 per acre.  If you add to that 10/- per acre for local taxes, you have an impossible annuity put upon these people.  We all know that the old Celtic hunger for land still exists, and that men will be induced to take up land upon impossible terms in the hope that <Col N="31" /> times may improve or that something may turn up by which their annuities may be reduced, but I suggest it would be a wrong policy to allow them to go in on land on those terms.  I would like to allude to a matter which may not be germane to this particular discussion. I refer to estates purchased by committees. The estates were purchased by these committees on money which they obtained on loan from joint stock banks.  The committees now find that the price at which the Land Commission is prepared to take over the land is a great deal less than what they paid for it originally.  These people, having obtained advances from the banks and guaranteed the loans will, of course, be liable for the money, and if something is not done in the way of coming to their assistance it will simply mean ruin for them.  I hope the Minister and the Land Commission will take their position into consideration and try to do something to relieve them from the awkward position in which they are at present.</P>

      <P>I desire to draw the Minister's attention to decrees got against tenants in the County Cork. Great dissatisfaction prevails amongst the tenants with regard to the machinery set up for the collection of their annuities.  It seems that where a decree has been got by the State Solicitor the tenant sends on the amount of the decree with costs, including the receivable order, to the State Solicitor, who holds it.  The latter, it seems, does not send on the receivable order to the Land Commission.  The tenant waits for but does not get his receivable order from the Land Commission, and the next thing he gets is a second civil bill for another instalment of the annuity which has fallen due.  This is a matter that I would like the Minister to look into.  I believe it is a general thing all over Cork with the State Solicitors.  I would like the Minister to inspect their books over a period, at least, of three months to see that they are correct, and that all the money collected on behalf of the Land Commission is transferred immediately to the Land Commission. If that is done there will be no dissatisfaction <Col N="32" /> among the people.  There is another matter I wish to deal with, and that is the case of chronic defaulters. It seems that Cork, like every other county, has been deprived of its share of the Agricultural Grant because of the fact that there are so many of these chronic defaulters.  I would like to know from the Minister if, in his amending Land Bill, he is taking power to deal with these people, and thus to relieve the local ratepayers of the heavy charges that at present fall upon them because of the remissness of these chronic defaulters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not rise for the purpose of criticising the Land Commission. To a large extent I am very well satisfied with the progress it has made in my constituency within the last few months.  There is one particular case that was brought to the notice of the Land Commission about two years ago, while it was also mentioned in this House on more than one occasion.  It is that of a number of congests situate at a place called The Commons, near Navan.  There are, approximately, 50 congests in this little area, and there is a population of between 300 and 400. The position is very acute there.  The poverty of the people in that particular area is equal to the poverty of the people in the Rosses, or in any portion of the West of Ireland.  The people living on The Commons, at Navan, have not enough land to enable them to graze a sufficient number of cows to keep up a continual supply of milk for the needs of their households.  The result is that they are compelled to walk a mile or a mile and a half to the town of Navan to purchase milk at the highest price.  Very often they are obliged to return without it, as the supply there is not equal to the demand. Deputations have been heard by the Land Commission on several occasions in connection with this matter.  Very flowery promises have been made to the representatives of these people, but so far nothing has been done for them.  I have files and files of correspondence dealing with this matter, while the unfortunate people themselves went to the expense of employing a solicitor to put their case properly before the Land Commission. <Col N="33" /> I think it is very unfair that for over two years they should be left in the position that they are in to-day.</P>
      <P>Last November I was informed that the Buchanan Estate at The Commons, Navan, would be dealt with expeditiously, but nothing has been done there since.  On another occasion I was told that an inspector was to visit this property with a view to its acquisition. My information up to last Friday was that an inspector has not been down there.  That is simply appalling.  Undoubtedly the Land Commission have divided a good deal of land throughout the country, but nowhere did they divide land where the demand was so great for it as in this particular place. As I mentioned, this property is right beside the town of Navan, which has a big population.  It is a serious matter to leave the people suffering as they are while around them are so many big farms.  I hope the Minister will take note of this matter and that it will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible so as to relieve the distress there.  Another matter I wish to mention, but I do not want to stress it very much, is that there are objections to a certain class of people getting land. Instances have come under my notice in County Meath of old people being allotted portions of land&mdash;very feeble old people who are not able to work the land and have no sons, daughters or other relatives who would be able to work an economic or any other class of farm.  Giving land to that particular type of people does not tend to increase production, and it means leaving the lands in the same position as they were before allotment.  There is a case I want to refer to in the Barnewall Estate at Trimlestown, Trim.  I do not want to mention names, but if the Land Commission look it up they will find that an old man there who has no male relatives capable of working land has been allotted land.  He is supposed to have some money of his own and he will be able to pay the annuities, but he will not be able to use the land productively.  There is no benefit derived from the division of land in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another danger in connection with the division of land is the allotting of it to people without capital.  These people <Col N="34" /> are unable to work the land but they put up the case to the inspector of the Land Commission that they are capable of doing so while in reality some landowners in the locality, probably men for whom the applicants might be working, take the land and work it in their names, with the result that the landowners reap the benefit of the division of that land and get the profit out of it.  Again, the allotment of land in that way does not serve the purpose for which it was intended.  I understand such a thing as I have mentioned occurred in a case where a parcel of land was allotted to a man who declined to accept it.  After some days he sent word to the Land Commission that he would have it.  That was after he had a consultation with his master, who came to the Post Office and sent a wire in this man's name saying he would accept the land, and the land was afterwards again allotted to him.  That is a serious matter and should be looked into.  I wish to refer to the Rathregan estate.  I certainly consider it is altogether unreasonable for the Land Commission to hand this estate of in or about 515 acres over to one migrant, leaving the whole estate practically as it was heretofore, with the result that it will be of no material benefit to the people of the locality.  There are some uneconomic holders in that particular district, and as far as my information goes there is no other estate in the district to meet the demands of these uneconomic holders who are endeavouring to exist around Rathregan estate. There are some nine or ten uneconomic holders there who desire to get holdings on that estate.</P>
    <P>I consider, notwithstanding the fact that a migrant is going to be put there, that a certain portion of that estate should be set aside so as to add to the holdings of the uneconomic holders.  I am not protesting against a migrant being brought in, for I admit I was the first who brought this estate before the Land Commission a couple of years ago, and I then mentioned that there would be room for migrants from the west on this estate.  I asked, however, that the Land Commission should give consideration to the few uneconomic holders there who have no other means of extending their holdings except by <Col N="35" /> getting portion of the land of this estate.  I cannot understand why the Land Commission were in such a hurry to acquire this farm and take it over from Mr. Wallis when an immediate demand for the land was not there. Apparently the demand is not there by reason of the fact that the Land Commission have thought well to let the land out on a system under which it has not been let out heretofore.  I think if the Land Commission had not proof positive that they could hand the land over to some person to work it, or become an occupant on the farm, they should have given consideration to the plea Mr. Wallace put to them to allow him to retain the land until he had disposed of the stock he had grazing on that farm.  He had lambs there and other stock, but he was hurried out of the farm on the supposition that someone else was going to walk in a day or two later.</P>
    <P>I think Mr. Wallis was treated in an unreasonable way.  The Land Commission can take time now and let the land the same as they did with the Barnewall Estate when it was let for twelve months.  I ask that consideration be given to the people of the locality when the estate is being allotted.  Deputy Heffernan, when speaking on the division of lands, said this matter should be approached from a non-party point of view.  As far as I am aware, I have more dealings with the land question than any other Deputy in the House, for I have it for breakfast, dinner and supper, and I can say that there has been no party capital made out of this question.  It is wrong to insinuate that the matter of the acquisition and division of lands is based on party lines.  I certainly repudiate that, and I say that I never found it so in the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>As regards the Committee lands, the Minister on the 11th December last said he was going to introduce legislation to deal with them.  I would like the Minister to do something in this respect immediately.  There are many farms in County Meath that were purchased through the banks in the years 1919-1920.  Undoubtedly the people who purchased them paid considerably <Col N="36" /> more than the farms were worth. There was one estate at Creemore, Drumree, near Dunshaughlin.  That estate was purchased by twenty tenants, and undoubtedly they paid too much for it.  They find themselves in the very unfortunate position of having to meet interest and principal in the banks.  They pay 6½ per cent. interest, and they find it a great hardship. On many occasions they have not been able to meet the principal, owing to the fact that they have to pay off the interest and have had very poor returns from their holdings.  I would like the Minister to take some steps to deal with this and other cases of the sort.  There is a somewhat similar case at Boyerstown, Navan, where five people purchased an estate under similar circumstances to those at Creemore. It would be advisable to have cases of that sort dealt with as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>On numerous occasions I tabled questions with the object of getting from the Minister the intention of the Land Commission regarding the Kennedy lands at Trim, Peterstown, Newtown, and Clonobon.  I never could get any satisfaction.  I was invariably told about the Land Commission having a farm at Ardenew, but that farm is only 120 acres in extent, while there are fully 425 acres at Trim.  Mr. Kennedy has a very large holding attached to his residence at Rathcore, near Enfield, but he also has this other holding at Ardenew, near Longwood, County Meath.</P>
    <P>Does the Land Commission ever consider they are treating the uneconomic holders, the people who desire to get accommodation for stock, fairly?  The Land Commission have refused to acknowledge the situation that exists there; they refuse to recognise the demand for grazing and tillage accommodation. The Kennedy lands at Trim surround the town; the town is practically built on this farm.  The people need accommodation very badly.  Milk is very scarce.  Many persons are desirous of taking advantage of a cow plot, if such were provided, and I think every effort should be made to facilitate them.</P>
    <P>Two years ago, in reply to a question, I was informed by the Minister <Col N="37" /> that the Land Commission were considering the question of acquiring a fairly large field known as Lockanash, near Trim, the property of Lord Dunsany, and the intention was to convert it into a cow plot for the accommodation of the people of Trim.  We heard nothing about that since.  I am given to understand that some twelve months ago this field passed into the hands of a local farmer, and the people are now left without it.  I consider that is not treating the people fairly.  It is time the Land Commission dealt with this vacant piece of country belonging to Mr. Kennedy.  It is not used for any other purpose than what Deputy Heffernan referred to yesterday&mdash; finishing live stock.  We have any amount of farms similarly situated.</P>

      <P>We have a right to tell the Minister what the existing grievances are.  We cannot do it through the medium of questions, and if we are not permitted to do it by means of discussions in the House, we cannot do it at all.  I think I am quite within my right in mentioning specific cases.</P>

      <P>I would have stopped the Deputy if I considered he was not within his rights; but I am asking the Deputy to consider the results of every Deputy exercising his rights and the more appalling result&mdash;I call it appalling&mdash;of the Minister exercising his right to reply to questions relating to every estate.  A few moments ago the Deputy mentioned <Col N="38" /> a particular field.  He said it was a large field.  Think of all the large fields in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidHall" hpid="Mr. HALL Mr. HALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the Ceann Comhairle has taken a wrong view of the situation.  The reason I am giving these instances is that there are Land Commission officials present; they can take a note of the matters referred to and, without any reply being given by the Minister, they can deal with those matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidHall" hpid="Mr. HALL Mr. HALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite so, but when these things are mentioned the Minister can have a note taken of them and later on they can be dealt with.  That is the reason why I make these specific references.  There has been very little progress made, and I would impress on the Minister the necessity that exists for speeding up matters.  The Minister should endeavour to expedite the acquisition and division of land.</P>
      <P>References have been made here to the holding up of the Land Commission in the carrying out of its functions under the 1923 Act.  That does not apply to the people of Meath.  That county has been charged with displaying opposition to anybody getting land in the county outside the people residing there.  The people of Meath do not argue on that line.  They believe they are entitled to first consideration, and it is natural that they would claim first consideration.  There are many acres of land in County Meath that can be taken over by the Land Commission and, after supplying the needs of the people of the county, it is my opinion that there will be a surplus of land to meet the requirements of migrants from the west or other portions of the Saorstát.  But there is no use all the time denying the people of Meath the right to the land of Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are numerous evicted tenants in Meath, or the sons of evicted tenants, who claim their right to the land, and it is certainly appalling that the sons of evicted tenants are turned down by the Land Commission.  I feel that the <Col N="39" /> Land Commission should treat these people more equitably than they have been treated.  It is unreasonable to see the son of an evicted tenant, when he makes his application for a holding, and is prepared to work it, pushed out by a man perhaps in receipt of a State pension.  Very often such men who are new arrivals in the county have sufficient money to purchase land in the open market.  That is an unreasonable way of dealing with the question.  Men who are unable to purchase land in the open market should be considered by the Land Commission when they are distributing lands.  There are numerous cases where people who were quite capable of purchasing tenanted land for themselves in the open market got land from the Land Commission when they were dividing farms up.  That is unfair and unreasonable, and is not a proper way of dealing with the situation.</P>
    <P>I was told some time ago of a man who came to Trim and got hold of some land, notwithstanding the fact that he had twenty-three acres already elsewhere. I was told that he was given a holding of thirteen acres, while he had twenty-three acres already.  I think that is an abuse.  It is time that the Land Commission went into this question. They should cease giving land to people who are not entitled to it, and give it instead to those who are entitled to it.</P>
    <P>As to the matter of taking over land upon which rates were due, I got a reply to a question which I put down, and from that I gather that the position is rather a curious one.  According to the answer that I got, the Land Commission will hold the incoming tenant accountable for the rates due.  The new tenant may have come in since the rate warrants were served, or he may have come in since March, or the first week in April.  I hold that it is unreasonable and unfair to ask him to pay rates due by the late occupier.  I think the late occupier should be compelled to pay, or else the Land Commission should accept the liability, and meet the debt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. MURPHY Mr. T. MURPHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little complaint to make about the manner in which the Land Commission does its <Col N="40" /> work generally, and I shall confine myself to one or two small matters on this Vote.  A very large portion of the constituency I represent has been scheduled as a congested area.  So far as I know very little has been done to relieve the position there, and I ask the Minister to state exactly what it is proposed to do for the people of that congested area and what immediate relief they can expect.  I would ask him to tell us what attempts will be made to relieve the awful position prevailing in the islands off the coast of West Cork.  The people there are in a miserable state, and temporary relief will not, to my mind, mean very much.  There must be some radical cure for the position.</P>
      <P>The difficulty I see about the position in the West Cork area is that locally very little land is available for distribution.  For that reason, in regard to any land available for distribution for the relief of congestion, any steps for the taking over of that land by the Land Commission ought to be definite.</P>
      <P>In one particular case I took very serious exception to the action of the Land Commission or the people who were responsible.  I know of a particular holding, very close to the town in which I am living, where an extraordinary position has arisen.  The owner is a bank official resident in Washington, America, for the last thirty years.  The land has been let for grazing for the whole of that time, practically.  As a result of action taken some time ago the Land Commission became interested in having the place acquired.  An inspector was sent down and particulars were obtained.  A preliminary objection was made on behalf of the landlord. I imagine the objection was lodged on behalf of a man who had no interest in it, and who, in fact, signified his intention of getting rid of the place if he could.  There were also some local shopkeepers who had mortgages on the place and who were interested in preventing the people getting it.  At any rate a preliminary objection was made with the Land Commission, and, curiously enough, the proceedings were discontinued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" /> As a result of further representations the case was re-opened.  An objection was again taken, but before the objection was heard the representative of the owner in the country had disposed of it.  People living around this particular district, who have no opportunity of getting a sod of land in that district for the next twenty years, and who unfortunately have not a bit of ground to use for a potato garden or anything else, find themselves confronted with the fact that a farm of seventy or eighty acres is now held by a person who has already sold two farms.  I am satisfied that this very shady transaction was effected for the purpose of defeating the objects of the Land Act, hoodwinking the officials of Land Commission.  I am quite aware that I am not entitled to criticise the action of the learned judge who decided the case, but I am criticising the action of the Land Commission Department that allowed the sale of this farm to a man who already held two, thereby depriving the unfortunate people there, who would make very good use of it, of getting a bit of land.</P>
    <P>Now I want to make a few general remarks.  I was very surprised to hear statements made like that uttered by Deputy Heffernan.  I have a shrewd suspicion that a good many people are thinking that way, but it was amazing that a statement like that should be made in this House.  The effect of the statement was that it would be unwise to break up land used for cattle purposes and to have it divided.  That argument amounts to this: that cattle and bullocks and things like that are more important in the eyes of some people than human beings and human happiness and human progress.  I am afraid, in spite of the very patriotic statement made by Deputy McKenna, Deputy Heffernan is not following on the lines adopted by his forefathers, who were prominent in the agitation that was part of the land movement. Deputy Heffernan is not following the lines of the people who proposed the resolutions to which Deputy McKenna referred.  That is perhaps the mentality of a good many people who profess to be interested in agriculture today. Probably no one would accuse gentlemen like Colonel O'Callaghan <Col N="42" /> Westropp of Clare, or Sir John Keane of Waterford, or Colonel Gibbon of Wexford, or Mr. O'Gorman of Cork of being anxious to break up the ranches in this country.</P>
    <P>Nobody would accuse them of being interested in the welfare of the evicted tenants, and I am quite sure that Deputy Doyle will realise that his plea for the evicted tenants would have very little support from people like them. What I regret very much is that that frame of mind has penetrated the minds of people like Deputy Heffernan who, if they followed in their forefathers' footsteps, should take up an entirely different line.  I would like to add my plea to that of Deputy Doyle's on behalf of the evicted tenants.  I am quite satisfied that the evicted tenants, generally, deserve very well of the people of this country.  I am quite satisfied that they deserve well of the Government, and I am equally satisfied that they have been very seriously neglected in many places.  I would urge upon the Minister to consider the few points that I have tried to make&mdash;the possibility of doing something in the very poor island areas in West Cork for the congests there, and of re-opening, if it is possible to re-open, this particular case referred to, where a very shady and dishonest transaction, in my opinion, has taken place.  I would urge on him to remember the need for doing something for the evicted tenants of the country when amending legislation in connection with the Land Act is taken up.  I quite appreciate the work the Minister has done.  I have no quarrel with the work that has been done.  I would like to pay a tribute to the manner in which the Minister has handled the work of his Department, so far as I know.  Any few criticisms that I have offered are criticisms of a minor nature. I would like to say that I feel that very much has been done by the Land Commission and that if some of the officials of the Land Commission were as keen as the Minister, perhaps something more could have been done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think one of the greatest obstacles to the division of land is the bringing in of congests from outside areas, especially into my district, where the young men are already <Col N="43" /> going to Canada.  They say, and their fathers and mothers say, that it is a terrible thing that they should have to go away to Canada while men are brought in from other districts to take up the land that perhaps their forefathers were evicted from.  I agree with them.  At the same time, the Minister for Agriculture is placed in a rather difficult position, and I would like to help him out.  I suggest that he should bring the single men into these districts and get them married to the girls in the districts.  That may alleviate the trouble that he will meet with in taking them there.  I will give him all the assistance I can.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to hear from the Minister what steps have been taken to acquire the remaining portion of the Pollock estate in County Galway.  People on five or six ranches of close on 5,000 acres on this estate claim to have tenancies from the landlord.  If they have I hold they are bogus tenancies, because they were got, as far as I understand, immediately before the passing of the Act for the purpose of evading it.  I would like the Minister to give some explanation of this matter.  I have only to say, in conclusion, that I endorse everything that has been said by Deputy Michael Doyle and Deputy Murphy with reference to the claims of the evicted tenants.  We all know that evicted tenants made the greatest sacrifices that anyone could be called upon to make.  They sacrificed their homes and their families for the good of their country, and it is a pity if they are going to be neglected now after all the good work they have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is unfair to put me specific questions such as have been put me from various parts of the House on the Estimates. I am not in a position to answer them.  There is the usual machinery of question and answer, and no one can complain that it has not been availed of in connection with the Land Commission work.  There probably have been more questions asked by Deputies in connection with the administration <Col N="44" /> of the Land Act than on any other matter, with the possible exception of unemployment insurance.  It is very easy for Deputies to quote one side of the case which I do not know anything about.  I assure Deputies that I do not carry the facts of every case in my mind.  I admit that I forget particulars of cases even a short time after I answer questions in connection with them.  That is in the nature of the case, because I get five or six questions every day.  I cannot be expected to know of cases that have never been asked of me before and that are sprung on me by way of speeches on the Estimates. If Deputies will just go back and have a look at the questions that have been asked for the last year in connection with the administration of the Land Commission&mdash;if they look at questions in which a very fine case has been made out against the Land Commission, and look at the answers and the supplementary answers&mdash;I think they will find that each case has been fairly met.  It is easy to ask a question and to ask supplementary questions.  If the reply is not full it is easy to put down another question and probe any case to the bottom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am willing to stand the test of an examination of the files of the questions that have been asked in the Dáil in connection with the Land Commission administration, but I cannot answer specific points put to me now in this debate. It is unfair to me and unfair to the Land Commission to put up these points in that way.  Deputy Hall got up and mentioned the case of some old-age pensioner&mdash;some person, I think he said, of 70 years of age&mdash;who got a holding of land.  I never heard of the gentleman before.  I have in my mind similar questions that have been asked of me in the House, and I remember distinctly on examination some new facts emerged which elicited no comments from the particular Deputies who put down the questions.  I cannot promise to deal with the specific points made here, with the exception of one raised by Deputy Murphy.  He asked me a question in connection with this estate.  I replied, and some supplementary questions were asked, and he announced as an alternative to raising the <Col N="45" /> case on the adjournment that he would raise it on the Estimates.  That is quite fair.  I have had warning of that case, but that is the only specific case that I could be asked to answer.</P>
    <P>It is quite evident from the debate that Deputies are beginning to realise that the administration of land purchase is no soft job.  One side of the Dáil wants quicker division.  I could hardly say one Party, because there seem to be differences in all parties in connection with the question.  One Deputy wants quicker division; other Deputies want the Land Commission to slow up; other Deputies want prices to be a lot less; others want to see that anything like confiscation does not take place, and so on.  Other Deputies keep repeating the request that we should deal with the congests, the landless men and the evicted tenants, regardless of the fact that there is not nearly enough land for one of these classes. We have to debate the Land Purchase Act in a cooler atmosphere.</P>
    <P>Deputies will simply have to realise that there is not land there to deal with the whole of any one class that they are fond of mentioning, and that what the Land Commission finds it necessary to do is to make a selection from each class, giving the congests above all others the preference, but at the same time making a selection from each class.  There are cases in which you have to deal with landless men, there are cases in which it is right to deal with evicted tenants, and these cases should be dealt with, but the policy should be the policy I outlined here before, that we should deal with the maximum number of congests and the minimum number of any others. Anyway, in general, it will have to be realised that of every ten deserving applicants for land only one can get it, and when Deputies get complaints in connection with the division of land from their constituents they ought to remember that, and they ought to remember the frame of mind of the nine deserving applicants who are left out, and the ninety-nine undeserving applicants who are left out.  They ought to remember all that, and realise that the stories which they have heard are naturally highly coloured, and that the more a person under a grievance is <Col N="46" /> suffering from what he regards as a deep sense of wrong, the more he is likely to colour the facts, and is likely, at least to some extent, to hide particular aspects of the case which would weaken his own case.</P>
    <P>There are one or two points that I can deal with together.  There is this question raised by Deputy Davin, Deputy Nolan and other Deputies as to price and with it the question of the alleged delay in vesting holdings.  Deputy Davin asked me how many cases came before the Judicial Commissioner and in how many cases had there been an increase in the price.  There are 349 estates priced, that is, estates acquired both compulsorily and voluntarily, and they cost an aggregate price of £1,781,000.  Out of these, 69 estates came before the Judicial Commissioner to price.  The price put on these 69 estates was £409,710, and the price as they emerged from the last process, before the Judicial Commissioner, was £436,576.  Therefore the total increases as the result of being brought before the Judicial Commissioner have been £26,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the acreage, but I will give the Deputy figures which will give him a fair idea of what the acreage would be, because I am coming to another point now. That is the question of the price of land.  Deputy Nolan has put the dilemma in a nutshell.  He wants me to see that a price is given that, from the point of view of the annuitants, will not be too much, and he wants also to see that we should give a fair price.  That is very wise, and I suppose that if Deputy Nolan were the Minister for Agriculture, and if I were <Col N="47" /> in his position, I would be also wise, and I should warn him that he should not be a Bolshevik and that at the same time he should remember the real interests of the annuitants.  It is easy to start out with good intentions in that matter, but it is very hard to square these intentions with the specific facts in each case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. NOLAN Mr. NOLAN">

      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, you have often said that Ministers were delighted with interruptions. Might I have the pleasure of interrupting the Minister now by explaining what I meant?  I meant that they should divide lands in their hands and not take over any other lands or negotiate about any estate until what they have in their hands is divided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying not to be provocative, as the Deputy will realise. I am on the question of the price of lands that we have acquired.  I am pointing out that it is very difficult when you come down to hard facts in each case, to be fair to the owner, to whom he wants me to be fair, and to be fair to the tenant purchaser, who has got to pay the annuity afterwards. Cases were quoted here in which it was alleged the annuities were more than the grazing rents, and Deputy Nolan, when quoting an example of average prices, referred to £40 an acre.  That is again an example of what I complain of.  I have never been asked here a question as to the price of an estate in which, as a matter of fact, the answer elicited that the price was £40 an acre. I have not in my mind any answer that I ever gave which showed that the price was £40 an acre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking the Deputy for particulars of the case now. He can put down a question any time, and I will answer it.  I am saying that in any of the answers which I have given up to the present in connection with the prices of estates, I never remember an answer which showed that the price was £40.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet the discussion went on here on the basis that that was a normal price.  I will give you the normal prices.  I am sorry it is necessary to give these figures, but in order to show the difficulties of the case I must give them.  The average price for Ulster under the Land Act of 1903 was £7.3 per acre; under the Land Act of 1909 it was £15.8 per acre, and under the Land Act of 1923&mdash;so far as we have purchased land, and there are hundreds of thousands of acres purchased&mdash;it was £10.3 per statute acre.  I do not want Deputies now to read too much into these averages.  The price per acre is misleading.  There might be a big estate with a very large proportion of bad land, and whereas the price of each acre might be low, nevertheless the price of the good land and the arable land might be dear, because a big proportion of the land might be worthless. If we have to follow all these prices we should take some lines which would make it possible to compare the figures for 1909 and 1923.  Deputies may take it for granted that the considerations which I have mentioned, namely, the proportion of good land to the bad land, will just as much vitiate the figures for 1909 as for 1923.  You can take it that there would not be more bad land on the 1923 estates than on the 1909 estates, and in that way we can see how they compare.  For Leinster the average price per acre under the 1909 Act was £19.9, practically £20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. NOLAN Mr. NOLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is statute acres?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is easy for the Deputy to add half and he will get an Irish acre.  Under the 1923 Act the average price per acre in Leinster was £16.3.  That is, I believe, about £25 an Irish acre.  The average price for Connaught under the 1909 Act would be £10.2 per statute acre.  Under the 1923 Act it would be £8.3.  I have it here for the different counties.  For Munster, the average price would be £15 per acre under the 1909 Act and £9.7 under the 1923 Act.  These figures are a bit misleading because there <Col N="49" /> might be an estate bought, say, for £4 per acre under the 1923 Act and it would be much dearer than an estate bought under the 1909 Act for £15 or £20 per acre, because of bad land, and <i>vice versa.</i>  There might be an estate bought, say, for £10 an acre under the 1909 Act and it would be much dearer than an estate bought at £20 per acre under the 1923 Act.  Deputies should not read too much into these figures. Everything depends on the quality of the land and the amount of bad land as compared with good land on each estate.  Say that 10,000 acres of land could be bought for £2 an acre, of which 500 acres might be good land, that would work out at £15 an acre.  You can take the same figures into consideration for the 1909 Act as for the 1923 Act.  So far as they are misleading under the 1923 Act they are also misleading under the 1909 Act.  Hence you can compare them.  On looking down my list I think the highest price I can see, taking the average for each county, is for land in Leinster £27 a statute acre.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There is no use going into small details in this matter. I am giving the average price of untenanted lands bought under the 1923 Act for purposes of division.  I think that is plain to every Deputy. I do not know why it is not plain to Deputy Nolan.  Untenanted land means the whole fee-simple, because there is no tenant on it.  The highest price that I can see is £27 an acre, in Dublin; then £20, and next £17.  This list would be correct up to a month ago, and the highest price paid was £27 an acre.  These are the facts.  They look very prosaic when compared with the alleged facts flung about the Dáil a few minutes ago.  Is that land bought too dear?  If it were the settled policy of the Land Commission to buy land at a smaller price, what would some Deputies who are now so keen on buying land cheap say?  You must remember <Col N="50" /> that we would be buying not only the fee-simple but in some cases resuming the lands of tenant purchasers and in some cases resuming the lands of the tenant.  Is it the policy of Deputies to compel the Land Commission to buy land cheaper than that?  There may be dear land amongst that.  I am sure there is.  No machinery is perfect. These are average prices.</P>
      <P>I should get a lead from the Dáil, and especially from the Conservatives, on the question: Should it be the policy of the Land Commission to acquire land much more cheaply than that?  I do not think it should.  Look what it means.  It is £25 an Irish acre for Leinster.  To start with, that means an annuity of 26/-.  That annuity would be only 16/- under the 1903 Act. Am I responsible for the rate of interest? I do not think I am responsible for the fact that the rate of interest is now 4¾% as against 3¼% under the 1903 Act.  The Land Commission is expected to do a lot of things, but it cannot be expected to wipe out at one stroke of the pen all the effects of the European War.  The fact is that we could not get the money at 4¾ per cent. but for the fact that we have forced the owners to take bonds.  It is not the market rate.  There is no use in getting eloquent on this subject; we must face the facts.  The facts are that the Land Commission can hardly he expected to buy land much cheaper and that the Land Commission is not responsible for the fact that the rate of interest is now 4¾% as against 3¼% under the 1903 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out that the annuity on land bought for £25 an acre&mdash;good land &mdash;would be 26/-.  Formerly it would have been 16/-.  Let us suppose there are twenty acres of that land with an annuity of 26/- bought at £25 an acre and, in addition, that we lend the tenant purchaser three hundred pounds or four hundred pounds to build a house.  I have been pressed here to make those loans.  It has been pointed out that there is no use in throwing a man land and telling him that he will have to do what he can with it.  I am told that he must be given a house, and that he must have the means of fencing.  We can only afford to give a small proportion of the <Col N="51" /> money we have on the Estimate as grants.  We must give some of it on loan and the loan is repayable in sixty years and bears interest at four and three-quarter per cent.</P>
    <P>If we give that man £300 by way of loan, we add about eleven or twelve shillings to his annuity.  That will be about thirty-six or thirty-seven shillings that he will have to pay.  If that man comes from Limerick, he will rush to Deputy Nolan and say: &ldquo;This is a nice performance.  This land was bought by the Land Commission at so much and here am I paying forty shillings per acre annuity.&rdquo;  That is what was happening in the case of every Deputy.  If you make inquiries as to how much of that payment represents actual purchase annuity and how much of it represents repayment of the loans that we are giving, you will find that the real grievance, in a great many cases, is in respect of the money lent for building houses&mdash;money which is lent at an extraordinarily low rate and on extraordinarily accommodating terms as regards sinking fund.  Take the case that Deputy Murphy mentioned.  That farm of seventy or eighty acres.  I think, is a purchased farm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, let us suppose a case in which seventy or eighty acres of land were previously purchased, that there is a local agitation for taking that land up and that the Land Commission propose to take it up.  They buy it at £20 per acre.  You start then with an annuity of nineteen shillings. If the Land Commission had to redeem the annuity on that land it would take £1,000.  That would bring the annuity up to thirty-eight shillings.  That shows how land bought at £20 per acre could start with an annuity of nineteen shillings. If the land were previously purchased and there was a charge or annuity on it, as is often the case, or if it was tenanted land, and the Land Commission had to buy the tenant's interest as well as the landlord's interest, that might increase the annuity up to forty shillings.  These are factors over which I have no control.  I cannot <Col N="52" /> solve these difficulties.  Deputies should realise that they are there and that they make land purchase extraordinarily difficult.</P>
      <P>That is the reason why we must have such a big sum for improvements under the Improvements sub-head.  We realise that we cannot make big loans and that we must be prepared to make bigger grants than we used to make in the past.  We would like that loans would form a larger proportion of that money, but we find that we cannot arrange that.  If we lend instead of making a grant for a house, we find that the charge on the land is too heavy.  Experience tells us that we must be prepared to lose considerable sums of money in order to make land purchase an economic proposition, in view of the high rates of interest.</P>
      <P>I have been asked to divide the land that is in hands and not do any more. Anybody who knows the difficulties of land purchase will see that that is impossible. I am afraid some Deputies are thinking of conditions in their own district.  If you go down to Mayo you will not be in a position to buy a big estate, because there are no big estates to be bought.  You will get the land in blocks of one hundred or two hundred acres, and you will find fifty or sixty congests about.  To deal with them would require three times as much land as you have got.  You have, say, a block of 350 acres.  That will deal with only ten congests.  There may be another estate adjoining of 1,000 acres.  If you could get that, you could deal with them all at the same time.  If you cannot get that, the difficulties of choosing ten out of fifty congests are overwhelming.  You will also find that one of the congests has a fairly big holding, and that if you take him out and purchase his holding you can deal with two of his neighbours and then deal with himself on the estate you have just bought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The long and short of it is that when you buy land in a congested district you find that in order to make the whole proposition economic, in order to have a state of affairs whereby people will not have to cart, say manure long distances from their houses to the holdings for tillage purposes, <Col N="53" /> you have to purchase another block of land close by in order to put the scheme through.  As a matter of practice, that is so.  That is the reason that the Land Commission, when they have got a little piece of land, have to wait on until they get more.  That is the reason they have been unable to vest certain lands which they have had in hands for a long time.  The Land Commission has, in fact&mdash;I am speaking now of the operations of the 1903 and 1909 Acts&mdash;vested 20,000 holdings comprising 6,634 acres.  There is almost as much more in hands.  In 1923 land purchase had to be stopped for a great many reasons.</P>
    <P>When the Land Commission in 1923 was amalgamated with the Congested Districts Board, there were huge areas of land, purchased under the 1903 and 1909 Acts, unvested.  That had to be done.  A lot has been done.  The more of that is vested the more difficult it is to vest the rest.  You are left with the tail-end of an estate, and it is difficult to divide that.  If we are to divide land judiciously, we must get time.  Schemes of division cannot be rushed.  If they are, the wrong men will get the land. If the Land Commission are expected to divide land quickly, they really cannot be expected to divide it fairly; they must, in that case, have regard not so much to the equities of the case as to a scheme that will pass muster for the moment.  It is very easy to put through a scheme if you give the land to the wrong men.  They are very often the strongest people in the neighbourhood. But if you are to be in a position to stand over the scheme absolutely when finished, you must take time.</P>
    <P>As regards Mayo, there were about two thousand acres divided under the 1923 Act and 60,000 or 70,000 acres divided under previous Acts.  I was asked how many migrants there have been out of Mayo.  There have been thousands and thousands.  A very big proportion of the lands of the midlands, which have been bought and on which big farmers have been placed, are really lands that were divided, if I may put it that way, in Mayo.  These big farmers, to a large extent, came from Mayo. Land purchase in places like Mayo is not one process but two processes.  You <Col N="54" /> have first to take up the land of the farmers&mdash;they are really big farmers and not landlords&mdash;there.  Then you have to acquire land for them elsewhere. Having done that, you come back and divide their land.  A very big area has been acquired all over the country and a large number of farmers have been migrated there from places like Mayo, in order to deal with the congestion existing there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey asked me two questions. He asked if capital was essential for a tenant purchaser.  It is not.  He asked if capital was essential for a landless man.  It is not.  Capital is always useful, but it is not by any means essential.  The Land Commission, in considering this question, regard the character of the man as well as the capital he has.  They even pay more attention to the man's character.  Capital is not essential for a tenant purchaser. A knowledge of farming and a reputation for industry is the first essential.</P>

I can assure the Deputy, and I am in a position to see to it, that that will not be the policy of the Land Commission. Everyone knows that a good farmer's son, even a small farmer's son, or a labourer used to farm work, is often a far better and a more desirable tenant purchaser than another man with capital.  On the other hand, capital is distinctly useful to these men.</P>

A tenant in a labourer's cottage is not disqualified thereby from benefiting by the division of land.  That was expressly safeguarded in the 1923 Act.  We select tenants of labourers' cottages wherever it is desirable, and wherever the circumstances warrant it.</P>

I can only say here is a case in which there are 70 or 80 acres of land near a town.  It is a palpably small farm.  There was an application that it should be acquired and divided. That was heard by the Commissioners. Proceedings were discontinued.  The Commissioners, in deference to representations made locally, re-opened the case.  The case came before the Commissioners. They decided to acquire and then it went before the Judicial Commissioner.  He, in his judicial capacity, decided that the land should not be acquired, and I think it is not open to us to argue the question any further.  I did not know until this <Col N="56" /> minute that it had gone as far as the Judicial Commissioner.</P>

I was glad to get the figures for the sixty-nine estates, because a feeling has gone abroad that prices were being unduly increased by the Judicial Commissioners on appeal, which did not appear to be justified by the figures which the Minister has given to-day.  In order to arrive at an accurate view of the cases which went before the Judicial Commissioner the Minister should give us the acreage for which this £20,000 increase has been paid.  I want to warn the Minister not to adopt the views of Deputy Gorey <Col N="57" /> and Deputy Nolan.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only about 240,000 acres of woodland in the Free State.  That represents 1.2 per cent. of the total land surface, which is a very small percentage compared with any other country in Europe which is suitable for growing trees.  The policy of the Forestry branch is to increase the woodland area to, at least, five per cent. of the total land surface.  That would entail the planting of 600,000 additional acres, in addition to conserving the 240,000 acres of woodland already in existence.  The main difficulty about forestry is that land is wanted for some other purpose.  Mountain land is not suitable for afforestation and a large percentage of the lands which are suitable are required for what is regarded as a more urgent purpose, such as the relief of congestion. 400 acres is regarded as an economic unit, and if that amount of land is obtained, similar units can be grouped about it.  The total area of forest land acquired is 33,000 acres, 21,000 of which have been purchased in fee simple.  Close on 7,000 acres of that were obtained from the Department of Defence and negotiations are proceeding for the acquisition of a further 11,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past season 3,043 acres were planted, and for this purpose 6,000,000 trees were required.  The principal varieties used were Douglas fir, Scots pine, larch, common and sitka spruce, silver fir and Corsican pine, etc.  The Department were able to supply about 3,000,000 trees from their own nurseries for last year's planting, and the others were got from various sources.  The total area planted during the last five years was 10,611 acres.  In 1921-22 the number of acres planted was 707; in 1922-23, 959; in 1923-24, 1,176; in 1924-25, 2,210; and in 1925-26, <Col N="60" /> 3,043.  Considerably more will be planted this year because Deputies will notice that for cultural operations there is this year a sum of £29,000 as against £24,000 last year.  The number of workmen employed is, roughly, 100 permanent men and 260 seasonal men. It is hoped to purchase in addition about 3,000 acres this year, and in addition plant about 3,500 acres.  I do not think that I need say anything on the sub-heads, as they speak for themselves. The important sub-head is C 2, which amounts to £29,000 as against £24,000 last year, and that refers both to the maintenance of land and to cultural operations.  This year for these two purposes as well as for the acquisition of land under sub-head C (1) the sum is £34,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to suggest to the Minister that he might take steps to wind up the Forestry Fund. I have been looking at the Estimate for the last few years, both in the Dáil and the Public Accounts Committee, and I see no particular reason why these sums should be retained as grants-in-aid when so many funds have been wound up and are now treated as ordinary estimates.  I see no definite reason why you should keep this estimate in the form of grants-in-aid.  Apparently, from the figures before us, it is quite easy to estimate the exact cost of this service for the year.  I think it would tend to uniformity if the estimates were put down in the ordinary form.  Under sub-head C 2, which is the main one, Deputies, as it stands here, have no information as to how the money is spent. The main sum in the estimates amounts to £34,000, of which £5,000 is to be spent on the acquisition of land, but we have no information as to the charges in regard to the £29,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Estimates were set out as Estimates for the Department of Agriculture we would have more information as to the exact cost of the services, how much is spent on charges, and how much on other matters.  I am glad to see that the expenditure has been increased this year.  I wonder also if the Minister would give us some information with regard to forestry education and as to whether any progress has been made in that <Col N="61" /> direction.  The Minister did not mention it in his statement.  I do not know whether we should deal with the sub-heads separately or together.</P>

In sub-head A I notice that the head of the Department has been changed from &ldquo;Assistant Commissioner&rdquo; to &ldquo;Director.&rdquo; I do not know if that has any significance.  I suppose it is only a change in the name.  If I understood the Minister rightly, apparently 33,000 acres have been acquired, and so far the acreage planted is about 10,000. These are the figures he gave.  Therefore apparently there must be 22,000 or 23,000 acres still in the possession of the Department and not yet planted. Would it not be better to spend more money in planting that area instead of spending it in the acquisition of land when there is so large a quantity of land still untenanted?</P>

I believe there are nurseries here and there throughout the country that could be used for this purpose, and so avoid sending the money away.  I have no fault to find with the way in which forestry is being managed by the Department.  In my district it gives very much-needed employment.  I would be the last to say anything against the way in which it is managed.  I only want to suggest to the Minister that he might in future, instead of sending money out of the country for these trees, arrange to have these young trees grown in the country and keep so much money at home and give employment here.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister if any grants-in-aid are being given to county councils who have forestry schemes set on foot.  In my county the county council have been <Col N="62" /> fortunate enough to have acquired a considerable amount of woodlands on very easy terms.  Some of these require planting to replace the timber that is being cleared out.  What I wish to know is if any grants-in-aid are being given to the councils for this work or has the work been altogether paid for out of the rates?</P>

      <P>Complaints are being made about the dearth of timber in the vicinity of Stranorlar in the northern part of Donegal.  I have been asked to bring the matter before the Minister.  The whole country around there has been denuded by the contractors who have purchased the woods.  The local people object to it very much.  It would be desirable if the Minister or his Department could exercise some authority in that matter. I would like to urge the Minister and the Department to go in more extensively for re-afforestation schemes in Donegal.  The congested districts of the county would lend themselves much to this form of industry.  I would ask that this matter be taken up seriously. I do not know what is being spent at present on forestry in Donegal, and if there is nothing, I suggest that there should be some money spent there every year by the Department in tree-planting. In parts of the county at least this is most necessary.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister if it is his intention to make any arrangements whereby farmers would be able to plant small belts of trees.  I approve of his policy in regard to afforestation in general knowing how important it is for the country. But a difficulty seems to arise in connection with the provision of small shelter belts by farmers.  I think a good deal of the denudation that has taken place is due to the cutting of trees by farmers.  The Minister is aware that the cutting of fence timber is often really an advantage to the land, fence timber being injurious, whereas on the other hand shelter belts in suitable places are most useful, and they certainly improve the value of the land.  As far as I know, there are no arrangements by which loans or grants can be obtained for the planting <Col N="63" /> of such belts.  Farmers are naturally slow to plant those belts of trees because the return from them takes such a long time to come in.  Life is short and, money being scarce, farmers are naturally slow to plant trees from which they will not get any advantage in their lifetime, perhaps.</P>
      <P>I know considerable portions of waste and semi-waste land, barren or semi-barren hills that would grow timber. Farmers would be anxious to plant those hills if they could get some aid by way of grant or loan.  I suggest, without giving very much consideration with regard to a system of advances, that something might be done whereby advances would be made that would not be repayable at once.  Farmers naturally would be slow to look for advances or loans which they would have to start repaying immediately. However, I do not intend to stress that point.  At any rate I think the idea with regard to advances should be considered.</P>

It is a very interesting occupation and a work of national importance.  I think it deserves more consideration from the Department than the £150 down here.  I urge the Minister to increase that amount to a much larger sum so as to enable a School of Forestry to be established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Esmonde is right about the giving of more information in the Estimate as to what makes up the £29,000.  That is a matter that is worth considering&mdash; whether the form of the Estimates should not be changed with a view to giving more information on that point <Col N="64" /> to Deputies.  This sub-head C 2 for £29,000 is made up as follows:&mdash; For new buildings, roads, bridges, equipment, etc., the approximate capital expenditure is £1,000.  For fixed annual charges covering rents on leased properties, annuities on estates acquired under the Land Acts, rates etc., approximately £3,000.  For maintenance which provides for foresters' and foremen's wages, caretaking, repairs to building, fencing materials, tools, etc., approximately £8,500.  Cultural operations cover the normal operations incidental to the working of forests exclusive of maintenance charges and is estimated at £16,500.  I think that gives in some detail information as to how the £29,000 is made up.</P>
      <P>There are some county schemes, but they do not seem to be developing.  We make grants of, roughly, £20 to a county council, for every acre under nurseries, and in addition pay for a forester for two years.  I think that answers Deputy Heffernan's query also. These grants are made to the county council on an acreage basis.  Any county council that adopts the scheme and that starts a nursery will get £20 for every acre planted, and we reimburse to them the wages of the forester during the first two years of the scheme. One of the conditions of the scheme is that the county council shall sell the young trees to the farmers at cost price. The horticultural instructor acts as a go-between the farmer and the county council.  That looks a sound enough scheme if it were only taken up more widely.  The grant is a fairly considerable one, and the wages of a competent man for two years is even more important still.  Then the condition under which the trees are sold at cost price to the farmer seems to me to be reasonable. The scheme, however, has not been taken up by a great many county councils, but it is the only scheme in existence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not give any grants in respect of land that has been permanently planted.  We do give grants in respect of nurseries.  The whole idea of the scheme is to provide nurseries from which farmers can get trees at cost price.  It would land the State into very considerable expenditure if grants were given in respect of areas actually planted out with permanent timber by the county council, and I think it is a sounder policy to divert all the money that is available for cultural operations through the Forestry Branch of the Department with a view to extending the area planted in the country.  It would be a complete change if we allowed each county council to do the kind of work that should be done by the Forestry Branch, to start planting out large areas of permanent timber. I do not think that the county councils would be likely to take that up. It would mean a big staff and a special branch under the county council.</P>
      <P>If it were to be done properly at all it would have to be highly organised, and I do not think it likely that the county council would have the staff or the organisation to take charge of big planted areas.  I think that that work should be left to the Forestry Branch, and the real question at issue is as to whether the Forestry Branch should not plant a much larger area and proceed further with their schemes.  I do not think it would be sound to transfer portion of that work to each county council.  What we do is to give inducements to the county councils to have nurseries and to sell the trees to the farmers at cost price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Deputy ought to say that they do not approve of it, because this is the first time I have ever heard the proposition made that the county councils should plant out forestry areas.  If that suggestion had come from the county councils it would have to be considered a little more fully than I have considered it now, because it has never been considered at all.  It is the policy of the Forestry Branch to take over any areas which contain valuable trees and which are of sufficient size to be worked economically.  They are doing that; they are taking over such areas from the Land Commission and from private individuals, and I am quite sure they will be glad to take over such areas from the county councils if they were offered and if they were economic. That, I think, answers Deputy Heffernan's question with regard to arrangements to enable farmers to plant trees.</P>
      <P>I have said what the county councils scheme is.  We have only a very small item here for education and at present the question is under discussion with the Minister for Finance as to whether some changes should not be made in that particular service.  That small sum is to pay the expenses of the few apprentices that we have at various centres for educational purposes. Money is sent out of the country for trees, and obviously the figures which I gave are an explanation of that.  Six million trees were planted last year. That is a very big number.  We were able to supply three million from our own nurseries, and we were able to buy a considerable percentage from other nurseries in the country, but we had to buy a certain percentage outside.  This country, after all, is not noted for forestry development, and it is not likely that at any time we would be able to obtain sufficient young trees for any kind of ambitious programme. With an increased programme, it is not likely that we would be able to obtain sufficient trees in the country to plant the area available.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not quite meet my point.  I knew about the system of nurseries under the county councils, but I suggested rather a different idea.  I suggested advances to the farmers for the purpose of planting, say, shelter belts, perhaps areas that might be somewhat larger than shelter belts, but which would not be large enough to be dealt with economically by the Department. The Minister gave 400 acres as the smallest area that could be dealt with economically by the Department, but a farmer might have 40 acres that he would like to plant.  The justification for my request for such advances is that not only would they be advantageous to the farmer but to the nation in general, because it is generally agreed that a bigger area under forestry would be of general advantage to the nation from climatic and other points of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very long Bill and I would not like to begin it. There are a great many sections in it. Deputy Sears asks if bigger areas could be planted in the congested districts. Of course they could, but it would mean a great deal more money.  There are other limitations besides the amount of money.  On the Estimate this year there is a sum of £34,000 for forestry, and if there was twice as much money there could be twice as much for forestry. That is what it comes to.  It is an old question whether the money could not be used to better advantage in some other direction.  Personally, I would be anxious to see the forestry programme speeded up.  I admit that <Col N="68" /> the amount of land planted is comparatively small, and that there would be a justification for spending bigger sums on forestry each year.  But to do anything like what Deputy Sears seems to have in his mind&mdash;to plant large areas in the congested districts&mdash;you would want very big sums of money indeed, running into hundreds of thousands of pounds, and then you would be up against other limitations.  First of all, you will be up against the limitation of finding suitable trees.  There is another point, and it is that a very big area of the land which the Deputy seems to have in his mind as suitable for planting and which may not look well is really good mountain grazing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the mountains in Mayo and Kerry afford really excellent grazing for mountain ewes, and are possibly the most valuable adjunct that the small farmer has.  A small farmer in either of these counties may have a holding of only five or six acres, but in addition he has grazing rights on three or four hundred acres of mountain and is generally well off. The mountain could not be divided. It is held in common, as a rule, and carries 20, 30 or 40 mountain ewes for each man.  That would mean a proportionate number of lambs, or say £100 for each man.  That is the reason why even in the very poor districts of Kerry where there is a lot of commonage of that sort, and where the holdings are extremely small and look extremely poor, the people are, comparatively speaking, in comfortable circumstances compared with people in other districts who have bigger holdings.  You would be up against a real difficulty at once if you attempted to go in for an ambitious scheme of forestry which contemplated taking a part of some of these areas the Deputy has spoken of and which might not appear to be very valuable.  You generally find that these mountains are covered with mountainy cattle and sheep.  The opposition to taking them over would be intense.  I think any scheme that contemplated taking some of them over would be unsound, apart from the opposition to which I have referred.  There are, of course, mountains <Col N="69" /> that are no good for grazing. If you confined yourself to these the question then arises: are they any good for forestry?</P>
    <P>You generally find, I think, that the mountains that are excellent for grazing are also excellent for forestry purposes, and that mountains that are no good for grazing would be no good for forestry.  You might find some mountains, of course, no good for grazing that might be useful for forestry. The sort of trees to be planted would have to be chosen very carefully, and I can quite see that it might not be easy to get them in a short time.  They would have to be grown and planted out for the purpose.  There are all these limitations against entertaining a big, ambitious forestry programme at the moment.  I do not know that there are other and more urgent credit needs than the one Deputy Heffernan has referred to, namely, loans for individual farmers for planting. If I were to make a list of them I know a hundred and one needs that the individual farmer would want loans for, and that, perhaps, are all fairly reasonable.  You might make the same suggestion about any thing else.  The individual farmer could influence his county council to adopt the scheme that some county councils have adopted.  We pay a subsidy to nurseries owned by county councils, and we also pay the services of the forester for two years.  Under this scheme the farmer could get the trees at cost price. So far as the trees are concerned, it becomes an inexpensive operation.  I think that meets the case.  I am afraid I cannot hold out any hope to the Deputy that we will cull out this particular service and make loans in respect of it to individual farmers.  I do not think any farmer is stopped from planting his land with shelter beds from the money point of view in view of the facilities offered and in view of its comparative cheapness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>About £31,000.  The credit societies were criticised very strongly at first, and people announced that they would die before they would have them.  Every attempt was made to get loans direct.  Naturally that is the easiest and most satisfactory way for the borrower, whatever about the State.  Everyone is anxious&mdash;we are all individualistic in this country especially when it comes to a question of credit&mdash;to get money direct, and for a long time the credit societies stopped dead because the people hoped that the Government would relent and that the money would be advanced in a way that was regarded by possible borrowers as more satisfactory.  As it became quite plain that we intended to <Col N="71" /> stick to the idea of credit societies, and that the people had to make use of this very reasonable scheme which we propounded, then the credit societies began gradually to spread, and to spread in the areas where they were needed most, with one exception, the County Clare.  There has not been a society established there yet.  I hope there will be soon.  Anyway, up to the 18th May last the number of credit societies established was twenty-one and the total advances made by the State amounted to £33,687; that is to say, the cash transactions of these societies would be about £50,000 or very near the amount the Northern Government has put out.  I believe myself that the whole sum which I am asking for will be absorbed this year. The first State advance made to any society was issued on 3rd October last and progress has since been steady. The preceding period from May to October, entailed considerable propaganda work on the part of the organisers. The following is a list of the societies, showing the State advances made to them and the corresponding local deposits:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County Cavan&mdash;Killinagh Credit Society, State advances, £369; deposits, £203 14s. od. Scrabby Co-operative Society, State advances, £330; deposits, £165.  These are the only two societies formed in Cavan up to the present, but I think there will soon be more.  County Donegal&mdash; Tullynaught agricultural bank, State advances. £503; deposits, £335 10s. County Kerry&mdash;Ballymacelligott co-operative credit society, State advances, £5,317; deposits, £2,658 10s.; Gneeveguilla co-operative credit society, State advances, £720; deposits, £360.  Milltown and Ballyhar agricultural bank, State advances, £1,491 10s.; deposits, £759.  Tralee credit society, State advances, £7,416; deposits, £3,708.  In Leitrim there are six societies.  Leitrim is a very poor county and to my mind it is particularly suitable for credits of this sort, or to put it the other way, credits of this sort are particularly suitable for conditions in Leitrim. <Col N="72" /> Carrigallen credit society, State advances, £1,536: deposits, £768.  Cloonmorris, State advances, £1,186; deposits, £790 18s. 10d. Cornageeha credit society, State advances, £204; deposits, £102.  Eslin Bridge credit society, State advances, £988; deposits, £494.  Gorvagh, State advances, £876; deposits, £584, and Kiltoghert credit society, State advances, £400; deposits, £200.</P>
    <P>These are all new societies.  There has been practically £3,000 put up in deposits in Co. Leitrim to over £6,000 given by the State.  Leitrim is a poor county and these are all small societies. A point I want to stress is that this money has in the main been put up by farmers, small farmers, and the same applies to other counties also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one society, I think, in Carrigallen, but I cannot pick out for you now one or two old societies that may have been established. There may have been three of them established, but you may take it that the bulk of the deposits are all new and have been put in since the fluke outbreak.  There may have been one or two of the old societies in Leitrim, but there are six societies there now.  I think Carrigallen was in existence, but if it was, there was £768 put in in deposits since, and the State has made an advance of £1,536.  County Limerick seems to be very much in love with this particular scheme, though it is not by any means a poor county. There are five societies in that county, only with two of which, strange enough, we have had some trouble&mdash;with the Ballyhahill society and the Glin society.  I think they are working all right now.  They got over £8,000 from the State, and they put in £4,000 or £5,000 in deposits.  In Co. Longford there is one at Killoe; in County Louth, one at Cooley, and in County Monaghan there is a society at Ballynode. Societies are being formed at Listowel, and Newtownsandes, County Kerry; Owenmore, Co. Sligo; and Clare Island, County Galway.  This will bring the total to 25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> I believe every penny that has been voted will be absorbed by the end of the year for this purpose, and two years after the event I am absolutely satisfied that it is the right way to give credit, especially in the really poorer areas.  These societies are being organised by the I.A.O.S., and I impressed on that society the necessity for the very closest supervision.  I believe the closest supervision is being kept on the operations and on the personnel of the societies.  It is obvious to anyone who knows the country that there could be a certain amount of wrangling in connection with these societies.  Certain attempts were made in that direction in one or two cases, but I have taken care to have had three or four inspections of these societies within the last few months.  From the reports I have got I am satisfied with the personnel of these societies, with the committee, and with the general management of the societies.  I am satisfied that the money is being lent for right purposes, that the security is good, that the whole point of view is sound, that the money is to be repaid, and that the money is used in a thrifty and economical manner.  I anticipate the minimum amount of trouble from these societies, but the trouble will come undoubtedly when the money has to be collected again.  It is a question that will have to be considered whether in some cases a certain amount of extra time should not be given.  I think that is the scheme as originally framed, and we can readapt it as it works out, when we will see the weaknesses of the scheme so far as they will show themselves.  We can then deal with any new points, and with any gaps that need to be closed.  Any other things that need to be done can be done as societies are re-organised and as we see their strong points and weak points. In a word, I am satisfied with the way these societies are going on, and I hope and think they will spread.</P>

In the majority of cases it has been of no benefit to the individuals or districts that needed it most.  Ballymacelligott, which was mentioned by the Minister, is probably one of the most prosperous districts in Kerry.  More money was lent to that society than to any other, and I suppose correspondingly more deposits were put down in that society. We would have no objection to this in normal times; it would then be good, but it does not serve the particular object we wanted one and a half years ago.  It has not relieved the people who suffered most.  In the majority of cases it has not reached the sufferers. What we had to say to the scheme on the last occasion we have to say to it now.  Time has justified what we did say; it did these people no good.  In Clare nothing has been done.  Limerick has five new societies.  Credit societies were needed most in West Limerick. I do not know anything in regard to Galway or Mayo; I do not know what has been done there.  We hear a great deal of complaints from those places. There is no doubt the scheme is a perfectly sound one, but it has not done what the Minister said it would do; it has not relieved the position created by the fluke epidemic.</P>

      <P>The Minister's explanation in regard to this Vote is very interesting.  It rather leads one to think that the outlook in regard to this matter will necessarily be changed in the near future.  Assuming these credit societies will progress at the rate the Minister has indicated they have so far progressed, on the basis of advancing £2 for every £1 contributed locally, it would seem that the possibilities of <Col N="75" /> extension are unlimited.  As the people recognise the advantage of getting £2 for £1, it may ultimately grow into a very big business.  Does the Minister contemplate any such thing, or is there any limit?</P>

      <P>I know there is a limit in the Estimate, but judging by the progress made so far in regard to the foundation of these credit societies, it would appear the possibilities are unlimited.  Does the Minister imagine that at the end of the period intended he will get all the money back?  Is it not likely there will be an application for a renewal of these societies for other purposes?  The societies were started in connection with the fluke disease.  The proposition was then put forward that the fund was needed to meet a certain state of affairs in connection with which relief was necessary.  As time progresses I think the Dáil will have to face the continuation of a similar scheme.  How does the Minister expect to wind up this scheme?</P>

      <P>I do not think I can join in the congratulations which the Minister offers to himself for having succeeded in starting 21 societies.  The total number started does not represent one for each county of the Saorstát. The Minister admits that two or three of the 21 societies are old societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. COLE Mr. COLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount involved is £33,000, I understand.  The aim sought in establishing these societies was to meet the needs of the small farmers. This has not been done.  The most of the money that was advanced by these societies was advanced to people who requested a few pounds in order that they might get a cheap loan afterwards. The societies have not catered for the small farmer who wanted money and who was in a bad position. Many of the small farmers found themselves in a difficult position; they were not even able to pay their rates.  They <Col N="76" /> had to borrow money at exorbitant interest; there was no other way out of it.  It really meant chasing the last beast out of the field.</P>
      <P>The last time this matter was under discussion I endeavoured to show the Minister that in lending £200 to make a total of £300, the cost to the Government would be at least £10, calculated at 5 per cent.  If the Government would lend money to the farmers at 2½ per cent. and pay the other 2½ per cent. to the bank, on the £300 they would be paying only £7 10s. and the farmer would be paying the other £7 10s.  All this could be done on the security of the land.  That has been done in the North where the Government has advanced money to the same extent as we have advanced money. In the case of the North the money has been advanced to one county. There was practically no fluke in the Northern counties; it was only in Fermanagh that the trouble existed.  I think the Government should reconsider the matter and see if they could not advance money to the farmers through the banks at a small rate of interest.  That is the only way to meet the difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

      <P>Deputy Gorey insists on being pessimistic about this thing.  I never claimed that the money reached everyone who lost cattle, or that it even reached every county where cattle were lost.  I do make some claims, however, in regard to these credit societies, and these claims are borne out by facts I have given.  Clare is a very difficult county to organise.  There was extreme opposition to these credit societies from the beginning on the part of people who thought they would prefer to get loans and grants direct. We need not shut our eyes to the fact that numbers of people wanted grants. I do not suggest that Deputy Gorey said that; but throughout the country people were hoping they would get grants, and if they did not get them they would get the next best thing, a good loan.  They would get that loan individually, and no one would know anything about it.  While that spirit was there, it was extremely difficult to organise these societies.  This scheme has not reached Clare; it has done no <Col N="77" /> good to Clare, because it did not touch on that county yet.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It has not reached Galway, and there is no great need for it there.  There were a number of arguments put up against these societies, and the question was asked, where were the unfortunate people to get the money?  Everyone who knows the country knows well that that is all nonsense.  Where there is a will there is a way, and where there is a question of putting down one pound as a deposit to secure two pounds, everyone knows it will be forthcoming.  Everyone knows also that it is a guarantee of the <i>bona fides</i> of the matter, and that has been proved by what has happened. Take the County Leitrim. Leitrim is a far poorer county than Clare.  The farmers are poorer there; the holdings are smaller, and certainly the fact that these societies were organised in such a widespread way and that the depositors were found, is a convincing and unanswerable proof that these societies could be organised in Clare if there was the same goodwill shown.  In fact, things are changing there, and I have every hope that we will be able to organise societies in Clare as we have done in Leitrim.</P>
      <P>Take Leitrim.  I have a summary of the numbers registered there.  The Carrigallen Society has deposits to the extent of £768.  It is an old society, which has done very little business.   was completely reorganised so as to come under the Department's credit schemes.  Cloonmorris is an old society with a good business reputation.  A State advance was made.  It is one of the few cases of an old society with existing deposits.  Now, the purpose for which the loans were granted was the re-stocking of the land.  These are the only two old societies, and in regard to the first of them, the Carrigallen Society, the deposits are new. Now take Cornageeha Co-operative Credit Society&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is in Leitrim. I am dealing with Leitrim as a sample <Col N="78" /> county.  This is a new society registered on the 8th February.  All the committee are farmers, and all the loans issued were for the purpose of purchasing cattle.  The members are showing a keen interest in the Society's work.  Eslin Bridge Society is a new society.  The deposits amounted to £494 and the State advanced £988.  The membership which is drawn from various localities around Mohill is made up of all farmers and in nearly all cases the loans issued by the society were for the re-stocking of farms.  The committee aimed at encouraging the purchase of milch cows so as to restore the milk supply to the local creamery.</P>
      <P>Gorvagh Society is an old society, Kiltoghert is a new society.  The report of the Department was that nearly all the borrowers were farmers in and around the district, where the heavy fluke losses made the people very anxious to obtain the benefits of the scheme.  I am expecting to have more societies registered in Leitrim.  Surely anyone will see that if this scheme can succeed in Leitrim it should succeed elsewhere.  There is, fortunately, some goodwill now and I am confident that the societies will spread.  I have reports not only from the I.A.O.S. officials but from officers in the Department in reference to these societies.</P>
      <P>Take Ballymacelligott.  This is a poor district.  Take the loss of cattle. A senior organiser, reporting on the work of the society, stated, &ldquo;There can be no doubt that the loans which have been issued were granted with more care than could be exercised by the manager of a joint stock bank in the ordinary course of his business and on at least as good security as he would require.&rdquo;  The society works in close touch with the local creamery committee.  When the society was last reported on, its loans had in every case been made for the purchase of cattle. The committee found it necessary to refuse loans to some applicants.</P>
      <P>I personally am quite satisfied with the progress which is being made. There are two societies in Cavan.</P>

The society operates in an area on the border, between the counties of Cavan and Longford.  The district being very poor, the State advanced £330.  In Leitrim, Kerry and Donegal these societies have spread.  If you take the areas into account there should be an end once and for all to all this talk that these societies could not succeed because you would not get local assistance. You can get it.  We can debate whether we should extend this scheme on another Estimate.  We want this money voted now for the purpose of the Credit Societies on the terms already given.

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that this Vote is a rather difficult one in which to anticipate lines of criticism, I do not intend to dwell very long on any particular item.  In view of the current criticisms in the Press and in other places I thought, at the outset, it might not be inopportune at the present time to give a short survey over the periods between 1914-15 and the present year, as indicated by comparative figures, showing the cost of Local Government services in 1914-15, 1921-22, and the present year.  It will, perhaps, be information that will be useful and acceptable to Deputies.  The figures for 1914-15 and 1921-22 are proportionate figures for the twenty-six counties, although at that time the whole of Ireland was under review.  The cost of officials' salaries in 1914-15 amounted to £46,065.  In the year 1921-22 we had reached the position, as Deputies are aware, when there were two Local Government Departments functioning in the country, the British Local Government Board and the Dáil Local Government Department.  In that year most of the actual work was being carried out by the Dáil Department.  The cost in that year of the Dáil administration was £15,314 and the cost of the English Board was £86,940.  In the present year, as the Estimates show, the cost is £84,535.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under sub-head B the cost in 1914-15 was £5,738; the cost in 1921-22 was for the Dáil Department £2,057, and for the British Local Government <Col N="81" /> Board £4,353.  In the present year the cost under that sub-head is £9,550.  Under sub-head C&mdash;Salaries of Auditors&mdash;in the year 1914-15 the figure was £9,155.  In the year 1921-22 for the Dáil Department it was £3,392, and for the British Local Government Board, £14,500.  In the present year it is £10,950.  Under sub-head D&mdash;Travelling Expenses, etc., of Auditors&mdash;the amount in 1914-15 was £2,462; in 1921-22 the cost under the Dáil Department was £683, and under the British Local Government Board, £1,693, and the present cost is £3,200.  The total of those figures represents roughly the amount expended on salaries and travelling expenses of officials.  The total amount for 1914-15 was £63,420.  For 1921-22 the inclusive cost of the Dáil and British Local Government Board was £128,922, and at the present time the cost is £107,835.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the actual sub-heads, indicating the services provided in those years, we find that under sub-head E there was no expenditure at all in 1914-15.  Sub-head F in 1914-15 was £2,893.  In 1921-22 it was £671, and in the present year it is £1,200.  I do not think that it is necessary to go down all the sub-heads, but there have not been very many changes or very remarkable changes in the cost until we come down to sub-head K&mdash; Child Welfare.  We find there was no provision made under that sub-head in 1914.  There was provision made of £10,900 in 1921-22, and there is provision made for £15,530 in the present estimate.  Likewise on sub-head L&mdash;Medical Treatment of School Children&mdash;there was no provision made, of course, in 1914-15, but in 1921-22 there was provision of £190, and in the present year it has jumped to £1,700.  Likewise with regard to sub-head M&mdash;Education (Provision of Meals) under the Provision of Meals (Ireland) Act, 1917&mdash;of course there was no provision in 1914-15.  In 1921-22 £194 was provided, and at the present time £5,700 is provided. Welfare of the Blind is another service that was not in operation in 1914. Likewise Treatment of Tuberculosis, Treatment of Venereal Diseases, <Col N="82" /> Grants to Local Authorities, ect., under Housing (Ireland) Act, 1919; Grants to Municipal Authorities, under Government Housing Scheme, Grants to persons and Local Authorities, building or reconstructing dwellinghouses. Under none of these headings was there provision made in 1914-15. These are the sub-heads which are responsible for all the increases or practically all the increases in the present cost of Local Government services.</P>
    <P>If we compare the figures showing the amount expended actually on salaries and wages in 1914 with the amount expended actually on services, we get the remarkable result that there was £63,420 expended on salaries and wages in 1914-15 whereas the cost of the services actually only amounted to £22,788.  In other words, salaries and travelling expenses amounted to three times the sum expended on the services.  In 1921-22 there was an improvement in that respect.  In that year we find that there was £128,922 expended on salaries and travelling expenses whereas the cost of the service was £123,051.  When we come to the present year we find that the proportion has advanced very considerably. In the present year there is £107,855 expended on salaries and travelling expenses and £454,054 expended on actual services.  Of course housing, tuberculosis and these other social services are mainly responsible for this development.  In view of the fact that the cost of Local Government services has gone up very much since 1914 I thought it well to give those figures.</P>
    <P>Probably the sub-head under which we will have most discussion is that of Appropriation-in-Aid which brings in the question of the road policy of the Department and accordingly I shall say a few words on this subject.  There appears to be a great deal of confusion in the public mind in regard to the road policy of the Department at the present time.  Much confusion in my view arises mainly as a result of half truths enunciated by interested parties of various kinds.  You have the owners of heavy lorries, and those interested in the sale of heavy lorries, crying out that our roads are the worst <Col N="83" /> in Europe.  They are continually inquiring what the Government is going to do, and when are we going to give the owners of these lorries value for their money.  You have the motorists crying out that they are being taxed very heavily for road maintenance, and that they are getting very poor value.  You have those interested in railways saying that it is unjustifiable on our part to be expending large sums of money maintaining a permanent way for a rival form of transport, and that at a time when the railways are in anything but a flourishing condition. You have the ratepayers crying out that they are being fleeced in the collection of rates to maintain roads and highways at a standard that they have never asked for, and which is of no use to them.  There is a certain amount of truth in all these contentions, but, on the whole, the untruth more than makes up for the little grain of truth they contain.</P>
    <P>It is certainly a gross exaggeration to say that our roads are the worst in Europe.  It would be very much nearer the mark to say that our roads are the best in Europe.  Both statements would be untrue.  With the exception of England, I should say that our roads compare more than favourably with the roads in European countries.  In saying that I am not confining my statement to the main or trunk roads, but I refer to every kind of road.  The bye-roads in this country are maintained on a much higher standard than similar roads on the Continent, taking the average road of that particular class.</P>
    <P>There is nothing to be gained by continually crying out that nothing has been done in the way of improving our roads.  We have not as good roads as they have in England, and we never will have.  The reason for that is, not that we are not looking after our business as well, but simply because of the fact that we have 14½ miles to every 1,000 of the population in this poor country, compared with 4½ miles to every 1,000 of the population in Great Britain.  In England they are in a position to spend £200 to £232 per mile from rates, whereas we are only in a position to spend £27 per mile. <Col N="84" /> Doing our very best, I cannot see that the time will come when we will be able to maintain our roads at the standard at which roads are maintained in England.  When we take into consideration that for five years nothing in the way of maintenance was done to our roads, and that during that period we had two wars in Ireland, in which the main object of attack seemed to be the roads and the bridges, I think we have brought our roads into a very creditable condition, indeed.  The ratepayer in the country has really very little to complain about as regards what he is being charged for the upkeep of the roads.  In pre-war times the expenditure from the rates on the roads was £670,000.  At the present time it is £1,234,000, or an average increase of 98 per cent. over the past three years.  We must bear in mind the fact that the main item of cost in the maintenance of roads is labour, and that the increase in rates for road maintenance should bear very close relationship to the increase in wages.  The increase in the wages of road workers really amounts to 146 per cent.  If that is taken into account, it will be seen that the ratepayer is paying a relatively small increase for that particular service.  In England the increase from 1915 to 1922 was much greater.  It increased from fifteen millions to fortyone and a half millions.</P>
    <P>When discussing this question we must remember that this is a universal service, and that everyone in the country who utilises the roads benefits. Men, women and children have to use the roads, which are an essential service. If we bear that in mind I think we must realise that our present expenditure is relatively small.  If we compare our expenditure on roads&mdash;a universal service&mdash;with what we spend, say, on old age pensions. a service that only embraces a very small number of people in the community, it will be seen that we are certainly not overdoing it.  We are spending over 2½ millions on old age pensions.  The cry of the railways is, of course, altogether unjustifiable.  The average cost to the ordinary ratepayer for the maintenance of roads has gone up 98 per cent., but the increase in rates for roads on <Col N="85" /> railway property has only gone up 66 per cent., so that they have no grievance whatsoever.  The policy enunciated by the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech was not a policy intended to remedy grievances.  There were no grievances to remedy.  The sole object of the Minister's policy was to try and devise a more economic and a more efficient method for expending the resources at our disposal.  In his Budget speech, he announced that £2,000,000 would be made available for improving the main arteries of the country&mdash;namely, trunk roads&mdash;limited to 1,500 miles.  We are at the present time making all possible haste to get ahead with that scheme.  It is, of course, being financed out of the Road Fund.  Heretofore, that fund was not capitalised.  That prevented our doing any really constructive work of a permanent character.</P>
    <P>This new policy will enable us to undertake much more ambitious schemes.  Under our present policy, it is our intention, so far as possible, to stereotype or standardise the present rate paid for roads.  We intend to try and stereotype the rate paid for roads at about 60 per cent. above what was paid in pre-war times.  That is a rough figure.  In some counties it will be more, and in others less.  But we realise that the agricultural community should be given every possible assistance in their struggle in the British market with foreign competitors.</P>
    <P>Last year and the year before we thought well to relieve the farmer by increasing the Agricultural Grant. This year we are again bringing relief to that section of the community by not insisting on an increase in rates for roads to the extent that the present cost of living figure would indicate if the roads were to be maintained at a proper standard out of rates.  This giving of relief to the agricultural community and to the ratepayers in general will, of course, necessitate our placing additional burdens on other shoulders.  Accordingly, we have thought well to place that burden on the shoulders of those best able to bear it&mdash;namely, on the owners of heavy lorries.</P>
    <P>The roads in Ireland were never intended for heavy traffic.  Even in pre-war <Col N="86" /> times, you had excellently constructed roads in England, laid down by engineers of the highest qualifications, and laid down on a strictly scientific basis.  In Ireland, even our best roads&mdash;the mail-coach roads&mdash;often-times had only a surfacing of road metal a couple of inches deep.  Beneath that you had clay.  Accordingly, we have a much more difficult problem here than they have in England.  To allow these roads to be torn up by heavy lorries would defeat our whole object, no matter what expenditure we incurred.  Therefore, we found it necessary to limit the weight of these lorries. Last October I issued an Order limiting the weight to nine tons.  Previously it had been limited to 12 tons. That in itself was something to be going on with.  But anybody who knows the country realises that that in itself would not have been sufficient.  A great number of lorries of nine tons laden, or even of six, seven or eight tons laden, would create a wear and tear that would tax us to repair.</P>
    <P>We thought it necessary to devise a policy of steeply grading the tax on lorries according to weight.  The result of that will be that either the heavy lorries will disappear off the roads&mdash;I would be sorry to see all lorries of over five tons disappear off the roads&mdash;or if they do not disappear, then the revenue for maintaining the roads will be very considerably increased. We anticipate from the system of taxation announced in the Minister's Budget speech a revenue of something between £600,000 and £700,000.  Owing to the number of changes we have made, it is very difficult to give an exact estimate.  We do not, of course, intend to capitalise all that amount.  Several counties will not come in under our Trunk Road Scheme or will only benefit to a small extent.  The idea is to link up the main national centres.  It would not be equitable to divert all the money derived from the Road Fund to those particular counties, and to leave the counties that would have no trunk road mileage&mdash;as we understand trunk roads in this scheme&mdash;undowered.  Accordingly, about half the figure will be available for maintaining trunk roads in those counties, and it will also be <Col N="87" /> devoted to works of a similar kind in counties where, perhaps, the road scheme will also be in operation to some extent.</P>

      <P>The Minister has stated that this money will be devoted to the making of trunk roads.  In several counties the trunk roads are already made.  In other counties no trunk roads are made.  Will it rest with the County Council or with the Minister to decide whether this money shall be devoted to trunk roads or otherwise?</P>

      <P>When this road scheme was first announced, my Department was literally inundated with demands from people all over the country&mdash;road authorities and individuals interested one way and another &mdash;insisting that this road and that road should be made a trunk road and giving the most plausible reasons in substantiation of their claims.  The road scheme then announced took a considerable time to mature and, accordingly, that agitation died down. In view of the demands that were made at that time, I decided to take a very strong line in this matter.  We have sent out our engineers&mdash;experts in this matter&mdash;who have consulted with the county surveyors and people able to give them information in the various counties.  The Roads Advisory Committee have spent months deliberating on this point and have decided what roads should be included in this 1,500 mile scheme.  This is a matter that has to be decided from a national point of view.  If we are to have national roads, they must be roads that are important from that point of view and not merely from the point of view of the man living in a particular town or a particular county.  Accordingly, we have decided to lay down those trunk roads and we do not intend to deviate an inch from the line we have taken up after very careful deliberation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, I will announce now the actual roads on which this extension will be made.  As I have already said, the fact that we are expending this money on a scheme of national trunk roads will not, in any way, deprive <Col N="88" /> counties which will not benefit by those trunk roads from their lawful share of the Road Fund.  There will be a residue left every year out of which their legitimate claims can be met.  It is proposed to repay this loan of two millions in ten years at five and a half per cent. interest.  Therefore, in the first year the principal will be £200,000, and interest £110,000&mdash; £310,000 in all.  That will leave a considerable residue to make up for any injustice which might otherwise fall on counties through which this trunk road scheme did not run.  The lines of roads will run as follows:-</P>
    <P>(1)  Dublin, Balbriggan, Drogheda, Dundalk, Newry, with branch from Drogheda, Ardee, Carrickmacross, Castleblayney, Monaghan, Clones, Cavan.</P>
    <P>(2)  Dublin, Navan, Kells, Virginia, Cavan.</P>
    <P>(3)  Dublin, Lucan, Kilcock, Kinnegad, Kilbeggan, Athlone, Ballinasloe, Kilconnel, Athenry, Galway; Branch (a), Kinnegad, Mullingar, Longford, Carrick-on-Shannon, Boyle, Collooney, Sligo, Ballyshannon, Stranorlar, Lifford, Letterkenny&mdash;border at Derry; Branch (b), Longford, Roscommon, Castlerea, Claremorris, Castlebar, Ballina and Westport.</P>
    <P>(4)  Dublin, Nass, Kildare, Portlaoighise, Roscrea, Nenagh, Limerick; Branches: (a) Limerick, Ennis, Ennistymon; (b) Limerick, Rathkeale, Abbeyfeale, Castleisland, Tralee; (c) Tralee, Killarney, Macroom, Cork; (d) Limerick, Charleville, Mallow, Cork; (e) Cork, Bandon, Bantry; (f) Cork, Midleton, Youghal, Dungarvan, Waterford; (g) Cork, Fermoy, Mitchelstown, Cahir, Urlingford, Abbeyleix, Portlaoighise; (h) Waterford, Clonmel, Cahir, Tipperary, Limerick; (j) Clonmel, Kilkenny, Carlow, Naas.</P>
    <P>(5)  Dublin, Bray, Wicklow, Gorey, Arklow, Enniscorthy (branch to Wexford), New Ross, Waterford.</P>
    <P>A great deal of work, of course, has been done on those roads during the last couple of years, but most of it has been work not of a very durable character.  At least a quarter of the whole mileage has not received any treatment <Col N="89" /> whatsoever.  A survey of the work at various points has been carried out and the engineers of my Department are co-operating with the county surveyors in the various counties.</P>

      <P>No, except at Cahir, in the south.  With regard to the method of reconstruction, it is a very difficult matter.  As I have said, we are always up against the question of cost.  I will give the Deputies here some comparative figures to show the cost of doing the really expensive work on roads at present.  Most of this high-class road construction is beyond our means.  Just now we are only expending from rates an amount equal to about £27 per mile on roads. On anything like high-class roads we would spend £3,000 per mile.  Concrete roads will cost about £10,000 per mile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>The ratepayers will pay for it.  Even the ordinary waterbound macadam steam-rolled road in some counties has been done at a cost of £250 per mile, and it goes up to as high as £3,000 per mile in some counties, where they undertook widening and put down very substantial foundations. In the County of Mayo you are doing ordinary steam-rolled waterbound roads at an average cost of £400 to £450 per mile.  As Deputies are aware, we laid down several experimental <Col N="90" /> stretches of road between here and Naas.  Those stretches are of a very different kind.  It may be of interest to give figures showing the cost of these different kinds of work. Reinforced concrete, twenty-four feet wide, with drainage, costs over £10,000 per mile.  This cost prohibits any extended use.  A much less expensive kind may be tried.  This may be considered barred out on the score of cost.  Secondly, asphalt surfacing has been laid as cheap as eight shillings per square yard.  Even at such prices there can be only a very limited use. Even the cheapest asphalt, on account of its cost, will only have very limited scope under the new scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is for mail coach roads.  The fourth class of road is that done by grouting with bitumen <Col N="91" /> and spraying.  The cost would be about £2,800 per mile.  The fifth class of road, grouting with cement and sand and tarring, would cost £2,500 per mile; the sixth class, silicate of soda grouting and tarring, would cost £2,150 per mile; the seventh class, a cheap form of tar macadam on good existing road crusts, would cost £1,500 per mile; the eighth class of road, rolling, spraying and chipping with incidentals, would cost £1,200 per mile; and the ninth class, rolling with centre strip tarred would cost £1,000 per mile.  These estimates can only be taken as a rough approximate cost based on work already carried out or being carried out.  The ninth class of road might cost less than £1,000, but if work, such as widening, drainage, and strengthening, has to be done the cost might run up to £3,000 per mile.  It will accordingly be seen that it is not an easy matter to lay down exactly what a particular stretch of road will cost or what method you should adopt for improving it.  Every mile of road will have to be surveyed and given special attention.  It is our intention to give more attention to roads in the immediate vicinity of towns, where the traffic is heavier, and where we will achieve a double object, namely, that of improving the transport system, and also improving the appearance of the towns and probably improving the health of the inhabitants by having proper and hygienic highways.  One of the greatest eyesores which we have at present is the miserable and dirty streets of some of our principal towns. I do not think, until questions are put to me, that I can say much more on that subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a good deal of discussion at present about nationalising our trunk roads.  That is one of the vague expressions which people often bandy about without trying seriously to ascertain what is in their own minds. I must say that it is a term which confuses me a great deal.  When we are asked why we do not nationalise our roads the best answer to the question, probably, is to say that we have nationalised them.  We have <Col N="92" /> certainly gone a considerable way towards doing so.  Nearly all the terms used in this connection are vague.  The term, for instance, &ldquo;trunk roads,&rdquo; means so many different things that everyone has probably a different idea of its meaning.  If you take, for instance, 1,500 miles of trunk roads, it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that we have nationalised them inasmuch as paying for their reconstruction will be a national charge.  The operations on the roads will be directed from a national centre.  We have decided where the roads are to run, to what standard they should be brought, and what kind of material is to be used upon them.  Under the Local Government Act we have power, if we want to do it, either to get contractors to undertake the work of reconstructing these roads, or, if we care, we can do the work directly ourselves, but it will probably be more economical to allow the local authority to do the work.  In some cases we may bring in contractors who may have more up-to-date machinery.  In so far as that is nationalising the roads, we have done it.  If by nationalising the roads is meant establishing an expensive Department in Dublin with a huge staff of engineers, putting three or four of them in every county cheek by jowl with the local engineers, and so duplicating our staffs in each county, I am afraid that the day is a long way off when that is going to occur.  So far, however, as reasonable nationalisation is concerned, I think we have actually done it.</P>

      <P>No; it is to be brought to nine tons.  Dealing with the Estimate generally, I do not think that there is any other item of such interest to Deputies as the roads, but I will just make a short statement regarding the various sub-heads.  It may be convenient to deal with sub-heads A and C together.  Under A there is a reduction from £91,042 to £84,535 or a reduction of £6,507 as compared with last year.  Under C there is a reduction from £11,714 to £10,550, or £1,164 as compared with the previous year.  In the numbers of staff there is a reduction under these sub-heads of 15 and 2, making a total reduction of 17.  As Deputies are aware, the control of the Local Government in 1921 had passed to the Department of Local Government set up by Dáil Eireann.  In that year there was a staff of about 70 engaged on local government administration the cost of which was defrayed out of Dáil funds.  The Provisional Government took over the staffs of the British Departments in April, 1922, and the combined staffs of the Dáil Department and Local Government Board numbered 288.  Between August, 1921, and 31st March, 1922, eleven members of the Local Government Board staff had gone out on pension, thirteen had been previously transferred to Belfast, while the Board's temporary staff, engaged upon the administration of the Irish Land (Provision of Sailors and Soldiers) Act, 1919, was not transferred to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total of the combined staffs at April, 1922, was, as already stated, 288. At the present time the number is 253, which is the lowest figure that can safely be reached, consistent with efficient administration of the public services. The position compares favourably with the British régime, particularly when the extent of the services administered is taken into account. Already the bases of far-reaching reforms have been laid in respect of the poor law, public health and road transport, and the future development of these services demands careful administration. The housing problem, too, has claimed close attention.  I <Col N="94" /> shall deal more fully with the progress attained when I come to the Housing sub-heads.  Up to 1922 there was almost complete stagnation.  Then there are the services which have been transferred to the Department since 1922, namely, control of mental hospitals, elections to the Houses of the Oireachtas, and road maintenance, also the new service for the combined or central purchasing of commodities required by local authorities.  Not alone have the duties and functions of the Department been extended, but in every branch of administration there has been a considerable accretion of duties which have been carried out without any net addition to the number of staff.</P>
    <P>Sub-heads B and D do not appear to call for any special comment.  Sub-head E deals with expenses in connection with International Road Congresses.</P>
    <P>This year the Triennial Congress of the Permanent International Association of Road Congresses will be held at Milan.  The objects of the Congresses, which are held triennially, are:</P>
    <P>The publication of sundry articles, reports and documents relating to roads.</P>
    <P>The collection of the results obtained in every country from the tests of materials used or suitable for use in the construction and maintenance of roads, by application on the roads or by researches in the laboratory.</P>
    <P>It was considered that the Saorstát should be included in the list of countries belonging to the Association. The great majority of the nations have already joined the Association.  An Imperial Congress is to be held in London during the year, to which it is proposed to send a medical representative. Provision is made for annual subscription to the International Union against Tuberculosis, to be held in Washington in October.  We are not sending a delegate, but we have to keep in touch with it, and to retain our membership.  The object of the Union is to co-ordinate the efforts of organisations and institutions in the various countries in the campaign against tuberculosis, and scientific <Col N="95" /> conferences for that purpose are convened from time to time, usually biennially.  Having regard to the widespread incidence of tuberculosis in this country it is necessary to keep in touch with the latest developments in the struggle against the disease in other countries, so as to be in a position to avail of the most modern methods for its prevention and cure.  Provision is made for a subscription of £100 to the International Office of Public Health at Paris.  It has been constituted under the International Arrangement of 1907, in pursuance of the Paris Sanitary Convention of 1903, and embraces all the leading countries in close co-ordination with the Health Section of the League of Nations.  The office is controlled by an International Committee composed of technical representatives designated by the participating States in the proportion of one representative to every State, and is required to meet at least once a year.  One of the duties of the Committee is to make recommendations as to the modifications which may be needed in International Sanitary Agreements.</P>
    <P>The International Office is an acknowledged world authority on matters of Public Health.  Its principal object is to collect and bring to the knowledge of the participating States information of a general character relating to public health, especially as regards infectious diseases and the measures taken to combat them.  The Office issues a monthly Bulletin comprising notices of legislation and administrative regulations respecting transmissible diseases, statistics dealing with public health, and summaries of current literature on sanitary subjects.  The subscription covers the travelling expenses and attendance fee of the delegate.  Membership of the Office is a qualification for representation at periodical conferences dealing with public health questions of international concern in connection with the dissemination of infection through shipping and the movement of emigrants.</P>
    <P>I do not think that sub-head F calls for any particular mention.  Sub-head G shows a reduction.  This reduction is due to the fact that amounts were <Col N="96" /> included last year for clearance of a site, and so on, that are non-recurrent.  The dwelling accommodation of the Vaccine Institute at 25 Upper O'Connell Street was destroyed, and there was an amount in last year's Estimate for the clearing of that site.</P>

It is sometimes necessary to send an indoor officer to the country to consult with local officers upon special matters which could not be undertaken by the outdoor staff.  For example, there are matters in connection with elections. Miscellaneous minor services represent the usual charges for the cost of advertisements, daily newspapers, Local Government publications, petty office expenses, and expenses of messages&mdash; tram fares&mdash;when urgent delivery of letters is required.  The increase under the sub-head for this year is due to the inclusion of the amount required to meet expenses of the Trade Section under the following heads:</P>

    <P>The infant mortality in Saorstát Eireann&mdash;67 per 1,000 births&mdash;for 1925 showed a reduction as compared with 1924, and was only fractionally higher than the record year 1923.  This improvement was specially noticeable in urban districts where the infant death rate for 1925 was below the figure of 1923.  The high mortality amongst illegitimate infants continues to be an unfavourable feature, but efforts have been made on the part of the Department to effect improvement by the circulation of recommendations for concerted remedial action to the local authorities and voluntary agencies in Dublin County, and county borough, where the loss of life among this class is abnormally heavy.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for the coming financial year provides for an expansion of services, especially on the part of local authorities, who have generally shown disposition to enlarge their activities for child welfare.

The principal undertaking assisted is the provision of health visitors, that is to say, trained nurses who get in touch with expectant and nursing mothers, and children under five years of age, and give advice as to maternal health and as to the care and management of young children.  The primary object of health visiting is preventive, so as to forestall the development of conditions of ill-health. The work is carried on by whole-time officers in the larger centres of population, and elsewhere the services of district nurses have been utilised on part-time conditions. Twenty-six local authorities and eighty-six voluntary agencies participate in the grant.  The general infant mortality for 1925 was as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Sub-head L deals with the grant for school medical service.  In 1925-26 this amounted to £570, which was applied to five voluntary schemes and the two municipal schemes in Cork and Clonmel.  The latter have developed in accordance with the results ascertained on the preliminary inspections, and arrangements have been made for the treatment of dental defects and of affections of the eyes and throat.  In Dublin the Commissioners have been furnished by the Medical Superintendent Officer of Health with a report on the requirements, and still have the matter before them.  In Waterford the Corporation are considering a report on a scheme of school medical service submitted by their medical officer.  In the administrative counties the matter is closely associated with the appointment of county medical officers, one of whose early duties will be to formulate recommendations suitable to the requirements of their respective areas.</P>
    <P>Sub-head M deals with school meals. The expenditure on school meals was incurred in two county boroughs, namely, Dublin and Cork, and in fourteen urban districts, namely, Athy, Navan, Brí Chualann, Carlow, Ceannanus Mór, Clonmel, Dungarvan, Dun Laoghaire, Kilkenny, Killarney, Listowel, New Ross, Wexford and Youghal.  Recoupment from the grant is made in respect of half the actual expenditure from rates for the provision of food for school meals.  Primary schools under the control of the Christian Brothers will, as a result of arrangements made between the Department of Education and the Christian Brothers, come under the terms of the School Meals Acts.  About sixty-seven primary schools under the control of the community will be covered by the new arrangement.  The extension of the school meals scheme will not affect the grant until the year 1927-28, as recoupment therefrom in any year is only made in respect of expenditure <Col N="99" /> incurred during the preceding financial year.</P>
    <P>The decrease in the present year's Estimate is due principally to the dropping of the school meals scheme framed by the Rathmines and Rathgar Urban District Council.  Urban authorities have been reminded of their powers as regards the provision of school meals, but the general views of the councils who have not adopted schemes were that there was no necessity for such arrangements in their districts.  During the year 1924-25, approximately 12,478 school children were fed, of whom 6,061 were dealt with in Dublin County Borough, and it is estimated that 1,521,953 meals were supplied.</P>
    <P>Sub-head N deals with Welfare of the Blind.  There is but little change to be recorded in the position as regards the provision required to be made for the blind.  The number of workshop employees and of inmates in the institutions for the blind shows a slight decrease, which accounts for the reduction of £100 in the grant as compared with last year.  The scheme adopted by the Commissioners for Dublin County Borough for the welfare of the blind has been continued for a further year and has been extended by the Dublin County Council to their area.  Similar arrangements are being brought into operation in Cork Co. Borough, and consideration has also been given to their adaptation for Limerick County Borough.  The training of the blind in this country is not a problem of any great extent. Particulars as to the number of blind persons between the ages of five and thirty years in the several counties of the Saorstát have been secured through the County Boards of Health, and, omitting Dublin county, in which a scheme is operating, and the four county boroughs, the total number of blind persons between these ages is found to be, approximately, 116, or an average of less than five such persons per county.  In Dublin blind persons are admitted to the register on a certificate from a recognised ophthalmic surgeon or specialist.  Provision is made for the education, training, <Col N="100" /> employment and maintenance of suitable blind persons in the existing schools, workshops and homes for the blind.  The wages of blind workers employed in those workshops and living in their own homes are being augmented under the scale.  I do not think it is necessary to give that scale, as I gave it last year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head O is for the treatment of tuberculosis.  The administration of county tuberculosis schemes was transferred, in pursuance of Section 15 of the Local Government Act, 1925, from the county tuberculosis committees to the county boards of health as from 1st October last.  In addition to the existing tuberculosis schemes in twenty-two counties and two county boroughs, comprehensive arrangements for dealing with the disease are under consideration at present in Cork County and County Borough, Limerick County Borough, Meath County and Roscommon County.  The Cavan County Council are completing a tuberculosis hospital at Keadew, Cavan, and several other councils are also considering proposals for advanced case institutions.  It is somewhat difficult at present to estimate the effect of these projects in increasing the claims on the National Tuberculosis Grant in the present year, but an additional sum of £3,500 has been included to cover the contingencies of the adoption of new schemes, the operation of new institutions and the increase of patients under treatment, due to the operation of the compulsory notification of tuberculosis in pursuance of Section 17 of the Local Government Act, 1925.  The total number of patients dealt with under approved tuberculosis schemes during the year 1924-25 was 10,131, composed of 2,680 insured and 7,451 uninsured persons, and the amount issued from the grant as recoupment in respect of their treatment was, approximately, £34,300.</P>
    <P>The mortality rate from tuberculosis for the year 1924 was 1.45 per thousand of population.  This was a slight increase on the previous year's figure of 1.41 per thousand of population. Such an increase was not unexpected in view of the disturbed conditions of the two previous years.  The <Col N="101" /> comparative progress made in this country in reducing the mortality from tuberculosis may be estimated by examining the time which has been occupied in this and the neighbouring countries in securing the same measure of improvement in the death rate from the disease.  The highest rate of mortality in Ireland from tuberculosis was 2.9 per thousand of the population, and this figure was last attained in the year 1904.  The lowest record for the Saorstát was reached in 1923 in the rate of 1.41 per 1,000 of the population. Thus the reduction of the rate from 2.9 to 1.41 per 1,000 population has been effected in nineteen years. England last showed a death rate from tuberculosis of 2.9 per 1,000 population in the year 1878, and the rate did not fall below 1.5 until 1910.  This gives a period of thirty-two years for the corresponding diminution of the rate as against nineteen years in Ireland. Scotland's rate of mortality from tuberculosis was 2.9 per thousand of the population in the year 1883, and it did not go below 1.5 per thousand until the year 1919, or thirty-six years afterwards. This country has, therefore, achieved in nineteen years the same reduction in the death rate from tuberculosis which was effected in England in thirty-two years, and in Scotland in thirty-six years.</P>
    <P>In connection with sub-head P, I have to say that the attitude of the majority of the local authorities towards the provision of facilities for the treatment of these diseases is generally adverse. The five approved schemes for Dublin County Borough, and the counties of Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Monaghan have been continued.  In addition, approval has been given to the general outlines of schemes for the diagnosis and treatment of venereal disease in Cork County Borough and in Offaly County, and it is expected that these arrangements will shortly come into operation.  In County Westmeath the council have approved of the resumption of their approved scheme, which has been in abeyance for some years past.</P>
    <P>As regards the work performed in connection with existing schemes during the year ended 31st March, 1925, it is to be noted that the out-patient attendances <Col N="102" /> at the treatment centres were 26,076, as compared with 25,292 in the previous year, and the number of in-patient days amounted to 7,591, as against 7,022 in the preceding year. It does not necessarily follow from these increased statistics that the disease is becoming more prevalent, but the figures probably indicate that the facilities for treatment afforded under the schemes are becoming more widely known and utilised.  The total cost of the approved arrangements for dealing with the disease during the year ended 31st March, 1925, was £8,707 13s. 4d., of which 75 per cent. or £6,530 14s. 11d. was refunded from the State grant, leaving only £2,176 18s. 5d. to be met from the rates.  The total cost for the financial year 1923-4 was slightly higher, £8,913 18s. 6d.</P>
    <P>Progress in housing is being sustained. The total amount included in the present year's estimate is £348,000. Of this amount £2,000 is in respect of three schemes which were carried out under the Housing Act, of 1919, viz., schemes undertaken by Dalkey Urban District Council, Balbriggan Town Commissioners, and St. Barnabas Public Utility Society, Dublin.  In the first two schemes the subsidy payable is based on the annual deficit on the schemes, and in the case of the Public Utility Society the subsidy equals 50 per cent. of the loan charge on the approved expenditure.  The Exchequer subsidy under the 1919 Act to local authorities was a payment on basis of loan charges pending the completion of the houses, and when the houses were completed of a payment of 35/- for each £1 of rent collected, the subsidy not to exceed the actual deficit incurred. Final payment in respect of any year's subsidy is not made until the accounts are audited.  With the high building costs prevailing at the time no progress could be made, and the schemes local authorities had in view were deferred pending more favourable conditions.  Compared with the conditions which prevailed up to 1922 the present rate of progress must be considered satisfactory.  The Government has already provided over one million and a quarter for housing grants, and this year a further sum <Col N="103" /> of £348,000 is required.  Under the £1,000,000 grant which was made available for urban housing in 1922, schemes providing for about 2,100 houses have been undertaken by urban councils and with one or two exceptions are now completed.  The sum of £20,000 included in the Estimate represents the balance of the grant.</P>
    <P>The numbers of houses which are being provided under the 1924 and 1925 Acts are as follows: The number of houses constructed by private persons under the 1924 Acts is 2,745 and the number provided by local authorities 864, making a total of 3,609.  Of this total there have been built 1,079 in county boroughs, 357 in urban districts, 65 under town commissioners, and 2,108 in rural districts. Under the 1925 Act grants have been allocated in respect of 2,507 houses to be erected by private builders, 90 by public utility societies and 769 by local authorities, making a total of 3,366.  This number of 3,366 houses is allocated between urban and rural areas as follows: County boroughs, 1,045; urban districts, 278; town commissioners, 64, and rural counties, 1,979.  From price schedules which have come to the notice of this Department the cost of building shows a slight downward tendency.  Under the schemes of the Civic Commissioners the building cost of five-roomed houses in Dublin during the past twelve months averaged between £500 and £535, while in the smaller municipal areas houses of similar accommodation are being built at between £450 and £500.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>In previous years I offered a considerable amount of criticism on this Vote.  I am going to be very short this evening, because I am getting less hopeful as time goes on of ever being able to make any impression on the mind of the Minister. We have agreed to spend four hours on the discussion of this Vote, and the Minister has already occupied more than an hour.  I do not think he could have done justice to himself or his Department in any less time than he has taken. He has made a very clear and full statement.  I want, however, to bring <Col N="104" /> one or two matters to his notice to which, I think, attention should be called.  In the first place, I want to ask him to stiffen his back in regard to certain local bodies.</P>
      <P>Throughout the Saorstát there has been adopted a scale of salaries for dispensary medical officers.  This has been done in all the counties except Mayo and Longford.  The local bodies in these two counties have refused to fix a scale of salaries for their medical officers.  I think the Minister should stiffen his back, and urge these two counties to come up to their neighbours in this respect.  It is not a very satisfactory thing for a man to be working in Mayo, say, on a salary of £180 a year while a doctor in the neighbouring county of Galway, doing the same work, is getting, perhaps, £250. I do not want to be twitted with the charge that I have pressed for economy because I have never pressed for reducing salaries where efficient work is done.  I have pressed on this Vote, frequently, for a reduction in the number of people employed to do a certain amount of work, but that is quite a different thing from suggesting that salaries should be cut down, which I have never done.  I think the Minister should see that the county boards of health or the county councils in these two counties should adopt a scale of salaries for their medical officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point I want to call the Minister's attention to is the fact that I do not think he is sufficiently stringent with the local authorities in demanding from them that they should look after the adulteration and contamination of food, particularly milk. He himself has alluded in his statement to the very high mortality amongst infants and children.  I will tell him at once why the mortality is so high.  It is due to dirt in some form, but chiefly to dirt that contaminates milk.  There is no question but that the greatest and the highest mortality is due to summer diarrhoea amongst children, the result of contaminated milk.  Further, probably more than half the cripples we see throughout the country is due to the fact that they have been drinking tubercular milk.  It is well known that diseases of the bones and joints are due <Col N="105" /> to bovine tuberculosis which they have got from milk.  I suggest to the Minister that he should insist on local authorities carrying out the provision of the Public Health Acts in order that purer food is given to the people.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that he may excuse himself by saying that these things will be better done as soon as county medical officers of health have been appointed. We have been waiting long for these people.  Let me say that we have here in Dublin a superintendent medical officer of health, and we have not yet, as he has said himself, adopted the Medical Inspection of School Children Act.  Why that is so, I cannot understand.  It was quite reasonable in previous years for us to say that it was not possible for the Minister to do this because he had not the county medical officers of health to superintend all this work.  In Cork the scheme has been adopted, but in Dublin, where we have a superintendent medical officer of health, no scheme has yet been adopted for the medical inspection and treatment of school children. We have, I am glad to say, adopted the child welfare scheme here, and I believe it is working well.</P>
    <P>The only other remark I wish to make is with regard to the roads.  As one who uses the roads a great deal, I repeat what I said when the Budget statement was being discussed, that the heavy lorries should be driven off the roads.  I have followed them travelling at 20 miles an hour, and going as I was at that speed myself, I could feel the surface of the road flying up after them.  They should not be allowed at all on the soft roads.  I would not object at all to the heavy lorries going on the roads if we had road surfaces such as you see out in Merrion Street&mdash; or concrete roads&mdash;because in that case I do not believe they would do any harm, but I certainly have the greatest objection to allowing heavy lorries of ten tons to travel along our ordinary surfaced roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words with regard to the road policy of the Department.  At the outset, I wish to say that I agree with what the Minister has said that our roads are not nearly as bad as many <Col N="106" /> people try to make out.  I think when we realise what the condition of the roads was, say, three or two and a half years ago, and compare their condition then with to-day, we should give credit to the Department, to the County Councils, and to the men for the very good work they have done, not only with regard to the roads, but the bridges.  The roads are not as good as we would like to see them, but at the same time they are nothing like being as bad as some people would have us believe.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that our roads would probably be much better if we had some sort of standard system as regards the making and maintaining of them.  The trouble concerning the making and maintaining of roads is that in almost every county you have a different system.  In some counties the work is very well done.  They have a very efficient staff, very efficient engineers, and they have very up-to-date machinery.  In other counties they have not an efficient staff of men, for they do not keep them.  They take up a certain number of men, employ them for a few months, then these men are let go, and later on raw men are again taken on for a few months.  In addition, they have not up-to-date machinery, and in effect they have no system for the making and maintaining of roads.  I think the Minister himself will, perhaps, be the first to admit that.  I would suggest to him that he might well pay some attention to this matter, and see whether it would not be possible to devise some scheme which would make for a standard method of dealing with roads throughout the whole Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his statement said there was a good deal of confusion in the public mind regarding the road policy of his Department.  I think there is very good reason for that, and the public is not altogether to be blamed.  This time twelve months, I think it was, the Minister announced a very big road policy.  There was to be an expenditure of something like £3,500,000.  A few months afterwards we were told that had been passed on to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and again a few months afterwards we were told that it had been <Col N="107" /> passed on to the Minister for Finance. Eventually, after a good deal of pressure from all parts of the House, we were told that the Minister for Finance would disclose the whole scheme in his Budget statement.  He did, and he told us that the Government would give £2,000,000 for 1,500 miles of trunk roads.  I should like to know why the original scheme, which apparently recommended itself to the Local Government Department, was not gone on with.  I would also like to know whether the Minister for Local Government and his Department had a better opinion of the scheme propounded by the Minister for Finance than they had of their own scheme.  It seems to me that the original scheme mentioned by the Minister for Local Government, which had occupied the attention of the officials of his Department for many months, and then received the seal of that Department as being a good scheme, should have been gone on with.</P>
    <P>Another matter I wish to touch upon is the question of the amalgamation of unions.  I thought we would have had some statement from the Minister on that important question.  I would like to hear from the Minister when he is replying whether he is satisfied that the amalgamation of unions has been a success.  So far as I am concerned I am satisfied it has not been a success, and I doubt if there has been any real financial saving, but whatever saving there may have been it has not been worth the hardship, and in some cases the misery, inflicted on the poor people as a result of the amalgamation.  I suggest to the Minister he should go into this matter very carefully and systematically.  He should have a proper inquiry made into the working of the whole system throughout the country.  I am satisfied if that inquiry is carried out he would be very much surprised at the effect it has had on the poor people.  There are cases in which the poor people have to be taken forty or fifty miles across country to county homes and county hospitals, and we know there are cases in which people sooner than go that distance from their friends elect to remain at <Col N="108" /> home, and in many cases die in their own homes.  If the district hospital had been nearer they would, as in the old days, go into it and they could be visited there by their friends, and their lives would have been saved.</P>
    <P>I do not want to exaggerate the position.  I am stating the case as I see it, and as it has been presented to me in discussions I have had with people interested in the matter.  I believe that within the past few years there have been many deaths that might not have occurred if these people were not forced under the amalgamation scheme to travel forty or fifty miles, and perhaps in some cases more, to go to hospital.  In that connection, I also wish to bring to the Minister's attention the policy that is creeping up in certain hospitals under the control of County Boards of Health of admitting to those hospitals what are known as paying patients. I have no objection to people paying for their maintenance in hospitals, but I object to the hospitals, the nurses and the doctors that are paid by the ratepayers to look after the poor, looking after people who can afford to pay for themselves in outside hospitals. We know what will naturally happen in a district hospital in which there are a number of poor people, and a number of patients who perhaps are in a position to pay a couple of guineas a week.  Naturally the paying patient will get more and better service than the poor patient lying by his or her side.  That patient will also have other advantages.  Certain patients, because of their position in life, will have wealthy friends coming in to see them, bringing with them many luxuries which the ordinary patient in the hospital cannot have.  I consider it is not fair to the poor patients lying in their beds to have people coming in offering delicacies to paying patients when these unfortunate poor patients can never hope to have such things for themselves.  That might appear to be a small matter, but I draw attention to it because it is being talked of throughout many counties in the Saorstát.  The idea is gaining a good deal of ground that County Boards of Health are encouraging <Col N="109" /> paying patients and are increasing their number.  I submit that if paying patients are brought into a district hospital maintained by the ratepayers, the poorer patients, who cannot contribute to their treatment, are likely to suffer.  I would like the Minister to give us his opinion and state the policy of his Department on the question of the amalgamation of unions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. SHAW Mr. SHAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement with regard to road schemes. The statement he made this evening will constitute welcome news both to the persons who use the roads and the great number of unemployed throughout the country.  In my opinion the biggest asset the Free State will have for the future will lie in the attraction to Ireland of tourists from all over the world, now that peace has been restored.  Already, even though the strike in England had a serious effect, people going about the country must be astonished and pleased to see the large numbers of strange motor cars conveying people from other countries through different parts of the Saorstát. I would like to see the Department of Local Government more in contact with the Irish Tourist Development Association. A rate has been struck by many Co. Councils which will bring in a considerable amount of money for the purpose of advertising the attractive features of the Saorstát.  The Westmeath Co. Council struck a rate which, I think, will amount to something like £400.  That money will be available for advertising purposes.  If the scenic attractions of this country were more generally known, large numbers of persons would come here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter with which I would like to deal.  It is of such very great importance that I propose to occupy a little of the time of the Committee with it. As Chairman of the Westmeath County Board of Health, I happen to be in contact with an important institution, the county hospital. If there is one thing in this country that ought to be rectified soon it is the question of unmarried mothers.  It is a rather unpleasant subject to introduce, but its importance justifies its <Col N="110" /> introduction.  At the present time all over the country there are large numbers of these people in the various county homes.  They are not classified; a first offender is put in with a professional who has in many cases reared a family in the institution.  The more innocent girls have very little hope of reformation.  I do not know what the Poor Law Commission will recommend in connection with this matter, but the existing state of affairs in many county hospitals is really deplorable.  I look upon this matter as one needing prompt attention.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear if there is anything going to be done in the direction of establishing an institution in Dublin, or any other place through the Saorstát, into which those unfortunate people can be taken.  At such an institution they could be classified and given suitable work to do.  Ratepayers generally would not find any fault with such a system as that; they would be quite willing to pay for that.  The conditions in regard to unmarried mothers at the present time are really terrible. I happened to pass to-day through an institution where unmarried mothers are being looked after.  There are 35 of these people herded together, and the innocent ones&mdash;the first offenders&mdash; have no hopes for the future.  Some remedial measures should be introduced and I would appeal to the Minister to take up this matter seriously as soon as he possibly can.  It is one of the most important matters requiring attention at the present time.</P>

Credit was given to the Government for authorising the expenditure of money; to the county councils for spending the money, and to the people who made the roads for earning the money.  Not a scrap of credit was given to the people who pay the money.  If there is anybody who deserves gratitude in this connection it is the people who find the money and pay it.</P>

He talked about receiving paying patients in hospitals where there is plenty of room and staff.  The dividing line between the poor people who are entitled to go into hospital of right and the paying patients is in many cases very narrow. The only line of demarcation is that one belongs to a family with a certain social valuation, but who is actually poorer than the people who are entitled to go into the hospital of right. To say that these people get special treatment that detracts from the treatment poor patients are getting, and that because of the presence of paying patients there the others are not getting the attention they would otherwise get, is a gross reflection on the officers of the different institutions and also on the Government staff who supervise the institutions.  I think it is pure imagination.  I hope there is no ground whatever for the statement.</P>
      <P>As a former member of a board of health, I am prepared to assert there is no ground for the statement.  The people who enter as paying patients are just as poor, and are even poorer, than the people who claim to go into the hospital as of right.  Their presence in no way takes away from the attention and the facilities given to other patients.  I do not think Deputy Morrissey has given this matter the consideration it deserves.  I do not know that there is any use going into the question as to Government policy, with regard to motor traffic and so on. We had it recently, and we will have an opportunity of discussing that question again at a later stage on the Finance Bill.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="112" /> Deputy Sir James Craig referred to the bad quality of milk.  There may be some truth in what he stated in regard to the city.  I do not know what the condition is as to infant mortality in the city, but I am acquainted with child life in the country, and I have not seen any sign, or at all events very little, of that class of infant cripple or deformed children referred to.  As to the milk of the country generally the reports from the dairy inspectors are in conflict with the things mentioned by Deputy Sir James Craig.  Now, I appeal to the Minister on the question of administration to consider the very serious position we have.  As between county council and county council it is not a very crying grievance, even though they have different methods of construction and policy, and approach the same roads from different viewpoints, but there is great discrepancy between the policy of the county councils and the urban councils.  Most of the urban authorities I am acquainted with have the streets of the towns in an intolerable condition, showing that thousands of pounds contributed by the county councils for their upkeep have been absolutely squandered.</P>
    <P>There is always danger in passing through these towns; the condition of the streets and roads in them is scandalous. I am not exaggerating the position; my own town of Kilkenny is an instance.  If the ratepayers spend money for the upkeep of the highways, they ought to be kept in a proper way. One authority in a county is sufficient. I draw special attention to that.  Even if it is necessary to introduce a Bill doing away with some of the old Charters and superseding the powers they claim of maintaining the roads within their areas, the matter ought to be dealt with.  It is a crying necessity. You have good roads entering a town at one end, and good roads going out at the other end.  The roads are good enough until you come to the boundary, but the moment you strike that you strike bog and do not feel a good road again until you get out at the other end of the town.  That is the rule, and not the exception.  The Minister said in a very off-hand way, the ratepayers had very little to complain of, and that <Col N="113" /> they could congratulate themselves on only having 98 per cent. of increase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think 98 per cent. is a huge amount, something to give us food for thought at the moment.  A good deal has been made, and continues to be made, about the cost of living, but other people have to live besides people in receipt of salaries.  The country is very fast losing its capacity to pay.  That capacity has been reduced considerably.  One of the principal industries of the country is the dairy industry, and the price this year of the principal article of dairy produce, milk, is such that the agricultural community will be very lucky if they get 6d. a gallon, and that that can be maintained for twelve months.  It is the same with every other agricultural revenue-producing source.  Farmers will be lucky if they get anything like what will meet their outlay.  Ninetyeight per cent. of an increase cannot be approached as a light matter; it is a very serious matter for the ratepayer. There is no question of an increase in his position.  There is a decrease in his capacity.  The farmer is in a worse position to-day than he was in 1914.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I do not know if I made it clear but our object, and present policy, are to fix the increase on road expenditure from the rates at 60 per cent. above pre-war.  That is fixing it at something like the farmers' index figure for what he gets for his commodities, and that is considerably below the cost of living figure.  Ninetyeight per cent. was the average figure of last year and the two years before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose he does get 60 per cent., which is rather doubtful at the moment.  I do not think it is 60 per cent. increase with regard to milk. What, then, would the pre-war price be?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards milk, something about 4d. would be right.  Are we asked to accept that?  This is a very serious matter.  The Minister is <Col N="114" /> quite right when he said that most of the roads, practically all our roads, were never intended to bear extraordinarily heavy traffic.  The foundations were never laid to bear such heavy traffic, and when he fixes the limit at nine tons laden, I think he is still too high.  I think six tons laden will have to be about the weight, and, even then, only a small proportion of the roads, outside the main roads, will be able to bear it.  None of the bye-roads is in a condition to bear a six-ton lorry. When you come to examine the amount of money that will be required per mile to deal with this class of road construction, I think £27 a mile will go very short of achieving what the Minister has in view and what we all have in view.  I do not see any prospect of doing business in any kind of a satisfactory manner with the cheaper class of roads mentioned.  The cheapest kind is £1,000 a mile.  I do not think the Minister himself would recommend that except in exceptional cases.  I think we may assume that it will be roughly £3,000 a mile or £2,860.  How far this £27 a mile gives a good prospect in that direction I do not know. The two things hang together.  The Minister may have figures at his disposal, but, listening to his statement for the first time, I am rather doubtful that his figures are right.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, it is a thing I can never understand, and I am glad to find that it is the general opinion in this House that nobody can understand it.  I will give one concrete example to the Minister.  It is, perhaps, the best way to bring home to him the hardships that are being suffered by a good many people in this country.  In the matter of county hospitals the majority of the buildings that are being used were invariably, before the amalgamation scheme, county infirmaries.  If I might say so, the atmosphere of the operating theatre still hangs around them, and people regard them as only places for surgical cases.  There were, in most of the other towns, hospitals in connection with other institutions that were there for the benefit of the poor, and they were mainly regarded as places for medical cases.  People who go into the present institutions for medical attention do not expect, and invariably do not get, the care and attention that were given formerly to medical cases.  They have to go with the surgical cases into the county hospitals where the atmosphere of the operating theatre still obtains. The one concrete example that I wanted to give is this.  I remember seeing a married man of about 30 years of age, one evening at the end of his house.  It was a cold evening, and he was trying to pacify a child of about eight months.  I asked him where the mother of the child was, and he said she was in the county hospital. Here was this unfortunate man trying to look after a child in arms because <Col N="118" /> the child would not be taken in with the mother.  In the other institutions infants were admitted with their mothers.  That is only one case of the terrible hardship that people have to suffer.  Imagine the condition of that unfortunate man trying to look after an infant.  I think it ought to be sufficient to bring home to the mind of the Minister some of the hardships that are now being suffered in the country.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Shaw regarding girls in the county homes, but I will pass it over and refer to another class of people that are housed in the county homes.  I refer to the harmless insane and the imbeciles.  I saw their condition in some cases, and it is not at all conducive, where there is only temporary insanity, to the happiness of the unfortunate people or to the restoration of their sanity.  Their surroundings are gloomy at present, and something should be done to take them elsewhere and make their surroundings better and more likely to improve their mental condition.  In the case of paying patients it is a very serious matter. If I could be sure that the sick poor would get first attention I would be perfectly satisfied, but from a lot of the hints one gets, I think that such a thing is not being done.  Further, there is in these county hospitals such a thing as wrangling amongst doctors as to whether they are to be closed boroughs for one set of doctors more than another, or for one or two doctors more than others.  That kind of thing is not conductive to the interests of the sick poor, and it should get immediate attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding motor traffic, I said when the Budget proposals were going through that you could not force motor traffic off the road at the present time, but this much I would suggest to the Minister,&mdash;that it is not at all equitable to be endeavouring to maintain a national service as a local charge because that is what is being done at the moment.  The road service at the moment in the country is a national service and you are endeavouring to maintain that up to the standard as a local charge which is not at all equitable. The development of tourist traffic is, of course, an excellent thing, <Col N="119" /> but we should be mindful, too, of the people who are constantly in the district and paying for the maintenance of the roads just as we are mindful of the people who come to spend a very short time in the district.  I would suggest to the Minister very seriously and earnestly that he should assure us of some change in the present amalgamation scheme or of some immediate attention to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>One is disappointed to hear from the Minister, after the consideration that has been given to this road problem extending over a number of years, that we are to have in the future exactly the same method of maintenance, the same distribution of responsibility, as has existed in this country for a number of years.  I have maintained that that system is wrong in principle.  The proposal of the Minister appears to be that certain roads, known as trunk roads, will be maintained out of the Road Fund.  I was wrong in saying &ldquo;will be maintained&rdquo; because I understand from the Minister that these trunk roads will be constructed out of the Road Fund and will be maintained by the local authorities.  I do not know whether I am correct in that view of the Minister's statement or not.  He did not seem to be very clear on the point and one would like to be quite clear before one starts to criticise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>Not altogether.  They might be maintained as to seventy-five per cent. out of the National Fund and twenty-five per cent. out of the rates. One cannot make any clear distinction because these 1,500 miles of road may <Col N="120" /> ultimately be very greatly extended. There are over 4,000 miles of what we call trunk roads in the country at the moment and 4,500 miles of linked roads.  This is an arbitrary selection of roads arrived at by our experts.  It is not a fixed mileage by any means. There may be other roads included in it later on and we cannot lay down a hard and fast policy to hold to indefinitely.</P>

      <P>The President has referred to the question of money.  May I remind him that the increased charge on the local authorities for the last two years is one of forty per cent. and that it has very largely arisen, as the President knows, from the increased cost of maintenance and construction of roadways within those areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase that the Minister has anticipated in connection with the local authorities' rates for roads is sixty per cent. over the pre-war cost.  To that is added the whole of the Road Fund and the Deputy might concern himself with suggesting how best this money could be spent.  The Minister has tabled his proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Road Fund, we have argued that the road users should contribute more largely in the future to the construction and maintenance of the roads than what they have done in the past and that less of that burden should fall on the local authorities.  In consequence of <Col N="121" /> that recommendation there is included in the Budget of this year what is admittedly a heavy charge on road users. I do not remember at the moment what the product of that charge will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD.</NameTxt>
      <P>We will leave the question of the clippings alone.  We want to get from road users a very much larger proportion of the cost of and maintenance of roadways than we have done in the past and I must strongly urge that the local authorities should be relieved of that burden to a very considerable extent.  It has been properly argued here that the tourist traffic is an important asset in the country.  We recognise that, but tourists go to these places of attraction and those of us who know this State of ours know that the places of attraction are confined to a comparatively small number of counties.  The other counties are the highways to these places.  They do not benefit at all from that tourist traffic.  But the proposal is that they are to maintain the roadways leading to these centres from which they derive no benefit.  That is why I hold it is unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that the Minister had stated that.  I was laying down an axiom that will be clear to every Deputy.  I do not attribute that to the Minister, but seeing that that method, the present policy whereby it is proposed to go as far as laying down the roadways, to put the maintenance of these roadways on the local authorities, and seeing that the local authorities in many cases derive no benefit whatever from that through-traffic, I say it is an unfair system.  As long as that system prevails, I for one, at all events, will oppose it.</P>

      <P>Absolute nonsense. Absurd.  In 1923-24 the sum contributed from local rates for roads was £1,300,000 odd.  Last year it was £1,200,000.  I am speaking from memory, but I am not far out as regards the amount.  The incidence has gone down for the last three years by £150,000, approximately.  I would like to know how the forty per cent. was made up on that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>

      <P>The President can dispute the figures given to me in an answer by the Minister for Finance. That is the best authority I can quote. The President may be a better authority, but, in an answer the Minister for Finance gave me within the last few months, he informed me&mdash;the President will find the answer on the records&mdash;that in 1922-23 the local expenditure amounted to £1 3s. 1d. per head of the population, and that in 1924-25 the amount had increased to £1 13s. 5d. per head of the population. I leave those figures to the President. One would like to see improved standards in methods of road construction and road maintenance.  Those who pass occasionally through the different counties notice not alone the different surfacing on the different roadways but they notice, as well, the different methods of the different engineers in different counties.</P>

      <P>It is capable of improvement, and that is why I draw the attention of the Minister to it.  There are certain counties in which considerable improvement might be effected both in road construction and in road maintenance. There are some counties where one is delighted to see the condition of the roadways.  The Minister might, through his Department, have improvement effected in certain counties which I will not name at the moment. I am sure the Minister knows them himself.  Unfortunately, the roadways of some counties are notoriously bad in comparison with those of other counties.  And these counties in which there are bad roadways have a considerable attraction for tourists.  I might say, in passing, that a little more attention on the part of the Department and its officials to the officials of those counties would add to the comfort of the tourist, and would also add to the number of the tourists who visit those areas.</P>
      <P>As regards the weight of traffic on the roadways, there will be opportunities of discussing that matter on another occasion.  But it occurs to one that the question of the size of tyres has not had the attention that is desirable in connection with modern road construction.  Possibly if we devoted some of the attention&mdash;Deputy Hewat will agree with this&mdash;that is being devoted to what we call heavy lorries, to the tyres that heavy vehicles use, it would be better.  It is common knowledge that certain forms of tyres and certain widths of tyres do infinitely more damage to roadways than others. Additional attention should be devoted to that subject in the future.  It would help to lighten the burden of the maintenance of these roadways.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of housing, I observe from the Minister's statement that there has been a falling off in the number of houses erected under the 1925 Act, as compared with the number erected under the 1924 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to enter into any discussion with the President <Col N="124" /> at the moment.  Possibly we will have other opportunities of dealing with these points.  I want to concentrate more on the Minister for Local Government for the moment, and leave the President for a future occasion.  I notice from the Minister's statement that under the 1924 Act there were 3,609 houses erected and that under the 1925 Act there were 3,366 houses erected.  The falling off is one that may to some extent be accounted for by the policy.  That is why I call attention to it.  The policy of the Minister with regard to housing and the policy which he has urged on local authorities has been to concentrate very largely on five-room houses.  The five-room house caters for the more well-to-do section of the working classes.  There is a limit to the demand for that type of house. It means a rental of anything from 12s. to 20s., and I do not for the moment suggest that there have not been four-room houses and three-room houses erected under these schemes, but the policy has been to encourage the larger house.</P>
      <P>It does appear to me that we should direct more attention to the smaller type of house and thereby provide for a section of the community that has been, to some extent, overlooked in connection with our housing proposals &mdash;the poorer section, the men who are not able to pay from 13/- to 20/- a week for a house.  Seeing that the well-to-do tradesmen have been provided for during the last couple of years, something should be done for the unskilled labourers who form a larger proportion of the community than the skilled labourers.  These are the unfortunate people who dwell very largely in tenements and in the slums of our city and large towns.  One would like to see a bigger attempt to provide suitable houses and better surroundings for those people than was done under the previous Acts.  I admit there are difficulties in respect of these cases that are not as easy of solution as the difficulties in the case of other classes of the community.  But I think the time has arrived when we should do something more for them than has been done in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sir Jas. Craig has complained <Col N="125" /> that the local authorities are not doing as much as regards examination of foods as they should and he says that the death rate which has been considerably reduced, might be still further reduced if there were greater activity by the local authorities in this direction.  I do not doubt that statement but I do urge that the fines that accrue from the work of those local authorities should not, as is provided for in an Act passed recently, go into the Central Fund but should go towards the expenses of the local authorities as they did heretofore. This is going to place a further burden on the local authorities and the effect of that will be that the local authorities will not be as active in the future, seeing that it is going to cause them greater expense.  I should like the Minister to use his influence with the Minister for Finance and get him to issue an order, as is possible under that Act, so that the local authorities will get from the Central Fund the moneys they received in the past from these fines.  There would be no excuse then for any falling off in the work. If these fines are taken from them, it must be obvious that the work done in the past will not be continued in the future.</P>
    <P>Attention has been directed from the Labour benches to the question of paying patients in hospitals.  Let me say, as one who has had some little experience extending over many years of the working of our hospitals, that but for the money received from paying patients a great many of the hospitals would be closed up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to hospitals with which I am associated.  I think the principle applies to all hospitals&mdash;that those who can afford, as many of our better class trades people can afford, to contribute to the hospitals during time of treatment should do so.  I am glad to note that that principle has met with such approval from some of the Labour organisations that the Unions contribute themselves to the hospitals for their members while in hospital.  That <Col N="126" /> principle ought to be encouraged.  If it is not encouraged and if it is not more largely adopted, these hospitals, which do such magnificent work for the poor of our cities and towns, will have limits placed on their ability to carry on that work by reason of inadequate funds.  I am glad to know that the number of paying patients is largely on the increase in these hospitals. But for that fact, many of our hospitals would have to close their doors to those they were accustomed to help in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I will intervene to point out that Deputy Good asked the Minister for Finance on 4th December, 1925, a question as to what the expenditure, local and national, was in the years 1922-23, 1923-24 and 1924-25.  I am sure Deputy Good did not want to pose in that question.  I am sure it was an innocent question and a fair question.  But I should like to point out that the year 1922-23 was not a year that any sensible business man would base a case on.  The estimate for 1922-23 was compiled by the Co. Councils in December, 1921.  Just imagine for a moment what the condition of affairs was then.  For 18 months the Agricultural Grant had been held up, the Estate Duty Grant had been held up, and various grants in connection with local administration generally were in suspense.  Obviously, in the year 1922-23 there was a complete mix-up in the finance of local authorities.  Deputy Good will, I think, admit that that is not a year upon which a standard could be based.  I should like to hear from the Deputy on this point, on which we ought to be honest with ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will not answer, I will have to go a little further into it. I rather dislike going into it, as I happened to be a member of the Corporation of Dublin at the time.  I recollect the economies we had to recommend and which had to be accepted by the Corporation.  They were far-reaching. They went so far as to ask the work-people employed in the Corporation to take 75 per cent. of their wages for nine months in order to enable us to carry on the administration of the city. They agreed.  In 1922&mdash;it may have <Col N="127" /> been in January and it may have been as late as February&mdash;the British Government agreed to pay £1,300,000 out of the withheld grants.  That was the year Deputy Good selected and which the Press has taken up in order to prove that there has been 40 per cent. increase in local expenditure from that year to the next year and, continuing that sum, 40 per cent. up along from the other years.  The Deputy has not said whether or not that was a fair year to put down as standard and to mark the incidence of an increased percentage from.  I think the House is satisfied that you might as well base a case on a balloon in connection with finance as on the year 1922-23.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>We have disposed of that to everyone's satisfaction except that of Deputy Good.  The other point is that of Deputy Morrissey, what the Minister's view was of the Executive Council's attitude in turning down his last year's programme for three and a half million pounds. I am not concerned with what the Minister's view is, but, in justice to the Executive Council, some explanation should be given.  The income from the Road Fund is £540,000.  A three and a half million pounds programme would absorb, taking the figures of the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech, £310,000 on a two million capital expenditure.  A three and a half million capital expenditure would absorb £540,000.  That is the whole of the fund.  That is why the Executive Council could not view with equanimity the proposal to capitalise the entire amount of the Road Fund. They proceeded to approach consideration of the question, No. 1 by increasing the income of the Road Fund, and No. 2 by putting aside as much of the increase and a little of the ordinary income of the Road Fund as would satisfy the claims in respect to the two million capital expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was hoped to increase the income of the Road Fund by 50 per cent.  The nervousness of certain Deputies&mdash;I do <Col N="128" /> not know whether Deputy Good is one who is nervous&mdash;has confirmed the suspicion I entertained that we were not going to get that 50 per cent. Deputy Good has made a case that road-users were taxed a little more here than they were elsewhere.  Road-users were paying relatively less here than in England.  This year they are asked to pay as much.  The ordinary man who uses his car as Deputy Good does, for his business and pleasure, has been getting off to the extent of 10 per cent. for the last three or four years.  Now, with better roads, he is asked to pay more.</P>

      <P>In the County of Cork there are several urban councils and the roads were managed or maintained by those up to a short time ago.  They are all very aggrieved at being interfered with by the arrangement of the Local Government Department.  Cork County Council are prepared to meet them half-way, and I believe, in some instances, have already agreed to allow them to carry on as usual for the reasons that there are certain staffs employed by those urban councils, and that it will disorganise the staffs.  Some of them will have to lose their employment if the new regulation is persisted in.  In some of those urban councils you have other services.  In one of them you have a harbour board&mdash; Youghal.  The county council knows nothing about the management of the harbour board.  There are other services the county council cannot well manage, the cleansing of towns after a fair or market day or the sprinkling of the street on a dry day.  The county council will be far away from it.  I suggest to the Minister for Local Government that he should allow the county councils and the urban councils to enter into a mutual agreement, and let them carry on in order not to disorganise <Col N="129" /> the services that have been well managed for many years.</P>

      <P>We are all wishing that the county medical officer will be appointed very quickly because, in the different districts, especially the poorer villages and a lot of the towns, there are people living in fearful houses and, might I say, the doctors are not interfering with them?  Perhaps they have reasons of their own.  Let us hope that we will get an independent doctor who will go around, condemn those houses, and report to the Local Government Department.  Let us hope the Minister and his staff will enforce the law so that these poor people will not be living in houses which have been condemned during the last twenty years, I suppose, at least ten times.  The moment one family leaves, another poor family hopes to get in.  When one family dies from consumption, which is so much dreaded by Deputy Sir James Craig, another family hopes to enter the house.  Hence it is that a lot of poor people contract consumption in this way.  These old houses should be burned and better houses built wherever the money will be got.  The real way to do that is to get this county medical officer immediately to see that the law is properly administered and that these people will be relieved.  I ask the Minister for Local Government immediately to appoint this county officer of health.  It is the best part of the Local Government Act.  It was the only part acceptable to a great many in this House and it is the part which is acceptable to none more than the poor people who are expecting the appointment of the medical officer of health for the last nine months.</P>

      <P>I propose to refer to the reply given to Deputy Morrissey's criticism in regard to the question of patients.  I think that Deputy Morrissey referred to county hospitals maintained for the benefit of the poor. Deputy Good, in dealing with the revenue <Col N="130" /> of other hospitals, did not, I think, understand the case put up by Deputy Morrissey.  Deputy Morrissey referred to the hospitals maintained for the poor and to the way in which accommodation was monopolised to the detriment of the poor, and I think his remarks were justified.  As regards the road policy of the Ministry, I congratulate them.  They have done useful work generally in regard to improving the roads.  I would, however, like to direct the Minister's attention to a matter in that connection.  I was glad to hear Deputy Gorey's statement in regard to this subject because the tendency in many places, especially on the part of local authorities, is anything but progressive.  In Cork county, where Deputy Gorey's Party have a majority on the county council, a different line of action is taken.  There are men on that council who hold Stone Age views and their principal cry is &ldquo;back to 1914.&rdquo;  Their policy is to reduce road expenditure, but they forget that the conditions now are entirely different to those of 1914.  They have cut down expenditure to such an extent that within the next two or three years the roads in that county, with the exception of those which will be dealt with by the Minister's Department, will be little better than goat tracks.  I know a case in that county where an agreement was entered into to maintain a road for £1 18s. 6d.  I regret that the progressive policy of the Ministry is not reflected to any great extent in that of the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to amalgamation schemes, I appreciate the fact that when that policy was thought out the difficulties were very considerable.  Those who put that policy into practice were actuated by the best motives, but it was thought out very hastily, and it was too big a question to be dealt with under semi-war conditions, and it has not justified itself to any considerable extent.  From my experience in connection with a local authority, I do not think that the result of the amalgamation scheme for Cork County has resulted in economy.  As a member of the county council, I am satisfied from the claims that come in for compensation for loss of office and other claims, <Col N="131" /> that the net result will be a loss.  Along with that, you have to take the different services that have now to be maintained. Take, for instance, the condition of people in West Cork, especially in Castletownbere, where the people live eighty miles from the county home.  I can leave it to the Minister to picture the discomfort that is endured by old people who have to be carried eighty miles to the county home.  It has resulted in great hardship to the poor people, and sooner or later, the Minister will be faced with the alternative either of changing the scheme or of scrapping it altogether. Any economy effected under it has been at the expense of the poor.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to another matter which I regard as very important.  The Poor Law Commission sat recently in Cork, and I am not sure whether the Secretary of the Ministry was present at the sitting or not&mdash;I think he was&mdash;but Mr. Monahan, Commissioner for Cork, gave evidence.  He referred to the position of paupers&mdash;as he called them in his very charitable phraseology&mdash;and he dealt with the expense of removing them from where they died to their homes.  He amazed many people by saying that if a pauper, belonging, for instance, to Macroom, died in Cork, people should not be asked to spend the few shillings that would be necessary to convey him to his home.  He further said that a pauper is only entitled to a pauper's grave, and that he would be slow to advocate a policy of incurring expense to convey that person home. I never heard a more uncharitable expression, and if that is the frame of mind which is generally reflected in the Commissioners appointed by the Minister, there is not much hope for poor people, especially when we remember that people on local authorities in other parts of the country are expected to be guided by an experienced administrator like Mr. Monahan.  This gentleman has been paraded in the Press, notably in the &ldquo;Irish Independent,&rdquo; as being a person who effected considerable economies in the area of his administration.  If he is effecting economies in that way, he is doing it <Col N="132" /> only by hurting the poor, and he has not shown any Christian, humane, or honourable spirit in his treatment of the poor.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to see that the amalgamation system shall be carried out as humanely as possible, especially in regard to the poor, and that due respect shall be paid to the custom of the country of honouring the dead and giving them decent burial, whether they are poor or not.</P>
    <P>In regard to the amalgamation system generally, another very serious difficulty is the question of hospital accommodation. I know a particular instance rather intimately, because I brought it to the notice of the Minister some time ago.  The vicinity of Castletownbere has for a number of months past been visited by fever of a virulent type, and numbers of people have died.  The small hospital that was there was occupied by National troops, and day after day at meetings of the board of health we got reports regarding the outbreak of fever.  The nearest hospital is the county home in Clonakilty, some seventy or eighty miles away.  I suggest that in this particular case where we have outbreaks of a very serious kind of disease, with the whole countryside becoming affected, through the ignorance of the people in having wakes in cases where they are not prevented in time, the position is a very serious one, and some attempt ought to be made to provide hospital accommodation within reasonable distance of such a district.</P>
    <P>What is the attitude of the Department in regard to the question of labourers' cottages?  Is it their intention to do anything in regard to the building of further cottages? Local authorities find day by day an increasing demand for labourers' cottages, and although I come from a district where perhaps a very strong claim cannot be advanced for the building of more houses, having regard to the amount of arrears outstanding, not perhaps that the tenants have entirely failed to honour their obligations, but because of the system that prevailed in the past, I think that something might be done generally, because <Col N="133" /> no question of huge amounts of arrears obtains generally.  What is the attitude of the Minister in regard to legislation to enable tenants to purchase labourers' cottages?  This is a question that many of us are frequently asked about.  There are thrifty and industrious people who are anxious to be secure in their own homes by being allowed to purchase them.  I think it would be a very good thing if the Minister would outline some scheme whereby such tenants as are willing and as are in a position to become the owners of their houses might be allowed to do so.</P>
    <P>At present the members of the Cork County Council and the people generally are in a state of ferment in regard to the question of the payment of bonuses to local officials.  A very dishonest agitation is being carried on in Cork in regard to this matter.  The chairman of the county council, the gentleman who was referred to yesterday, has, I understand, refused to sign the pay sheets because bonuses of local officials are included.  The bonus varies with the cost of living, and as the cost of living goes down, the bonus is reduced. My view is that this is a matter for which legislation is needed.  At any rate, the result of this agitation in Cork will mean that in a short time the public services will be in a state of chaos.  Another Department concerned with this matter is that of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, but I am not entitled to refer to that now.  I would like the Minister to take definite action to clear up this position.  Day after day we are treated to sermons with regard to the attitude of the Department in refusing to sanction the abolition of these bonuses, and the so-called economists are treating us to homilies on the extravagance of the Local Government Department in this matter.  The Minister should make his position clear, and should take action to protect the local officials, at the same time pointing out, if legislation is necessary, what are the intentions of the Department with regard to it.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Daly's reference to urban roads.  We have had complaints as regards the hardships entailed by the new order made by the <Col N="134" /> Minister in regard to urban roads.  The position is that the main roads running through an urban area are supposed to be maintained by the county council.  The back roads are being maintained by the urban staff.  In adiiton to the unemployment and disorganisation to the urban staff that this causes, there seems in many urban areas to be absolute confusion as to who is responsible for scavenging.  I have had complaints regarding the filthy condition of towns due to this, and there does not seem to be any clear idea as to what exactly the position is.  It seems rather peculiar to have the county council workmen working in one part of the town and urban employees in another part.  I have heard that this is a preliminary to the abolition of the urban councils.  I hope that the Minister will make the position clear on this matter.</P>
    <P>The county homes are buildings that used to be called workhouses.  Most of us, and most of the people, were not in love with workhouses, but so far as I can see the workhouses have only changed in name.  I was recently through a workhouse that is now glorified by the title &ldquo;county home&rdquo; and I was very much struck with the absence of any real comfort in it.  I saw unfortunate people rigged out in the regulation uniform, huddled together in cold and cheerless dining-rooms, and taking their food out of tin mugs.  It is not the question of the tin mugs that matters so much as that of the food, but it appeared to me that, with very little extra expense, a more comfortable atmosphere could be created in such a building.  It was cold, cheerless and bare, and it struck me as being more in the nature of a county jail than a county home.  I suggest that a more humane line should be adopted with regard to institutions of that kind.  The poor have always had a horror of going into a place like this, and I do not wonder at it, having seen the conditions.  I saw a cold, bare, hard board in the dining-room. It would not make much difference in the cost of running the institution if a table-cloth were provided. There are pretty gardens around workhouse <Col N="135" /> buildings in some places, and it would not be too much luxury to place a bunch of flowers on the table. That may sound ridiculous to some people, but it might brighten the atmosphere for unfortunate people who are compelled to end their days in a place like that and who were in far more comfortable positions.</P>
    <P>Another matter brought to my notice was that there are large numbers of old people in these county homes who are unable to take strong food.  I saw dinner being provided that appeared to me to be good, substantial and well-cooked, but an official pointed out that there were many toothless old men and women who were unable to eat cooked meat and potatoes, that application had been made for an alteration of the dietary scale to provide such people with more suitable food, and that owing to some regulation such an alteration could not be sanctioned by the Department.  At any rate they did not sanction it.  That appears to be too cast-iron an attitude altogether, and I think that in a case like this an alteration might very easily have been made.  The result at present is that the food simply goes to waste.  That is a matter that the Minister might give some attention to.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of housing, I have nothing but praise for the manner in which the Housing Act has worked, as far as my experience goes. I live in a town where no houses had been built for twenty or thirty years before this Act came into force, and I can say that the whole appearance of the town, and of many other places that I know, has been transformed within the last two or three years. Any praise that is given to the Minister or to the Department in regard <Col N="136" /> to this housing effort is well deserved.  I would suggest in regard to future housing legislation, that attention might be given to the small houses.  The only difficulty I have seen with regard to these new houses is that the types of houses put up are not in most cases available for the people most in need of houses, and the only relief that the building of these houses brings them is that they may be able to leave the wretched houses they are in and get into the slightly better ones that are vacated by the men who go into the new houses.  At any rate, this scheme has been a great success, and I hope that this housing policy will be continued for a very long time, because the need for houses, particularly in small towns where no urban authorities are in existence, is very great.  In cases where towns have urban powers the local authority has a means of raising money, but in some cases they have not been very active. Perhaps the need for houses has not been so great as in these small towns where there are no urban powers.  At any rate in one town I know of the Housing Act has worked wonders, and I have to thank the Department for the manner in which it has been thought and worked out.  With the foregoing criticisms I think I have covered all the ground.  But I do suggest again to the Minister that he might, with advantage to the State, to the poor people, and to the good name of his own Department, review this whole system of workhouse amalgamation and improve it radically.</P>
