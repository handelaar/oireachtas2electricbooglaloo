      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that Mr. Cuffe, Tyrrellspass, Westmeath, made a claim for £450 in respect to the loss of a car which was commandeered by British forces; that the sum granted was only £50, and whether this case will be re-investigated with a view to increasing this amount.</P>

      <P>The claim referred to by the Deputy was considered by the Compensation (Ireland) Commission and found by them to be outside the scope of their terms of reference.  In certain cases of hardship, however, the Commission were empowered to submit special recommendations for the payment of compensation, and in this instance they recommended an award of £50.  Their recommendation was accepted and the award duly paid.</P>
      <P>As the Commission has now ceased to function the matter cannot be reopened and the award must be accepted as final.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>My intention is to move the acceptance of all these amendments.</P>
      <P>The Dáil went into Committee to consider the Seanad amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>1. In Section 7 (1), after the figures &ldquo;1923,&rdquo; line 63, the following words and figures inserted: &ldquo;and prior to the 24th day of June, 1926, by the Principal Act, or, in case such agreement was made on or after the 24th day of June, 1926.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was introduced at my request in the Seanad.  A suggestion appeared in a letter in the public Press that Section 7 as originally drafted went further than it was intended to go.  Under Section 7 as drafted it might appear that agreements would be validated over the period June, 1923, to June, 1926, even though the rent reserved exceeded the standard rent by more than the amount permitted by the Principal Act&mdash;in other words, that the extra 10 per cent. bonus given by Section 6 of the present Bill would be a permitted increase so far as these validated agreements were concerned.  That was not the intention. The intention was to validate agreements which were not enforceable merely because of a technical omission on the part of the landlord.  It was not intended to put him in any better position than the landlord who had observed all these technicalities.  The <Col N="1133" /> amendment ensures that what were in fact the intentions are fully carried out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the intention which the Minister has explained was the purpose of the section was believed by the Dáil to have been the actual intention, and if this amendment&mdash;as it does&mdash;makes that clear, I think there should be no objection to accepting it.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendments 2 and 4&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>2. In Section 9 the word &ldquo;while,&rdquo; in line 61, deleted and the following words substituted therefor: &ldquo;during any period not exceeding six months during which.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>4. In Section 9 all words from and including the word &ldquo;Provided,&rdquo; in line 66, deleted to the end of the section.</P>
      <P>These are merely drafting amendments and there is no change in the substance or effect of the Bill by their acceptance.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment 3:&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In Section 9, before the word &ldquo;tenant,&rdquo; line 64, the word &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; inserted.</P>
      <P>This amendment will affect, as I think, only rather large houses.  It was pointed out to me that a landlord should not be penalised for the rates of an empty house where he was bona fide unable to get a suitable tenant&mdash;that is, a tenant who, having regard to the size of the house, might reasonably be expected to be able to pay the rent and to maintain the house and the premises in a proper condition.  I think that there can be very little danger of abuse in connection with the amendment, because the question will fall to be decided in the first instance by the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the local authority disputes the fact that the houseowner was unable to obtain a suitable tenant they will, of course, not remit the rates, and an appeal from assessment of rates in connection with the house would only lie <Col N="1134" /> to the court.  There the question of fact as to whether the house was only kept vacant because a suitable tenant was not forthcoming would fall to be determined, and the landlord would have to satisfy the court that he was not unreasonably refusing to let his house to applicants.  It should be clear that a landlord does not necessarily act unreasonably merely because he refuses to let a house to an applicant.  If a particular applicant for a house were well known to be improvident and destructive it would be a hardship to expect, the houseowner to let him a valuable house of considerable size and high rent.  On the whole, therefore, I thought it better to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>To a house of what valuation does this amendment apply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>It would apply to any house.  There is no restriction on valuation, but I anticipate that its application will only arise in connection with large houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this is an amendment which should be opposed if the consequences of defeating it and having possible disagreement with the Seanad were not so great.  I realise that if, from a disagreement by the Dáil with the Seanad on a matter of this kind, the Bill did not become law for nine months, the effect would be that tenants all over the country would be at the mercy of the landlord three years earlier than they would otherwise be.  The Bill generally is designed to place landlords in a position in three years time to extract anything that they can get out of the tenants in circumstances of a house famine, but if this amendment led to a disagreement between the two Houses that permission to the landlords would be operative in a fortnight's time.  Therefore I do not propose to oppose the amendment for fear of a calamity which would arise if the Bill did not become law, even in its present very unsatisfactory form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the amendment will give rise to litigation.  Who will decide suitability as between the houseowner and the local authority?  Suitability will become a matter of dispute and <Col N="1135" /> will lead perhaps to a kind of lobbying and canvassing by the houseowner of the members of the local authority as to whether they would not agree that such-and-such a person was suitable or unsuitable.  I therefore think that, while the amendment is undesirable on its merits, the consequences of a quarrel between the Dáil and the Seanad would be too grave, and therefore I shall not oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">

      <P>If this amendment is accepted it will mean that any landlord whose house becomes vacant can keep it idle for twelve months or two years, until he gets a tenant able to pay him an exorbitant rent.  House accommodation is very scarce and people are not in a position to pay big rents, rents that may be 200 per cent. above the standard of 1914.  Yet such a landlord, under this proposal, will be able to keep the house vacant until a suitable tenant, who would be able to pay him 200 or 300 per cent. over the standard rent, comes along.  Last year the Minister accepted an amendment to the Rent Restrictions Bill making landlords responsible for the rates on vacant houses, and that facilitated people in the towns very much.  The landlords had to pay the rates whether the houses were occupied or not, and consequently they let them at fair rents.  But if this amendment is accepted they would not; they will not be losing anything by having the houses vacant, and some landlords would prefer to have them idle rather than to let them at a rent which a workman or artisan would be able to pay.</P>

      <P>I have very little shame in admitting that I do not understand the Deputy, and I do not know whether many Deputies do.  The Bill fixes a maximum rent, and there is no question of a house being kept vacant until a tenant who will pay an exorbitant rent comes along.  The rent of any tenant is likely to be on the level fixed by the Bill, beyond which it becomes illegal, and the extent of the amendment is merely to make it possible for a houseowner to refuse to let to a particular person on some such grounds that he, to put it crudely, would not be a good mark for the rent, <Col N="1136" /> or that his means would not permit of his keeping the house, and possibly premises outside the house, in a proper condition of repair.  These are valid reasons on which a houseowner might hesitate to let a house.  But the question as to whether in a particular case reasons exist, and exist to a degree that would justify refusal to let, would ultimately fall to be determined by the court.</P>
      <P>If the local authority were satisfied that a suitable tenant for the house was not forthcoming they would remit the rates.  If they did not accept the contention that a suitable tenant was forthcoming for the house they would not remit the rates, and an appeal from that decision, if the houseowner thought fit to take it, would, of course, lie to the court.  There the question of fact as to whether or not the house was empty because of the absence of a suitable tenant would be determined.  But Deputies should realise, putting themselves in the place of the owner of house property, that people might be applying for the tenancy of a house who would be distinctly unsuitable.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment 5.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In Section 14, after the word &ldquo;due,&rdquo; line 59, the following words inserted, &ldquo;by a landlord or any sum claimed to be recoverable by a tenant.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill was before the Dáil there was a discussion on the advisability of questions of standard rent, and kindred matters, being decided in any action that might be taken for recovery of possession and recovery of rent due.  It was pointed out that the Principal Act enabled this to be done where an action lay for recovery of possession, and Section 14 was put in to deal with a case where the action was for recovery of rent.  This present amendment extends Section 14 to the case where the landlord is sued by the tenant for alleged overpayments of rent.  If a tenant takes such action I think that auxiliary questions, such as the amount of the standard rent, could be decided by the court in the same action, and that is the <Col N="1137" /> purpose of the amendment.  It is simply a slight extension of what was already provided in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I move&mdash;&ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment 7.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In Section 14 the following sub-section added at the end of the section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The court shall, if satisfied that any error or omission in a statutory notice, whether served before or after the passing of this Act, is due to a bona fide mistake on the part of the landlord, have power to amend such statutory notice, by correcting any errors and supplying any omissions therein which, if not corrected or supplied, would render such statutory notice invalid, on such terms and conditions as respects arrears of rent or otherwise as appear to the court to be just and reasonable and, if the court so directs, the statutory notice as so amended shall have effect and be deemed to have had effect as a valid statutory notice.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a new sub-section.  The position hitherto has been that certain defects in statutory notices served by the landlord on the tenant have had the effect of completely invalidating the notices.  The decided cases do not make it very clear what particular defects are vital, but it seems possible that mere errors in calculation invalidate a notice ab initio, and that seems unduly rigid.  The amendment would enable the court to rectify bona fide mistakes. I would like to make it clear that the penalty provided by the Principal Act for fraudulent misrepresentation is unimpaired by the amendment, but it is possible, say, in a big office, dealing with a good many tenants, that a purely clerical error might bona fide creep into the notice.  It is rather unduly <Col N="1138" /> rigid that a mistake of that kind, with no question of fraud or anything of that kind involved, should utterly invalidate the notice, and it is thought proper to give to the court power to rectify mistakes of that kind when the court is entirely satisfied that the mistake was bona fide.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In page 2, lines 11 to 14, Section 2 (1), to delete paragraph (c).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to exclude from the operations of the Bill minor officers such as rate collectors and others employed by local authorities. It was pointed out on the Committee Stage the difficulties that would arise if these minor officers were to be appointed by the Commission.  We have given some consideration to the matter, and we think it would be better if paragraph (c) were deleted from the Bill. It has been agreed that medical officers and people requiring technical qualifications should be appointed by the Commission, but in the case of minor officers we are of opinion that their appointment should be made by the local people who will know their character and all about them, and upon whom the responsibility will fall if any defalcations occur.</P>

      <P>This amendment was before the House on the Committee Stage and was withdrawn.  I think that at the time Deputy Baxter was satisfied that it was an amendment that could not very well be urged.  It is one that is very wide in its scope and would restrict the application of this Act.  It would scarcely be worth while passing the Bill if we were to restrict its scope within the limits that the amendment indicates.  If the paragraph were deleted it would mean that some very important offices should be filled without reference to the machinery of this Bill, such offices, for instance, as matron to a county home, clerk to a mental hospital, accountant to the <Col N="1140" /> county council, health assistant officers, etc.  It is quite as necessary that we should have the machinery of the Act in those cases as in the case of professional and technical officers.  For that reason I ask the Deputy not to press the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Bill provide that in the case of an accountant to a county council the local body can promote an existing officer?  Why, then, is it necessary to bring that office within the ambit of the Bill?  As far as I can see, the only people who will be appointed under this paragraph are rate collectors.  They would be selected from non-existing officers.  We feel it would be better if these minor officers were appointed by the local bodies.  If the retention of the paragraph is to be insisted on, then I think the list of offices to be filled under it ought to be set out in the Schedule.  I do not think that a Commission could select suitable people to act as rate collectors in an area.  The salary attached to these positions might be only £30 or £40 a year, and you must get a local man to do that work.</P>

      <P>This section is so indefinite that these minor offices can be included under it at any time, and I suggest that the Minister can give no guarantee as regards what a future Minister may do.  From my reading of it you could include anyone under the section, even a tinker soldering a can at the workhouse door.  The paragraph reads: &ldquo;All such other officers and employments under a local authority as the Minister shall, from time to time, with the concurrence of the Commissioners, declare to be officers to which this Act applies.&rdquo;  Sub-section (2) of Section 2 reads: &ldquo;Every question or dispute as to whether any particular office or employment is or is not an office to which this Act applies, shall be decided by the Minister after consultation with the Commissioners, and such decision shall be final and conclusive.&rdquo;<Col N="1141" /> I hold that under this section the Minister's power is unlimited.  The Minister may have certain ideas as to the offices that are included under this, but he can give no guarantee as to what the ideas of a future Minister may be.  The whole thing is very indefinite and will lead to chaos.  We do not know where we are under this.</P>

      <P>Under the Bill the appointment of medical officers and other officials will be in the hands of the Minister. He will have so much power that he might as well completely wipe out the local authorities altogether and appoint commissioners to govern the local areas, because, as it will be under this Bill, they will have nothing whatever to do.  They will not even be able to appoint a road-worker.  All that Deputy Baxter is asking in the amendment is that the local authorities should have the right to appoint people to minor offices.  I do not want to see the councils of the Saorstát, which have been elected by the people, going back to the old poor law guardian type.  If the people show their confidence in the local authorities, then these bodies ought to be in a position to make minor appointments.</P>
      <P>As regards medical officers who will be appointed by the Commission under the Bill, I think that when a vacancy occurs in an area that a doctor practising there should get the preference in filling the appointment, provided he has all the necessary qualifications.  If the Minister insists on the retention of this paragraph he will have all the public bodies up against him.  Resolutions have been passed by public bodies all over the Saorstát asking the Government not to take the drastic powers given under this Bill.  I hope that at this, the eleventh hour, the Minister will repent and accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>You must remember that local government is a growing <Col N="1142" /> institution.  It is developing from day to day and year to year, and, therefore, I cannot foresee at the present time what class of officers we may have in the future that we have not now.  It would be absolutely impossible for me to draw a hard and fast line with regard to these officers.  Some of the officers who will be brought within the scope of the Act under paragraph (c) will be just as important as those coming in under paragraphs (a) and (b). If the principle is a right one to apply to paragraphs (a) and (b), I do not see any reason why it should not be right to apply it to paragraph (c).  The same principle runs throughout the whole Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to express my views as to how this will apply. Deputy Wilson has in mind home help officers.  If home help officers are placed within the category of paragraph (c) then it will follow according to Section 5 that a person to be appointed or who may be appointed by the local authority without reference to the Appointments Committee will have to be already the holder of a pensionable office or in receipt of an allowance in such office so that he will be a person who has had local administrative experience.  He will be in the employment of the local authority.  Unless that, he must proceed <Col N="1143" /> by the method of the local Appointments Committee.  I think that that points to the probability that the principal offices that will be brought under this paragraph (c) will be very few and rather select offices, rather individual <Col N="1144" /> offices than a class of office. Therefore, I am not at all opposed to the paragraph in the new form that the Bill takes.  I think that the danger that was in the original Bill has been taken out of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Housing Bill.  In doing <Col N="1145" /> so I shall have to draw somewhat on the patience of the House in order to pourtray very fully the details of our housing activities since 1922.  Under the grant of one million pounds, made available for urban housing in 1922, some 2,100 houses have been erected. The grants were available only to municipal authorities carrying out housing schemes under the Housing of the Working Classes (Ireland) Acts. The building costs of these houses averaged about £600 per house, while the average all-in cost was approximately £705.  The amount of the grant given under that scheme was two-thirds of the actual all-in cost of providing the houses, subject to a maximum of £750 per house.</P>
      <P>Under the Housing (Building Facilities) Acts, 1924, grants of between £50 and £100 per house were made available from State funds to private persons and to local authorities crecting or reconstructing houses.  In the case of reconstructed houses, slightly smaller sums were available.  Private persons constructed 2,747 houses, the grants in these cases absorbing £227,503 8s. 8d. The local authorities constructed 965 houses, the grants allocated amounting to £72,496 6s. 8d.  The total was 3,712 houses, and the cost was 4/8 short of £300,000.  Of that total of 3,712 houses 3,322 are new houses and 390 are reconstructed houses, the allocated grants being £282,333 16s. 8d. in the case of the new houses and £17,665 18s. 8d. in the case of reconstructed houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Housing Act, 1925, a further £300,000 was made available for grants to private persons, public utility societies and local authorities.  The grants under the 1925 Act ranged between £45 and £75 per house, and in the case of reconstructed houses between £30 and £50, for private persons.  For public utility societies and local authorities the grants were the same as under the 1924 Acts.  In the case of the 1925 Act, there were 2,655 houses constructed by private persons, and the amount was £180,371 8s.  Public utility societies constructed 90 houses, and the grants amounted to £7,540.  Local authorities constructed 840 houses, the grants absorbing £72,720 6s. 8d.  The total then is 3,585 houses and grants <Col N="1146" /> £260,631 14s. 8d., leaving an unallocated balance of £39,368 5s. 4d., which is scarcely adequate for the further schemes being formulated by local authorities together with the proposals from private persons at present under consideration.</P>

It will be observed grants have been allocated to date under both Acts in respect of 7,297 houses; that is exclusive of the million grant.  These are apportioned as follows amongst counties, county boroughs, urban districts and towns with town commissioners:&mdash;counties, under the 1924 Act, 2,117 houses; under the 1925 Act, 2,080 houses; total, 4,197 houses; county boroughs: under the 1924 Act, 1,169 houses; under the 1925 Act, 1,101 houses; total, 2,270 houses. Urban districts: under the 1924 Act, 357 houses; under the 1925 Act, 340 houses; total, 697 houses.  Towns with town commissioners: under the 1924 Act, 69 houses; under the 1925 Act, 64 houses; total, 133 houses.  It is not possible to obtain much information in regard to building costs of houses provided by private persons.  From the information available the average cost of building would appear to be £450 per house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  This average is brought so low by reason of the fact that in some rural areas private persons have found it possible by applying personal labour to the work to build good roomy houses at prices ranging between £250 and £300. An additional reason for the <Col N="1147" /> cheapness of building in rural areas is the easy accessibility of material such as sand and stone. In regard to local authorities, under the schemes of the City Commissioners the building cost of five-roomed houses in Dublin during the past twelve months averaged between £500 and £535, while in the smaller municipal areas houses of similar accommodation have been built for £450 to £500.  A considerable reduction in building costs to some local authorities has been effected by the use of plans of a modified form of construction prepared by the architectural staff of the Housing Department. These houses are being built with 7-inch reinforced concrete walls for single storey houses and 8-inch walls for two-storey houses, with asbestos slate roofs and three-inch partitions. The plans also show a slight variation in the size of some of the rooms.</P>
      <P>The houses contain a living room and three bedrooms.  The single storey house has a scullery.  The two-storey house has a very large living room which provides ample culinary space. The floor areas of the rooms compare as follows with the floor areas hitherto regarded as the minima for municipal areas.  The original minima were: Living-room, 180 sq. feet; first bedroom, 160; second bedroom, 85, and third bedroom 60 sq. feet.  The floor areas of the single storey modified plan are:&mdash;Living room, 161 sq. feet; first bedroom, 121; second bedroom, 90, and third bedroom, 72 sq. feet.  The floor areas of the two-storey modified plan are:&mdash;Living room, 265 sq. feet; first bedroom, 125; second bedroom, 88, and third bedroom, 70 sq. feet.</P>
      <P>In Drogheda and Ardee schemes for the erection of these houses have just been completed.  Other local bodies have similar houses in progress.  The building prices for the single storey plan range between £230 and £310, while a few days ago in a Northern urban district a tender was received for the two-storey house at £280.</P>

      <P>Four.  These reductions in building costs will justify the modifications effected.  Houses of this type can be let at very reasonable rents without any charge on the rates. Statistics put the success of the recent Housing Acts beyond question.  The principal feature is the inducement of private persons into the field of house production.  There has been a total provision of over 7,000 houses at the cost to the State of £600,000.  Compare this with the £1,000,000 scheme where a whole million of money went to subsidise the provision by local authorities of 2,100 houses.  This comparison is, of course, made to show how absolutely essential is the co-operation of private enterprise in the solution of the housing problem and is not intended as an adverse criticism of the £1,000,000 scheme.  There is no doubt whatever that under the conditions which then existed the generous terms of the £1,000,000 scheme were quite essential to enable local authorities to undertake house-building, and it is doubtful that private persons could be induced at all to enter on what was then regarded as a precarious and risky enterprise.</P>
      <P>The Housing Acts have achieved their objects.  The private individual has been enabled to supply his own housing needs and local authorities have been enabled to undertake building schemes.  All that is now required is to sustain the present activity until the housing problem is well on the way towards solution.</P>
      <P>The house-building activity brought about by the Housing Acts is general to the entire Saorstát.  In Mayo County 450 houses have been provided or are in progress, in Cork 440, in Galway 415, in Kerry 320, in Tirconaill 285, in Cavan 215, in Limerick 290, in Clare 200, in Roscommon 190, in Sligo 215, in Meath 130, in Leitrim 160, and in Monaghan 120.  There is no county in the whole State in which the benefits of the Acts have not been availed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The progress made in Dublin (City and County) since 1923 is worthy of note.  Under the £1,000,000 housing scheme 947 houses were built in the city.  Under the Acts of 1924-25 the Commissioners have completed or have in progress schemes for an additional <Col N="1149" /> 1,361 houses, and private persons have built some 600 houses in the city area. By other local bodies in Dublin County some 350 houses have been built under the £1,000,000 housing scheme and 150 under the Labourers (Ireland) Acts, while under the Housing Acts, 1924-1925, schemes have been prepared by local bodies for 20 houses, and 500 houses have been built by private persons, making a total of 3,928 provided in Dublin (City and County) since 1922.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this, there is no lull in activity.  The Borough Commissioners have prepared a new scheme for the erection of a large number of additional houses on an extensive virgin site at Drumcondra.  The majority of these houses will be three and four-roomed and will be capable of being let at reasonable rents.  The Commissioners also expect to begin work at an early date on a scheme for the provision of dwellings to be let in flats on a central city area (Crabbe Lane).  There are also signs of additional activity on the part of speculative builders in the city.</P>

      <P>What is a reasonable rent?  Twice the President used that phrase, and I would like to have an idea what is in his mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad if the Deputy puts that question later on.  I have not made any calculations as to what the exact amount is.  Compared with what you would call an economic rent it bears a very reasonable proportion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The ability to pay must be considered.  I think the President has something else in mind and the use of the term &ldquo;reasonable rent&rdquo; prompted my question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a reasonable rent, I should say, particularly when one bears in mind what rents are at present chargeable in respect to houses in which more than one family is housed.  Now, in regard to the special provisions made in the 1925 Act for public utility societies, it may be mentioned that the actual progress made by these groups did not come up to expectation.  This, however, is largely due to the delay which must necessarily arise in creating general <Col N="1150" /> interest in this form of house production and, as a lot of the preliminary spade work has now been got through, there is no reason why much greater activity should not result if the new Bill is passed into law.  In fact, it is understood that numbers of these societies have now been formed and registered and are ready to begin work.  There was a disappointment in connection with the 1925 Act.  Trade unions, to include which bodies in the definition of &ldquo;Public Utility Society&rdquo; the Bill was specially amended in the Dáil at the request of Deputy Johnson, were not active.  Very little work has been done in that connection, but there is a hope that something may be done in the future.</P>
      <P>Another interesting feature of the Acts is the amount of money which has been set in circulation and the consequent stimulus to industry and relief to unemployment.  Taking the average building cost per house at £450, the 7,297 houses represent an expenditure of £3,283,650, of which £600,000 was provided by the State.</P>
      <P>I have particulars of the schemes made by local authorities for supplementary assistance to private persons under the Acts.  From these it appears that under the 1924 Acts supplementary grants and loans were given by two county borough councils and two county councils, supplementary grants (without loans) were given by one county council and three urban district councils, and loans (without grants) were given by one county borough council, twelve county councils and ten urban district councils. Under the 1925 Act grants and loans were given by one county borough council and one urban district council. One county borough council, two county councils and two urban district councils gave grants without loans, and one county borough council, eight county councils and eight urban district councils gave loans without grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be noted that town commissioners of small municipal towns offered no local assistance.  Financial weakness was generally the cause of this, and under the 1925 Act provision was made empowering county councils to extend their local assistance schemes <Col N="1151" /> to such towns.  Generally, local authorities proved themselves anxious and willing to co-operate in making a success of the Acts, and wherever their financial position was sufficiently strong to enable them to afford facility to private persons, good work resulted. In this connection the Irish banks came to the assistance of many local bodies with short term loans, a total sum of £100,000 being made available by them for the purpose.  The enormous advantage to private persons of the local assistance provisions of the Acts need scarcely be stressed.</P>
    <P>Supplementary cash grants afford a considerable additional inducement to private persons with small capital to build houses, while the supplementary loans have been necessary in many cases to enable building.  The activity which resulted in areas where generous local assistance was given was an evidence of this fact.  Worthy of note are the cases of Dublin and Waterford cities, where supplementary grants and loans were made available.  The houses built by private persons in these areas, in addition to the houses built under the Acts by the local authorities themselves, have given a great relief to the housing demands.  The demand for houses is still far from satisfied, notwithstanding the great activity of the past few years, and, unless the present stimulus is sustained, the housing problem will rapidly disimprove.  In fact, even if the continuity of the scheme is broken, much greater effort will be required to put house production by private enterprise again under weigh.  A stoppage of the subsidy would also mean a considerable hardship to a great number of people who have incurred heavy commitments in anticipation of grants, but who have been delayed in proceeding with actual building work owing to divers circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Housing Bill, 1926, proposes, therefore, that the present system of State and local aid under the Housing Act, 1925, be continued without alteration for a further normal period of two years from October next, and that a further sum of £300,000 be made available for State grants.  As stated last <Col N="1152" /> year when the 1925 Bill was being considered, the extent of the housing problem renders it impossible of immediate solution, because of the high cost of building and the undesirability at this stage of taxing the State with the provision of funds to enable, by way of subsidies and other facilities, house production on a scale sufficiently large to meet the enormous needs prevailing.</P>
    <P>Pending more stabilised conditions, some alleviation must be effected in the direction of housing the people, and the system of State aid and other assistance established under the Building Facilities Acts, whereby a small amount is made available for utilisation within a limited period, appears to be the most desirable in present circumstances. These Acts must not be regarded as having provided an adequate and final settlement of the housing question, but rather as part of a series of temporary measures the periodical introduction of which will ensure continuity of house production over a number of years, until eventually the demand is fully met.  Legislation of this nature possesses a decided advantage over permanent codes, as it enables the frequent review of the system and its revision, when such is necessitated by altered conditions. Furthermore, no strain of national resources is involved.</P>
    <P>As regards the amounts of the grants, it is considered that these, having regard to the cost of building, will not bear any further reduction during the period proposed.  It is not proposed to alter in any way the general lines of the Act of 1925, as the minds of the people are now educated to the system, and alterations would only tend to confusion and consequent delay of progress. Experience has shown that the maximum period of twenty-two months, provided in the 1925 Act for the completion of houses by private persons, is inadequate.  In town areas considerable delay occurs in the preliminary work of obtaining suitable sites, settling plans, etc., while in country areas, where the intending resident ofttimes does most of the building work himself, he has to suspend operations during certain periods of the year to attend to his farming work. <Col N="1153" /> This was also the experience under the 1924 Act, and it will be remembered that the period had to be extended for a further four months under an amending Act.  For this reason it is proposed to make the 1925 Act period continuous from the date of its passing to the end of the extended period.</P>
    <P>Practically the only reason why the reconstruction clauses are continued is to allow to proceed the work of conversion of barracks, workhouses and such buildings into suitable dwellings. Another, and perhaps a stronger, reason for the reconstruction clauses is the possibilities opened up in the conversion into dwellings of derelict barracks, workhouses and such buildings throughout the country.  Many of these premises are no longer required for their original purpose, and there does not appear to be any purpose, other than housing, to which they can be devoted.  These premises are mostly situated in town areas, and their reconstruction will be undertaken by local authorities.  In fact, in a number of districts very good and healthy dwellings have been made out of these premises, i.e., Dublin, where Kehoe Barracks have been converted into 202 flats; Clonmel, where the barracks have been converted into 44 dwellings; Droichead Nua, where 28 good houses have been made in the barracks, and Tipperary, where the barracks have been converted into 36 flats.  In other districts similar schemes are under consideration.</P>
    <P>A number of local authorities, with a view to providing funds for additional housing schemes, have sold to intending resident purchasers houses already provided in their districts under the Housing of the Working Classes (Ireland) Acts.  These sales have taken two forms.  The first, a sale for ready cash and, the second, a sale on the tenant-purchase, or instalment, system.  The latter system provides for the payment of the purchase money in weekly instalments over a period of years and in some cases a small cash deposit is required.  To the weekly payment is added a small sum to cover such additional charges as fire insurance and administration charges.  The sale scheme of the Dublin Borough Commissioners is a good instance of the instalment <Col N="1154" /> plan.  The houses have been sold on the tenant purchase system with a maximum of forty years, the purchasers paying from 15/- to 16/6 weekly to cover purchase money, rates, insurance and all other charges.  The Waterford Corporation sold 20 houses, the tenant-purchasers paying small cash deposits and the balance of the purchase money in instalments over a period of fifteen years.  In Ardee the Town Commissioners sold 6 houses, one for cash and the remaining five on the tenant purchase system; Athlone Urban District Council sold 12 houses with a deposit of £100 and the balance of the purchase money payable in ten years and 2 with deposits of £250; An Uaimh Urban District Council sold 4 houses for cash, 3 at £470 and one at £460; Galway Urban Council sold 20 houses at £500 each, £400 paid in cash and £100 in two instalments; Howth Urban Council sold 12 houses at an average price of £500 cash; Killarney Urban Council sold 8 houses at an average cost of £520; Kilrush Urban Council sold 2 houses at £350 cash; Tralee Urban Council sold 16 houses at £500 each.  Other local authorities who sold houses are the Urban District Councils of Ballina, Blackrock, Bri Chulainn, Carrickmacross, Clones, Clonmel, Cobh, Drogheda, Dundalk, Dungarvan, Ennis, Kilkenny, Macroom, Pembroke, Thurles, Tralee and Wexford.</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary to comment on the beneficial extent of these purchase schemes, or on the extent to which they develop civic spirit and enterprise.  In conclusion, in addition to that series of housing activities, the Land Commission, where they consider it necessary, erect new, or reconstruct existing, buildings in connection with the sale of holdings and the division of untenanted land into new holdings or enlargements of existing holdings.  Since December, 1921, the Land Commission have sanctioned a sum of £368,000 on the erection or reconstruction of buildings in 2,450 cases.  It is not possible without a detailed investigation of the figures to segregate the number of new buildings erected from the number reconstructed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish.  I think for the first time in this House, to congratulate the President and the Government on <Col N="1155" /> extending the Housing Act, as that extension will, in my opinion, be of the utmost help to people throughout the country.  The President mentioned a sum of £300,000, but in Section 2 it is said that a sum not exceeding £600,000 may be given.  I would like to know whether it would be possible to include in this Bill the reconstruction of houses in rural districts?  As the President is aware, it is absolutely essential to try and help the small farmers and labourers, who may be in a position to improve their houses, and it would be of great benefit if such facilities were given in this measure as are given in the cases of towns of five hundred population.</P>
      <P>I have nothing to say against the previous Acts nor against the present measure, but I would like to point out that there is a large number of people living in towns who are anxious to erect houses for themselves but who, unfortunately, have not sufficient money to enable them to start the building of a house without the grant. It is provided that the house must be roofed before half the grant can be given, and that the remainder is given when the house is finished.  I may, perhaps, be asking too much, and there is an old saying: &ldquo;Do not spur a willing horse.&rdquo;  In this case, undoubtedly, the Government is a willing horse.  I would, however, like to know whether it is possible to help workers in the towns by giving loans in order to enable them to start the erection of a house and then give them the grant when the house was finished.  Several people come to me in regard to the construction or reconstruction of houses. It will be noticed that the President did not mention the number of houses erected or reconstructed in Westmeath and Longford.  The reason is that the people there have not taken advantage of the Act, as in their opinion there is too much delay in getting the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some cases in which the houses were completed even six months ago the people have not yet received the grant.  It would take a barrister to fill in properly the forms which the applicant gets when he applies for a grant. These forms should be made easier so that the ordinary man in the street can <Col N="1156" /> understand them.  When the applicant sends in the form he is generally told, after three or four weeks, that an inspector will visit him.  After some time an inspector comes down and visits the site.  If the site is approved, the work is duly started, but the applicant will have to wait for anything between six to ten months before he gets the grant. That is a great hardship.  Some people, who have not spare money to invest in a house, borrow it from a bank so as to start building but, perhaps, before they receive the Government grant the bank may serve them with a writ to recover their money.  There is certainly delay in giving the grant, and I would like, if possible, that in the coming year no unnecessary delay would take place in giving grants, especially in cases where the plans have been approved and where people are about to build.</P>
    <P>In Athlone they built thirteen houses and I am very happy to say that the suggestion of the Urban Council to sell the houses was approved by the Minister for Local Government.  They sold the houses, and with the money they received they were in a position to build twelve more houses.  Were it not that the grant was given the first thirteen houses would not have been built.  I think it is the duty of Deputies&mdash;I have done my part&mdash;to let their constituents know exactly how they are to apply and where they are to apply for the grant.  It has been said that a fairly large number of people are accustomed to the Act, but I say a very large number of people know nothing at all about it and it is absolutely essential that the Deputies representing the various constituencies should be in a position to let their people know exactly the amount they are entitled to and where they should apply for it.</P>
    <P>I certainly would like the President to include, for the purpose of the reconstruction grant, houses outside towns of 500 population.  A very large number of those houses are not fit at the present time for human habitation, and with the help of a little grant these people would be in a position to make their houses fit for themselves and their families to live in.  I know houses&mdash; and other Deputies who visit their constituents can bear me out&mdash;in remote <Col N="1157" /> parts of the country that are not fit for beasts, let alone human beings.  Yet the owners of these houses are denied the right to reconstruction grants.  Every year since I became a member of this House I have asked the President to extend the provisions of the Act to them.  It may cost £50,000, but £50,000 would be well spent on this work.</P>
    <P>At present many people are still living in houses with old thatched roofs that have practically fallen down, and some of them in houses with corrugated iron roofs.  The result is that when it rains at night the children are kept awake and they cannot go to school next day.  I suggest that the President give the question of extending the reconstruction grants to the rural districts his serious and earnest consideration. There are voters living in these parts of the country as well as in the towns, and I do not see why you should introduce legislation to facilitate one section of the community as against another.  If you give the grants to people in the rural districts to reconstruct their homes I can assure you it will be highly appreciated by them and the President will be surprised at the amount of good-will it will create.</P>

      <P>One was glad to hear from the President the interesting statement he had to make in connection with housing.  While he went fairly fully into figures, there were one or two figures that he did not give and that one would like to have.  He told us in connection with the City of Dublin that since 1922 some 3,928 houses have been erected&mdash;a goodly number.  But one would like to know the number of rooms in the houses comprised in this total of 3,928.  I do not know whether the President has that figure available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of housing, as the President has pointed out, is an urgent one.  I am not sure, notwithstanding what has been done, that the <Col N="1158" /> problem is not even more urgent to-day than it was this time twelve months, because I do not think that the number of new houses that we are putting up is sufficient to meet the depreciation&mdash; in other words, to keep up the level of housing.  Those who have studied the problem at all know that the demand for single dwellings is becoming a very wide one.  People are anxious to get out of these tenements and other places that their parents were quite satisfied to dwell in.  Naturally they are anxious to get into the new form of dwelling, that is the separate house.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding that a great deal has been done, except we endeavour to do something more than has been done, I am afraid we will not succeed in making much real progress with the problem.  I do not want in any way to reflect on what has been done.  I say that what has been done by this Government is quite an important item in housing.  Certainly for the last three years, with its limited financial resources, it has done a great deal to assist housing.  As I have said, this problem is to some extent beyond both the Government and the local authorities. If we are to get nearer a solution of this difficult problem we shall have to get a great many other parties interested in housing.  To do that, as I have pointed out when another measure was under consideration here recently, we want to get housing looked upon in the future as a safe investment and we want to do all that we possibly can to encourage investors to look upon housing, as I said, as a safe and wise investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection I would like just to mention one figure that would be useful possibly to those who are interested in the subject of housing.  I recently came across some figures in connection with what has been done in Great Britain and I found that while a very large number of houses had been erected by the different local authorities with State assistance, more than one-third of the houses erected in England and Wales in the year ending on 30th September, 1925, had been erected without State assistance of any kind. I only just mention that figure to show that if we could get housing into that <Col N="1159" /> position in which people will look upon it as an investment we would have done a great deal I am satisfied, as I said, notwithstanding everything that the Government has done and everything that the local authorities have done, that until we get housing into that position we will not be near the solution of the problem.</P>
    <P>I was anxious to get from the President the number of rooms in the houses that had been erected.  I have urged, since I have had the privilege of being in this House, that the policy of the Government in confining its efforts very largely to the erection of five-roomed houses was not on the whole a wise one, and the more one sees of that policy the more one is inclined to question its wisdom.  The result of that policy has been that, in the city at all events, the larger number of the 3,928 houses erected since 1922 are five-roomed houses.  The effect of that has been that people are called upon to pay rents for these houses that are beyond their means.  I have discussed this problem with many tenants.  The answer they have given to me is: &ldquo;You cannot get houses at a low figure, consequently we have got to incur this liability in order to get houses for our families.&rdquo; When they get into this liability they find it is a burden they are unable to discharge.</P>
    <P>In other words, if you take an unskilled labourer receiving something under £3 a week, perhaps £2 10s. a week, who is called upon to pay the best portion of 15/- or £1 a week for rent, it is obvious that it is a burden beyond his ability to pay.  The result of that is that these tenants are compelled to sub-let in order to relieve themselves and their families of this burden.  The evils that have arisen from sub-letting have been pointed out again and again.  I do not want to take up the time of the Dáil enumerating them now, but I think all the Deputies in the House recognise that sub-letting is an evil.  I am satisfied that that evil has been aggravated by the policy of erecting five-roomed houses.  I would like to see the pendulum swing in the other direction.  As I have said, the larger number of houses that have <Col N="1160" /> been erected in the city have been five-roomed houses.  Let us now try and cater for the man who cannot afford a five-roomed house.  In other words, let us cater very largely in this Bill for the man who can only afford a three-roomed house, or, if possible, a four-roomed house, but I would like to see a distinct preference given to a three-roomed house.</P>
    <P>As the Principal Act stands at the moment, it gives a decided preference to a five-roomed house.  The grants to local authorities and to private persons are just on the same ratio.  The grants to local authorities are equivalent to £20 per room.  For a three-roomed house the grant is £60; a four-roomed house £80; a five-roomed house £100. The grants to private persons, though smaller, bear exactly the same ratio. The grant for a three-roomed house is £45, a four-roomed house £60, and for a five-roomed house it is £75.  To those interested in construction, the grant for a five-roomed house is a much more attractive one than the grant for a three-roomed house.  I need not go into detail.  I think that will be generally admitted.  Consequently the effect of the Act of last year, and to some extent the Act of 1924, has been to give a decided preference to the five-roomed house as against the four-roomed house.</P>
    <P>I know the President is interested in this problem, and I would like to see something more done than has been done to try and help&mdash;I will not say the very poor in the city, because providing houses for the very poor presents a very considerable problem at the moment, but I would say to try and make an effort to provide for those who cannot afford a five-roomed house.  As I said, the evil of sub-letting has been brought about to some extent by the policy of the Government, and I know that many of these tenants themselves are just as anxious to get rid of this evil as any Deputy is.  The only way that that can be done is by altering the schedule in this particular Bill and giving a distinct encouragement to the building of small houses in preference to the larger houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision of the Government to continue the <Col N="1161" /> operations of the existing Act regarding housing and to continue the grant. As to the proposition put forward by the President, one might be tempted to argue as to the wisdom of going piecemeal at this problem without regard to any planned scheme covering a number of years.  I think the President's view of that is faulty&mdash;I think it is wrong. I think economy in future building lies in looking ahead for a number of years and having something in the nature of a plan, which may be modifiable, but to be able by having such a plan to economise by standardisation.  I will not go into that discussion now.</P>
      <P>I rose particularly to meet the point that the President raised regarding the failure of trade unions to utilise the method of the public utility society. Trade unions as such are not at all likely to enter into building operations, and what was in mind when this matter was referred to a couple of years ago was the possibility of trade unions which had accumulated funds and required to invest those funds&mdash;mainly, one might say, unions having their headquarters in Great Britain&mdash;having facilities provided here as they have in Great Britain for investing those funds in housing.  The point was made at that time, and I understand that no change has taken place, that there is, in fact, a handicap here upon any friendly society or organisation similar to a friendly society, investing in houses, because there is an income tax charge, whereas the British system is to exempt the friendly society from income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a factor which has prevented organisations from extending their housing schemes&mdash;one or two of them had regular housing schemes&mdash;to this country, although the men affected had pressed upon their union executives to extend their housing benefits&mdash;I will call them that for convenience sake&mdash;to housing schemes in this country.  They would incur a liability here that they would not incur for similar schemes in Great Britain.  I may say that within the last few days I have had emphasis laid upon the question.  I have before me a letter from a big insurance society which has 60,000 policy holders in the Dublin district and which takes a large sum in the way of insurance premiums from this district.  The total amount of <Col N="1162" /> money that that society has invested in the Free State is £1,500.  Certain proposals were put forward, and are to be put forward, on behalf of the Dublin policy holders pressing upon this society to make available for investment a much larger sum&mdash;a considerable sum as a matter of fact&mdash;in this country.  The explanation that is given &mdash;and I quote from the letter&mdash;is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With regard to investments the difficulty so far as the society is concerned is that the Free State will not agree to exemption from income tax under the Friendly Societies Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that this class of society finds a barrier against investment in housing because of the differential treatment under the Friendly Societies Act.  That undoubtedly explains the failure of the idea that I had in mind when I referred to the possibility of trade unions investing money in housing.</P>
    <P>I would like if the President could give us some further figures regarding the annual wastage, particularly the wastage in Dublin district and, perhaps, even more particularly in the city of Dublin, because unless we have those figures we cannot form any judgment as to whether the present rate of building, no matter how long it may be continued, is really overcoming the shortage. One might also require to know, so far as Dublin city and district is concerned, whether the population is increasing faster than the housing accommodation. I suppose we shall only know that when the census returns are available.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether I am rightly interpreting the President, but I am sure I am rightly interpreting Deputy Good when I say that he is looking forward to the time, not distant, when housing can be, as it is called, put upon an economic basis&mdash;when the rent of a house is going to be sufficient to cover interest charges, upkeep and general expenses.  I have said that I do not think that that is within the region of practical politics, and I doubt whether on the present basis of the social relations between employer and employed &mdash;the wage-earning basis&mdash;it will ever again be economic.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has pleaded for the policy of building the three-roomed house, again with a view to it being economic and again with a view to it being purchased.  I presume &mdash;at least that is the policy that is generally favoured: that the house should become the property of the occupier.  I wonder does the Deputy look ahead and consider the position of that three-roomed house and the occupier.  It may be quite satisfactory for a married couple without children, or where there are one or two children, but when the family grows the three-roomed house remains the habitation, and because it has been purchased, or is in the course of purchase, it is a fixture. The family grows and the three-roomed house remains the habitation.</P>
      <P>I do not think that that is a prospect we ought to look forward to.  I do not think we ought to build upon that anticipation.  I think that the three-roomed house policy is going to fix in the minds of people occupying such houses a habit of meanness and poverty and dismal, mean surroundings.  I think it is undesirable and that we ought not to set our hands to a policy that will inevitably lead to that result.</P>
      <P>I would rather run the risk of continuing for a time the evil of undesirable sub-letting, because there is a hope as time passes that the sub-letting will be got rid of.  But when you have a three-roomed house you have a family fixed in a three-roomed house, and there is an impossibility of enlarging it.  The ideal that Deputy Good put forward that we should contrive to get back to the position when housing was a safe investment, I think, vitiates the Deputy's view of this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had shown to me two days ago&mdash;I am sorry I have not got it with me&mdash; a copy of what I suppose would be called a demand note in regard to a City of Dublin Corporation house.  I forget the figures, but the total was analysed, showing so much for cost of collecting rent, so much for depreciation, so much for rates, so much for this, that, and the other.  The total <Col N="1165" /> was something over £34, and the amount for interest at five per cent. was £19 odd.  Now, to get a safe investment for the investor, the tenant of this house, which costs about £36 a year, has to pay £19 in interest.  I thought that a very useful education, and I thank the Corporation of Dublin for their object lesson in showing where the housing problem really resides.  It is very good, indeed, of the Corporation Commissioners to submit such a table, because it shows that it is the investor in house-building, or, in this case, probably the investor in Corporation Stock who is really drawing the sustenance from the wage-earner, that he is getting his return despite anything, and the five per cent., that is to say, 8/- or 8/6 a week of the tenant's earnings, is being paid week by week, year by year, for so many years to the person who invested so much money so many years ago in that particular stock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes, I quite agree.  That is the whole problem. And the unfortunate part of it is that the President, helpless, I agree, cannot avoid it.  The investor says: &ldquo;I shall not lend my money unless I can get the world market rate.  I will let everything go hang until I can get the market rate.  I am going to be a Shylock.&rdquo; The country, the wage-earner, the business-man, every person who puts his strength into production, has to pay toll to the investor who happens to have accumulated wealth and is prepared to put that accumulated wealth in the investment that can give him the highest safe return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The picture that this particular form presents to the <Col N="1166" /> purchasing tenants of these houses is, as I say, a very valuable economic lesson.  It shows that the wage-earner's wages are, to the extent of 9/- a week or thereabouts, going to the money lender, and that the actual charges for upkeep, the actual charges for what might be called rent, amount to less than half of the weekly payments. However, I am glad that the Minister has decided to continue this scheme and these grants for another year or two. I hope that the result will be a very rapid increase in the number of houses. I hope it will be possible to find some way to reduce the weekly charge upon the tenants.</P>
      <P>I think the problem must be faced, as we are beginning to hear, week by week, especially in the city of Dublin, that those who have bound themselves to pay certain weekly or monthly charges find themselves in difficulties about paying, that the problem is going to affect them, and unless there is regular, or fairly regular, employment available for the occupiers of these houses and wages are maintained or increased, the possibility of drawing and continuing to draw for years the rental that these people have been obliged to agree to is not very certain, and the prospect is that they will never be able to maintain these payments.  However, I am not going to look too far ahead.  I only remind the Minister that there is a problem arising with regard to meeting the liabilities that these people have entered upon, and I am afraid that it will become a grievous one within a few years' time.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson, by implication, says that it is actually wrong to expect a return from private capital invested in houses.  The only alternative to that is State capital. State capital is the capital of every citizen of the State.  If the private individual does not do it the State must do it, and if so it will not be done by any particular class in the State but by every class.  Most of the rural population were excluded from the operations of the last Act, of which this is proposed to be an extension.  They could avail of the 1924 Act, but not of the 1925 Act, either for construction or reconstruction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Reconstruction is a very important matter in rural areas, and we claim that reconstruction should be available and could be availed of as economically and to as good a purpose in the rural areas as anywhere else.  We do not want new work to be put on bad foundations that could not be passed by any engineer worth his salt, but we say that where good foundations are available for reconstruction it should be possible to use them in the rural areas as well as in the urban areas.  We take exception to that part of the Act and we hope that this Bill will depart from that policy and will allow reconstruction in the rural areas on the same lines as in the urban areas.  The rural population are citizens of the State and they demand and claim as their right the same facilities and the same privileges as are given to urban dwellers.  I see no reason why they should be excluded and why this distinction should be made.</P>
      <P>It is no argument to state that under the 1924 Act the rural areas absorbed practically the whole grant.  That proves, if it proves anything, that reconstruction was more needed in the rural areas, and the fact that houses were built in the rural areas at a cost of from £250 to £300, while the cost in the urban areas was almost double, goes to show the value that is got for money in the rural areas.  First of all, the requirements of the rural areas are greater than they are anywhere else, and, secondly, you get better value for the money.  Therefore I have no apologies to make for putting forward the claim that this Bill should be extended in all its provisions to the rural areas, both for private individuals and for local authorities.  I would like to know what the President's attitude is with regard to this.</P>

      <P>I would have to be against that, and I will give very good reasons for being against it.  The total amount given to private persons in the urban areas for the reconstruction of houses, or for the reconditioning of such buildings as stables to make them into dwellings, was only £11,000 under the two Acts.  The local authorities got £11,000, mainly in respect of Kehoe Barracks, the barracks in Tipperary and the barracks in Clonmel.  As I mentioned in my speech, if it were not for these workhouses, barracks and other such buildings, the reconstruction clauses would not have been in these Acts, for reasons that, I think, I have already stated very fully.  The expenses of administration in connection with reconstruction are inordinately high.  One sees at once in the case of new houses the foundations, and so on, but in respect of reconstruction and reconditioning very much more inspection is required.  The actual cost to the State is such that I could not really justify expenditure on reconstruction, and if it were not for these barracks and workhouses it would not be in this Bill at all.</P>

      <P>You would get very good value for the money.  It is required in the country more than anywhere else.  The country people deserve as much consideration in this respect as any other part of the community, and <Col N="1169" /> the President's argument for not extending it to them is not justified.  To be told that it would entail high initial expenditure is not an argument and does not meet the case that exists in the country for good houses.  Go through any of the rural areas in the Western, the South-Western and the North-Western counties and you will see the need that exists.  If the President took the trouble to look out of his car when he is travelling he would see the number of houses that are not fit for human habitation, where there are often sound walls that, with a little expenditure, could be made into good houses.  I think that the President's attitude is altogether unjustified, and I cannot compliment him on this Bill on account of this exclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to add my quota of appreciation of what the Government has done by way of subsidising housing in this country.  With Deputy Good I would like, however, to say that to my mind we have only touched the fringe of the problem.  So far as housing generally is concerned, the subsidy of the Government is appreciated by local authorities.  In view, however, of the fact that the banks are so tight about giving loans of money, and that in many cases they are refusing altogether to give loans to local authorities, the subsidy is not very much good.  I thought that in his statement the President would have said something about extending the facilities of the Local Loans Fund to local authorities during the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In provincial centres, at the moment, it is absolutely impossible for local authorities to build houses to let at an economic rent.  In many towns through the country the banks have refused altogether to give loans to the local authorities for the purpose of carrying out housing schemes, even though those local authorities were in a good financial position.  The attitude of the banks in that respect has prevented houses from being built, while it has also prevented local authorities from taking advantage of the Housing Facilities Act.  The President referred to the work done by the Dublin Commissioners: to the houses already built and to those in course of construction, and <Col N="1170" /> he said that these were being let at a reasonable rent.  That may be the case so far as the City of Dublin is concerned, but I put it to the President that what might be looked upon as a reasonable rent in the City of Dublin could not be looked upon as a reasonable rent in other areas of the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>When the previous Housing Acts were going through this House, I advocated, on behalf of small provincial towns, that the subsidy in their case should be larger and that some differentiation should be made as between the City of Dublin and provincial towns in the Saorstát.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but because people in the City of Dublin are in a position to pay more rent than people in other centres.  Prior to the housing scarcity that the country is suffering from at the moment, and prior to the war, rents were higher in the City of Dublin than they were in other towns in the country. I am not saying that that is correct or that there is any justification for the very high rents that prevail in the City of Dublin, but workers in provincial centres are not in a position to pay as high a rent as they are in the City of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the President will agree with me when I say that it is impossible for local authorities to build houses unless the banks are brought to a better frame of mind than they are in at the moment. The attention of the President and of the Minister for Finance was called to this matter on numerous occasions previously.  They promised that the money in the Local Loans Fund would be made available for local authorities to enable them to build houses.  It is only when that is done and when we get back to the pre-war position when the Board of Works were enabled to loan money for a period of from 40 years to 60 years, that this housing question can be undertaken properly in the State. Under present conditions the solution of this problem cannot make much progress.  The position will be that while a good many houses are being built a great many others will have <Col N="1171" /> fallen, so that for a great number of years we will be in the position we are in to-day unless the local authorities are facilitated by way of long-term loans.</P>
    <P>There is one particular matter I wish to refer to in connection with the Building Facilities Act.  The President referred to the modified plan that is being taken advantage of by various local authorities in the country. Drogheda, Ardee and Wexford have taken advantage of it and recently built twelve houses.  The President called them four-roomed houses.  I, too, call them four-roomed houses, but the Housing Department are only giving a grant of £70 when the local authority is entitled to £80 for a four-roomed house.  The Housing Department are not permitting the cubicle to be described as a room, and I ask the President to see that some arrangement is made whereby the local authority will get full advantage of the Act, because these are certainly four-roomed houses, and I believe that the £80 grant should be given in respect of them.  I again congratulate the Government on what they have done for housing.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would make a special appeal to the President to see that in the next financial year, if he cannot do it in this financial year, money is made available from the Local Loans Fund to enable local authorities to take up this question of housing: to enable them to make greater efforts to solve it in the future than they have been able to do within the last two or three years.</P>

      <P>I think the President and the Government are to be very heartily congratulated on the very excellent house-building work that is being done in and around Dublin.  It has changed the whole appearance of the suburbs.  The houses that are being built are very pretty, and it is very encouraging to see such efforts being made to provide nice houses for the people.  While that is true with regard to Dublin, I must say that I entirely agree with the remarks of Deputy Gorey and Deputy Corish, namely, that the urban centres throughout the <Col N="1172" /> country are in a great need of houses. Anyone who motors through the country must feel sadly impressed by the great number of terribly bad houses that we still have in the country.  You still see houses with no windows and the smoke coming out of the doors. Though the Government has done a wonderful lot in providing houses for the people, this is an aspect of the question that I would impress on them.</P>
      <P>It is clear that there is a lot of leeway still to be made up before we will have got rid of all these wretched houses.  Some of them are not fit for animals to live in.  They are not fit for cows or even pigs.  I think that greater sums of money should be put at the disposal of the local authorities by way of loan or otherwise to enable them to get rid of these terribly bad houses.  We still have too many one-roomed houses in the country.  They are neither decent nor habitable.  In many small towns you see a large family housed in one miserable room. We have also too many two-roomed houses, and I do not think we should have them.  It is my opinion that we should not have anything less than four-roomed houses.  I think that a big effort should be made for the sake of the credit of the State to have our working population properly housed.</P>
      <P>In regard to this housing question there is still vast room for improvement, and money could not be spent in any better way than in trying to solve the problem.  If it were possible, I think the President should see that more money was placed at the disposal of local authorities for the purpose of adding additional accommodation to some of the houses that we have, and in making provision for the housing of the poor in out-of-the-way districts where the position in this respect is very bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that I welcome the decision of the Government to extend the provisions of the 1925 Housing Act, even though I do not agree that it is anything like an adequate contribution towards this very serious problem.  The President gave us a very interesting statement with regard to the position of housing in the Saorstát to-day.  I am only <Col N="1173" /> sorry that I cannot draw the consolation from it which he appears to draw nor can I visualise the happy condition of things which he appears to think is only a very short distance off.</P>
      <P>The President told us that under the 1924 and 1925 Housing Acts 7,300 houses have been built.  That certainly looks a big figure, but when you spread 7,300 houses over the Free State, and remember that each year a certain number of insanitary dwellings go out of use, that this year, just as last year, a certain number of such dwellings will go out of use, and that there ought to be out of use a great number of hovels which masquerade as houses, one is brought up against the fact that if we are doing anything in regard to the housing problem at the moment it is only making good the natural wastage and shrinkage of housing accommodation. The President told us that 7,300 houses had been built under these particular Acts.  If we take the number of those houses which contain quite considerable accommodation and which are not within the reach of the ordinary working man to rent, one must realise that so far as providing for the needs of workingmen are concerned, the problem has not even been touched so far as a great number of districts are concerned. With the exception of houses built by local authorities, all the others have been built for sale, so that it is impossible for the ordinary workingman to find the wherewithal to pay the rent of one of these houses, or to take advantage of the housing that is going on at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who have money have taken advantage of any houses built for the purpose of sale.  These people certainly have got some relief, but the workingman depending on a wage of £2, £2 10s. or £3 per week has not felt any benefit from all the house building that has gone on under the 1924 and 1925 Acts, except the benefit that might be conferred upon him by the small number of houses erected under municipal schemes.  It may be taken generally that private enterprise is interested in building houses not with a view to providing for the needs of those who require houses, but for the purpose of making a profit out of them, <Col N="1174" /> and they realise that a profit will be made out of houses by selling them. These houses are sold to people who have money and can afford to buy them, and the responsibility for providing houses for the ordinary working man and working woman devolves on the local authorities.  I know that a goodly number of local authorities have endeavoured to face up to the problem of providing houses for working-class people, but they have had to contend with very real difficulties in the way of doing so.  Local authorities have found it impossible to get loans from the banks.  Even local authorities with low rates and a good rateable area have found it extremely difficult to get money from the banks for even a period of 15 years.  It is quite impossible for any local authority, so far as I know, to get a loan for any period exceeding 15 years.  With housing costs what they are in Dublin, a 15 years' loan means one thing, and that one thing is high rent.</P>
    <P>When a man in need of a house is brought up against the problem of high rent, he may commit himself to that liability, but he can never meet that liability unless he resorts to the evil of sub-letting, which ultimately develops into the evil of overcrowding. The problem of overcrowding is becoming increasingly acute, because rents are high, which is due to the fact that the banks will not make money available for long terms, and the Government has not seen fit, up to the present, to provide money for housing purposes under the Loans Fund.  Notwithstanding the rosy picture of housing conditions which the President painted, I am of the opinion that there is very little real improvement in housing conditions to-day as compared with four or five years ago.  Every member of a local authority knows perfectly well that the demand for houses to-day is as great as it was four or five years ago.  There is no gainsaying that. Every member of a local authority will substantiate what I say.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that the problem of housing, which has been allowed to develop to an acutely serious degree, will not be solved by the subsidies outlined in the 1924 or 1925 Acts.  I think the <Col N="1175" /> problem will only be solved when the money of the people, at present invested in Timbuctoo and Borneo, in wildly speculative schemes, is brought home here and used for the benefit of the people here.  I suggest to the Government that it would be a very good plan&mdash;a plan which would have the support of every Party in this House&mdash;now that we are told so often that we have only a small national debt, to raise a loan of £10,000,000 with a view to putting this housing problem in such a position as would enable us to see a solution of it in a very short time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. SHAW Mr. SHAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the announcement of this supplementary grant in connection with housing.  There is nothing so urgently needed in town or country as proper housing facilities. I appreciate the difficulty in connection with the extension of the Reconstruction Grant to rural areas, but I know that the towns have not taken, up to the present, full advantage of that grant.  It is extraordinary, too, how few people seem to understand what they ought to do in the building of a house in order to obtain a grant. I would suggest that the Local Government Department should send to the county councils and other public boards a copy of the specification of various houses, according to the Local Government Department's plans.  In the constituency I come from, a large number of people start to build houses, not having complied with the measurements specified by the Local Government Department, and, when the houses are half built, they find they are not eligible for the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I bring this suggestion to the notice of the Department because if it were carried out the people in the country could go into the office and inspect the plans, and select the three, four or five-room model.  That, I think, would facilitate the building of houses to a great extent.  It is only within the last six or nine months that the people of Westmeath seem to have taken an interest in this matter.  At present, I am glad to say, there are a large number of houses built.  I should like, if the President will consider the suggestion I have made as regards making these <Col N="1176" /> plans available to the people through the medium of the local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a great deal to be said for Deputy Shaw's suggestion.  The benefits of the 1925 Act should be brought more clearly and more closely home to private persons.  The local authorities have endeavoured to take advantage, and in some cases have succeeded in taking advantage, of the 1925 Act, and the present Bill, by way of extension of that Act, is decidedly commendable. I am inclined to agree with various speakers that there might be differentiation made in regard to the urban areas outside the City of Dublin.  In the various Rent Restriction Acts which have been passed, there was a distinction made as to the rent and valuation of houses within the metropolitan area and elsewhere.  It is only fair to say that though, generally speaking, the wealth of Dublin may not be far in excess of that of other centres in the country, rents in the past have been on a higher scale in Dublin, and, for some reason or other, they were obtainable on that high scale.</P>
      <P>The proposal, so far as it goes, is good.  My only comment is that perhaps it does not go sufficiently far. The local authorities have endeavoured to operate, and have partially succeeded in operating the Act of 1925, but there is a great deal to be said for the suggestion that there should be some form of long-term loans.  The Board of Works, in days gone by, were able to render enormous help in the direction outlined, and by the methods described by Deputy Corish.  I am sure that the Government cannot have overlooked the possibility of reviving those loans. I should like if the President would give some indication of the results of their inquiries in this direction, and if he would say whether it is possible to revive the system under which those loans were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">

      <P>What inquiries does the Deputy refer to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the loans which used to be made by the Board of Works, extending over periods from forty to sixty years.  There is a matter germane to the question under <Col N="1177" /> discussion which I should like to remind the President and the House of, though I may not be strictly in order in doing so on the Second Reading of this Bill. There is at the disposal of a certain body at present a sum of, I think, three-quarters of a million for the provision of houses for certain classes of people in the Saorstát.  I refer to the money granted by the British Parliament, which was to be expended by a body known as the Land Trust in providing houses for ex-British servicemen resident here.  Would it be possible for the President to do something to speed up the erection of these houses?  I know that it is not exactly within the purview of this Parliament.  At the same time, I think it is only right that our Government should approach the British Government and should inform the British Government of the existing state of affairs.  That state of affairs is that practically no houses have been built for ex-servicemen in this country and that the money is there to build them. I make this suggestion not only for the advantage and benefit of ex-servicemen, as such, but for the benefit of the general community.  If put into operation, not only would this scheme be of use to the particular class for which it was intended, but it would obviate the necessity of the Government here providing houses for these people or for others of like character.</P>
      <P>I would impress on the President the absolute neglect which, up to the present, has occurred in putting into operation this large sum of money for the erection of houses for citizens of this country.  I would respectfully ask the President, on behalf of the Government here, to impress upon the British Government the delay there has been in this matter and to endeavour to get the British Government to speed matters up and to have houses provided for the people for whom they were to be provided.  That suggestion, I think, is germane to the subject under discussion, because we are all anxious to provide houses for our people.  Here is an opportunity which has not been taken to provide houses for a large number of well-deserving citizens of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the last point first.  It is no part of my <Col N="1178" /> duty to interfere in that matter, but I had some interviews with one of the trustees&mdash;Senator General Sir Bryan Mahon&mdash;and I know he is very anxious to have the work expedited.  Other people have seen me also in connection with the matter, including Deputy Cooper and Senator Sir William Hickie. I have hopes that much more work will be done in the near future than has been done in the past.  The matter, I think, will be speeded up very shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>A considerable number have been erected.  In one district on the outskirts of the city over 200 have been erected.  I should say that about a thousand of these houses, in all, have been erected up to the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right to say that a large number of these houses are being erected throughout the country. I have no information regarding the two counties that Deputy Redmond has referred to, but in some of the adjacent counties houses of this class have been erected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that a thousand of these houses have been erected and that about 2,500 remain to be built.  Everything possible, on our part, to expedite that work has been already done.  We had hoped that by reason of the rate reduction laid down in the Local Government Act some stimulus would have been given to the construction of those houses.  I think it will be found in that Act that a proportion of the rates was remitted in respect of new houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree, but my complaint is that they have not done it.</P>

    <Col N="1179" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Local Government Act two-thirds of the rates are allowed from 1927 to 1933.  I think I brought it under the notice of the trustees of the Soldiers and Sailors Trust that it would be advisable, in order to get the full benefits, that they would start without delay to build houses.  It is really a considerable benefit.  It means that houses would not be liable for the full proportion of rates for quite a long period.  It is true the Board of Works lent money in pre-war days to local authorities.  It is not true to say that there were oceans of money available for the purpose of lending.  It is true that the money was there at a small rate of interest, but it is not true to say that any greater work was done during 50 years through the running of such loans than we have done in four years.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to have a lecture delivered here in regard to housing schemes and how they should be carried out.  We have had that from Deputy Norton, but there are many matters which the Deputy overlooked. A ten million loan is one thing.  Any person can quite easily suggest a loan of ten millions; but it is another thing to go into the market and get that loan. There is a very great difference in suggesting the loan and getting it.  As far as I know anything of the finances of the people who have money in this country, there are very few who have invested their money in wild-cat schemes in Timbuctoo.  While we may criticise the bank rate or the rate of interest, what is the reason that it is so high?  One reason is that income tax is at a high level.  When we hear of a person getting five per cent. on his money it does not mean that he can put the five per cent. in his pocket. Four shillings in the £ have to be paid in income tax, and in some cases super-tax has to be met, and that does not leave a full five per cent. to go into one's pocket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought Deputy Johnson put his finger on the trouble that he sought to put his finger on when he described this particular institution which has a large number of clients in this country but which declined to invest money here because of the income tax.  I presume <Col N="1180" /> they wanted five per cent. or something like that, and the only thing that kept them from getting it was the fact that we were charging income tax here.  Those people may be philanthropic-minded, but they are not satisfied to pay 4/- in the £.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

      <P>This Friendly Society, which is a Glasgow Friendly Society, and similar societies, have not invested their money here while they are doing it in England.  In England the conditions regarding friendly society investments in housing are that they are free from income tax.  The conditions here are that they are not free. I merely wanted to point out that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It might pay them even to forego the income tax.  An examination of the improvements in Cork City and Dublin City will show that some extraordinarily beneficial effects have taken place within ten years.  I would like Deputy Norton to know that a very close examination of the housing problem was made in 1919, and it was estimated that Rathmines and Rathgar required 239 houses. Through the operation of these Acts 242 houses have been supplied there; in other words, they have three houses more than they required.  If that had occurred when I was connected with the Corporation I would have said it was a remarkable contribution towards the solution of the housing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>What the President has stated now proves that there was no very careful examination made.  If there were a careful examination made in 1919 the housing problem in Rathmines and Rathgar would be solved.  I invite the President to come to my <Col N="1181" /> house, sit in the hall and listen to the people who come week after week asking for houses.  They cannot get houses.  I do not believe 1,000 houses would satisfy the demand.  If there were sufficient houses I would have no complaint to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>If 1,000 houses would satisfy the needs of the people there, and in four years you have 242 houses erected, I should say that is doing remarkably well.  When I was in the Corporation I came to the conclusion that if the housing problem around Dublin was solved in 20 years very good work would have been done. At that time I got very sound advice in regard to the actual capabilities of the building trades to turn out houses. At one time I was informed it would not be possible to build more than 500 houses.  That figure has been exceeded to a remarkable degree.  I went so far as to demand 1,000 houses per annum and I was told it was utterly out of the question.  In three years something like 2,800 houses have been built, and I think that is a very considerable advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would like very much if money were available in the Local Loans Fund for housing.  We were told it was there to an illimitable extent in pre-war days, but it was never drawn out; it was never got.  The total amount at present due in respect of housing by urban authorities is somewhere in the neighbourhood of one and three-quarter millions.  In the case of the Labourers Acts something like six millions are due.  There is no use in hiding from ourselves the fact that it was very much easier to borrow money at that time than it is now.  The surplus money available for lending to the Government and private persons in this country at present is relatively small.  It is not fair to say to the banks: &ldquo;You must lend this money or you are niggardly.&rdquo;  In my view the banks have been generous in respect of loans to local authorities&mdash;particularly generous.  One would think, from seeing certain observations made by members of local authorities, that the banks were at liberty to lend this money and it was only a question of saying either &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  That <Col N="1182" /> is not the case.  The banks have had commitments in respect of long-term loans before these demands for houses were made on them; I am positively certain that each bank had some commitments in respect of long-term loans. The only available money they have got for a long-term loan is the difference between the commitments at that particular time and whatever their share capital and reserve funds amount to, less the sums spent in buildings and furniture and other things.  I think that will be admitted.  That is a relatively small sum.</P>
    <P>The banking capital in this country is a very small percentage of the huge sums that they have on deposit.  Those sums must be available on demand or at short notice, and they require to have a very considerable amount of money in liquid assets.  In reference to money tied up such as this, there is no question about its security; the security is excellent.  But banking is carried on on a different basis to security.  Financial houses deal with security, but banks must have liquid assets and they are not at liberty to issue money on long-term loans.  I am not making that statement after having been primed by the banks.  I have seen no banker on this question at all. It is simply my own opinion I am expressing. It is due to the banks that that should be made known.  They have met us in a reasonable spirit in connection with this matter, but I am perfectly satisfied that they are not justified in going any further than they have gone.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind Deputy Norton that while the National Loan has remained at a very good figure for the credit of the country during the last year or two years, there was a time within the last two years and six months when the quotations for the National Loan showed a very marked discount on its issue price.  The Deputy may say that was remedied in a short time.  I say that is so, but it would not be for the good of this country that such fluctuations would continue. The larger the amount there is out in connection with the National Loan the greater the danger of such fluctuations.  My advice would be to <Col N="1183" /> borrow only when needed, and to borrow as little as possible.  A country starting, as this country has started, with many disadvantages, with many people looking to see where the weakness is, cannot lightly embark on very big loans.</P>
    <P>The policy in connection with housing has been to put up as fair a contribution towards the abnormalities of the situation as the State was able to afford.  We are satisfied that we have made as big a contribution as the State could afford in the circumstances towards the solution of this problem.  It is only one of many services for which the State is responsible.  It is not a question of solving simply one problem or looking after one service specially.  One must keep an eye over all the services and over all the demands in connection with various services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gorey was scarcely fair in regard to the question of reconstruction. As I understood the case made in respect of reconstruction for rural areas, it was that because provision was made for towns provision should also be made for rural areas.  The housing problem, as it was known, had reference mainly to urban and municipal areas.</P>

      <P>A person can live in comparative comfort in the country in a dwelling which would be regarded as highly insanitary in a city. That may not be accepted in its entirety, but it is very near the mark. In other words, a particular dwelling is not an insanitary dwelling unless it is in close proximity to many others of the same character.  What are the facts in regard to slum dwellings? Firstly you have congestion, and, secondly, lack of sanitary accommodation; mainly you have the lack of air and sunshine.  Those things are not lacking in the country in the same way as they are lacking in a city or town. <Col N="1184" /> While a person might have a very small room in the country, the same size of a room in a city would be almost a pestiferous habitation.  In the country there is no such thing, and one can live in comparative comfort in a habitation in the country which would be almost as much as life would be worth if one were to live in a similar room in the city.</P>

If I had a four-room house which is out of repair and if I put it into repair, say, by putting a roof on it or by putting a wall into it, I would not get one penny under the Act.  Take, however, the case of a house in respect of which there is a good stable adjoining, and a proposal comes in to reconstruct and make it into a habitable dwelling, as many such stables have been made habitable; that would be a case in which reconstruction would be in accordance with the Act.  There is that difference between reconstruction and repair.

      <P>That would not be covered by the Bill as it stands.  I have no information regarding wastage. It was very severe twelve or thirteen years ago.  I know that if there were a sufficiency of houses at present, quite a number of houses which are now inhabited would be condemned.  In response to Deputy Good, I may say that there is a considerable number of three-room and four-room houses in the course of construction, mainly in the cities of Cork and Dublin, but also in other areas in respect of which that modified plan, of which I spoke, is in progress.  Perhaps on the Committee Stage I would have some more information about that.  In the case of Drumcondra there are 158 three-room and four-room houses, and in the case of Fairbrothers' field, I think, there are between 40 and 50 in addition to the flats already mentioned in Kehoe barracks, Clonmel barracks, and Tipperary barracks.</P>

      <P>I would like more particulars in regard to that.  I will look into that case.  As regards Deputy Good's query as to the number of three-room and four-room houses, I understand that of the 500 houses in connection with the Drumcondra and Glasnevin scheme the majority are three-room and four-room houses.  There are 59 four-room houses in Fairbrothers' field.  The tendency amongst smaller local authorities is to provide four-room dwellings.  These have been built, or are in the course of building, in Drogheda, Ardee, Wexford, Clonmel and Dungarvan.</P>

      <P>There are 59 such houses in that area.  Deputy Corish raised a question as to providing a larger subsidy for small local authorities. I gave that matter consideration this morning and I am not satisfied that we would be justified in discriminating. In Dublin, for instance, there is a higher wage paid and a higher rent can be paid there than, say, in Wexford.  In Dublin the price of a house is approximately 20 per cent. higher than in Wexford. I think, in view of that fact, that Dublin might reasonably make a case for a larger subsidy.  Although the subsidy is £20 a room, in the case of a four-room house of the modified plan I do not think that it would be fair to give the full £80.  I think they have given £70 in the case of houses according to the modified plan, and I heard to-day, <Col N="1187" /> in respect of one local authority, that such a house cost, approximately, £270. Deducting the £70 subsidy, that would leave the authority £200 for a four-room house.  That, I think, is getting very near the mark.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 23:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert before Section 18, a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The duties of Customs and Excise chargeable or leviable on twist and plug tobacco, shall on and after the 30th of June, 1926, be chargeable or leviable at rates amounting to three pence per ounce less than the duties chargeable or leviable previous to the said 30th day of June, 1926.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I proposed a similar amendment to the Finance Bill of last year, and I assure you that nothing has occurred since to alter my opinion.  I am convinced that the present tax on twist and plug tobacco is a cruel injustice upon the poorest and most deserving classes of the community, and that it helps to create and prolong the discontent which we still have abundant evidence of from many parts of the country. During last year's debate we were told by a Deputy that tobacco is a luxury which working men and small farmers might very well do without. Although that Deputy does not smoke, he must know, as well as I do, that to deprive poor people of their occasional smoke would be nothing short of cruelty.  Why should not the poor people have some little luxury?  Is it to be all work and no play for a class without whose labours we could have no State?  Is this the comfort, the freedom, and the independence that are guaranteed under the new order of things, when British rule has disappeared?</P>
      <P>In last year's debate the Minister for Finance said: &ldquo;That there was no means of distinguishing between the twist and plug and any other form of tobacco when the leaf is coming in.&rdquo; And he went on to say: &ldquo;It is difficult to estimate what this would cost, because we have not any firm figure of the amount of twist and plug used in this country, but (he added) it would cost anything in the neighbourhood of three-quarters of a million.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister cannot distinguish between the different kinds of tobacco when the leaf is coming in, and when <Col N="1192" /> he has no firm figures of the amount of twist and plug used in this country, how did he arrive at the conclusion that it would cost the State three-quarters of a million, if my amendment was carried?  I wish to draw the Minister's special attention to the fact that the present high duty on tobacco was imposed as a war tax by the British Government.  Now, sir, we were told by the President in this House a short time ago that Ireland's contribution to the war tax, in accordance with the Treaty Agreement, was wiped off the slate.  If this is so, why continue the war tax on tobacco, or on any other articles which were free from such tax previous to the war?  In conclusion, I appeal to the Minister to leave this matter to a free vote of the House. And if he does, I have no doubt as to what the result will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NALLY</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this amendment.  It is eight years since this tax was imposed, and I see no good reason why it should be continued eight years after the war is over.  The Minister will no doubt ask where the revenue is to come from if this tax is not imposed.  I think the revenue would come from increased consumption. There is no doubt whatever that 75 per cent. of the revenue would come from increased consumption.  I also think it is time that the war bonus which is paid to officials should be discontinued. I do not see any reason to continue the war bonus almost ten years after the war is over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy must have been attending meetings of public boards.  I explained last year that this is a proposal which would not be practicable unless we adopted some entirely different system of dealing with tobacco duties.  Tobacco is mostly imported unmanufactured.  When the Free State was set up tobacco in the form of cigarettes was imported manufactured. Cigarette factories have been set up, and there is now a very small import of manufactured tobacco.  All tobacco, we may say, is imported unmanufactured. It pays duty, is allowed out of bond, and is used by the manufacturer in whatever way it is suitable to use it.  If we were going to <Col N="1193" /> give a rebate on twist and plug tobacco we would have to make arrangements whereby manufacturing operations would be carried on in bond and under excise supervision.  An entirely new system of dealing with tobacco manufacture would have to be set up.  Presumably what would happen in that case would be that the manufacturers would pay full duty when the tobacco was taken out of bond.  Then the Customs officers would see that it was manufactured into twist or plug, and arrange for a rebate to be paid.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult to estimate what the cost of the change would be.  It certainly would be a very high figure. Our revenue from tobacco is £3,200,000. A reduction of 3d. per ounce would be about a remission of half the duty.  If this rebate were to apply to all tobacco it would mean that our revenue would be halved.  That we would have about £1,600,000 instead of £3,200,000.  We have no means of knowing what proportion of the tobacco consumed in the country is consumed in the form of twist or plug, but certainly a very substantial amount is, and the loss to the revenue on the Deputy's proposal would be very substantial.  It would be half-a-million or more of a loss, or perhaps three-quarters of a million.  It is very difficult to say.  It would be a sum that would certainly throw our Budget entirely out of balance.  It is, again, a concession that it would not be possible to make, unless we were prepared to impose other duties.  To make up the sum that would be lost by Deputy Cosgrave's amendment would involve heavy impositions of duties on other articles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied that it is desirable to impose duties, say, on tea or sugar to make up the loss.  There is no doubt at any rate that tobacco is an article that is consumed by a smaller number of people than either tea or sugar. There would be no appreciable increase of revenue as a result of a reduction, because tobacco is one of the commodities the consumption of which has not decreased.  Since the Free State came into operation and we had figures for our own territory, we have seen that there has been a decrease in the consumption of whiskey and beer, but <Col N="1194" /> there has not been a decrease in the consumption of tobacco.  Even when money was more plentiful in the country at the beginning of the Free State, there was not a greater consumption of tobacco than there is at present.</P>

      <P>Whatever the cause is, that fact indicates that a decrease in the duty and a consequent decrease in the price would not increase the consumption appreciably, so that whatever figure this amendment would cost would be a definite net loss of revenue to be made up by some other tax.  I indicated that there might be some grounds for thinking that there would be a ten per cent. increase in beer consumption if we reduced the duty, but there is nothing in the figures available to indicate that a reduction in the tobacco duty would lead to any appreciable increase.</P>

      <P>The Minister says there is no decrease in the consumption of tobacco.  Could he tell us if there is any decrease in the consumption of those two specified sorts of tobacco? The consumption of tobacco as a whole would not have decreased&mdash;in fact, the general consumption of tobacco and cigarettes is probably greater than ever&mdash;but in the consumption of the two kinds of tobacco specified in the amendment I believe there has been a large decrease, and I would be very glad if the Minister could give us any figures as to that.</P>

      <P>Would it not be possible to discriminate between the tobaccos of higher and more expensive quality and those tobaccos that are used by workingmen?  I am not a smoker myself and therefore do not profess to know much in actual practice about the difference between one type of tobacco and another, but I am aware that the ordinary workingman regards his tobacco as he regards his food, that frequently men would rather go without their food and have their tobacco.  So that in that light to certain classes of the community this cheaper sort of tobacco is an absolute necessity.  It is quite possible they could be weaned from the use of it, but I think it highly improbable that that would ever come about.</P>
      <P>If we accept facts as they are and admit, as we must admit, that indulgence in tobacco is not immoral, it seems to me that the situation could be met by taking off from the tobacco in more general use and keeping the revenue intact by putting a heavier impost upon the higher quality which, as a higher quality, is more in the nature of a luxury.  It may be that the Minister would reply that that is tantamount to class legislation.  But it is not, because it is on that basis that most of the taxes upon luxuries are calculated: that luxuries come first and necessities absolutely last.  So, unless there is some practical difficulty in the way of making the distinction, it seems to me in reason a good case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the situation is at the customs, as to whether it would be impossible in the case of tobaccos to deal with them separately without increasing the cost of collection, but if there is no difficulty, if the position is merely this: &ldquo;We must get the money and we will get the money at all hazards,&rdquo; I do not think it is a fair position for a Minister for Finance to take up.  The history of a tax is an important consideration in regard to its continuance.  Emergency measures ought to be emergency measures, and a tax imposed under the stress and stringency of war is not wholesomely continued, inasmuch as it shuts the door against the possibility of the Minister in peace time being able to <Col N="1196" /> increase the flow, the yield of taxation, when it becomes necessary for some new enterprise of State.  It seems to me the argument is all in favour of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not give the information that Deputy Doyle asked for.  It probably could be got with a reasonable degree of accuracy from the manufacturers, because the tobacco used in the Saorstát, as I have said already, is now put into its manufactured form here.  If we had those figures they would indicate whether there has been a decrease in the consumption of tobacco in this particular form, but those figures would not give by themselves any indication of the loss of revenue by the adoption of this amendment; because if you enable those particular tobaccos to be sold at, say, threepence per ounce, or more than threepence per ounce, less than they can be sold at present, there would be a certain tendency to shift over to the consumption of twist and plug.  So that if we had the figures and were trying to calculate the amount of loss, we would have to estimate for a change over to the consumption of tobacco in that particular form, and I think it cannot be doubted that the cost to the revenue of this concession would be well over half a million.</P>
      <P>It is impossible at the moment to do more than indicate that it would be very large, so large that we could not at all contemplate the concession unless we were prepared for the imposition of other taxes.  It becomes a question of whether it is desirable to take taxation off an article which is consumed by only a proportion of the people, by only, shall we say, less than half the working-people&mdash;because the wives of the working-men do not consume tobacco to any extent&mdash;and put it on something else.  We take it off something that is consumed by only a proportion of the population&mdash;I do not know what proportion, but a proportion that is very much less than the proportion that consumes the other articles on which we would have to put taxation to meet the revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impossible simply to sail in and drop half a million or three-quarters of a million of revenue without considering <Col N="1197" /> how the deficit is to be made up.  As I said last night, to make up a sum like this involves the taxation of some article of common consumption. Many a time I have had occasion to go over the import list to see where revenue could be got if we were dropping some of the existing taxes or wanted to change the scheme of taxation, and it has always appeared to me that the taxation of some article of common and necessary consumption is the only way to get substantial revenue. I certainly do not think it would be desirable to take the tax off tobacco and put a tax on, say, tea or sugar, or some other article of consumption, for the purpose of getting revenue.  If we had no protective object in mind, we might put a two or three per cent. tax on cloth or other articles and get substantial revenue, but I believe that we would be imposing much greater hardships on the community if we raised taxation in that way than by continuing it as at present.  Here we have an article of, shall we say, a semi-luxury type, which is bearing taxation.  The great <Col N="1198" /> trouble really and the great perplexity that is occasioned by the beer and spirit duties is that they have shown signs of not being able to bear the taxation. The consumption has shown signs of shrinkage, but there is no sign at all of shrinkage in consumption as far as tobacco is concerned.</P>

      <P>I regret I was absent when Amendment No. 22 came on, but I would ask you, sir, on a point of procedure, whether it would not be advisable that I should move it now, as otherwise I would be obliged to put down a motion asking the Dáil to agree with the recommendations of the Committee on Home-Grown Tobacco.  I put down the amendment in the hope that it would be a more convenient form for discussing the recommendations of the Committee, and I suggest, as this amendment is down to the same section as the amendment which has just been considered, that it would be advisable to consider it now, and not to pass it over and necessitate a motion.</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde's amendment is for a new section before Section 18, and, in fact, might as well have appeared on the Paper after the amendment that has just been defeated as before it.  Therefore I see no objection from the point of view of procedure to allowing him to move it now.  But I am not agreeing to allow it to be moved under any threat of a motion by Deputy Esmonde later; I am agreeing simply because, in fact, as it happens, there is no difference between its being moved now and in its place on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only made the suggestion from the point of view of procedure and of saving the time of the House.  It was not in the nature of a threat.  The amendment is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 18 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The excise duty on unmanufactured tobacco containing 10 lb. or more of moisture in every 100 lb. weight thereof shall, as on and from the 1st day of August, 1926, be charged, levied and paid at the rate of five shillings per lb. in lieu of the rate charged at present of five-sixths of eight shillings per lb.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As I have stated, the object of this amendment is to try to give effect to the provisional recommendations of the Committee which were communicated to Deputies, and I presume that the discussion will be roughly in the nature of the discussion on the report of the Committee.  The first point to which I wish to draw the attention of the Minister for Finance and of the House is the extraordinary discrepancies and the apparent contradictions which exist in the statements of the Minister during the last twelve months with regard to this question of home-grown tobacco. I must apologise for quoting several statements made by the Minister during that period, but it is necessary, I think, in order to bring home to the Minister his delinquencies in this respect.</P>
      <P>A year ago when Deputy Mulvany moved an amendment which, although the amount was different, was substantially the same as that which I am now moving, the Minister gave certain undertakings and made certain statements, as a result of which Deputy Mulvany withdrew his amendment.  On that occasion the Minister for Finance said that he, or the Executive Council, was anxious that the Irish Tobacco Industry should be made to take root and become established if possible.  He further said that the Executive Council were willing to do anything that seemed likely to result in success, provided it was not at an outrageous cost. He went on to state that if there was a complete removal of the excise duty on tobacco it would undoubtedly result in a demand for Irish-grown tobacco, because people here would become accustomed to the use of Irish tobacco, or at any rate the larger proportion of them would, but the people who could afford the luxury of other tobaccos might not smoke Irish tobaccos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But if they were able to buy tobacco at three farthings an ounce instead of <Col N="1201" /> eightpence there is no doubt that the consumption of Irish tobacco would grow.  On the other hand, some £3,000,000 of revenue would go.  He then suggested that this was one of the things that sometime later on, and well before the next Budget, might be very usefully examined by a committee which could bring witnesses before it, and have all papers and documents produced, because there was ample material for a study of the whole thing. When Deputy Mulvany's amendment was withdrawn be gave an undertaking that &ldquo;before the next Budget comes along, and even before the question of sowing the seed is determined, I would be prepared to move for the appointment of a select committee of the House, with power to call for witnesses and documents, to go into the whole question thoroughly, have it thoroughly threshed out and let us see what the facts are.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On that understanding, as far as I remember, Deputy Mulvany withdrew his motion to the Finance Bill last year, and then on the 10th February this year the Minister moved for the appointment of this Committee.  &ldquo;This Committee&rdquo;&mdash;I am quoting from the Minister&mdash;&ldquo;will enable the Dáil to make up its mind with greater certitude than if it were simply to rely on the arguments put forward by a Minister and put forward against a Minister by people who might have been briefed by tobacco growers.&rdquo;  Deputy Johnson, on that occasion asked the Minister what amount of money was available in order to keep alive the tobacco industry.  The Minister replied &ldquo;Any sum that the Dáil might like to spend on the luxury could, I presume, be afforded.&rdquo;  The Minister went on to say that in spite of the very considerable time spent experimenting on tobacco &ldquo;we are still at the point where the manufacturer getting the leaf&rdquo;&mdash;that is the Irish leaf&mdash;&ldquo;for nothing will not take it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the statement of the Minister in February.  Then this Committee, representing all parties in the Dáil, was set up and although it had very short time it reported to the Dáil. The Minister, in his Budget statement, admitted that the Committee was placed in an invidious position and was placed <Col N="1202" /> under certain handicaps when he stated on the 21st April that the Committee &ldquo;unfortunately was appointed rather late in the year and had, consequently, very little time for the hearing of evidence or the consideration of findings.&rdquo;  But in spite of these handicaps under which the Committee was suffering, the Minister came to the conclusion that the tobacco growing experiment in this country should be put to an end on the grounds that &ldquo;the Executive Council are satisfied that a sufficiently large proportion of Irish tobacco would not be used in mixtures to enable any part of the reduction in duty to be passed on to the public.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the sole ground which the Minister for Finance gave in his Budget statement for rejecting the recommendations of the Committee of the Dáil.  He based that opinion on the evidence of one manufacturer who appeared before the Committee, and also on the opinion of other manufacturers who apparently had given secret information to the Minister and who refused that information to the members of the Dáil Committee.  The Minister apparently had private means of information which the members of the Dáil, appointed to this Committee, had not got.  Again, in the concluding stages of the debate on the Budget, the Minister replying to Deputy Egan who advocated the adoption of the recommendations of the Tobacco Committee stated &ldquo;That the report was quite an excellent report if the terms of reference had definitely included the suggestion that the tobacco industry was to be kept going at all costs.&rdquo; That was the opinion of the Minister with regard to the report of the Dáil Committee.</P>
    <P>I have had to give these quotations at some length because they will recur again.  The first point to remind the Dáil of is, that the Minister agreed to the withdrawal of Deputy Mulvany's motion on the undertaking that a Dáil Committee should be set up to go into the whole question, and that it should have full time and opportunity to investigate the whole matter. According to the Minister's own statement, the Dáil Committee did not have those full opportunities because the Committee &ldquo;unfortunately was appointed <Col N="1203" /> very late in the year and had very little time for its investigations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore the question arises whether the undertaking which the Minister gave to Deputy Mulvany has been carried out.  For myself I do not think it has. The Committee, both in its interim and final report drew attention to the lack of time and the difficulties of the question.  In fact it bore out the statement of the Minister for Finance that it was not given an opportunity to go fully into the whole question of tobacco growing in this country, and consequently I do not see how it can be maintained that the undertaking of the Minister to Deputy Mulvany was carried out in this particular respect.</P>
    <P>The second question which arises is one of Parliamentary privilege and procedure.  It is, what are the functions of a Dáil Committee?  If the Minister required private information or technical information on this particular point of excise duty, surely he should have appointed a departmental commission of inquiry that would have reported to him personally and advised him on this particular matter, but he did not do that.  He appointed a Parliamentary Committee which was to report, not to him, but to the Dáil.  As far as I know, this is the first occasion in the history of the Irish Free State in which an unanimous report made by a Parliamentary Committee appointed by the Dáil has been ignored and rejected by a Minister without consulting the Dáil.  This report was not to the Minister, but to the Dáil.  The Minister himself knew perfectly well that this Committee had to report to the Dáil, and that the Dáil was responsible for rejecting or accepting the recommendations of the Committee.</P>
    <P>When in answer to Deputy Johnson, who asked what sum was available, the Minister replied in definite language &ldquo;any sum that the Dáil might like to spend on this luxury could, I presume, be afforded,&rdquo; it was obvious it was the Dáil that was to decide this question and not the Minister.  Otherwise I do not see the object of appointing a Parliamentary Committee.  Surely Deputies <Col N="1204" /> are not supposed to spend their time sitting on committees simply for departmental work and helping Ministers. That surely is the business of civil servants.  If members of the Dáil are asked to sit on a committee, and particularly a committee representing all parties in the Dáil, presumably that is a committee which reports back to the Dáil, and the Dáil, as distinct from the Minister, is supposed to decide whether the report of that committee is satisfactory or not.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as I have quoted, gave as his sole reason in the Budget statement for rejecting the recommendations of the Committee that a sufficiently large proportion of Irish tobacco could not be blended with other tobacco so as to produce any benefit to the consumer.  In other words, that no protection was to be allowed to this industry unless it resulted in a reduction of price to the consumer.  That was the Minister's contention: unless the consumer by this protection would be benefited by a reduction in the price of the commodity then no protection was possible.  That was the contention of the Minister, but where did he get his information?  We hear that he has received this secret information from manufacturers of tobacco, information which was refused to members of the Committee.</P>
    <P>Did the Minister get any information from the first interim report of the Agricultural Commission of 1923? Obviously not, because that Commission would completely contradict his statement.  The report of the Agricultural Commission stated that although the evidence was conflicting as to the possibility of using Irish tobacco in mixtures still it ultimately came to the conclusion that at least 25 per cent. of Irish tobacco could be used in mixtures, assuming that there was no reduction in price.  The Minister stated that he received information from Mr. Goodbody.  The evidence of Mr. Goodbody before the Committee was that Irish tobacco could not be used in mixtures in sufficient quantities so as to hand on the benefit to the consumer. Yet if the Minister had taken the trouble to read all the evidence before the Committee he would have seen that <Col N="1205" /> Mr. Goodbody himself publicly urged people some years ago to buy tobacco with a blend of 50 per cent. of other tobaccos in spite of the statement which he made before the Committee, which was, I fear, a prejudiced and not altogether satisfactory statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would allow me to correct a mis-statement which fell from him accidentally. The Report of the Committee did not state that &ldquo;at least 25 per cent.&rdquo; could be used.  It stated &ldquo;having regard to the fact that such an alteration of taste is necessarily a slow process, we feel justified in assuming that the maximum quantity of Irish tobacco that can be utilised for some years to come is about 25 per cent.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  I was incorrect in using the words &ldquo;at least,&rdquo; That, I understand, was on the assumption that there would be no reduction in the price of the tobacco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that has nothing to do with price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to explain that.  The Minister for Finance admitted that if there were a sufficient reduction in the Excise duty, Irish tobacco would become very popular here.  That admission was made in the discussion on Deputy Mulvany's motion. The Minister admitted then that the larger proportion of the people of this country would become accustomed to the use of Irish tobacco if there were a sufficient reduction in the Excise duty.  That statement is in striking contradiction to his other statements, that no matter how cheap Irish tobacco is nobody will take it, and that the manufacturers will not accept it even if they get it for nothing.  Deputy Johnson has reminded us that cheapness is an essential factor in determining public taste.  If Irish tobacco is to become popular in this country, then it must be cheaper than the ordinary tobacco.  That is perfectly obvious and the Minister admitted it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet, on a subsequent occasion, he said that no matter how cheap Irish tobacco was, nobody would accept it. Something happened between the time <Col N="1206" /> the pledge was given last year and the time the Minister proposed the appointment of this committee, when, I understand, the Minister made a very significant and sinister remark in this connection. Probably Deputy Mulvany will be able to throw light on this matter. The Minister for Lands and Agriculture and the Minister for Finance, when speaking of the development of Irish tobacco growing, compared it with the development of tea growing in Ireland.  The Minister for Lands said that if we spent enough money in building green-houses we could grow tea in Ireland with great success.  But does the Minister for Lands or the Minister for Finance suggest that a hundred years ago the greater part of the tea consumed in England was grown in Ireland?  Yet, we have the authority of Hansard&mdash;however reliable that is&mdash;for the statement that the greater part of the tobacco consumed in England in the years preceding the suppression of the Irish tobacco industry in 1830 was grown in Ireland, and that there were over 100 tobacco factories in Ireland in a flourishing condition. I never heard of even one tea factory in Ireland during that period.</P>
    <P>I do not think, therefore, that the comparison of tobacco-growing with tea-growing was a fair comparison. The two investigations that we have had into this matter during the past few years&mdash;the Agricultural Commission and the Dáil Committee on Tobacco Growing&mdash;have resulted in reports that tobacco of a satisfactory class could be grown in this country.  The words of the Report of the Agricultural Commission (section 3) are:&mdash;&ldquo;For the past twenty-two years, the Department of Agriculture has conducted a series of experiments in the growing, curing and handling of tobacco.  These experiments have proved that tobacco of a fairly satisfactory quality can be grown and cured in this country.&rdquo;  The Report of the Dáil Committee stated:&mdash;&ldquo;From the evidence which has been adduced, the Committee are satisfied that tobacco of fairly good quality can be grown in Ireland.&rdquo;  For those reasons, I think the remarks and allusions by the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance, in comparing <Col N="1207" /> tobacco-growing in Ireland with tea-growing, are rather cheap, and are not supported by the evidence brought before these two inquiring bodies.  They are not supported either by the experience of those people who have seen the increasingly satisfactory results of tobacco-growing here.</P>
    <P>The contention of the Minister for Finance is that to reduce the excise duty from 8/- per lb. to 5/- per lb. means a subsidy of 3/- per lb., or roughly £120 per acre, taking 800 lbs. to the acre.  Superficially, that seems very convincing.  It seems convincing to say that if you give this preference you are subsidising the growing of Irish tobacco.  At the present time, the British Government gives a preference of 2/- per lb. to tobacco grown in Ireland as against American tobacco. Is it suggested by the Ministers for Lands and for Finance that the British Government, when they were here, gave £25 per acre of a subsidy to Irish tobacco and now, when they have gone, that they are, with extraordinary magnanimity, giving a subsidy of 2/- per lb. or £80 per acre to the Irish growers of tobacco?  That is obviously absurd.  Yet, that is exactly on the same plane as the contention of the Minister for Finance that we are asking for a subsidy of £120 per acre to-day.  At the present time, the British Government gives a preference of 2/- per lb to Irish-grown tobacco and British Empire-grown tobacco over American tobacco.  The Irish Government gives a smaller subsidy in Ireland to Irish tobacco than the British Government gives to Irish tobacco in England.</P>
    <P>On the question of subsidy, the unfortunate man who would grow an acre of tobacco in Ireland would, if this amendment were accepted, have to pay £200 or £300 to the Government for the privilege.  And this is the man whom the Minister describes as &ldquo;subsidised!&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to explain, as far as I can, the reasons which induced the Committee to decide on this recommendation which is embodied, so far as I have been able to embody it, in this amendment to the Finance Bill.  In the first place, what struck the Committee, <Col N="1208" /> when listening to the evidence, was the extraordinary value and importance of this crop as distinct from other crops.  It is not necessary for me to recapitulate the matters mentioned in our Report and also in Section 1 of the Agricultural Commission's Report, in this connection.  All the members of the Committee were struck by the extraordinary importance and value of this crop as distinct from all other crops that can be grown in this country. The Committee did its best, in spite of the suggestions of the Minister for Finance, to pay attention to its Terms of Reference, which laid particular stress on the influence of any recommendation which they might make upon the revenue.  The Minister said that we recommended that this industry be kept alive irrespective of what the cost might be.  That was quite untrue. We carefully considered the cost. What would be a reasonable cost for keeping the industry alive?  It was to get the opinion of members of all parties in the Dáil on that question that this Committee was set up.  We were asked to give that opinion and we gave an opinion which we thought was correct. We gave the opinion that the industry could be kept alive at a certain cost.  The Minister disagreed and said that was too great a cost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost is set out in the recommendations of the Committee&mdash;a reduction of 3/- per lb. Now, this experiment of tobacco-growing was started, as everybody knows, about twenty-five years ago in the United Kingdom.  It was conducted in a very unfortunate manner; it never got a fair chance.  It was conducted inside the United Kingdom by means of an acreage subsidy which meant that farmers did not mind what sort of tobacco they grew so long as they got the subsidy.  It was something similar to what the Minister for Lands and Agriculture described to the Dáil when dealing with war-time tillage.  It was a very unfortunate experiment and it delayed definitely the improvement of tobacco growing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact remains that although for <Col N="1209" /> over twenty years the experiment of tobacco growing has been conducted in the United Kingdom, no experiment has ever been carried out in the Free State.  From the moment the Free State as an economic entity came into being, no attempt has been made by the Government to organise, control, or show any interest in, the development of tobacco.  It is a fundamentally different thing to grow tobacco inside the customs unit known as the United Kingdom and the customs unit known as the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>Unlike the experiment of beet growing, tobacco growing, as anyone who has studied the subject knows, takes a very long time and successful results cannot be expected by a unified plan. In Canada for twenty years tobacco growing experiments were conducted with little result until suddenly one farmer discovered the particular early leaf which suited Canada, and in a few years the growing of that leaf spread all over the country and now it is one of the most valuable assets of the Canadian Dominion.  The same applies to America.  The reason why America has got such extraordinary superiority over other nations, particularly in the English speaking markets, is because of the centuries of experiments in tobacco growing which were carried out and which have enabled them to reach a much higher stage of perfection than existed in any other country.</P>
    <P>At the period when Ireland was a prosperous tobacco-growing country it took forty years for tobacco to develop. The embargo was taken off in the seventies of the eighteenth century and experiments continued down to the time tobacco became a flourishing industry at the beginning of the last century; that would be over one hundred years ago.  There was admitted incompetence connected with the experiments conducted by the British Government.  The Free State Government has done nothing whatever to encourage experiments in the Free State itself.  We are told instead that now the industry is to be wiped out and no more is to be heard about it.</P>
    <P>Another matter which influenced the Committee in coming to this decision was the fact that by determining to <Col N="1210" /> stamp out tobacco growing in Ireland the Minister for Finance is officially recognising a tobacco monopoly in the Free State; not legally, but nevertheless officially.  At the present time the British Imperial Tobacco Company has got a virtual monopoly in this country. It has not got a monopoly in any other country, with the exception of Great Britain.  It has got a ninety per cent. monopoly here.  The native Irish tobacco manufacturers are being, one by one, wiped out.  Only two weeks ago a tobacco manufacturer closed down in Cork and several others are on the point of closing down. Possibly by the end of the financial year there will be only one company manufacturing in the Free State; that is, the British Imperial Tobacco Company.</P>

      <P>The Imperial Tobacco Company that last week announced a fresh bonus are being given a monopoly here and they are not paying anything for that monopoly.  The cost of building their factories in Dublin was paid out of the Irish taxpayers' pockets.  They kept the price of tobacco that they manufactured in Ireland at the cost which was paid for tobacco manufactured in England for three or six months after it was manufactured in Ireland and by that means they completely recouped themselves for the cost of setting up the factories in Dublin.  In other countries when they permitted a tobacco monopoly the Government made a good thing out of it; they got some money.  Here they are giving a monopoly for nothing.</P>

    <P>As everybody knows, the prices charged for tobacco here are far in excess of the actual value of the tobacco supplied.  When people talk about good and bad tobacco it is entirely a question of taste.  People in this country may find South African or Continental tobacco inferior to American tobacco, but the same opinion exists in other countries in regard to tobacco. The actual recommendation we propose, <Col N="1211" /> and under this amendment it is suggested, is that Irish tobacco should have a preference of 3/2 per lb. over imported tobacco.  I will not waste the time of the committee by going into complicated mathematical calculations, but roughly it amounts to a preference of a little more than twopence an ounce.  If this lasts for a time Irish tobacco could be sold at twopence an ounce cheaper than corresponding western American tobacco which is on the market in Ireland to-day.</P>

      <P>The whole argument of the Committee was that Irish tobacco, to be popularised, should be sold at a cheaper price than western American tobacco.  If the Deputy chooses to work it out, he will find that by a reduction of three shillings or three and twopence, Irish tobacco could be sold much cheaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>You talked before of a reduction of one and fourpence; now you are speaking of a three and twopenny reduction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned a reduction of three and twopence from the full Customs rate of eight and twopence on tobacco.  Irish tobacco could, I said, be sold at twopence per ounce cheaper if there was that reduction in Excise duty.  If there was a mixture of fifty per cent. Irish tobacco, it could be sold at one penny per ounce cheaper, <Col N="1212" /> or one half-penny per ounce cheaper if the mixture was twenty-five per cent. Irish.  These are rough figures.</P>
      <P>The question which the Minister is likely to ask is, would it be sold at that reduced price?  There is nothing to force the Irish manufacturers to sell the Irish mixture at one penny or a half-penny an ounce cheaper than another mixture.  I think there is one very palpable reason why that mixture would be sold at a cheaper rate, and that is, on the admission of the Minister himself, that only by a reduction of price could Irish tobacco be made popular.</P>
      <P>The Minister has referred to the loss of revenue.  In the opinion of the Committee the loss of revenue would be very small.  It would take a very long time, under the present proposals as embodied in this recommendation, to change public taste, and therefore there would be a correspondingly small decrease in the buying of Irish tobacco. The Minister talks as if such recommendation would involve a great loss to the Exchequer.  May I point out that the Minister in recent years has been a most disgraceful profiteer in respect to tobacco?  In 1923 the Minister stole between twenty and thirty thousand pounds to be set aside for the development of Irish tobacco.  When I say &ldquo;stole&rdquo; I mean that he appropriated the money to the Central Fund. In his Budget statement this year the Minister admitted that he made twenty thousand pounds out of tobacco.  He profiteered to the extent of twenty thousand pounds more than he expected. Now he is unwilling even to make a small concession in order to keep alive this experiment of Irish tobacco growing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is not to give an extraordinary preference which would result in a great development of growing inferior Irish tobacco. The object of the amendment, and of the report of the Committee, was to create a situation whereby the tobacco experiment in this country could be just kept alive, pending the complete investigation of its possibilities which we maintained has not been given, and which the Minister himself, in his Budget statement, admitted has not been <Col N="1213" /> given.  Likewise, if this amendment were accepted, the loss to the Treasury would not be very great because the increase in the price of tobacco would be very slow, and it would require some independent-minded tobacco manufacturer in this country, in order to break away from the ring formed by the Imperial Tobacco Company, to develop an Irish brand of tobacco.  It would be a considerable time before that could take place, and, as the loss of revenue during several years would be very small, to that extent the experiment would be kept alive.</P>
    <P>That was the whole object of the Committee's proposal.  If I may recapitulate the objects which the Committee had in view in coming to this decision, I may say that they were, in the first place, that the tobacco growing experiment has not been given a fair chance; secondly, that the experiment might be of great use, particularly if the Government were to decide, as ultimately it will have to decide, to do something to develop tillage; thirdly, that it would be unfair to condemn this experiment to extinction without having it fully investigated; fourthly, that the Dáil appointed a Committee representative of all parties in the House which was supposed to give an honest opinion as to what cost would be justified in keeping alive this experiment, and whether this experiment could be kept alive at a reasonable cost.  We gave that opinion, and I think it is for the Dáil to decide whether that opinion is right or wrong.  Finally, it is the conviction of all members of the Committee that for several years the loss to the State would be very small if our recommendations were accepted.</P>

I am not going to cover the ground again, or to speak as long on the subject as Deputy Esmonde, nor am I going to trot out the arguments used here in debate last year in support of the amendment which I introduced.  As Deputy Esmonde <Col N="1214" /> has said, it was on the Minister's suggestion that I withdrew my amendment on 11th June last.  The Minister then stated that before the seeds would be sown for this year's crop, he would ask for a Select Committee of the House to call witnesses, to take evidence, and to report.  Time wore on, and, I think, sometime about November last I happened to meet the Minister downstairs. I said: &ldquo;Hello, Mr. Blythe, what about that Committee you promised us last June?&rdquo; His reply there and then was, &ldquo;Any time you ask for it you can have it, and then it will do you no good.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That statement was made.  I asked for the Committee.  I had to ask for it, although the Minister said on the 11th June that he would ask for it himself.  He did not.  As I say, I asked for the Committee after the Christmas holidays, and it was appointed.  As every Deputy knows, that Committee was representative of every element in the Dáil.  I think we had about six meetings.  We called all the witnesses we could get and we took all the evidence we could.  We considered our report very carefully, and on the 25th March last, after going through our draft report, Deputy Egan, who was a member of the Committee, stated before he left the Committee room, that he and Deputy Beamish came in as two die-hards and went out as two converts.  We sent up an unanimous report recommending a further remission of duty.  That report has been turned down by the Minister.  I am not surprised.  I think it was going rather too far if the Minister, when having that Committee appointed, had his mind made up beforehand as to what he would do, no matter what the findings of the Committee were.  That is what I complain of, and I think that is what every Deputy who sat on the Committee has a right to complain of. <Col N="1215" /> I think the action of the Minister is nothing short of a vote of censure on every member who sat on that Committee.</P>
      <P>I do not come here to look for favours, but I expect in this House, whether I am here long or short, to get justice and fair play, and I believe that I, for one, and that every other member who sat on that Committee have been treated unfairly and unjustly, and with the utmost contempt.  We hear a great deal about subsidising this and that industry.  We are told that we are looking for a subsidy to grow tobacco. The question of subsidy does not arise. There is a vast difference in subsidising an industry and asking for a remission of duty on one that is over-taxed. The average acre of tobacco will be about 800 lbs.  With the existing duty on an average of 800 lbs. an acre, there would be about £300 duty on every acre of tobacco grown in the Free State. That means that the grower is practically paying a rent of £300 an acre to the State for every acre of tobacco he grows.  We are not looking for a subsidy, but for a reduction in the rent. That is another way of putting it, and we are looking for that reduction, not alone for the reason that it will help the tobacco growers to carry on, but that by tobacco being grown in this country we will have more tillage and we will have more wheat.  That fact was proved in evidence by the various witness who knew anything about tobacco growing and about agriculture. Wheat can be grown very successfully after a tobacco crop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal that is not contained in the Report, with all due respect to the Committee.  First of all, we are placed in the position that foreign-grown tobacco coming into the country gives us a revenue of over three and a quarter millions.  I do not know the figure for this year.  I am speaking about the figure for 1924-25. If we do not derive that revenue from tobacco we have got to derive it from something else, preferably something that does not grow in the country, for instance, tea or sugar.  To make tobacco a paying proposition in this State, to my mind, three things are essential&mdash;a remission of duty to a certain point, a fixed price corresponding with that certain point and a restriction of acreage.  If tobacco, by a remission of duty, is made an exceptionally profitable crop in this country, everybody will grow it.  The agriculturists will grow it instead of turnips, and if the nation is going to have nothing but Irish-grown tobacco, tobacco will be of no more value than turnips.  I hope that everybody will have an equal right to grow tobacco.  It cannot be the monopoly of a few people.  We cannot have protection for a few.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not propose it in so many words, but it is only tinkering with the question to deal with it in the way in which it has been dealt with up to now.  To make this a profitable crop, only a certain limited <Col N="1217" /> quantity can be grown in the country. Then the question will arise, who will have the right to grow it and to what extent they will have the right to grow it?  I would like an answer to this question before I for one could cast a vote for this amendment.  I have a perfectly open mind on the question, and I want to be given a little information from those who are apostles of Irish-grown tobacco.  Some three and a half million pounds must be provided from some other source if Irish-grown tobacco is going to take the place of the foreign article.  It has been stated that by a reduction of 1/4 in the £ Irish tobacco can be made an economic proposition, but only by a reduction of 1/4 in the £, plus maintaining the price at its present standard.  A reduction of 3/2 in the £ would mean that the same profit could be derived from tobacco if it were sold at 2d. an ounce less.  In any case, there is no fortune in the crop.  There is nothing to be made for the grower except under these conditions, and even granting these conditions you will have to restrict the crop, because if everybody starts growing tobacco there will be no profit for the few who work on the assumption that they alone will have the privilege of growing it.  Unless there is a remission of the duty and a restriction of the acreage, tobacco can be of no more value than the growing of turnips.</P>

      <P>Well, the majority of <Col N="1218" /> them anyhow.  If we were told&mdash;perhaps it is my own fault that I have not the figure&mdash;what is the value of the raw material coming into the country&mdash; how much money is leaving the country for the raw material&mdash;it might help us.  We have been told that £300 an acre has been paid by the grower at the present rate of duty.  That is not true.  It is true of course that he pays it direct, but it is equally true that he gets it back through the manufacturer or the consumer.  These are the people who are paying it and not the grower.  I think we want a lot more light from the apostles of this gospel before we can come to any fair and honest decision about it, because we have not all the facts.  We have not considered it from that view-point before.  I would like to have some of the questions I have asked answered.</P>

      <P>It is true that there has been a very partial statement of the case.  Deputy Esmonde made a good deal of play with the appointment of the Committee and the lateness of its appointment.  I was very willing to admit that the Committee had not a sufficient opportunity of considering the matter, because that seemed to me the only rational explanation of the report that the Committee produced. I think it was a fact that they had not really sufficient time.  Through an oversight the actual formulation of the terms of reference was delayed a little. There was some delay between the Minister for Agriculture and myself in settling the terms.  Then they were submitted to the Executive Council and it was some days before anything took place.  The result was that it was a fortnight or three weeks later than we had intended before the Committee was arranged.  So their time was short.  I was quite willing to admit that that was an extenuating circumstance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that. In any case I will pass away from that.  Deputy Esmonde said that some manufacturers appeared to have given secret information to the Minister and <Col N="1219" /> refused to appear before the Committee. One Irish manufacturer who spoke to me complained that he had not been asked to give evidence and that he would have been most anxious to give it.  The only manufacturer who appeared before the Committee gave evidence which was apparently disregarded by the Committee.  He indicated that only about ten per cent. of Irish tobacco could be used in mixtures. Other manufacturers hold that that figure is even less than ten per cent. If only ten per cent., or some such percentage, were used there certainly could be no reduction to the consumer. As a matter of fact, what would happen in that case would be that they would be supplying the manufacturers with a legalised adulterant for their mixtures.  At present it is forbidden to include, except in Cavendish, the leaf of any tree or plant other than a tobacco plant.  If we reduce the duty to 5/- we would practically be giving them a substance which they could incorporate in their tobacco to some limited extent and sell it to the public without any reduction.  Deputy Mulvany tried to obscure the issue.  He talked about the reduction in the rate of duty that growers were paying.  Deputy Gorey dealt with that.  The Irish grower must, in order to carry on, get about 1/6 per lb. for his product. A better article grown elsewhere can be sold for 7d.  If there were no duty at all on tobacco&mdash; neither Excise nor Customs Duty&mdash;in order to enable the growing of tobacco to be continued here a subsidy of from £30 to £50 an acre would be necessary in perpetuity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the consensus of opinion.  The Irish grower says &ldquo;an equal article.&rdquo;  I would concede that, although I do not believe it is an equal article.  The Irish grower's contention is that the equivalent article is an article that sells at 7d. a lb. where he must get 1/6.  That makes it clear that there is no prospect at all of Irish tobacco <Col N="1220" /> growing being put on an economic basis.  I submit to propose to keep that thing going on the basis of a subsidy of £40 an acre would be simply, shall I say, protection gone mad.  There is no employment given that would justify it.  If our tobacco was free from duty we would have to make an actual payment out of the Exchequer of £40 an acre or perhaps more; it would depend on the crop.  I do not say that that could be justified, and that is the prospect.  Meantime we are asked to give a remission of duty which is equivalent to a subsidy of anything. from £120 to £150 an acre and that after, I think, 25 years of some sort of experiments.  Could anybody say that it is a reasonable proposition that a crop on which money has been spent and on which Instructors have been employed for the past 25 years can only be grown now when we give a subsidy and when we lose out of the Exchequer £120 to £150 for every acre grown?  I think it is a preposterous suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is at present an arrangement whereby on each pound of tobacco the grower has an advantage of 1/4.  We are not proposing to drop that.  If anybody can carry on with that let him do so, but really the facts even brought out by this Committee indicate that the wise thing to do would be to recognise that we have been attempting the impossible. The 1/6 and the 1/7 figures which the Irish growers themselves accept and which I have quoted prove that it is an impossible thing, and the wisest thing to do would be to drop it and if it were dropped, as I have already said in the Dáil.  I would not object to winding it up decently so that people might not be discouraged from growing experimental crops in future by being left in the lurch.  I think we have many a time urged people to make experiments and I would frankly say that if the experiment were being wound up a fair consideration ought to be given to the people who have been engaged in it. I do put it to the Dáil most sincerely that really the investigation conducted by this Committee, if you read it over, is an indication that we should not go on, that it really is only a degree better <Col N="1221" /> than growing tea or growing something like that.  Conditions one hundred years ago were different altogether. There were not the same transport facilities and it was an entirely different matter growing tobacco one hundred years ago from what it is now.</P>
    <P>Somebody said the British Government gives 2/- per lb.  The British Government has a general Colonial preference of 2/- per lb., but I do not know how much Irish tobacco is being sold in England owing to that.  I understand there is none.  There was a consignment sent over, but I believe it is being hawked around and cannot be sold.  I heard that information perhaps a month or so ago, and it may be out of date now.  That is the fact&mdash;that it could not be sold, because the Irish grower if he wants to get his tobacco sold must sell against somebody who can afford to put it on the market at perhaps less than 7d. against his 1/6, so that it is really an illusory thing.</P>
    <P>Tobacco will come into the British market from Africa and other places where they have a climate suitable to the growth of tobacco, and they have tobacco there that people will consume in considerable quantities.  Even if it has a different taste, it is not the sort of thing a manufacturer is afraid to put into his mixtures; so possibly a considerable quantity is put into the mixtures in order to gain some benefit by the reduction of 2/- on Colonial tobacco.  That is not so here.  Some manufacturer who has not a scrupulous regard for his product may put some of this tobacco into it, but in general he will shy off, because one of the effects largely of high taxation is that people nowadays are particular about the quality.  Various manufacturers told me that the public is more particular about the quality of tobacco that it uses now than it was some years ago.  One manufacturer told me that in one of his mixtures in which there were ten ingredients, one ingredient out of ten was altered and within a month there was a distinct falling-off of that mixture because the public did not like it.  It is because of that fastidiousness of taste that has grown up that the manufacturer will <Col N="1222" /> not risk more than quite small quantities in his mixtures and, consequently, even although you have a reduction of 2/- per lb. in duty, what will happen will be that practically the manufacturer will get that.  Because he gets the amount of 2/- per lb. into his pocket he will risk putting some of the Irish tobacco into his mixtures. The grower will get his 1/6 for his acreage and the Exchequer will lose from £120 to £150.</P>
    <P>It has been said that we are paying a very substantial subsidy to the sugar beet industry, but that is new, and it is not a subsidy of that size in any case.  We would not continue it if we did not believe that at the end of the experimental period a very much reduced subsidy would do.  We have to give that big subsidy because something like £400,000 has to be put into a factory to induce the firm to start. There are all sorts of factors which necessitate a very big subsidy there. But to ask us now at this stage to give a subsidy of from £120 to £150 per acre, and with no better prospect before us than that sometime, if we got to the stage when the public liked Irish tobacco as well as they like other tobaccos, when the taste of the public would have completely changed, the industry could carry on on the basis of from £40 to £50 per acre of a subsidy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel I cannot vote on this question without explaining the reason for my vote.  When the case was put forward it was put forward mainly because tobacco is valuable as regards the employment of labour.  When the proposal for a sugar beet subsidy was before us I examined it as well as I could and asked myself whether the subsidy that was proposed to be given was the best way the money could be spent, first, for the improvement of agriculture, and, secondly, for the employment of labour and the general development of the country&mdash;whether if £100,000, or whatever sum might be in question, was to be spent that was the best way of spending it.  After a good deal of consideration, in view of all the circumstances, I agreed that the experiment was worth the cost, and that it would probably lead to a <Col N="1223" /> national advantage very much greater than the cost to the State that was involved.</P>
      <P>I approached this question in somewhat the same way.  I asked myself whether the amount that is proposed to be spent, the amount that it is proposed to cost the State, is the best way that sum of money could be spent for the improvement of agriculture and consequently for the employment of labour.  I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that it is not the best way that money can be spent.  I take the evidence of the report and I find that the estimated cost of the advantage proposed by the amendment is £66 13s. 4d. per acre.  That is over and above the £50 at present.  Now £66 per acre might be justifiable as applied to tobacco growing if one really saw the prospect of that developing into a valuable asset to the country, and at a cost which would gradually decline.  I see no evidence whatever of that gradual decline.</P>
      <P>The labour expenditure is a very considerable factor in the consideration of this question.  I find from the tables submitted in the evidence that the labour expenditure, including the cost of growing, rehandling and marketing, will average, taking one year with another, from £30 to £35 per acre.  That, I presume, includes the cost of the labour of the small farmer who is working it and his family, because the cost per hour is quoted for men, women and boys, no matter whether they are wage labourers or the actual small farmer and his family.  So that the labour cost of this produce is, let us say, £35 per acre, including rehandling. The cost to the State to pay that amount of labour is at present £50 per acre, and it is proposed to add to that another £66.  That seems to me to be entirely too difficult a proposal to accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is said that the need for this additional subvention is caused by the entry into the British market of coolie-labour-grown tobacco, and that while that coolie-labour-grown tobacco&mdash; labour at a very low rate of pay&mdash;is in competition it is necessary that we in this country should meet it by a charge upon the State.  I am afraid <Col N="1224" /> that that is a proposition that we could not very well agree to.  If any action that we could take would raise the cost of the coolie-grown article, then we might be induced to continue.  But can it be shown that any action of ours is going to raise the wages of these coolies?  I cannot see that.  So that we would be faced with the likelihood that this subvention would have to continue if we were putting it on for the purpose of meeting the competition of this coolie-grown product.</P>
    <P>As to the question of the consumer's taste and the rest, I am assuming that all that is solved, and that we are now treating it purely from the point of view of the producer, the advantage to agriculture and to the employment of labour.  In regard to the advantage to agriculture, I have no doubt that it is considerable.  But is this the best way to procure that advantage&mdash;that is, by the continual expenditure of £66 per acre over and above the £50 per acre already expended?  I leave that to the agriculturists to answer.  Is there any better way of spending £116 per acre for the protection and development and encouragement of agriculture than by tobacco growing?</P>

      <P>Well, of course, these are facts that did not come under my notice in looking through the evidence, or when hearing the evidence of an earlier Commission, and I had the notion that there was a certain allowance for moisture in imported tobacco. But apart from that, assuming&mdash;and all my argument is based upon the assumption which, if it is false, I ask the House not to take any notice of&mdash;that for every ounce of Irish-grown tobacco that is purchased by a consumer there is an ounce of imported tobacco not imported, there is a loss of revenue by the fact that one ounce of Irish-grown tobacco replaces one ounce of imported tobacco.  I am taking that assumption.  I have heard nothing at all to dispel that assumption from my mind.  Then if that is so, the figures that I quoted seem to me to be too serious to allow us to pay the sum required to keep this industry in being.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if the Deputy speaks of it as an experiment he has got to give us some evidence to encourage us to believe that within a reasonable period the experiment will come to an end.  I quote from the Final Report of the Commission: &ldquo;In arriving at this conclusion the Committee did not lose sight of the effect on the revenue of such a proposal.  Accepting 800 lbs. as the average yield per acre, and allowing 10 per cent. for waste and assuming that home-grown tobacco would displace a corresponding amount of imported leaf, the additional loss to the revenue, over and above the present rate of preference, would be approximately £116 for every acre of tobacco grown and marketed.&rdquo;  The Deputy can answer that by his recent statement.  I am relying upon that, because I think that that is the fact.  I think his correction of my statement <Col N="1226" /> does not accord with the Report which he signed as Chairman, and it is on those grounds that I reluctantly feel obliged to vote against this amendment. I do so as one who is prepared to go a long way to assist the development or to maintain a promising Irish industry. If the Deputy can give me some reason to believe that within a reasonable time this experiment will emerge from the experimental stage, or that there will be from an early date a gradually lessening cost, I would be prepared to consider the matter.  But I would like to have some evidence of that before the discussion is brought to a close.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. COLE Mr. COLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise on this occasion only because I happened to be one of the Committee, and I may say that, whether rightly or wrongly, I went on the Committee to a certain extent with a biased mind.  I did not believe that there was anything in the industry, and I might say that after the first day's evidence probably 99 per cent. of the Committee left with the idea that the game was not bothering about.  But on the second day we had the evidence of Mr. McCaffrey, who said he was growing tobacco for twenty-five years, and who gave us his experience, not only as a tobacco-grower, but as a general farmer.  He convinced not only myself, but I think the remainder of the Committee, that the thing was really worth consideration at any rate. This is probably the last effort that the tobacco growers will make to try to get assistance from the Government. As we have heard from practically all benches in the House, it is very difficult for the small farmer to exist at present, and it has been stated over and over and over again that everything he has to sell is practically at pre-war price and that everything he buys either for himself or for his farm is greatly in excess of pre-war price.  Therefore, I think that the Government should be very anxious to facilitate the small farmers, especially in anything which would give employment, employment not only to the labourers, but work which will keep the farmers' families at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told that an average crop would make about 800 lbs. an acre, and <Col N="1227" /> if an extra remission of 1/6 in the lb. were granted it would equal about £60 per acre.  According to the evidence submitted to us, three-quarters of this would be spent on labour.  Tobacco-growing gives about 300 per cent. more employment than any other average crop, and the figures as to the employment it gives in comparison with other crops, for which, I believe, the Department of Lands and Agriculture are responsible, are: Tobacco 748 hours, potatoes 309 hours, flax 228 hours, mangolds 270 hours, sugar beet 270 hours, turnips 173 hours, and barley 83½ hours.  So that from the viewpoint of employment alone I think that this matter should not be lightly set aside; I think the industry is still worth consideration, especially as it is an old Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The evidence given to the Committee showed that there was very little unemployment in the tobacco-growing districts, in fact it led us to believe that practically everyone was employed. The Minister may laugh, but I am giving the evidence we got, which we had to go by and which was not contradicted.  It is also noteworthy, comparing the census of 1901 with the census of 1911, that the population in the tobacco growing districts increased in these years.  Another important fact which Mr. McCaffrey brought to our notice, and which I think should have some effect with protectionists, is that tobacco cannot be grown on the same ground two years in succession. In order to be a successful crop it has to be in rotation of six years' crops and consequently there is the first year a crop of corn and the last year a crop of wheat.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about the subsidy to tobacco, but I contend that it is only a grant to tobacco and that it is really a subsidy to wheat and corn, because for every 100 acres of tobacco you grow you have to grow 100 acres of corn and 100 acres of wheat. According to his evidence, Mr. McCaffrey could grow better wheat and get a much larger yield after a crop of tobacco than after any other crop.  I do not give that as a personal experience but as the experience of an expert who has been growing tobacco <Col N="1228" /> for the last twenty-five years.  The Committee considered this question of remission and all the possible arguments which the Minister could rake up as to the losses which the State had sustained.  After due consideration we came to the conclusion that the State would not sustain all the losses that it has been argued it would.  We must realise that if 1,000 more people were employed in the tobacco-growing district the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would get a share of the money that would be circulated, that certainly more letters would be passing through the post, there would be more boots used and more of everything that is taxable, so that it would not really mean all the losses that the Minister has made out.</P>
    <P>All these taxable commodities have to be taken into consideration, and the more people you have in the country the more of these taxable articles would be used.  Therefore I contend that the loss would not be so very large as has been made out.  The Minister for Finance talked a good deal last night about the loss that there would be to the revenue if the spirit duty were reduced.  I suppose if the workers on the land would not be consuming this stuff the people in the factories would.  As one of the Committee who came to this unanimous conclusion I still hold that we should try to keep this industry going.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN (Minister for Lands and Agriculture)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cole, who is a hard-headed man, should push that to its logical conclusion.  He pointed out that if we were willing to give a subsidy of £116 an acre we could get a large acreage of tobacco under cultivation, that we could get a considerable number of men employed, that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would have more letters to carry, and that the publichouses in the neighbourhood would have more customers for drink.  That is all absolutely true, but tobacco has certain limitations from that point of view.  It is admitted on all hands that we would not get a very big acreage under tobacco, even with this subsidy of nearly £120 an acre.  In fact it is claimed as one of the advantages by the Deputies <Col N="1229" /> who are advocating this that you would not be likely to get a very big acreage of tobacco, and consequently that your total payment would not be very high.</P>
      <P>It suffers, therefore, from that particular disadvantage from Deputy Cole's point of view, because if we paid £120 an acre to potato growers instead of giving it to the tobacco growers, I would make a bet that you would get 30,000, 40,000 or up to 100,000 more acres grown, and there would be far more labour and far more employment given, more letters carried by the postman, more drink sold, and everyone would be happy.  That is one of the objections to tobacco growing.  The advocates of tobacco growing point that out as an advantage.  If the Minister for Finance says that we would get a great deal of tobacco grown at a subsidy of £120 an acre and asks where is the money to come from, the advocates of tobacco growing say that you will not need it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cole's case is somewhat different. He points out that if the subsidy is a very high one it has other advantages; it puts a certain amount of land into cultivation, enables the owners to grow a corn crop after the tobacco, gives a certain amount of employment, sets the postman going, and means that a certain number of people will be consuming drink who would not be in ordinary circumstances.  I am addressing myself now to Deputy Cole's arguments. I am trying to present to him that there is an alternative, that if the Minister for Finance were to give £120 per acre for growing potatoes, not X men, but ten times X men, would be employed, not thousands of gallons  stout drunk, but tens of thousands of gallons.  Deputy Cole is a hard-headed man and he should at least be logical. Nobody would be wiser than Deputy Cole if the proposition were a different one.  He would not talk about an ancient Irish industry, or things like that.  He would examine things on their merits and say whether the advantages were worth the money proposed to be spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question I put up is the question that Deputy Johnson rightly put up: Can we spend on an experiment, or on <Col N="1230" /> something that is now past its experimental stage, £120 an acre, or £60 an acre, which is the additional subsidy now asked for?  Would it be in the interests of the small farmers?  How many small farmers would it affect?  Who is to pay it, anyway?  Money does not come from under a stone.  Even the Minister for Finance does not get it that way any more than the rest of us. The thing is absolutely absurd and has never been examined.  Deputy Cole must not have examined this question or he would not have put up such arguments. It is absurd to compare it with sugar beet and I am sorry that it has been compared with it.  We must get out of the idea that there is no finality about anything.  We will all have certain doubts about beginning experiments if we believe that we are going to create precedents and that the experiments are going to be continued whether they fail or succeed.</P>
    <P>That is a wrong point of view.  I would never have asked the Minister for Finance to give £25 an acre, roughly, for these beet sugar experiments if I had thought that we would have this extraordinary point of view expressed about them, that whether the experiments failed or succeeded we were going to continue them.  We must face all these matters logically, and if we do not then no Government can do the right thing.  If the Executive Council, or whoever is responsible, has to consider that in this country the point of view of every party and of every interest is you are to continue an experiment whether it fails or not, naturally it will be unwilling to make experiments.  Our action should be directed towards encouraging the Executive Council to take risks in making experiments.  I protest against the statement that if 50 per cent. of the experiments do not fail, then it is because we are afraid to make experiments.</P>
    <P>That gets me back to the old story about the agricultural colleges.  Why do they not pay?  We all know that we could make them pay if we were merely considering things that we knew would not fail, that were settled long ago, and that are being done on every commercial farm.  As I said before, an experiment <Col N="1231" /> is essentially experimental. Here is an experiment that was begun long before the war.  First of all there was a payment that amounted to something like £25 an acre; then there was a payment of £50; afterwards so much per acre grown; later there was this subsidy of 1/6, which amounted to about £40 an acre, and finally, £60 an acre.  Now we are asked, as a commercial proposition, for that is what it amounts to, to give a subsidy of £120 an acre for an odd 1,000 acres of tobacco. There is simply no case for it. We should be quite logical about this matter and have finality somewhere. I suggest that we drop this talk, and that there are many other ways in which the money could be more usefully spent from the point of view of the small farmer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>The tobacco-growing industry is one that is going to give employment to a number of people. The Government have already adopted, as an experiment, a policy of tariffs. In some cases these tariffs have proved satisfactory, and I have no doubt that if Deputy Esmonde's amendment was accepted it would also prove satisfactory. In Ireland a hundred years ago, as we were told, the country was able to provide its own supplies of tobacco for the thirty-two counties.  It is strange that we cannot do the same now for twenty-six counties.  The Minister for Finance stated that the consumer would not benefit by any reduction in price.  I do not agree.  I think if you took ten per cent. off Irish tobacco that there should be a reduction of 1d. an ounce.  Some Deputies who are opposed to this matter are non-smokers. Their attitude is similar to that taken up yesterday by other Deputies in connection with the liquor question.  The non-drinkers objected to any reduction in the duty on spirits, and it is the same to-day as regards tobacco with the non-smokers.  These Deputies have never enjoyed the pleasure of a smoke, and that is why I suggest they are opposed to this reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Dáil should accept the amendment.  You have only about fifteen or twenty acres of land in the <Col N="1232" /> Saorstát under tobacco.  I think the Dáil should agree to carry out further experiments, and even if these do not succeed, the money spent on them will not be lost, because it will have gone towards providing employment for a number of people.  About twenty years ago I remember seeing men and women around Navan working in the fields in which tobacco was grown.  The industry is there still in a small way, but practically no employment is given. Last year a sum of £785,000 was paid through the labour exchanges to the unemployed.  You have approximately 87,000 people unemployed in the Saorstát. Under this amendment you are asked to do something that would provide work for the people.  I think it would be much preferable to spend money in giving employment to the people than to be paying it out to them otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise for the purpose of saying that this matter has not been treated fairly by the Minister for Finance since its inception here.  The question is viewed with seriousness by some Deputies and by tobacco growers down the country&mdash;I mean the manner in which it has been treated by the Minister for Finance since the 11th June, 1925.  On that date Deputy Mulvany raised the question in the House, and the Minister for Finance then gave an undertaking that he would appoint a Committee of the Dáil to investigate it and report to the Dáil. The Minister did nothing from that date until February last when, following a motion put down by Deputy Mulvany, he moved to set up this committee. If the Committee was tied for time in the consideration of this matter that surely was the fault of the Minister who waited until he was pressed the second and the third time, according to Deputy Mulvany, before he appointed it.  I contend that the Minister should have moved for the appointment of this Committee in November, 1925, and should not have waited until February last when he was pressed by Deputy Mulvany to carry out the undertaking that he gave to the Deputy in June, 1925.  I hold that the Minister for Finance has not treated the matter fairly, nor has he treated <Col N="1233" /> Deputy Mulvany or the House fairly. I presume that when a Minister gives a promise to a Deputy in the House he should fulfil it without undue delay. Deputy Johnson is anxious about the loss to the State if you granted a remission of the tobacco duty or gave a subsidy as it is styled by some.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind Deputy Johnson and others who argue on the same lines that if this remission of duty is not given to our Irish-grown tobacco, the net result will be that the industry will have to close down altogether.  I can state that because I know the conditions under which tobacco growers in my constituency are working for the last couple of years.  If the industry has to close down, and the people who are producing tobacco are obliged to cease doing so, what, I ask, will be the loss to the revenues of the State compared with the amount of the remission that the Minister is asked to give?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to make a few remarks before the debate closes.  I was a member of the Committee that investigated the question.  There are one or two points I wish to bring out about the quality of tobacco that I do not think were touched upon very freely by previous speakers.  The Minister dwelt rather severely on the quality of Irish tobacco.  As regards the manufacturers, I believe myself that they boycotted this inquiry.  That was the estimate I made of their attitude.  One manufacturer who did attend before the Committee did not impress me.  His attitude as a manufacturer was quite different to what it was some years ago. <Col N="1234" /> when he was a grower of Irish tobacco himself and also a manufacturer.  He then bought in one year all the Irish crop in order to have a monopoly of it, and to put it before the public as Irish. He sought to buy the crop a second year, but better prices were offered by other manufacturers, and when this manufacturer could not get the whole crop he took none of it.  That was the attitude of this manufacturer who now ridicules Irish leaf and who said before the Committee that more than ten per cent. of Irish leaf could not be put into manufactured tobacco, whereas some few years ago he put over fifty per cent. of it into manufactured tobacco himself.</P>
      <P>As regards cultivating a taste for Irish tobacco, I know something of that, and I believe that if it were put on the market at a somewhat lower price, a taste for it could be developed.  In my own county, the people who assisted when we were making the hogsheads ready for market started without any taste for Irish-grown tobacco.  In the long run, we were hard pressed to keep the tobacco from being filched.  Nothing else was smoked by the people there, and the revenue people had much to do to protect their own interests and our interests.  I sold the Irish-grown leaf alongside that of Western America to one of the largest manufacturers then in Ireland, the northern counties included.  The manufacturer, the Department's expert, and myself attended for the sale and sampling of the crop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manufacturer put the Irish-grown leaf alongside the Western American tobacco and the Department's expert, who came from one of the chief tobacco growing States of North America, said that he really could not distinguish any difference between our first quality tobacco and the American first quality.  The difference in price to that manufacturer was only a farthing per lb. at that time, which was pre-war.  Deputy Johnson made one statement with which I do not agree.  It was as regards the cost per acre.  I do not know what years he took his figures for.  I think the Departmental figures for pre-war days do not agree with those given by Deputy Johnson.  We were allowed <Col N="1235" /> only £25 per acre for the growing of tobacco and it was the increased cost of labour during the war and after the war that killed the growing of tobacco in our district.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures I quoted are taken from the tables in the report on tobacco growing in Ireland, showing details of the cost of growing and rehandling per acre and per lb., the yield of saleable tobacco per acre in respect of heavy dark pipe tobacco grown by Mr. B. Anderson, a representative small scale grower, selected to keep accounts, and rehandled by Sir Nugent Everard. The tables are for 1921, 1922, 1923 and 1924.  I have simply deducted the charge for artificial manures, rents, taxes and insurance.  I allowed the whole of the rest to be considered the labour cost.  The total figure is £35 gross for the year 1924, including £6 for manure and rents, taxes and insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDoyle" hpid="Mr. M. DOYLE Mr. M. DOYLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought an acre of tobacco could not be grown at those prices at that time.  I was dealing with the question of quality.  The largest buyer then in Ireland, who is now in Northern Ireland, said that there was practically very little difference in our first quality leaf and the American leaf.  As regards improving the land, a tobacco crop must necessarily improve the land.  It makes it fit for any corn crop, because it requires very heavy manuring to grow a full crop of tobacco.  It necessitates a very large outlay in artificial and farmyard manures and there is no question whatever that it fits the land for any crop one desires to grow. Wheat, for instance, would be a very suitable crop to follow tobacco.  It would stand up better than some other corn crops that might be sown.  I think tobacco-growing should get some further time and that this amendment should be agreed to.  The Minister took rather hasty steps in condemning the experiment.  Anybody could put up the case made by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.  I am convinced that the Minister for Finance would be justified in giving a further trial to this experiment and I think he should accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that this amendment has fallen into the hands of three of the most notorious non-smokers in the Dáil&mdash;the Minister for Finance, Deputy Gorey and Deputy Johnson.  Since this has happened, I cannot expect justice, not to mention mercy.  One feature of the speech of the Minister for Finance deserves to be noticed.  He referred all the time to the manufacturers.  The manufacturers told him this and told him that but these manufacturers never took the trouble to inform the Committee of their views.  They never came publicly before the Committee.  As this is apparently the final stage of this question, I might as well inform the House that manufacturers did send secret communications to the Committee recommending a reduction of the Excise duty; but they had not the courage to come before the Committee.  That was because they were simply in the hands of the British Imperial Tobacco Company and would not dare make such a recommendation in public.  It is only right that I should inform the House that that is the fact.</P>

    <P>Deputy Gorey expressed doubts about this amendment.  He said he had not got sufficient information.  That was the difficulty of the Committee.  That is the difficulty to-day in deciding whether this experiment should be continued or not.  The question should be thrashed out thoroughly and I think it is unfair to condemn the experiment before full investigation.  It is specifically stated in the Report of the Committee that they make their recommendation as a provisional measure in order to save the tobacco growing industry from extinction.  The Committee also state that they &ldquo;strongly urge that the present condition of tobacco growing should be investigated by a committee having wider terms of reference which could enter into the whole question of developing the industry in relation to both the Irish and British markets.&rdquo;  We have not investigated the matter fully and I think the Minister has got a guilty conscience because of that.  Both Ministers know that this experiment has not been given a fair trial, and has not been fairly investigated in all its aspects.  It has been <Col N="1237" /> condemned before the whole case has been put before the Dáil and before the country.  Deputy Johnson was gravely mistaken in thinking that this has to do with the position of Irish tobacco in English markets or with the difficulty that has arisen on account of the introduction into the British markets of tobacco produced by coolie labour.  This amendment refers only to the Excise duty.  We are not referring in any way in this amendment to assistance to Irish tobacco in British markets.  British Empire tobacco in this country has no preference, and, therefore, the question of coolie labour does not arise under this amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson asked if there was any chance of this experiment producing results within a reasonable period. What is a reasonable period?  That is, of course, a matter of opinion.  In other countries forty years elapsed before satisfactory results were produced. What is a satisfactory result?  It is, I think, a constantly-improving result. Tobacco growing in America has been marked by centuries of slow growth and improvement.  In Ireland the improvement has been enormous during the past twenty years.  It has been much slower than it would have been had it been run properly&mdash;had there been an incentive to farmers to improve their tobacco, instead of simply having a fixed grant per acre which, of course, tends to deterioration.  But this is a question of years, and it is a question of continuous improvement.  It is a question of decision whether this experiment is to be carried out or not.  If it is to be carried out, it ought to be carried out properly.  The belief of the Committee was that this was a valuable crop, a crop which had possibilities and which succeeded before in this country.</P>
    <P>It would be, therefore, unfair definitely to condemn this experiment without investigating all the circumstances. The Minister for Lands and Agriculture was entirely mistaken in suggesting that we came here to propose the setting up of a tobacco industry as a commercial proposition by this method.  The Minister for Finance suggested that the whole suggestion was ridiculous and that we were asking <Col N="1238" /> an immense subsidy per acre.  In other words, he suggested that not only the members who have spoken here tonight but also Deputies Beamish, Egan and the Chairman of the Government Party were idiots.  According to the Minister, everybody responsible for this recommendation called for the same condemnation.  They have, according to the Minister, put up irresponsible proposals to subside an uneconomic crop to the extent of £125 to £250 per acre.  That is the suggestion of the Ministers and that is the accusation which the Ministers have brought against Deputies Egan, Beamish and Sears.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Lands and Agriculture declares that this experiment has failed.  What experiment has failed?  Was the experiment&mdash;whatever it was&mdash;conducted properly?  There was an experiment in the growing of tobacco in the United Kingdom.  That experiment, as everybody admits, was badly conducted. Conducted in that manner, it was bound to fail.  There has been no experiment in the development of tobacco growing in the Irish Free State and, therefore, it cannot have failed.  These are the main points that I desire to bring out.</P>
      <P>I must insist, if only for the sake of form, that the Dáil should vote on this matter.  It will be voting substantially on the report of its own Committee. I must insist on pressing this amendment. It will be the first occasion, as far as I know, on which the Dáil will have rejected reports unanimously arrived at by a Committee representing all sections of the House.  The report was first rejected by the Minister for Finance without consulting his experts or the experts of the Department of Agriculture.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture states that the experiment has failed.  I doubt if in saying so he represents the opinion of the experts in his Department.</P>

Tipperary; that his parents were in receipt of £1 per week from him before he joined the National Army; that they were almost entirely dependent on him for their support, and if he will state what steps, if any, were taken to grant them reasonable compensation for the loss sustained through the death of their son.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the circumstances in which Private O'Haire met his death.  A claim under the Army Pensions Act, 1923, was received from his mother.  Investigations disclosed the fact that she had not been wholly dependent on her deceased son.  A pension could not therefore be granted to her.  She was, however, awarded a gratuity of £100, which is the maximum admissible under the Act.</P>
