    <Title>Urban Renewal Bill, 1986: Committee Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This section states that the measure will be known as the Urban Renewal Act, 1986.  I question the validity of the description in view of the very limited nature of the Bill.  A later amendment to the title reads:</P>
      <P>Bodies to be known as the Custom House Docks Development Authority and the Dublin Walled City Development Authority, respectively and to enable other bodies to be established. To assign to the bodies established by or under this Act their functions.</P>
      <P>We want to make sure that this very limited Bill will have the possibility of extending into other areas that require special treatment and attention, as does the Custom House Docks site.  I purposely put down the amendment with regard to the old walled city and the amendment has the potential for the development authorities at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that will arise on amendment No. 3.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 2 to 5, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with designated areas.  The Bill as it stands is too limited in scope because it is limited to the Custom House Docks area and any other area in relation to which an order under subsection (2) is in force.  Following a change in the title we should be <Col N="277" /> taking the opportunity to designate a part of the County Borough of Dublin bounded by a line commencing at a point near Grattan Bridge which intersects the River Liffey Valley, in other words, taking in the old walled city of Dublin. This should be a designated area and we should have the possibility of establishing a development authority for this area.</P>
      <P>Section 6 merely gives the Minister power to designate and use a development authority in the case of the Custom House Docks area, but he has no authority to appoint development authorities for any other area in the country.  We consider this to be a very shortsighted approach.  As well as the Custom House Docks site, we want other areas to be designated and power to be taken to establish urban authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may give an example of the old walled city of Dublin.  This area commences at the point where Grattan Bridge intersects the River Liffey; then continuing in a southerly direction along Grattan Bridge and Parliament Street to the point at which Parliament Street joins Cork Hill and Dame Street; then continuing in an easterly direction along Dame Street to the point where it joins Palace Street; then continuing in a southerly direction along Palace Street and the imaginary southerly projection of Palace Street to the point at which such projection intersects the imaginary easterly projection of Ship Street Little; then continuing, initially in a westerly direction, along the last-mentioned imaginary projection and Ship Street Little to the point where Ship Street Little joins Werburgh Street and Bride Street; then continuing in a southerly direction along Bride Street to the point where it joins Bride Road; then continuing in a westerly direction along Bride Road to the point where it joins Nicholas Street and Patrick Street; then continuing in a northerly direction along Nicholas Street to the point where it joins St. Nicholas Place; then continuing in a westerly direction along St. Nicholas Place to the point where it joins John Dillon Street; then continuing in a northwesterly direction along John Dillon Street and Lamb Alley to the point where <Col N="278" /> Lamb Alley joins Cornmarket; then continuing in a south-westerly direction along Cornmarket to the point where it joins St. Augustine Street and Thomas Street; then continuing, initially in a north-westerly direction, along St. Augustine Street and the imaginary northerly projection of St. Augustine Street to the point where such projection intersects the River Liffey; and finally continuing, initially in a south-easterly direction, along the River Liffey to the point first-mentioned.</P>
    <P>That is the old walled city of Dublin, the Liberties.  Places like the Cornmarket, Lamb Alley, St. Nicholas Place, Patrick Street, Ship Street Little, Werburgh Street and Bride Street are synonymous with old Dublin.</P>
    <P>If there is one area that is crying out for the very special spotlight treatment of an urban development authority, this is it.  There is great potential for the development of the old walled city into a region of small shopping arcades, art galleries, small restaurants and so on.  This area is designated in the Bill but not with the opportunity of an urban development authority.  In my view the Minister should take this opportunity to establish a development authority for this area.  I ask him for a response to the points I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Burke charged that this is a limited Bill, but this is a very broad Bill encompassing all our cities.  Nothing like this legislation has been introduced before.  Although vague promises were made, nothing actually happened.</P>
      <P>Most of the walled city is within the designated area of the quays and most of the remainder is in the hands of the local authority or the State.  By and large, the question of dereliction in this area has been well taken care of in this Bill.  We have not set up a specific authority to deal with this.  We believe 27 acres is a very large site and no development of that nature has taken place before, particularly in an inner city area, and it was the Government's view that this area required a special authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> We felt the planning authority, the local authority, in the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford, were the competent people to know their own areas.  We believe they are best able to look after their own areas.  In the walled city of Dublin the local authority have carried out a substantial amount of work &mdash; there is a lovely park at St. Audeon's and they refurbished the wall. A substantial portion of the walled city is within the designated area and, given the types of incentives that are there, I see great potential for development taking place.  While I am not opposed to the setting up of authorities &mdash; we are setting one up here and I am not averse to considering particular authorities for one thing or another if I feel they are required &mdash; given that we have taken most of this walled site that the Deputy is talking about within the designated area, the Dublin area, that meets the need as I see it.  I am quite happy that what we are doing here will meet the Deputy's wishes. I understand the case he is making.  He is concerned for the walled city but it is taken on board generally within the designated area and being handled by the local authority who are the planning authority for that area.  They are competent and have the ability and expertise to plan and to do a good job.</P>

      <P>Let the Chair direct the attention of the House to amendments Nos. 3, 18 and 19 which will be taken together.  It would appear that that will be a more appropriate time for the discussion which is now taking place. These three amendments are in the name of Deputy Ray Burke.  They are fairly elaborate and I am suggesting that the argument being put forward now could be reserved until we come to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I think you will find what I have to say is within that context. I regard it as a lost opportunity not to be addressing ourselves to the situation before the House.  There is no point whatever in running away from the realism that our capital city is at present under serious threat to the point that the <Col N="281" /> destruction in vast areas cannot be repaired without the necessary archaeological investigation taking place at the same time.  This is so important that it would be impractical to lay before the House, even within this Bill, an appropriate objection to the lack of co-ordinated effort at present.  This city, the Minister will agree, needs a city archaeologist. That call has been made by this side of the House for many years now, yet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>This affords the Minister an ideal opportunity to make such an appointment.  The mediaeval core of our capital city is very rich in archaeological treasure.  A Bill before the Seanad at present relating to the use of amateur archaeological aids like metal detectors and so on indicates a deplorable lack of co-ordination in trying to come to grips with this problem in our capital city.  The Urban Renewal Bill is an ideal focus for trying to repair the awsome damage that has been done to the city.  The Minister may decide that the local authorities have the expertise and we can leave it to them, but that is not right or proper.  I know the Minister does not intend in any way to mislead the House.  He has a sincere commitment to this, but we must address ourselves to the facts.</P>
      <P>We have not had a city architect in Dublin since 1965, 21 years ago.  How can this city be planned and how can people profess themselves to be experts in city planning, renewal or development without even a city architect?  An eminent expert from America who is at present surveying and looking over the city cannot understand it.  We are moving against trends in other European cities where effort is being put into repairing damage rather than just compounding it, as we are by massive road widenings right through the ancient part of our city.  We should not allow this opportunity to pass without making a very strong protest to the Minister in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With due respect to the Minister, the experts he is speaking about are just not <Col N="282" /> there.  We have had such a degree of bureaucratic vandalism right across from Wood Quay that people have lost confidence in the commitment of officials whom he has named to produce this urban renewal activity he spoke about.  My colleague, Deputy Ray Burke, very carefully pinpointed this whole subject which must be regarded as special at this stage in the development of our city.</P>
    <P>I suppose in a way it is dreadful to say that the recession has been a mixed blessing in one sense.  The lack of building activity has afforded an opportunity to do a survey of what is left of the mediaeval core of Dublin and then to address ourselves to the problem of rectifying damage with the appointment of key personnel who we lack within the city.  We have no city architect or city archaeologist in key positions in Dublin.  Compare Dublin with cities such as York where these appointments hold.  The matter is spinning like a top at the moment and anyone who goes to planning meetings soon realises that it is a question of vested interests pulling against each other, rather than addressing ourselves to the betterment of our city and its protection for future generations and improvements rather than pulling down buildings all the time.  Very serious mistakes have been made by our local authorities.</P>
    <P>Unless corrective action is taken now, it is axiomatic that there will be continuing mistakes, compounded as a direct result of not putting people in who are sympathetic to the motive of the Bill, which is to renew the inner city.  I know about the Custom House site but that is only a small part of it.  The central core, as Deputy Burke said, is the medieval walled city of Dublin.  Anyone who is familiar with it will see that building is going on there at present with vast areas needing archaeological investigation.  Is the Minister aware that developers knock down buildings and redevelop without calling in authorities to see if there is a possibility that part of the city wall might be buried there?  They do not and in the past, regrettably, the archaeologist was looked on as someone who impeded the <Col N="283" /> progress of development of buildings and so on.  That should not be the prevailing spirit in relation to our ancient capital city.  It is happening because we do not consult the experts.  The Minister should appoint an architect to plan our city properly and there should also be an archaeologist employed on a permanent basis instead of employing them piecemeal through the National Museum and so on.</P>
    <P>Sincere people like Friends of Medieval Dublin or personnel in An Taisce constantly come up against bureaucracy. I am sure that the Minister has attended seminars, as I have, on the preservation of the city and building it from its inner core.  Given the amount of waste and the old buildings that can be refurbished and protected, this is our last opportunity to ensure that the capital city will not be lost forever.  We will have a mid-Atlantic type city to which nobody will relate and we will be hankering for &ldquo;Dublin in the rare old times&rdquo; without commiting ourselves to doing something about it now.  Many children who are taught civics at school are very conscious of the fact that the city is being vandalised because building is done on a piecemeal basis.  I urge the Minister to take a strong stand in regard to this matter and to examine the points which my colleague made.  He should make the key appointments to which I referred because a whole range of archaeologists are coming out of UCD and Trinity College who would be willing to do excavation work on a voluntary basis. That would show we are serious in our efforts to ensure that there is not another Wood Quay debacle.  However, the Minister knows it will happen unless he takes a firm stand in the matter.</P>
    <P>Yesterday at a seminar in Dublin Castle the subject we are speaking about was focused on.  I welcome the Bill in its broad outline.  It is very important legislation.  We should not gloss over it but take the necessary steps now to preserve our city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 6 (2) I would like to express concern about the fact that Dundalk and Drogheda have not been <Col N="284" /> earmarked for assistance under this legislation. Over the last four or five years County Louth has suffered more economic deprivation than any other county.  Dundalk has suffered because of its proximity to the Border, and the great fluctuation in trade and commerce in the area has effectively meant that urban decay has set in in Dundalk and Drogheda because of the irregular cash flow which businesses in those towns have had to endure.  For three months of the year the balance of trade favours Dundalk but for the other nine months it favours Newry, Banbridge and other towns north of the Border.  This has devastated business in Drogheda, Dundalk and smaller towns and villages in the Border area generally.  The effect of this great variation in trade and commerce can be seen in the unemployment statistics for County Louth, which show in excess of 8,000 people unemployed, and all the indications are that the figure is spiralling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is an ideal opportunity for the Government to recognise the special problems which exist in towns like Dundalk and Drogheda and to earmark them for special aid under the Bill.  They should provide a package which will rejuvenate these towns.  Commercial and industrial firms are boarded up in these towns and have fallen into a state of dereliction which is a terrible reflection on the Government's economic policies. Such policies are pursued because there is a single minded commitment to ensuring that certain levels of taxation must apply because they need finance to meet the ongoing demands for capital and current expenditure.  However, that policy will leave towns like Dundalk and Drogheda in a state of advanced decay, socially and economically.  I appeal to the Minister to take this opportunity to recognise the problems which exist in Dundalk and Drogheda and to include them in the areas which have been marked for special designation.  Such a move would be much appreciated in the towns concerned and could provide a platform for their economies to take off again.  Will the Minister seriously consider including the towns of <Col N="285" /> Drogheda and Dundalk for special designation?</P>

      <P>I agree with many of the points made in regard to the old city of Dublin.  However, we must ask what the purpose of this Bill is and what it will do.  Perhaps there should be a separate authority for different areas.  Basically I am very worried about the whole concept of separate authority in this Bill and its effect on the concept of democracy. The local authority for the city of Dublin is simply wiped out.  Dublin Corporation spent a few years discussing this site at Custom House Docks and had many plans for it, but the Government just make their own decision, totally disregarding Dublin Corporation.  Maybe it is a good thing, but the whole principle of democracy is being eroded.  Maybe the dictatorial principle will get things done more efficiently, and that is the Minister's argument for this.  He has to consult with Dublin Corporation but he does not have to get their consent.  Dictatorships are in many cases more efficient; but they are doing what the dictator wants, not what the people want.  That is precisely what is happening in this Bill.  It is concerned with what the Minister wants done, not about the wishes of the people of Dublin.</P>
      <P>The beginning of this is to wipe out the working class people from the inner city and put in a <i>nouveau riche</i> type with their marinas and boats, following the line of what has been done in London.  That is the purpose of this and it worries me exceedingly.  The headquarters of the Garda Síochána are to be in the same area to ensure that these people are protected from the marauders on the outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 2 the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by order declare an area to be a designated area.  There is no reference whatever to the local authority, to the councillors elected every five years to Dublin City Council.  These city councillors are seen as a bit of a menace.  The same attitude is adopted towards councillors in the country who are seen to be causing problems.  Without them, the <Col N="286" /> managers could do a very good job. There may be problems with political pushing and pulling, but that is what democracy is all about.  Do we want democracy or do we want dictatorship? We have to decide.  Local councils are elected by local people; and, if they do not do the job for which they were elected, they will not be successful in the next election.  Many councillors were not re-elected last year.  That is what the system is about.  They have to do what the people want done, whether the Minister likes it or not.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now to have the power to designate any area he decides in any part of the country, without consulting the local authority.  The local authority might well wish to have a particular area designated for the purposes of tax incentives and so on; but the Minister will make the decision, not the local authority, as to what area should be designated. Perhaps business and political lobbyists will be able to bring pressure on the Minister to give them tax incentives for an area they intend to develop anyway.  If they had incentives for the development of the Dublin 4 area, would they not make a mint?  We do not want the Minister making decisions at the behest of pressure groups who are seeking to line their own pockets.  That is why the local authority should have some say, but they are not even referred to in this section.  The only consent the Minister needs is that of the Minister for Finance. He can make any order he decides.</P>
    <P>I omitted to ask the Minister to explain what section 4 is all about.  There may be implications in it which we do not see.  I would ask the Minister when replying on this section to explain the meaning of section 4.  The Minister may make an order without any consultation and then amend that order.  There is reference to consultation with another Minister of Government, but I do not know which Minister that is or the circumstances in which he would be consulted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady talked about the importance of the city architect.  His could be a very important role, but as far as the city of Dublin is concerned the city architect <Col N="287" /> has very little role to play because of the planning laws.  All he can tell a planner or developer who is knocking down a whole street is that the new building must be so many feet back from the road and must not exceed a certain height.  He has no say about the type of architectural frontage of the new building.  Architects can put up buildings of concrete and glass and all sorts of messes, as they have done around St. Stephen's Green.  The city architect mainly helps to design local authority housing, which is very well done.  As regards the planning and designing of the city, it is architects in general who make these decisions.  A visiting architect has been criticising Dublin Corporation for the dereliction in the city and many such criticisms can be made.  He has not, however, referred to the architects and the monstrosities they have erected all over this city, as well as the developers who made the decisions to knock down existing buildings.  He did not refer to the situation in St. Stephen's Green, in which Dublin Corporation had no hand, act or part.  The Gallagher Group, who put £30 million down the drain, had something to do with it.  The same situation existed in Earlsfort Terrace for years.  I do not know whether this Bill can correct any of those things. The Minister may, however, make orders without reference to the local authority.</P>

      <P>I referred to it in passing in order to ask the Minister to explain it.  I am talking now about section 6 (2).  The whole Bill represents an erosion of the powers of local authorities. The Minister should consult with the local authority and get their agreement and approval designating any area.  There is an attitude of mind growing within the Department of the Environment that they should carry out the job because they are providing the money.  Local democracy is becoming a joke.  People <Col N="288" /> are being elected who have no power over anything.  The Minister's attitude is evident throughout this Bill.  He does not even think that there are elected local authorities who should have some say in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the case made by my colleague, Deputy Kirk, with regard to Dundalk and Drogheda.  I am very familiar with the town of Drogheda.  The connections between that town and the area I live in and represent &mdash; Fingal &mdash; are very close.  Even our local paper comes from Drogheda and there is a special edition for the north county area.  I fully support the case made by Deputy Kirk that if one town or district should be designated, the town of Drogheda is ideal.  It is an historic area. Just as in Dublin some of the walls and some of the gates are left.  The town goes right back into our history.  There was the famous Cromwellian attack on Drogheda and the massacre of the people.  It is an ideal area for designation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla questioned the thrust of this Bill.  I fully support it and do not find that it is anti-democratic.  It supports the whole democratic procedure by giving extra powers to get jobs done which cannot be done using the present machinery and planning laws.  We should take the opportunity to designate more areas and appoint more authorities.  My only complaint with the Bill is that it does not go far enough.  The Minister is tying his own hands in not allowing himself the opportunity to appoint more authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla made many points in regard to developers and planners.  But it is not only in the private sector that such things are happening.  Many of the areas that are suffering the worst dereliction are in public ownership.  There was a classic example only this week when the Minister himself signed a CPO to put forward a road plan which will dramatically affect the area of the walled city of Dublin and St. Patrick's Cathedral.  In the light of the ring road and the southern cross route that have now been approved by the Government I question whether we need such a major cross-city route as <Col N="289" /> proposed and sanctioned by the Minister. There is a classic example of public authorities proposing things that will damage the core of the city.</P>
    <P>In section 6 (2) it is provided that the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, declare an area to be a designated area.  If an area needs rejuvenation, regeneration, reconstruction, redesigning or replanning, it needs that.  It does not need the dead hand of the Minister for Finance.  It will be self-evident that it needs all these things.  It should not be written into the Bill that the Minister for Finance should have to approve it.  Within Government structures here, if an order is to be made, or if a Minister intends to make any proposition, he goes to his Cabinet and discusses it with them and secures their agreement. It should not be necessary to write it into the Bill that he has to get approval from the Minister for Finance.  Putting financial constraints on what is necessary from a planning point of view is doing things the wrong way around.</P>

      <P>Ar an Dara Céim den Bhille seo, chuir mé fáilte roimhe agus dúirt mé go mbeadh iarracht á dhéanamh agam ar chuid seo den reachtaíocht a athrú ar Chéim an Choiste.</P>
      <P>In regard to the designation in the Cork area, I may be repeating what I said on Second Stage.  I welcome the thrust of the Bill.  The revitalisation of the inner cities is welcome.  Anything that helps to put life and heart and soul back into our inner cities is very welcome.  The Bill acknowledges what it would cost to refurbish and rejuvenate old buildings.  It has been found much easier and less expensive to carry out green field development. To that extent the Bill is realistic and, like the other speakers I welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The designation of the 80 or so acres in the Cork area is welcome.  But I cannot understand the leap-frogging over the Watercourse Road/Gerald Griffin Street area.  I indicated on the Second Stage that I hoped the Minister would acknowledge the effort that has been made to refurbish the old Cork Distillery site on the Watercourse Road encompassing 17 <Col N="290" /> acres.  The downward trend in employment and economic wellbeing in Cork is world renowned.  There have been closures of traditional industries together with closing off the supporting industries that went with those.  Yet the Watercourse Road Industrial Estate has been an example of the self-aid we are hearing so much about.  I fail to understand why the Department have not recognised that and included the old distillery area of old buildings as an encouragement to what has already been done out there.  It contains 17 acres of industrial land on which there are old derelict buildings, some of which have been refurbished.</P>
    <P>Up to £1 million has been spent on that area and the return on investment has declined.  The cost of refurbishing old buildings has become more and more uneconomical, especially in view of the recession experienced in Cork.  The remaining buildings are in such a dilapidated condition that they could not be developed or rebuilt without the aid of a scheme such as the urban renewal scheme.  People could set out to do this development work at a cost of £500,000 approximately within the next few years. That is just what we need in Cork.  I have to keep reminding the Minister of the need to acknowledge the efforts which are being and have been made by local people in this decimated area of our city. If this were included in the designated area, the 1,500 people employed would be trebled in number.  It would become the largest employment centre in the north city Blackpool area, which has a tradition of a labour market, with skills available which could be utilised in this way.  One can easily imagine the benefit to the Blackpool area and inner Cork city which have suffered so much in recent years.</P>
    <P>If development of the site could be furthered in this way it would give an example and an impetus to areas where similar developments could be undertaken. This industrial area has not received or asked for any grants or assistance from Government or local authority. They are not looking for a grant <Col N="291" /> now for this industrial estate.  The purpose of this Bill was to correct dereliction in Cork city and other towns and cities throughout the country and at the same time create jobs in the building industry, which are very badly needed, and other productive employment.  There is no excuse for excluding the Watercourse Road Industrial Estate which has become the cradle for 40 new small business enterprises.  In the light of the amount of State aid available through agencies such as the IDA, the least that would be expected would be an acknowledgment that an effort is being made and encouragement given by enlarging the area of the Blackpool section, as mentioned in the Finance Act, part IV of which sets out the designated areas.  The Cork area designated is too limited for the practical purposes of urban renewal or development and the creation of employment. Why leapfrog over the area which would profit by being revitalised?  I am sure I have the support of the Minister of State at the Department, who also represents that area.  Perhaps later he will show his support in his contribution.</P>
    <P>There is another derelict set of buildings across the road from the Watercourse Road area, the old Denny factory and efforts have been made to deal with the dereliction.  The area already designated should be linked up as far as the centre of Shandon Street with the Watercourse Road and Gerald Griffin Street and out to the area at Commons Road and Dublin Street.  That is all I am asking and it is not a lot.  The Government should at least examine this idea.  I am quite sure that they will be satisfied that that area would benefit by being included in the designated area, with the aid of the strategy and structures and commitment of the Urban Renewal Bill.  Otherwise, the Bill will not have the effect for which we all wish.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents a hope for the renewal of inner cities and towns.  The buildings are falling down; but people would be prepared, with a little encouragement, to revitalise them.  Under the <Col N="292" /> terms of the Bill, section 6 (2) the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, for the purposes of this section, declare an area to be a designated area where he is satisfied that there is a special need to promote urban renewal therein and may by such order describe such area in whatever manner he thinks fit.  I am quite confident that the criteria laid down in that subsection will be met.  It will be one of the easiest functions of the Minister to be satisfied that what we are saying about the whole industrial area, mixed with some residential locations, would be following the thrust of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brady talked in particular about archaeological problems and fears that further damage would be done in the areas that he mentioned. We are all concerned that that should be done.  I wish to inform the House that Dublin Corporation have asked the Friends of Mediaeval Dublin to make a submission regarding the old city area so that the corporation can take this into account when making the development plan by attaching the appropriate conditions to any planning permissions given in that area.  It is important to say that the local planning authority are aware of the problems with regard to any despoiling of archaeological sites.  That should help to allay the fears there.  I reiterate again that we have included a vast area of the walled city in the designated area which will be the responsibility of the local authority in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kirk spoke about Drogheda and Dundalk.  Deputies from Kerry would talk about Tralee and Deputies from Mayo would talk about Castlebar, and rightly so.  They are looking after the best interests of their areas.  In drawing up this, first of all we looked at the three large cities, Dublin, Cork and Limerick. We then included Waterford and Galway.  We included the five county borough areas in the designated areas for the purposes of designation.  One can argue whether or not we should extend it further. Looking at the dereliction in many of our bigger cities it was important to <Col N="293" /> tackle that problem first and make these generous incentives available to these areas.  I believe it will take off.  It is not a question of turning one's back on any particular area.  We have certain obligations to the large urban areas and, in particular, to our older cities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla spoke about the lack of democracy.  He more or less accused us of being dictators.  We have to go before the people to be elected. This House makes decisions as an elected body.  There is no question of dictatorship. In all of the designated areas there was full consultation with the planning authorities.  It was their suggestions that we took on board.  If one looks at the areas we have taken on board, one will see that they are areas of dereliction. Dublin Corporation were anxious to have the quays incorporated in part of the north inner city.  We took those suggestions on board.  That can easily be verified and checked out.  One only has to walk these areas to see the kind of dereliction that exists.</P>

I do not want to discuss the 1982 Act because this is a totally different Bill in its approach and the type of incentives we have on offer to bring it forward quickly.  I believe it will be brought forward quickly.  The previous plan would never have got off the ground because of the type of development that was insisted upon by one Deputy in this House who called the shots.  I want to make it clear that there was full consultation in regard to all designated areas.</P>
      <P>Cork city is the largest area of the five county boroughs with reference to population.  Those areas were selected on the basis of recommendations made by officials of the local authority and as many as possible of the problem areas indentified by them were included.  We did not go around looking for every site in the area.  What was decided was to take sizeable areas in all cities and to move on them pretty quickly.  There is a three year time span on these.  If we picked sites all over the place in any of the cities there would not have been any proper core to develop.  We wanted to get it together and have it developed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 81 acres designated in Cork city.  I wrote to the Cork officials in April asking them to appoint an officer in charge because this requires special attention as everyone will agree.  We set out a list of things that he should do.  I had to write another letter asking what is happening.  If everybody rolled up their sleeves and worked at promoting the idea there would be positive improvements in Cork and other areas.  Let us get started on the areas that have been designated and see how the scheme operates in them.  After the scheme has been in operation for a while we may have to have another look at the terms of it, but for the moment we should wait to get the response of local authorities. It is only fair to remark that the response of some local authorities was excellent and that they have their action plans drawn up.</P>
      <P>The incentives for development are very generous.  In areas in Cork there will be a 100 per cent write-off for commercial development, a ten year rate relief and a very generous double rental allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>We are aware of those incentives.  There is no problem about them.  The problem is in regard to the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It behoves the local authority to get things moving rapidly. Leap frogging was mentioned, but I should like to point out that local authority officials in Cork made a strong case for that.  I did not make any case for it. Indeed, the Watercourse Road development was well down on the list of priorities. In making our selections we did not want developments dispersed all over the place, leaving the bad teeth.  As expected, we received representations from people whose property runs adjacent to the designated areas, but we will have such problems no matter where the line is drawn.  Our scheme was prepared in full consultation with and with the agreement of the authorities concerned. It is a matter for the authorities to get the development underway.  They should give all developers the proper advice and <Col N="296" /> encouragement to get them working in the areas concerned.  If we succeed in doing that we will have moved a good distance down the road towards eradicating a lot of the derelict sites we have in our old cities.  That is our main concern in this.</P>
      <P>The experience in other countries has been that when development work commenced adjacent areas prospered.  It is important that we should concentrate our work in specific areas.  Work along the quays in Dublin is long overdue.  The line drawn along the quays for such development will remain.  I hope that when development takes place there that adjoining areas will benefit.  The development of the Port and Docks site will improve the north side of the city.  If we can attract some prestigious development there I have no doubt that others will follow and set up business.  It is my hope that something similar will happen in Cork.  I have no doubt that once such areas are developed and become alive entrepreneurs will move in.  I am confident that the schemes will work because the incentives are generous.  Developers can build in such areas happy in the knowledge that they will have a package to sell to prospective tenants.  Those setting up a business in those areas will be rent free for ten years.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke asked why the Minister for Finance was mentioned in the Bill. The reason is that if further designation is required it will be necessary to amend the Finance Act.  The Minister for Finance has an important role to play in this. If tax incentives are to be extended to other areas, it will be a matter for the Minister for Finance to put through the appropriate legislation.  The only relief the Department of the Environment can give is in regard to rates.</P>

      <P>I am a little disappointed at the response of the Minister.  It is no harm to remind him that we are all at one in regard to the objectives of the Bill. Will the Minister give me an undertaking that he will at least look at the area I <Col N="297" /> mentioned?  He referred on many occasions to what officials at local level indicated to him and said that the area mentioned by me was down their priority list.  The Minister said he wanted to keep the designated areas close to each other, but how can he agree to leap frog from an area designated in Cork city over a huge area?  Even the school children in the Public Gallery will accept that that is not a wise move.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I will let the Minister in on some information that he may not be aware of&mdash;I missed the boat in trying to become a member of Cork Corporation. The election was held last June.  I am a member of the county council; but, as a Deputy, I represent that area.  I was born and reared in the area and can recall running around it in my bare feet. Members of the corporation or local officials cannot tell me anything about any stone in the Blackpool area.  All I asked the Minister for was a commitment to examine the area or to get officials of Cork Corporation to look at the area of Gerald Griffin Street, Watercourse Road, the industrial estate and the site of the old bacon factory.  People there are attempting to revitalise the area.  All we want from the Minister of State in this Bill is for him to show good faith in the people who are attempting by their actions &mdash; not by words alone, because it is easy to have words &mdash; to do what this Bill hopes to do, which is to revitalise the inner areas of the city and to reactivate the industrial areas.  I would be confident, if the Minister of State gives an undertaking to examine the position, that he cannot but be satisfied that Watercourse Road Industrial Estate, Watercourse Road and the area of the old bacon curing factory, which is surrounded on the north by O'Connell Street and on the west by Gerald Griffin Street, will be a close-knit designated area.  He should do this rather <Col N="298" /> than leapfrogging over the industrial part of that area.</P>
      <P>I could go on as to why the outer area was introduced.  I will mention in passing for the record, even though it has nothing to do with the Bill, that Douglas Shopping Centre is very relevant and was relevant at that time.  In view of the fact that the Minister would not indicate that he would have consideration given to that area it is necessary for me to give notice at this stage that I will put down an amendment on Report Stage.  I am going to test the Cork Deputies in this House to see how in earnest they are about revitalising the run down industrial area of Blackpool and, in particular, the area I have mentioned.  I refrained from putting down this amendment to that section.  I agree with the Minister of State; I am not in here for confrontation.  We accept and agree with the thrust of the Bill.  We give it our full support.  But the Minister of State would not even acknowledge the proposals and suggestions I had made other than to say that Cork officials are the cause of it &mdash; that is what he did say &mdash; and to go back to them.  There is no point in going anywhere when the Bill has gone through the House, because the Minister can say that that is the Bill, even though in section 6 (2) allowance is made for the movement I am requesting.  There should at least be an indication given that it would be looked at.  That has not been done.</P>
      <P>I repeat that I am not here for confrontation. There is no need for it.  We are all committed to giving support and total commitment to the main thrust of this Bill, which is aimed at the renewal of urban areas, within the inner cities in particular.  Such areas are falling down around us.  We have been losing employment in industrial areas, and factories are closing down.  We want to bring life back to the city.  I want to give notice that, if I cannot get an indication from the Minister of State of some way of correcting this imbalance in regard to the area of Blackpool, I will have an amendment down on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I want to make one <Col N="299" /> brief point in regard to that.  I am not going to go back over the ground again. The Deputy is aware that the Finance Bill has passed both Houses.  It was the Finance Bill which gave power for the incentives.  I am not saying that the Deputy should not put down his amendment on Report Stage but what I am saying is that an amendment on Report Stage will not change it because the designated areas are in the Schedules to the Finance Act.  They are quite clearly designed for the incentives we are talking about.</P>

      <P>I am well aware of that. I have the Finance Act with me and I mentioned it earlier on.  I also acknowledge that written into section 6 (2), which I have already read &mdash; if necessary I will read it out again, but there is no need for me to do so &mdash; is that the Minister for the Environment in consultation with the Minister for Finance may at any time make an order designating areas.  If the Minister of State is saying that that cannot be done, I would like to hear it and have it written into the record.  To me, it means that the Minister, in consultation with and with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may make an order designating areas which are not designated in this Act.</P>

      <P>Yes, that is what I said.  All we can do in this Bill by way of incentive is to give a rates incentive.  If we decided to change the areas, they would not carry the financial incentives. To reiterate what I said earlier, there are 81 acres in Cork.  I have written to the Cork officials asking them to do certain things.  When I see some intent coming from Cork I will be very satisfied.  There are 81 acres down there ready to be developed and I would like to see some action being taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke about consultation with the parties concerned when areas are being designated for change and for development.  Would the Minister address himself to the harsh reality that the system of consultation is not working and that this leads to direct confrontation?  The Minister should have provided in this Bill for a more efficient system of consultation with local people. For instance, the Clanbrassil Street development involved a road widening project &mdash; it cuts through the Minister's constituency and mine &mdash; and it was lack of consultation that led to confrontation in that area.  There may be potential damage to the old cathedral simply because there was not proper consultation.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister consider a much more efficient system of consulting local people rather than just putting notices in the newspapers, which people do not see or read?  Would it not be far more beneficial if the authorities concerned would write to the people in particular areas and consult directly with them?  We appreciate that it is necessary to put notices in the newpapers, but people living in affected localities should be consulted at first hand.  Such consultation does not occur.  Consequently, very often people write letters of protest or find it necessary to build up pressure groups nobody wants to find himself involved with.  That all occurs because of lack of consultation.</P>
      <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that very often, particularly in Dublin inner city, pressure groups are set up simply because consultation did not take place.  Would the Minister embody in the Bill a more efficient system of consultation with local people, locally and nationally?  If nothing else, it would draw attention to some of the meritorious work the Minister is trying to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to contest the Chair's decision so I will speak on the section, which deals with the remission of rates in designated areas. My purpose in putting down the amendment was to try to ensure that local authorities would not be at a loss.  A certain amount of rates are still paid in most designated areas &mdash; not much, but some.  In the normal way in Dublin the corporation would get full rates from the developers, like Irish Life.  The authorities designate the areas in which there would be rates remission but there is no reference in this section to local authorities. This may be because of an attitude of mind in the Department who apparently do not even consider that there are local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister just decides that as an incentive to development there will be rates remission.  Thereafter, it is the local authority concerned who will be at a loss, not the Department or the Minister, <Col N="304" /> because the Minister will not make up that loss to the local authority if it is not provided for in the Bill.  He has been doing that for a number of years and consequently there is less and less money for local authorities.  The Minister for the Environment tells managers they have not been doing things but, if they have not, it is because they did not have the wherewithal to do them.  This Bill puts the local authorities in the same position. Developers are told to develop and to get rid of dereliction, but the Minister should make provision in this Bill to compensate local authorities for loss of rates.  I do not understand how that will put an extra charge on revenue.  In the Bill the Minister proposes to remit rates and that will be a loss of revenue.  I am saying that remission of rates hits the local authority and they should be compensated for that loss.  Otherwise, areas will be designated through the city and elsewhere, rates and taxes will be remitted and the Government and the local authority will be at a loss.</P>
    <P>I am not against incentives.  I realise they are necessary, but there should be more than incentives.  There should be penal taxes on derelict sites to ensure that development takes place.  We must use both the stick and carrot.  I am not speaking against tax incentives or remission of rates for certain periods, but I am saying that the local authorities have not been taken into consideration.  The Minister is making the decisions all the time and is leaving them with less power and now with less money.  The Ceann Comhairle has ruled out the amendment on the basis that it constitutes a charge on revenue.  I ask the Minister to keep the amendment in mind and to take into consideration the real loss to the local authorities.  Whole areas of this and other cities could be designated by order of the Minister without consultation with them.  In another section he has power to amend an order made and in that way he can deprive local authorities of commercial rates.  I ask him to respond to that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The port and docks site has been derelict for at least 20 years. <Col N="305" /> After major development there will accrue to the local authority a tremendous rate revenue as a result of the total package of incentives.  They have a role to play in the city and they have a contribution to make.  That will be to forego the rate demand for ten years, but as a result of the total package they will get a considerable amount of revenue after ten years.  That makes good sense.  They are the authority for the area, and where they can they should make their contribution to any development.  The remission of rates for ten years is their reasonable and good contribution but in the longer term it will benefit them considerably with additional revenue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the case made by Deputy Mac Giolla.  The Minister has not answered it adequately.  He has said the local authority will receive a considerable boost to their revenue after ten years, but I ask him what happens in the ten years when they have to service the redeveloped area and when they have to provide public lighting, cleansing, water and sewerage and maintenance services as well as the other sundry services of a local authority?  The Minister conveniently took the example of the Custom House Dock site which was probably the best case from his point of view&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the other designated areas in Dublin, Galway, Cork, Limerick and Waterford?  There is a strong case to be made for compensating local authorities all of whom are currently in bad financial circumstances. Quite rightly, the Government are giving incentives to development and they should compensate local authorities from the national Exchequer.  Otherwise the local authorities will find themselves increasingly unable to service the redeveloped areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11 of the 1982 Bill provided the same incentives without any compensation to local authorities. They proposed many more commissions and statutory authorities.  What we are doing now is the correct thing.  The local authorities have a stake in the development of their areas.  I took the example of the Port and Docks site and I accept that possibly that was the best example. However, when one considers parts of the north inner city one questions the kind of revenue the corporation are getting. Even along the quays so much of that area is derelict there must be no return from it.  What we are proposing makes good monetary sense from the point of view of local authorities and they can claim they are playing a role in the development of their city by making a contribution.  It is a reasonable approach and I see no conflict here.  The local authority in Dublin have a vested interest in the development of the city and they have an obligation to make their contribution, which is by way of this kind of incentive over ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an extraordinary statement from the Minister and I am convinced he does not believe it himself.  He was a city councillor and he knows the problems of the area, which are shared by other local authorities.  The financial constraints imposed on them has meant that local authorities have less power, and everyone now accepts that fact.  They are on their knees, begging for bits and pieces to keep things running. The Minister for the Environment tells them they must clean up the litter, but neither funds nor staff are provided for the job.  Now this Minister tells us it is only right that the local authority should make their little contribution, that they have a say in the development of the city. <Col N="307" /> The only say they have is to lose money, to put in their little penny.</P>

      <P>The Minister is setting up a separate authority to deal with the site.  Dublin Corporation will be told it is their job to get the land together and to make sure that the local development plan is suitably altered to be flexible enough for development.  That is what the local authority are being asked to do. That is what the Minister is telling the local authority to do.  That is their contribution to this great development.  They will not have any say in the authority. They have no say in designating areas, which is the point we discussed in section 6.  The Minister does not even consult with them before he designates an area.</P>
      <P>Now the Minister can designate by order and he can tell the local authority that they will not get any money out of it for ten years because these people are being given rates remission.  The Minister is not making up this money for the local authority, although he did not give them any say in the designation of the area.  He says the fact that the local authority will lose money for ten years will be their contribution to this city.  He says they should continue to provide all the services for that designated area for ten years because in ten years' time they will get a great return for their investment.  But so will the Minister and the Exchequer if new jobs are created.  Why must the local authority be at the loss of this money? Even if they do provide the necessary services for this area, it will be at the expense of some other area.  There may be less public lighting in one area to give the Custom House Docks site the best service possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 6 the local authority do <Col N="308" /> not have any say in the designation of an area.  Now he has the gall to say the local authorities have a say in it.  They do not. He says they must make their contribution to this scheme by not collecting any commercial rates for ten years.  That is not acceptable.  The Minister for the Environment is becoming more of a dictator. As far as local authorities and local government are concerned, he is taking back power into his own hands and giving orders by circulars to managers.  That is how local government is run now, and that is the thinking in this Bill.  The Minister does not seem to give a thought to the fact that he should consult with the local authority because they are elected representatives. He did not think that was even necessary.  The Minister is the boss. He sends the orders to the local authorities through the managers and makes the designations, and in this section he says he will leave them short of money and that can be their contribution to the development of the area.</P>
    <P>If the local authority do not have the money they will not be able to provide the necessary services.  If the designated area is a success the local authority will have to provide better services &mdash; more water, more sewage treatment and so on. If there are more people in the city, new business, new houses and so on, the local authority must spend even more money but in this Bill the Minister is deciding to give them much less money. If this scheme goes ahead and the local authority are short of money the services they provide will be abysmal and the whole thing will be a disaster.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla is happy if nothing is happening.  We are injecting good finance into the local authority. Of course it will be long term but we have all seen these derelict sites. There was no development in certain areas and there was no remuneration from these areas for the local authorities. In this Bill we are ensuring that development will take place but Deputies are not happy.  They still whinge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authorities will benefit from this development in the longer term, despite the begrudging mentality in some quarters.  This Bill is a success because we are getting complaints and there is a certain amount of cribbing from some quarters.  I have no doubt this move will <Col N="310" /> have a tremendous impact on this city. For many years we have heard a great deal of talk about the derelict sites along the quays and now, for the first time, we are making it possible to bring forward incentives to encourage development in this area.  The local authority should play their part in this development because this is their city.  They have a role to play. They are the planning authority and they have a say in the development, planning, designing and so on of the area.  To say they have no say in what happens is far from the reality.</P>

      <P>The Minister's remarks were totally uncalled for.  He said I am happy to see derelict sites in our city.  How can anybody be happy with that?  Many reasons were given for these derelict sites, and I could put forward my own views, but a number of them are Dublin Corporation's problems.  Deputy Burke or Deputy Brady pointed to road schemes.  These schemes were forced on the corporation because Governments refused to sanction schemes such as the CIE rapid transit system, a short range, six miles or less, underground system which would connect all the rapid transit systems and could reduce the number of cars in the city, thereby lessening the need for road schemes.  The ring road scheme should also lessen it, etc.  However, undoubtedly the corporation road schemes are a dereliction problem; and on one side of the quays they are a problem because the corporation want to step back and that is causing quite an amount of the dereliction there.  I have taken part in many of the discussions and arguments about this, the need for it and so on; but it is there now.  They are not solely responsible for the other side because most of the dereliction there is not as a result of corporation problems or planning.  We want to see it developed. As I have pointed out on a number of occasions on this Bill, I agree with the tax incentives and so on, but there should also be a bit of stick to pressure them, and that should bring in some revenue. A derelict sites tax system would ensure that the people concerned would develop <Col N="311" /> their sites, or at least sell them off to somebody else so that the sites could be amalgamated and be ready for this type of development the Minister is talking about.</P>
      <P>In this section we are discussing a simple matter of enabling the local authority to continue their job and not to erode their powers further.  There is considerable erosion of the powers of local authorities in this Bill, and the Minister's attitude is clear throughout.  He does not even think of the problems of local authorities.  I emphasise to him the need for the Exchequer rather than the local authority to take the burden of the remission of rates.  In that way the local authority would be in a far better position to push development.  The corporation will have no incentive to promote new developments, if they are to get nothing out of them and are, indeed, at a loss as a result. There is nothing to increase revenue for the local authority in the new development areas when they will need increasing revenue.  If the Minister was prepared to ensure that local authorities would be at no loss as a result of the passing of this Bill, then I would be quite happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no reason why the corporation or any of the local authorities concerned should be at a loss as a result of the Bill. The Minister should give the incentives. He is in consultation with the Government, and the Minister for Finance and knows the state of the revenue and the Exchequer.  The Minister should take the loss, if there is a loss.  The Minister will get the gain in ten years time as well. There is no reason why the Minister should not look forward to the great gains in ten years' time for recoupment to the Exchequer, but let the local authority not be at the loss for that period.  I ask the Minister to consider the problems that local authorities will have over those ten years and to see if on Report Stage a suitable form of wording can be got into either this section or some other section of the Bill to ensure that a particular local authority would not be at a loss of revenue in view of this.  We are all <Col N="312" /> hoping for this development, for expansion of business, offices, houses and facilities, and the local authority will need all the money they can get.</P>

      <P>I do not want to delay the House on this section at this stage because it is obvious that the Minister has his mind made up and is not going to move on it.  However, I ask him to consider this on Report Stage or in the Seanad, to listen to the points being made and not to feel that because there is a disagreement with him that it is a matter of disagreement in principle on the Bill. It is not.  A reality that Deputy Mac Giolla and I have been echoing is that this financial problem exists in the local authorities and that in giving these benefits and incentives for redevelopment the Government rather than the already hard-pressed local authority should pick up the tab.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated, when all of this was being discussed I had discussions with the local authority and they were very anxious that the quays and other areas would be considered before, say, the Port and Docks site.  They were quite happy when they saw that the quays were being included with other areas of the city which as planners they would like to see developed.  Knowing the packets that would be implemented, they made no great objection to the fact that they were playing their role in bringing this forward as well, and it was responsible of them to agree to work in this way.  I understand the view of Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy Burke on this.  They say that the State should pick up the tab.  I have a different view.  I have said previously that it should be the local authority, because we consider the longer term, not just from year to year, and the greater good of the city.  For future revenue in many of the designated areas I have spoken about the rates will be coming anyway from the existing structures and it is only in further development that rates will not accrue for ten years.  I would be misleading the House if I gave <Col N="313" /> any other impression.  I think that what we are doing represents a reasonable balance and on Report Stage I will not be bringing forward any change in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 8, but in Part II, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8&mdash;(1) A tax to be called a Derelict Sites Tax shall be charged, levied, and paid annually upon the net market value of derelict sites within the designated areas, on the valuation date in every year of every assessable person and the rate of tax shall be 10 per cent of the gross market value.</P>
      <P>(2) The Derelict Sites Tax shall be paid to the Local Authority.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred, when dealing with section 7 in regard to remission of rates, to the need <Col N="314" /> to impose some penalties as well as providing incentives.  The Minister is well aware that many of the derelict sites have been derelict for many years.  The question of a derelict sites tax has been discussed and put forward on a number of occasions.  We in the Workers' Party have been putting it forward for a number of years in pre-budget submissions to the Minister for Finance.  Many local authorities felt it would be an excellent idea to try to ensure the development of derelict sites.</P>
    <P>Our amendment says that a tax to be called a derelict sites tax shall be charged, levied and paid annually upon the net market value of derelict sites within the designated areas, on the valuation date in every year of every assessable person and the rate of tax shall be 10 per cent of the gross market value.  It is important to accept the need for a derelict sites tax.  It could be imposed in a number of ways and I am sure the Minister has his own ideas in that regard.  This tax should be used as a penalty to ensure development within a certain period of time, say ten years.  Such tax could increase over that period to ensure that people who own, develop and dispose of the building to another developer or local authority within that time would be taxed in accordance with the length of time it was lying idle.</P>
    <P>Derelict sites cause great problems for local authorities and they spend big sums trying to keep such sites tidy and clean. Dublin looks like a bombed out city and apparently is now the location for war films.  I presume people keep sites derelict because they are hot properties which will rise in value when the recession is over.  They are happy to keep these sites derelict but, if a penalty was imposed on this asset while it remained in that condition, it would go a long way towards solving the problem.  However, if they built on these sites they should get tax incentives and rates remission which would ensure much more rapid progress in the development of an area like the city quays where there are so many derelict sites.  There are many others around the city and in Limerick, Waterford and <Col N="315" /> Cork.  The imposition of tax would bring about rapid movement in these areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the principle of a derelict sites tax.  If we are striving for redevelopment and providing incentives to do so, it is fair and sensible that there should also be a tax on those who do not redevelop and leave these eyesores around our cities and urban areas.</P>
      <P>However, I am not prepared to go along with the precise form of tax as set out in Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment because, as he said, there are a number of ways in which this could be imposed and I am not in a position to decide whether this is the best way of alleviating the problem.  If someone owns property which is not maintained to a certain standard and allows it to deteriorate to such a degree that it is an eyesore, a tax should be imposed for allowing such a dereliction.  I hope the Minister will agree with the principle of a derelict sites tax an I will be recommitting our party to that concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make a brief contribution because I do not want to delay the passing of the Bill and I am anxious to hear Deputy Burke's ideas in regard to the walled city.  His amendment in that regard is a major one which has been well thought out and we will need time to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody is concerned about derelict sites but, while we need drastic measures to clean them up, a tax does not seem to be the answer.  That does not mean that I want to see a well heeled speculator, developer or bank exempted from such a tax, but there are not many hot properties around Dublin nowadays as a result of inflation over the years.  Many of these sites may be owned by companies which have gone into liquidation, or on which money is owed to the banks.  There are no buyers of these buildings which is part of the problem.  One of the biggest perpetrators of the derelict site syndrome in Dublin for decades, has been the Corporation as a result of earmarking buildings <Col N="316" /> all over the city for long term road widening proposals designed to demolish the old city of Dublin and replace it with highways.  It is a vote of confidence in the future of the motor car and they are prepared to sacrifice the quays, Bridgefoot Street and Clanbrassil Street in the interests of road widening.  If they had pursued that policy we would have ended up with flyovers and spaghetti junctions all over the city which would have turned it into downtown Detroit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla referred to solutions which he had in mind to solve the problem such as updating the public transport system and providing cheap accessible transport for the population of Dublin who do not have cars.  However, by leaving sites vacant for decades, such as sections of Cork Street which it was intended to widen, the Corporation encouraged derelict sites.  We thus lost part of our Georgian buildings.  Many of the children present in the Gallery now will never have the opportunity to see the heritage that we had been left in this city. Dublin was one of the largest Georgian cities in the world.</P>
    <P>In York £5 is charged to look at houses such as these and we did not know how to handle such a heritage. The ongoing UCD architectural study, which will last for a six months period, will bring this out.  I agree with Deputy Burke's suggestion of an incentive, but would not agree with a penalty.  This is not workable and will penalise people who are perhaps hanging on to a site, not because they want to but because they have no way out.  Encouragement in the form of designation of areas is helpful, although one must give thought to the periphery of the designated areas.  Who will purchase property or a site outside but adjacent to a designated area when one can get incentives, capital gains and tax breaks for buying within the designated area? That will create more problems, but this can be tackled in the long term.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the commitment of the Government in regard to the dockside, which is a long term prospect, and to the quay site.  This has probably given <Col N="317" /> rise to Deputy Burke's suggestion about the walled city.  At least we are concentrating our minds in what is left of a tattered Dublin.  Dublin resembles a doughnut, the hole in the middle being our heritage which has gone down the drain.  The city is crumbling and falling into the river.  It might be worth while leaving a thought for the Members that there is a tremendous bonus to be got out of rebuilding our city.  This bonus is in the nature of jobs.  One could create tens of thousands of jobs by undertaking this rebuilding.  If I have an opportunity later to do so, I might mention some examples. This has been done very successfully in smaller cities than Dublin throughout the world and has caused the creation of incredible numbers of jobs.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House on this section.  I appreciate Deputy Mac Giolla's concept.  This total neglect, boarding and shoring up of properties, not bothering to do anything more with them until they start falling down around us is a lingering sore which has been there for the last two decades at least.  It is mainly the responsibility of our local authority, of which he has been a member.  Perhaps this debate will give rise to a new impetus from that local authority and from Members.  It might raise the standard of concern in Dublin Corporation with regard to their city. There are certain items that I would not like to see the Corporation getting their hands on, in view of their record to date in dealing with this most historic city. One matter I hear mooted is the handing over of the Phoenix Park to Dublin Corporation. I dread to think what would happen if that were the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we should tackle dereliction, not only in the designated areas but in all our urban areas.  I also agree that some form of taxation for derelict sites should be considered.  Land not required for immediate development, whether in private or public ownership, should be maintained in an environmentally acceptable fashion.  All these issues are under active consideration in the Department.  Proposals for <Col N="318" /> dealing with dereliction will be brought before the Oireachtas as soon as possible. It may even be possible to publish proposals during the present session.  I hope that we can do something in that area.</P>
      <P>There are still some difficulties to be ironed out.  There are constitutional problems to be overcome and advice has already been sought in that area.  There are also genuine problems of site assembly and of ownership.  A good many of the derelict sites, particularly in Dublin, are in the ownership of statutory bodies, including Dublin Corporation.  In many instances dereliction is caused by medium or long term planning objectives of these bodies.  There are problems in connection with, for example, road planning. A great deal of thought is required to produce an equitable and effective answer to the whole problem of dereliction but I hope that we shall be able to give the answer in the very near future.</P>
      <P>I would ask Deputies Mac Giolla and De Rossa to withdraw their amendment, pending the introduction of Government proposals which it is hoped will come as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 8, but in Part III, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8&mdash;There shall be established a body which shall be known as the Dublin Walled City Development Authority.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is the heart of this Bill, in particular when one takes amendment 18 also into consideration.  This Bill sets out, by a series of incentives and in association with incentives included in the Finance Bill, to make provision for regeneration of our urban areas.  It sets out to designate specific areas and in one instance takes on to itself the power to establish a development authority.  That is only in relation to the Custom House Dock site.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House feel very strongly that the concept of a development authority is such an excellent one that it should not be restricted to that one site.  This Bill should be amended in such a way as to give the Minister of the day, whoever that may be, the power to establish development authorities for any other special urban area within the country where this spotlight treatment would be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The urban development authority has very special planning powers, functions and controls which are not available to a local authority.  Because of that, these powers should be used in very specific areas.  The Minister has taken on to himself just the Custom House Dock site.  My case today to him is that there is one area in this country, more than any other &mdash; probably even more than the Custom House Dock site &mdash; that deserves the special spotlight treatment of an urban development authority being established. That is the mediaeval walled city, or the old walled city of Dublin.  It is within that walled city that our heritage as a nation <Col N="320" /> is.  It is not just specific to the people of Dublin.  It is a national treasure, a national responsibility.  It is of national importance that that area be redeveloped and rejuvenated.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 18 I described the area to be covered by the proposed Dublin walled city development authority. It is a direct copy of the proposal included in the 1982 Bill which I introduced at the time.  This area has such historic names as the Grattan Bridge, Parliament Street, Cork Street, Dame Street, Palace Street, Ship Street, Bride Street, Werburgh Street, Patrick Street, Nicholas Street, John Dillon Street, Lamb Alley, Cornmarket, Thomas Street, St. Augustine Street.  These names are written in large print across the history of our city.  That area deserves the very special treatment that an urban development authority could give.  The Minister may say he has designated it and is leaving it under the local development authority.  But Dublin Corporation have failed miserably over the years to give this area the consideration it deserves and we have no reason to believe that designating the area will give an injection of enthusiasm to Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>The only way to come to grips with the potential for the development of this area is to set up an urban development authority as proposed in my amendment.  This area is part of our heritage.  It is the Liberties; it is the area of the Vikings; it is the area of St. Patrick's Cathedral.  It is the very heart of our country, not just of our city.  I appeal to the Minister not to restrict himself as he has done by appointing a development authority only for the Custom House Docks site which is very important, but the importance of the walled city cannot be over emphasised. Surely it is criminal to put this legislation through the House and exclude from it the heart of our capital city.  I could go on at great length but we have already discussed it here this morning with excellent contributions from Deputy Brady and others.  So I appeal to the Minister and I wait to hear his response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>First I should like to <Col N="321" /> point out that the south quays designated area contains within its boundaries virtually all of the mediaeval walled city.  As I indicated this morning, anything that is not included is in the hands of Dublin Corporation or one of the statutory bodies.  The mediaeval walled city will benefit from the package of taxation incentives and the rate incentives already announced.  In addition, as soon as the Bill is enacted, Dublin Corporation will be putting forward a comprehensive and effective package based on the initiatives contained in this Bill which we hope will revitalise the mediaeval core of Dublin. Therefore I do not consider that a special commission, as advocated by Deputy Burke, is necessary.</P>
      <P>It is not that I am necessarily against commissions but the mediaeval walled city is not a homogenous area like the Customs House Docks site which is an area of its own.  It is like any other area in the city with a wide range of skills and resources and it is best to leave the responsibility for its redevelopment to the planning authority.  As I indicated earlier this morning, Dublin Corporation have requested the mediaeval society to make suggestions to them for the draft development plan so that they can impose particular sanctions in any planning permission relating to the mediaeval core of Dublin.  In the last number of years Dublin Corporation have done a good job around St. Audoen's Church, the park and the city wall there and I hope that will continue in that vein so that we will have a redevelopment and, as a result of the designation, we will see a new development, particularly around Taylor's Hall.  Dublin Corporation have been trying to develop a site there for a number of years and I hope that will take off in a really good development in keeping with the general area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in tandem with Deputy Burke's view that a commission is necessary. The local authority can do the job just as well.  They are the planning authority and we should leave it to them.  Also they now have an obligation to ensure that they themselves bring forward plans <Col N="322" /> that are in keeping with the best traditions of our city both in the walled city and around it, because all of the quays area from O'Connell Street up are important.  There should be a comprehensive plan by the local authority that will incorporate the mediaeval walled city Deputy Burke is talking about.  The north side of the river is as important as the south side and we should try to get them developed in tandem, retaining the line of the quays.  This would be of tremendous benefit to the core of the city and not just the narrow core of the old walled city.  We should extend beyond that.  The onus should be on the planning authorities and Dublin Corporation to bring suitable plans forward.  I have no doubt they will do that.  They have people within the authority who are capable of doing this and it is up to them, once this Bill is passed, to bring it forward as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I have not taken the Minister up wrongly.  I am a little disappointed because the first thought that came into my mind when Deputy Burke was talking about this was that what he was talking about was making the most out of the jewel of Dublin.  Then I thought of Eamonn Mac Thomáis's book <i>Me Jewel and Darlin' Dublin,</i> which is really about the area described in the amendment.  It is ludicrous to suggest that we leave that area to an authority which literally fought the people of Dublin in the courts when they sought to prevent the corporation from developing Wood Quay so that it could be properly excavated. The corporation went ahead in the face of protest marches and appeals from the ordinary populace, as well as people of stature in the State and the Old Dublin Society.  It does not make sense to entrust the future development of this important part of the city to that authority.  These are the people who are responsible in the main for the derelict state of a great part of Dublin and they do not have any plans to deal with that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More than 20 years ago the British Institute of Architects sent a group of students to study Dublin.  At the end of <Col N="323" /> their deliberations they decided that Dublin would be judged by how it treated its quays.  We know that in the intervening years Dublin Corporation have done nothing with the quays.  The PRO for Dublin Corporation was asked within the past few years what plans the corporation had for the quays.  He replied that they had none and said it was up to people to make planning applications which would then be considered on their merits.</P>
    <P>We have an ancient city dating back more than 1,000 years, yet we have no plans to develop its historic areas.  The last thing that seems to be in anybody's mind is good redevelopment.  The corporation have not used their compulsory purchase orders to good effect in the past, but they could decide to use them to pick out the lines of the old city walls.  A 17th century map on the wall of this Chamber shows those ancient walls.  Many continental cities which are not as old as Dublin have been divided into old and new parts.  If one travels from Basel in Switzerland to Brittany in France one will pass through many towns and cities which have their old quarters.  Such areas are a pleasure to walk through.  It is shocking that we want money for designated areas to be spent on Dublin.  Money should be poured into the old parts of Dublin to encourage certain types of development. There could be a &ldquo;Latin quarter&rdquo; type of development in areas like Francis Street. There are still institutions around the city which are referred to as being within the walls or without the walls.  They will not last much longer because they are rapidly becoming derelict.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the objective is literally to demolish the remaining old parts of Dublin, although this has been happening over the last few years, whether by accident or design.  My experience in growing up in this city and living abroad leads me to believe that we have reached this sorry state by design and neglect.  An architect who is visiting the city for the first time to see what it is like has spoken about the many derelict areas.  One does not have to be too old to remember what High Street was like before it was turned into <Col N="324" /> a highway.  There were cobbled twisted streets going up to the old St. Audoen's and the new St. Audoen's and the Tailors' Hall.  It was a fascinating area full of character, but it was bulldozed 20 years ago because somebody who did not want to go into private practice went to work for Dublin Corporation and decided that Dublin needed to become a new Detroit. We started to copy cities which have only grown up during the last 50 or 100 years, although Dublin is in its second millenium.</P>
    <P>We must emphasise the old city within the walls, as well as the Liberties outside the walls.  We have a lot of documentation and literature available which would help us to develop it in the traditional way.  We are not getting value for money on many short-term employment projects here and there throughout the country. It is appalling to think of the amount of money that is badly accounted for or not accounted for at all.  Millions are being spent on projects such as cleaning up areas which are overgrown again a month later.  We must devote our energies to saving the future of Dublin.  Parts of the old walls still remain.  It is not good enough to entrust the task to Dublin Corporation because they would not be able to give a good account of their stewardship over the past few years.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect to developing an area like this which could be of enormous benefit to people.  I would refer to an article in <i>The Financial Times</i> on Friday, 18 April about the town of Edmonton in Alberta which has a population of 650,000.  They created a fantastic number of jobs and developed a fascinatingly attractive area of leisure, shopping and commercial facilities.  The article stated that it ought to be a white elephant but it is not.  Shoppers come there from Calgary, Vancouver, the prairies, the Arctic and the United States.  They even charter planes for the trip.  West Edmonton measures its trading area in thousands of miles and keeps shoppers for two to three days.  It states that the fully fledged fantasy mall is like &ldquo;dropping an atom bomb into the market place&rdquo;.  I keep <Col N="325" /> pointing out in this House that it is possible to do this in Dublin.  If we rebuild Dublin in a properly organised manner we can make it the most attractive city in Britain or Ireland.  We could have people coming in here by the planeload.  There is nothing to see around the city at present except derelict areas.  It has been pointed out that when coming from the airport one has to try to find a route which will not shock visitors.  This is not being true to one's city.</P>

      <P>Because of changes in the European <Col N="326" /> Social Fund guidelines assistance for training those over 25 who have been unemployed for less than one year has been curtailed.  This means that the cost to the State of a training day for those over 25 unemployed for less than a year is twice the cost of a training day which would be assisted by the ESF.  Given the severe budgetary constraints facing the Government, it is not possible, in these circumstances, to maintain the level of training for those over 25 unemployed for less than a year that obtained in 1985. The Government have, however, provided £1 million for enterprise training to AnCo in respect of such trainees.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the needs of the group in question for training and I am considering whether scope exists to assist them further during the remainder of 1986 and subsequent years.  As regards those over 25 who are long term unemployed, ESF assistance is still available and participation on the alternance programme, which is the main training programme for the older long term unemployed, is being increased in 1986.</P>

For the time being access by those people to a certain number of schemes has been restricted. As I said in my reply, I am now looking at ways in which we can provide new access for such people having regard to the demands they have placed upon the system.</P>

Can the Minister confirm whether or not ESF <Col N="327" /> financial support is dependent on this Government providing equal amounts of resources for these courses here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the other way around. I share the Deputy's concern and we are looking at ways to try to alleviate it. Guidelines operate as to the distribution of European Social Fund money.  They were changed some time ago, a change which we resisted at the time, and which brought in this 12 months requirement for long term unemployed over the age of 25.  We received 55 per cent funding for every training day provided for by AnCO in respect of those programmes which qualify for ESF funding.  That is the balance of support.  We do not qualify for support for such programmes for those who are less than 12 months unemployed. As I said, I am looking at ways in which the category of people to which Deputy Treacy referred can be properly accommodated by AnCO.</P>

Would he further confirm that AnCO were left an abnormally long period waiting for the exact budgetary amount which they would have for 1986?

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy is saying.  He is implying, although it is not his intention, that those who are involved in work experience programmes are not being trained and are not in the process of going on to take up a job.  By adopting his logic one could say that every medical student is unemployed because he or she is not currently working although they will end up getting a job. The vast majority of those who participate in these schemes go on to gain employment.  The placement rate of AnCO is of the order of 60 per cent. Obviously, that figure varies from course to course and person to person.  I do not think one should adopt the procedure suggested by Deputy Ahern and say that if it were not for this intervention the unemployment rate would be 45,000 people extra.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>One may argue that the figure is not 45,000 but it is my opinion that a substantial number of those people could be included in the figure.  Even if I accepted the Minister's argument that some of those people will receive jobs when they finish the training courses, although that is questionable, the unemployment level is still more than 20 per cent.</P>

The amount of money made available in the Estimates for 1985 was increased in the course of the year because of the success of the scheme.  I presume the Estimate for 1986 was based on what was provided in 1985.  I share the view that Teamwork continues to be a very successful programme and that it is totally over-subscribed.  It is because of its success that we have made available an extra £2 million.  I hope that amount will be sufficient to meet the demands on the scheme.

      <P>The main reasons for the difference between the figures are: (i) The area covered by the Tallaght National Manpower Office is greater than the Tallaght employment exchange area, e.g.  Tallaght NMS area includes Blessington and surrounding areas.  (ii) There are certain categories of persons who would not be eligible for social welfare benefit/assistance and therefore would not appear on the live register but who would be on the NMS register as looking for work, e.g., early school leavers, AnCO trainees, participants on temporary work schemes and job-changers.

      <P>The Department of Labour have specifically provided a range of employment incentives for enterprises right across the country.  I am not satisfied that enterprises in the Dublin area, in general, and in the Tallaght area, in particular, have made full use of these.  I refer specifically to the employment incentive scheme and the work experience programme.  I am not sure also whether all of the people who are registered with the National Manpower Service are aware of the support system we have under the enterprise allowance scheme.  In addition &mdash; and we will have a relevant question later on on the Order Paper &mdash; Dublin County Council have the potential, if they so choose, to employ at least 1,000 people under the social employment scheme.  They have not yet chosen to do this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he has an advisory section to assist people emigrating from the country; if so, if he will give details; and the funds which are allocated to such a project.</P>

      <P>My Department are responsible for overseeing the implementation of procedures governing the free movement of workers within the EC, which includes workers leaving Ireland to work elsewhere in the Community and <i>vice versa.</i> As Minister for Labour, I regard my main responsibilities for assisting workers contemplating employment abroad as being to provide information and advice on employment and training opportunities at home, to enable them to make an informed choice, and to discourage as far as possible unplanned and ill-prepared migration.</P>
      <P>Pre-departure information and advice to prospective emigrants is provided by the National Manpower Service, and is funded from the general finances of the service.  Recent initiatives include:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Since August 1985 the placement and guidance staff at NMS offices <Col N="336" /> advise young people considering emigration of the difficulties which they may encounter if they fail to prepare themselves properly and try to dissuade those who appear to lack the necessary resources or qualifications to secure employment overseas especially in the United Kingdom.  In order to familiarise themselves fully for this task occupational guidance officers of the NMS have had briefing sessions with officers of voluntary organisations involved in emigrant welfare work who have first hand experience of the realities of the situation.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Careers Information Section of the NMS are at present preparing a booklet in the careers series which will provide information and advice for young people about working abroad and the kind of precautions and safeguards which are necessary to avoid the pitfalls relating to accommodation, job-search difficulties, social security problems, etc.  This leaflet will be distributed through NMS offices, schools, etc., in the normal way.</P>
    <P>(3)  The NMS participate in SEDOC &mdash; the EC information exchange system whereby job-seekers in Ireland may apply for vacancies in other member states.</P>
    <P>In addition to these official measures the Dublin based Emigrant Welfare Bureau which are a voluntary body provide information and advisory services to persons leaving Ireland.  The bureau receive a Government grant on the recommendation of Dion &mdash; the Committee on Emigrant Welfare Services which I established in June 1984 and who have responsibility for advising me on emigrant welfare services.  Dion also advise on the allocation of State financial assistance towards the employment of professional workers at reception centres in Britain dealing with the problems of newly arrived Irish workers.  In 1986, the Government allocated £155,000 for this purpose which is an increase of 49 per cent over the 1985 allocation of £104,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>At last some people in the National Manpower Service and the <Col N="337" /> Minister's office have realised that probably about 25,000 people a year are emigrating. When similar questions were asked last year or the year before, almost always the answer was that there was no necessity to do anything.  Various emigrant agencies came to this country to lobby the Government and the Opposition to highlight the major problems which are arising in places such as Kilburn where there are massive numbers of Irish people arriving weekly with no advice and assistance and who have not got the foggiest notion of their entitlements.  It appears that because this question was put down the National Manpower Service have informed the Minister that they will now set up an information section and will issue a pamphlet.  Would the Minister not admit to the House that this is about three years too late because this is an issue I raised back in 1984?  What is the delay?  Is there no commitment within the National Manpower Service or the Department to assisting these people once they leave the country?</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister has met some of the people from Kilburn or other parts of the United Kingdom.  The Irish people arriving there are being very badly treated, are living in appalling conditions and have no idea of their benefits or welfare arrangements.  They find it very difficult to obtain work except in areas where they are exploited under the labour laws by employers who are unscrupulously treating them as second class citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I say in relation to the figures that there has been confusion which has not helped any of us in this debate?  If one regards emigration as the net outflow of people from this island, taking one year against another the statistics which I have given consistently over the years have been accurate.  What Deputy Ahern has said in relation to the 25,000 people is not necessarily inaccurate either.  What we are counting is the number of people and the Deputy is referring to the approximate numbers of people who are leaving this island.  The census data given to me also showed the <Col N="338" /> number of people who are returning. Since they are returning, they are not necessarily a problem.  We have got into a false position in the past in relation to what the exact amount of the problem was in terms of numbers.  At a recent conference with chaplains related to emigrant welfare services abroad I attempted to resolve this matter.</P>
      <P>With regard to why this information was given, I have to tell the Deputy that his question has not prompted this response.  This documentation has been in preparation for some time.  This Government &mdash; and I take responsibility for it &mdash; decided that for too long we have been hiding behind the reality of this problem which has existed not since the Government came to power but since 1922 and going back further.  I changed the very nature of the previous committee which had responsibility for welfare services abroad.  At that time, the vast majority of the membership were based in Ireland and, despite their concern for the people involved, had not got the day to day experience of people living in the United Kingdom.  I changed the composition and structure of the committee and renamed it to use the Irish word &ldquo;Dion&rdquo; which means roof or shelter. We gave them considerably increased resources.  In 1984, the amount of money available to Dion or Cowsa, their predecessors, was £38,000.  As I indicated in my reply it is now £155,000. Their concern is primarily in providing a welfare service for those people who are unable to cope for themselves and who present themselves, sometimes in desperation, at the doors of an Irish centre, usually in a UK city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say, and put it on the record for those people who think that running away to England is a solution to their problems, that for most young people there is a better support system in this country in terms of educational training than there is in the United Kingdom. Many people who leave this country and go to England do so for reasons not directly related to unemployment.  They go for other reasons.  Many of them go because they want a better job and others <Col N="339" /> go because they want a change.  That is not to say that economics is a driving factor.  Both Deputy Ahern and Deputy Fahey have met people who left jobs in this country.  Therefore, it is not exclusively for employment.</P>
    <P>My concern as Minister for Labour is to ensure that anybody who decides to leave has all the facts at his or her command and knows exactly what they are going to, which is frequently not the case. As regards people who are not trained or adequately prepared, there is an obligation upon all of us to ensure that they exhaust all of the opportunities which exist before they decide to leave.  I am satisfied from detailed discussions I have had with individuals in the welfare services in the greater cities in Britain and with officials in the Department of Employment in the UK, including the Secretary, Mr. Clarke, and his predecessor, Tom King, that here we have a better support system for young people than the United Kingdom.  All Deputies confronted by people who are contemplating leaving should advise them to exhaust all the possibilities available to them here before going.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much of what the Minister has said, but the question still must be asked about what we as a people are doing to assist those going abroad.  Would he ask the Minister for Social Welfare to instruct labour exchanges to recommend to young people who are signing off with the intention of emigrating to seek the advice of The National Manpower Service to assist them?  The services may be there for people who go to look for them but those who are leaving the placement network are not getting advice and the result is an appalling emigration problem which the Minister knows well.  I do not want to play it up or down, but large numbers of young Irish people are arriving in parts of London without hope.  We cannot just draw a line under their names and say they have left the country and we no longer have responsibility.  We could do many things but we are doing very little. <Col N="340" /> The figure referred to by the Minister, £155,000, is very little if an impact is to be made in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Ahern's support and his frankness.  We must all be prepared to realise that this problem exists and we must ensure that the National Manpower Service will deal with it honestly and that they will not be open to the charge that they are giving people information about situations abroad and consequently that they are encouraging people to emigrate.  I will undertake to ensure that the maximum information will be made available in the manner Deputy Ahern has suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the reason the amount of moneys available for the Teamwork scheme during 1986 was reduced by his Department; the number of applications from County Wexford under this scheme from January 1985 to February 1986; and the number given approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation for Teamwork in 1986 was determined as part of the annual Estimates process which took account of the demands for Exchequer funding and the general budgetary situation. Twenty-nine applications were received from County Wexford in respect of the 1985 allocation and 21 in respect of the 1986 allocation.  Eight projects from County Wexford were approved in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the large number of projects approved for assistance in 1985 which have continued into the present year, very heavy financial commitments were carried into 1986.  It has been possible, therefore, to approve grants for only a limited number of new projects this year.  The new projects for which approval has been given do not include any from County Wexford.  However, a number of projects in County Wexford for which grants were approved in 1985 have continued into 1986 with assistance under the Teamwork scheme.  An additional £2 million has been provided by <Col N="341" /> the Government for the continuation of the Teamwork scheme this year.  All applications received this year and rejected due to lack of funds including those from County Wexford are now being re-considered in my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This question has been down so long that it is nearly out of date. I put it down in February but my name did not come out of the lottery.  I want to highlight the unemployment problem in Wexford, particularly in relation to young people.  There are 8,000 people unemployed in County Wexford, 40 per cent of them under 25 years.  The Minister has been in Wexford on a number of occasions.  In view of the serious unemployment there &mdash; it is 7 per cent above national average &mdash; does the Minister consider that the county should be given priority in relation to sanctions for Teamwork schemes?  Only eight schemes were sanctioned in two years and therefore Wexford is losing out badly <i>vis-á-vis</i> other counties.  Would he consider the serious position there and give priority to the applications already in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, I have great affection for County Wexford and visit it quite frequently.  I am also a great admirer of the Model County's ability to maximise all of its resources. I might ask Deputy Browne to try to persuade his farming colleagues in Wexford in pay the arrears of rates they owe to Wexford County Council, approximately £2 million, and then there would be plenty of resources in that county to be applied to the numerous schemes in the Department of Labour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a suspicion the Minister is trying to dodge issue by putting the blame on people who in this instance are not at fault.  He has been successful in doing that many times. What criteria are used to decide which county or counties or projects are accepted eventually for the Teamwork schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We look at projects on the <Col N="342" /> basis of the need for employment for the participants, the potential they would have for getting employment arising out of the schemes and the economic benefit the project would have in terms of their contribution to the community.  We must also have regard to a geographical spread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to a geographical spread.  Eight schemes out of 40 could hardly be acceptable in these circumstances.  The Minister asked us a number of times to put forward ideas about where money might come from. Most of those young people are on unemployment assistance and surely it makes better economic sense to pay those people to work rather than to stay at home &mdash; work from which some benefit would eventually be returned to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>One criterion we are looking at is the qualifications of the participants who would otherwise be drawing social assistance money.  If the Deputy puts down a question I can supply information on the overall spread of the various projects.  The Deputy will find that County Wexford has fared well in programmes sponsored by the Department of Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister was not serious when he introduced the red herring of the farmers and their rates. That has nothing to do with Teamwork schemes.  One thousand young people are emigrating every year and I share the same concern the Minister and Deputy Ahern expressed about advising them when they are emigrating.  Because so many young people are emigrating from Wexford and because we have the highest unemployment rate in the country, would the Minister seriously consider allocating extra Teamwork money to County Wexford? The AnCo training centre in Wexford has been advised not to take on people over 25 years and cannot take on people under 25 years because of a lack of money for Teamwork.  Where, then, will any young people in Wexford go? Taking account of geographical spread <Col N="343" /> and all that, would the Minister consider treating Wexford as a priority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not facetiously introduce arrears of farmers' rates in County Wexford, but the one constraint we have in relation to any of these programmes is money, and I am not satisfied that the farming community in the past have been paying their fair share of taxation.  The specific crisis in County Wexford in relation to local authority finance was precipitated by the farmers who initiated the High Court constitutional action which in part has resulted in the crisis in local authority funding nationwide.  Wexford County Council are owed £2 million which the Wexford farmers have yet to pay up.  That is the only constraint we have in relation to these programmes.</P>
      <P>County Wexford has benefited significantly under the social employment scheme for 25 year olds and over.  The AnCO centre is operating in Wexford, though not at a scale or a size that I would like but, as I said, my only constraint is money.  I am prepared to sit down with the two Deputies to show them what has been provided for Wexford in the past couple of years.  By comparison with the rest of the country, they would find that more than a fair share has been provided for Wexford.  I do not say in any sense of false flattery that I have a great respect for the ability of the Wexford administration at all levels to put to very good use the resources they receive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <P>It appears a number of these EC regulations are at various stages of implementation.  Will the Minister consider asking someone in his Department to examine the entire list of regulations?  If it is the case that some are just difficult to implement or are not in the national interest, we would be better off knowing the facts rather than waiting until the evil day when someone in the EC will say we have not implemented them.  It appears to me that people use every process they can to delay implementing the regulations.  Some are extremely important and others are perhaps against our national interest, and it would be better if we knew where exactly we stood in relation to them.

      <P>Under the provisions of sections 6, 20 and 71 of the Factories Act, 1955, the Minister for Labour has power to make regulations in relation to any factory or class of factory where there may be a risk of bodily injury or a risk of injury to the health of the persons employed.  Two sets of regulations have been made concerning ionising radiations: (i) Factories Ionising Radiations (Sealed Sources) Regulations, 1972, S.I.

      <P>No doubt the <Col N="346" /> Minister is aware of the UCD case where an accident occurred in 1981 in the Zoology Department and where the union concerned sought a copy of the report of the Safety Committee and was refused.  I understand the Labour Court upheld the right of the college to refuse it.  Does the Minister not consider that in such a situation the workers are entitled to sight of the report in order to minimise the risks to themselves and also to reduce the possibility of further accidents?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the workers have that right and for that reason the legislation dealing with occupational safety and health, to give effect to the proposals of the Barrington Commission, will make specific provision for that in relation to all such reports.  I regret the decision taken in the case mentioned by the Deputy, even though obviously it was quite legal in that context.  If we are to get co-operation with regard to safety measures in our workplaces it must be a fundamental right of all workers that they have access to published documents, measurements and reports that affect their safety and health.  It is the intention of the legislation currently being draftted, and which I hope to have before the House by the end of the year, to give legal effect to that right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there has been great concern about safety in recent years, not just in respect of nuclear fallout but also in hospitals.  There are regulations governing the radiography departments of hospitals but these regulations are now nearly 30 years old.  They were drafted at a time when there was not much equipment in those departments and when there was very little danger. The checking equipment now used on the clothes of radiographers and radiologists cannot monitor or register any damage caused.  Nowadays equipment such as gamma counters, nuclear magnetic machines and ultrasound machines are in constant use.  The regulations now governing the use of such machines have been in operation for 25 years or 30 years and are no longer effective.  No one is <Col N="347" /> quite sure of the risk involved.  Radiographers and radiologists probably know more about radiation than anyone in the country and they have expressed concern with regard to this matter.  I ask the Minister to examine it because the hospital staffs are in the forefront in respect of radiation danger.</P>

There is a great interest and concern among all people, and particularly working people, about their health and their right to know and understand the consequences of working with the processes they use.  As I said in reply to Deputy De Rossa, the intent of the proposals of the Barrington Commission &mdash; we will be bringing legislation before the House in that regard &mdash; will be to recognise that right and to give it positive effect.  For that reason, in anticipation of the enactment of the legislation I have proceeded to establish an interim board comprising representatives of the social <Col N="348" /> partners as follows: three representatives from the ICTU, three representatives from the employer organisations and four representatives from four Government Departments, the board to be chaired by an independent chairperson.  They have already commenced work on how the proposals may be implemented.  All of the complex factors referred to by Deputy Ahern will be accommodated in that framework.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is aware of the concern expressed by a number of trade unions regarding the practice, recently adopted by the Labour Court, of allowing employers to make confidential submissions to the court, which are not disclosed to the workers or unions, to enable them to respond; if he is happy with the practice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure of the Labour Court is laid down in section 20 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, which provides that the court may make rules for the regulation of their proceedings. Rules were made by the court in 1946 which allow the procedure to be observed at a sitting of the court to be regulated by the chairman.</P>
      <P>Apart from this, the court issued a detailed statement in December 1946 on disclosure of information given to the court.  This statement provided that the extent to which information received by the court may be disclosed is a matter for the discretion of the court.</P>
      <P>The question of the use of information by the court is therefore a matter entirely for the court themselves to regulate.  If a party to a Labour Court hearing has reservations about the operation of these procedures, then they should raise the matter directly with the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that concern has been expressed in two specific cases recently, one by the Marine Port and General Workers' Union and the other by the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, where employers involved in disputes with the unions concerned submitted reports to the court and which appeared to the <Col N="350" /> unions to have had a direct bearing on the outcome of the court's decision. However, the unions were not in a position to respond to the information given. Does the Minister not consider that situation unsatisfactory and that if it continues it is likely to lead to an undermining of confidence in the court, in their operations and in the way they deal with cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have responsibility for the Labour Court but effectively they are controlled and run by the social partners. The very independence of the court is the bedrock on which their authority rests. Consequently, the workers' representatives and the employers' representatives have not only a right but an opportunity to express their concern as to how the court conduct business.  If a union is unhappy about the way in which the court or a member of the court &mdash; or in this instance the vice-chairman &mdash; has conducted business in relation to a certain matter, there is a clear line of communication and procedures open to that union to seek redress.  For me, as Minister for Labour, to attempt to intervene would be dangerous because it could be construed that I was interfering with the independence of the court, and I do not propose to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate the Minister's reluctance to appear to interfere with the independence of the court, and I agree with him on that, but I am raising this question because it appears that confidence in the court by the trade union side at least is likely to be undermined if the procedure adopted at present is continued.  Would the Minister not agree that a decision made 40 years ago in relation to confidentiality of submissions, at a time when court proceedings were open to the public and <Col N="351" /> to the press, is no longer valid and perhaps he might take it upon himself to have private discussions with the people concerned to see how the matter can be resolved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be misleading to imply that there has not been a review of the operations of the court since 1946, but perhaps the Deputy was not implying that.  In the first instance the union involved, or any union, have access to Congress in an official capacity, or have access to individual members of Congress who have been nominated to serve as ordinary members of the court, in order to ensure that the court complies with standards believed to be acceptable to both sides. Until that process is exhausted, and a union has gone down that road and is not satisfied with the outcome, I would be very reluctant to intervene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy De Rossa and the Minister about the independence of the court.  I have read the submissions of the unions in both cases but in one case at least the submission raised a lot of concern.  I am not sure how the Minister can intervene.  Let us take the employer who is making his case and refused to make a statement in public but hands the chairman a confidential document.  The next day rumours start about what may have been in that submission and the person about whom the submission was written suffers because of that.  If the chairman makes a ruling which seems &mdash; and I say &ldquo;seems&rdquo;&mdash; to have been influenced by that submission, that can leave the court in a dangerous position.</P>
      <P>Any document submitted to the court should be seen by both sides.  This process is followed in all our courts.  While the regulation was tightly written in 1946, the interpretation of how this can be applied in the dispute we are talking about is open to question.  It would not solve the dispute but perhaps&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps this created unnecessary problems.  I agree with Deputy De Rossa that the Minister might raise this matter with the court during their next meeting because there is a concern in this House that the Minister should not be seen to interfere and that the independence of the court is real.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he intends to introduce any amendments to the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act; in particular if he will consider the possibility of paid paternity leave; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of the review of the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1981, recently undertaken in my Department, it emerged that the major issues of difficulty have arisen through the numerous notification requirements in the Act and, in particular, the degree to which failure by employees to adhere strictly to the notification procedures can lead to disqualification from entitlements.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that these difficulties may operate as a constraint on the effectiveness of the Act, and I propose to clarify the situation by way of an appropriate affirmative order as soon as possible.  I have no plans to introduce paid paternity leave at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate the nature of the order he proposes to make and what way the notifications will be altered?  Would he also indicate whether consideration has been given to the introduction of paternity leave which in many cases is essential for the well being of the mother who has just had a baby or is expecting a baby?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 (1) of the Act says that in relation to any provision of that Act relating to notification or confirmation of notification, the Minister of <Col N="353" /> the day is empowered by order to vary such a provision.  We wrote both to the FUE and the ICTU on 21 April 1986 asking for their views on the proposal setting out the manner in which it would be proposed to change this and to simplify it.  We are awaiting their response because, to make this operate efficiently and effectively, the co-operation of the social partners is desirable.  As soon as I have an agreed formula it will be my intention to bring forward the affirmative order in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>We have considered it but we have no proposal at this stage to introduce such a scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards paid paternity leave, what progress has been made at EC level to have that recommendation changed to a directive?  In the event of such a thing happening, hopefully in the future, what will be the Minister's position at the meeting of the Council of Ministers which will bring that about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Next Friday when we are discussing the Estimates I will be in a position to give a more comprehensive review as regards the various draft recommendations and directives due to come before the Council on 5 June.  It is not possible at this stage to say what the outcome of such a directive will be because the position is still fluid.  The directive is still being revised and redrafted to accommodate the positions of various member states.  As regards our own position, until we see the final draft of that document, I am not in a position to indicate what the Government position would be.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Redundancy Payments Act, 1967.</Title>
    <P>15.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he considers it appropriate to amend the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, in view of the many anomalies that have arisen since the Act came into <Col N="354" /> operation and that the present system is not equitable to the claimants in many respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no proposal at present for amendment of the Redundancy Payments Acts.</P>
      <P>The experience of my Department and the information available to them do not support the contentions in the question or suggest the need for urgent review of the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy does not appear to be aware that since the 1967 Act was enacted there have been three amending Redundancy Payments Acts, 1971, 1973 and 1979.  These provided opportunities for the removal of anomalies and difficulties which had emerged in the operation of the legislation based on working experiences of a number of years and the legislation is now considered to be working well.</P>
      <P>So far as the rights of employees are concerned, the Redundancy Payments Acts provide machinery, in the form of the Employment Appeals Tribunal, which is readily accessible for the resolution of disputes and determination of entitlements.  The Act also provides for payments of statutory lump sums to employees from the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund where the employers concerned refuse or fail to make those payments.  There are, therefore, arrangements which provide quick redress for employees as regards both establishment of their entitlements and payments of lump sums due.</P>

    <P>16.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will report on the results of the first year of the social employment scheme; and if the scheme has failed to make any impact on the unemployment position, particularly in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The social employment scheme was set up to help the large numbers of productive and energetic persons who have been unemployed for an <Col N="355" /> extended period to make their contribution to environmental, cultural and social development in their community.  The response to this challenge from both sponsors and workers alike has been most encouraging.</P>
      <P>The first project under the social employment scheme began in April 1985. Since that time, participation in the scheme has continued to rise steadily. There are currently 9,373 persons employed on 2,347 projects.  The target figure of 10,000 jobs set by the Government will be reached by mid-1986.</P>
      <P>Approximately two-thirds of the projects operated under the SES are sponsored by public bodies such as local authorities, schools and health boards. Local authorities employ the largest number of people on the scheme.  Voluntary bodies sponsor the remaining one-third of SES projects.</P>
      <P>There is a wide variety of projects under the scheme which encompass a wide range of activities.  The commonest categories are environmental work, cultural activity, educational work, community service and promotion of tourism and heritage.  I am glad to be able to tell the Dáil that there is a good supply of project sponsors in most parts of the country.  Indeed, a further 1,132 projects are at present approved which, when operational, could provide employment for over 4,000 persons in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The eligibility criteria for participation in the SES have recently been widened to increase the catchment group so as to ensure that the National Manpower Service will be able to recruit sufficient persons to meet the demands of all the projects which are due to start or are currently being proposed.  In addition, an extra £15 per week is being provided for those on the scheme who had previously been receiving an allowance for an adult dependent as part of their social welfare payment.  Most of the difficulties experienced at the early stages of the scheme, such as problems with insurance and trade union agreement, have been successfully resolved by my Department <Col N="356" /> through negotiation with the relevant bodies.</P>
    <P>The problems referred to by the Deputy in relation to the operation of the SES in the Dublin area stem from certain industrial relations difficulties in the local authorities concerned, principally Dublin and Dún Laoghaire Corporations. Discussions aimed at resolving these problems are on-going.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on these discussions.</P>
    <P>I feel the scheme has achieved its principal objective of helping the long term unemployed at a reasonable net cost to the State.  In terms of this objective, it has been an unqualified success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had this question several times with the Minister about the Dublin position.  The discussions are not ongoing, they are offputting.  It is finished.  There is no question of agreement in Dublin.  The social employment scheme will not operate and I for one as leader of the Fianna Fáil group on Dublin Corporation have given up.  We will not talk about any more ongoing talks.  Will the Minister agree to meet the Dublin City Manager, and perhaps some of the personnel, in order to give the money that would have been allowed to Dublin Corporation under the social employment scheme for the formation of some scheme that would give a similar number of employment opportunities? Obviously, that cannot happen under the social employment scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned discussions are ongoing, because I am informed by the ICTU, who are represented on the monitoring group, that they propose to have this matter resolved. Three unions involved, one of them predominantly and exclusively involved in the Dublin region, have so far refused to allow the operation of the social employment scheme in the Dublin area despite the fact that the conditions which have been offered to that union at the Dublin level have been accepted by the same unions nationally throughout the rest of <Col N="357" /> the country.  The Deputy is aware that the three unions involved have exclusive nominating rights for employment in relation to these jobs.  It is incomprehensible to me that people who have the right to give jobs to people who are currently knocking at their door looking for employment are effectively preventing those jobs from taking place, even though every assurance that has been sought and required by the unions involved at national level had been obtained and is available to them at local level.  In answer to Deputy Ahern's specific request, I am available at any time to meet the County Manager and the City Manager of Dublin, but I think the scheme that has worked for every local authority should be capable of working for Dublin and Dún Laoghaire.  Therefore, I will meet them only on that basis.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy wishes to know about the work of the unit and I am replying on that basis.  The unit's tasks include administration of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, the preparation of legislation for the extension of worker participation in State enterprises and provision of the secretariat for the Advisory Committee on Worker Participation.  In addition, the unit services international organisations, primarily the EC, on matters relating to worker participation.</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied with the progress we have made in relation to the extension to the 1977 Act.  We have <Col N="358" /> reached some difficulties of a technical nature at the drafting stage which I understand are being resolved.  This will provide, among other things, for the extension of the Act to cover a new range of bodies and State organisations and also give the Minister for Labour the power to extend the operation of the Act to all other State companies by agreement with the House.  In addition it will require all State companies, existing ones who have worker-directors and those who will qualify to have worker-directors, to make provision for adequate sub-board structures within their organisation, and to provide on account in their annual report of the progress they have made in relation to worker participation.</P>

      <P>This is my final question on this.  In the event of one of the listed companies now or in future being taken over, with State involvement in that take-over, what will be the position of the worker-directors?  I think the Minister will know what I am talking about.  Will he ensure that the worker-directors' rights under the 1977 Act will be taken into account in any talks in which the State will be involved?</P>

      <P>I think I know what the Deputy is referring to and I appreciate his diplomacy in the way he has referred to it.  I am aware of talks that are ongoing at the moment about possible linkages. He can rest assured that, as far as the Department of Labour and I are concerned, the ground gained in relation to worker-directors and worker participation will be held and any decision that might arise &mdash; no decision so far has been taken &mdash; will take into account fully the position of worker-directors.</P>

I am glad of the Minister's assurance.  It is vital that any agreement writes clearly into it that the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, provisions continue in any amalgamation.</P>

Other bodies, such as the Central Bank and the Economic and Social Research Institute, also undertake reviews of economic developments including employment and unemployment projections.</P>
      <P>Neither my Department nor their associated manpower agencies produce independent forecasts for unemployment but consider the implications of projections made by outside sources for the labour market and the development of manpower policy and programmes.  The most important research exercises carried out by the Department include the annual school leavers survey, the followup survey of school leavers and the analysis of trends of earlier surveys.  In addition the Department analyse data relating to manpower programmes such as those published in their annual reports.

      <P>Does the Minister think that there is merit in the suggestion that the various research units at present involved in compiling information on unemployment and employment opportunities for the future should be centralised?  As I understand it, at the moment there are a number of research units under the Youth Employment Agency, AnCO, the Department of Labour, a section of the Department of Education, a section of the Department of Industry and Commerce, and God knows where else.  Information about them is not easily or readily available in any one or two reports.  That information is collected and is paid for by the taxpayer. It would seem that a proper <Col N="361" /> modern research unit with access to modern technology, which most of them have not got, would be in the interest of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I agree with the Deputy because people undertake research into the labour market for different reasons.  We are speaking about 1.2 million people and I am not aware that there is any difficulty in regard to that information or that the results of the research have been withheld from one group by another.  My worry about centralisation is that, while it looks neat and tidy on paper, the researchers would probably spend more time arguing with each other about how to go about the research than carrying it out.  While I understand the sentiments of the question, there is no proof that his proposals would necessarily be more efficient.  We need greater knowledge and a detailed picture of the labour market and its components and certainly at this stage I could not agree with his suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's reply as I do not know enough about the matter to argue further.  Could the various agencies be compelled by the Minister involved &mdash; not just the Minister for Labour &mdash; to issue an annual report in line with the Department of Labour who were able to publish theirs in four months and on which I congratulate the Minister?  Some agencies tend to circulate some of these reports which contain vital information and which are paid for by the taxpayer three or four years late which is of little benefit to those studying the problem.  Perhaps they could be forced to issue their annual report four or five months after the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is satisfied that the youth levy to date has been properly utilised, and if a high proportion of the fund has been used for job creation purposes or if the fund has merely been used to fund programmes that were in existence prior to the youth levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Youth Employment Act, 1982, the youth levy may be used to fund training and employment programmes for young people.  Since its introduction in April 1982 the levy has been used in this way and I am satisfied that it has been properly utilised.</P>
      <P>The main levy funded activities aimed at reducing the burden of youth unemployment include training, job creation measures for the private sector, the work experience programme, temporary employment programmes and vocational training and preparation programmes.</P>
      <P>Some training, work experience and temporary job creation measures were in existence before the introduction of the levy.  Since its introduction, however, these activities have been significantly expanded and their quality improved.  In addition new programmes have been introduced.  These include: the enterprise allowance scheme run by the National Manpower Service, the community enterprise programme, youth self-employment programme, marketplace, young scientists and technologists programme &mdash; STEP &mdash; European orientation programme, national co-operative farm relief services run or funded by the Youth Employment Agency, the skills foundation programme and the community workshops run by AnCO and the certificate in farming run by ACOT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A measure of the major impact of the levy in improving the employment prospects of young people through training and employment programmes can be obtained by examining participation levels on programmes.  In 1981 just over 22,000 young persons participated in <Col N="363" /> training and employment schemes.  By the end of 1985 this figure had risen to over 66,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the youth employment levy was geared to creating sustainable jobs but that all accept £5 million of the levy is paying for existing courses under the National Manpower Service, AnCO, YEA, ACOT and a number of other agencies and that the amount used to create sustainable jobs is almost negligible?  Does he also accept that, because of that, the principle and the spirit of the Youth Employment Agency Act, 1981, have been totally defeated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Act has been totally defeated although the Deputy is probably right in saying that many people expected it to result in direct employment. When the Labour Party devised the Youth Employment Agency we expected them to provide jobs.  The research done and the decisions taken by the board of the Youth Employment Agency which comprises representatives from various sectors, employers, the Congress of Trade Unions, farming organisations and young people indicated that the major barrier to employment for young people then, as now, related fundamentally to their skills and training levels.  Therefore, the vast amount of money raised by the levy was put into training schemes and the Deputy is mistaken if he thinks that it was simply a substitute for money already spent.  The programmes in general were substantially increased over those operating in 1981 and, in some cases, new programmes were created.</P>

      <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 8, but in Part III, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8&mdash;There shall be established a body which shall be known as the Dublin Walled City Development Authority.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody doubts that the core of Dublin is in grave decline because of city's life blood and <i>raison d'être</i> are based on commerce between members of a peaceful community.  If you take the commerce away from the core of a city it is like a leech on the city's commercial life.  It also triggers massive infrastructural expenditure in relation to roads, sewerage and services which were previously available in the city centre.  Therefore, new funds have to be found to provide for such infrastructure and that has not been borne in mind in relation to these designated areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the proposal before us in this section, the city can be compared to a tree: when the core dies the tree perishes.  It declines before it perishes and we had an example of that in Dutch Elm disease which affected so many trees over the past few years.  That is also the case in relation to the city.  You can plant a new tree.  Only severe human folly will fully destroy a city.  A city can only regenerate itself by prudent investment at the right time following bold and audacious decisions.  This may be a step in that <Col N="408" /> direction but I do not see why it could not encompass this innovation idea.  The Minister is giving himself power in the Bill to create other designated areas.  By investing in the city centre and in the old mediaeval areas we can make the city more attractive.  It is vital, as Con Power of the CII said, that the stamp of quality is put on everything done under this new scheme.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the centre of Dublin resembles a doughnut.  What encourages a person to buy a doughnut is the filling in the middle, be it jam or sugar.  If we liken Dublin to a doughnut we do not find anything in the centre except dereliction and decay.  The city is teetering into the Liffey.  There is nothing to attract tourists to Dublin.  This is a great shame on the fathers of the city, the members of the local authority, and on us.</P>
    <P>This legislation is designed to revitalise the city.  However, we are just doing what has been done many times in the past. We have designated an area and, apart from giving various incentives to invest in it, we leave it up to the developers and speculators to think of ideas.</P>
    <P>The quays are in tatters.  They are a disgrace.  Dublin Corporation adopted a policy in the past of not doing anything about them but rather waited for developers to think of schemes for them.  The British architectural body, in a study undertaken over 20 years ago when they looked at the jewel which Dublin is, said that Dublin would be judged on what it does with the quays.  Dublin Corporation did not do anything except bring one of our eminent citizens to court over Wood Quay and insisted on building what everyone regards as two massive bunkers which block out the view of Christ Church Cathedral.  They would not allow time for the proper excavation of the remains of Viking Dublin.</P>
    <P>We can see what happens as a result of having a wide street programme.  At least in the 18th century when they spoke about having wide streets, those parts of Dublin had not been built.  Now these wide streets go right through the heart of the city.  They go through the Liberties and other mediaeval areas.  I do not see <Col N="409" /> why the track of the old wall should not be exposed.  Within that area we could encourage the kind of things one would expect in old Dublin which has a very rich history.  This has been done on the Continent in other walled cities and towns.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of good, basic, cheap, efficient transport.  Deputy Mac Giolla made this point earlier.  This is one of the keys to the revitalisation of Dublin.  It makes the centre of the city more accessible. There were plans to build a subway system.  Had this been done in the fifties we would now regard the amount spent on it as being very little.  With the high inflation of the seventies the building of such a system would have cost a fortune. There is one last opportunity, based on the scheme CIE have of building bus stations in the city centre.  This scheme is supported by the FUE and the city centre businesses.  It is also supported by An Taisce.</P>
    <P>Those who write about Dublin criticised the Government recently for trying to attract development to a part of the city which is not being developed. Growth in the city is towards the west, towards Heuston station.  No-one in their right minds would invest in the docks area.  The place to invest is in the other designated area along the quays.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burkes's idea should be taken up.  The concept is a good one and I hope the Minister will not say that because it comes from the Opposition it cannot be considered.  It is constructive Opposition at its best.  We need a springboard from which to create the rebirth of the city. Such a springboard is a public transportation centre which would have a phased income of funds from the private sector.</P>
    <P>The real jewel in the crown of Dublin would be to tackle the mediaeval area. Enough of it exists to save it.  I welcome Deputy Brady back into the House.  He has given the lead on many environmental and urban renewal issues.  I have despaired of the life of Dublin to such an extent that I could not bring myself to read Frank McDonald's book.  I cannot bear to turn the pages because I know what I will see written on them.  It is a <Col N="410" /> tale of woe, of scandal and shame.  There is nothing in it to be proud of.</P>
    <P>In the last number of years, in spite of all our troubles, we are fortunate to have had many schemes put forward, many with the help of the EC and there are hundreds of millions of pounds floating around.  I have heard calls in this House for all of these schemes to be put under one umbrella.  If we were to examine the various schemes that are available we would have to question how the money is being spent.  If about £5 million was taken out of the total each year to finance a definite plan, we could do wonders. This is probably the last opportunity we will get.  I am glad to see that there are people who think like this in the upper echelons of the main Opposition party because, in the event of an election and the Coalition not being returned to Government, we still have some hope for the future and that is very important in the light of the knocking that goes on in here.</P>

      <P>We have to face facts.  We will give Fianna Fáil a good run for their money and hope that we get back.  I am just making the point that this is a positive, constructive contribution.  What I am suggesting would not be a blot on this map, produced courtesy of <i>The Irish Times</i> on 27 March.  I would go so far as to suggest that it should have been the first to be put on it.  Long term investment in the docks area is questionable.  Within hours of the docks area being designated, the top property people gave it the thumbs down.  Developers are not anxious to spend money there because it is not where the action is.  One will notice that Irish Life have not proceeded with their scheme across the river from the Custom House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="411" /> Every history book I have ever picked up has got a map of old Dublin in it similar to the one on the wall here beside the Malton prints of the 17th century. The old city is delineated very clearly and buildings can still be seen in it which are referred to as being &ldquo;within&rdquo; or &ldquo;without&rdquo; and this refers to whether they were within the walls or outside the walls of the city.  Children looking at these do not understand this and wonder why it is that they cannot get in touch with that part of their heritage.  A long time ago, maybe 20 years ago, my wife who was teaching in the national school in the north inner-city, brought the children on tours around the different streets to show them our heritage of old buildings, old Georgian houses and so on.  She was criticised and reprimanded for doing this and told that that was not really part of our heritage, probably because it came down to us from the British.</P>
    <P>I often wonder is that the reason we let everything go to rack and ruin.  A lot of the good things came down to us from pre-Irish Parliament days.  We should take this amendment on board, if not in its entirety, at least in principle.  The Minister has the power to declare an area to be a designated area where he is satisfied there is a special need to promote urban renewal therein and may, by such order, describe such area in whatever manner he sees fit.  The power is there and we are not asking him to spend money on it immediately.</P>

      <P>He has the power to do this under this section and to put this amendment into effect.  It could focus the attention of the various bodies, the old Dublin groups and the voluntary groups who work within the city on that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need a transportation system, and we need it fast.  We need easy access to the city because such massive development has taken place on the periphery of the city.  There are probably people who have been born and reared to an <Col N="412" /> advanced young age, many to their teens, on the outskirts of the city who have made very rare trips to the centre because it is so difficult and expensive and so awkward, and when one gets there it is difficult to get around it.  Let us not forget that, if this section is taken on board, it is the one which will give the cultural boost to the city because there will be a definite place for people to go and to tramp around.</P>
    <P>The most enjoyable period I ever had in Dublin was during my days of anonymity when I was able to trample around the different side streets and back lanes and cobble-stoned areas of Dublin city.  I often listened to the competitions that took place in the pubs among Dubliners to identify particular streets or lanes and so on.  That was an old game that was played and some of these places are mentioned in this section.  I would therefore ask the Minister to consider this proposal. I hope to get an opportunity later to put forward reasons and ways to develop these designated areas in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I have tried many times in the past, and could not believe I could get such opposition from my own side of the House, to put forward ideas for the development of Dublin city and its revitalisation. What does not seem to be accepted is that it can create literally tens of thousands of jobs if we take a step in rebuilding our city.  We can benefit while rebuilding it.  It is negative to do nothing but say it will come right.  That is what has happened to Dublin city; it has been left to rot.  One can pay £5 to see houses of lesser quality, in, for example, the city of York, where they have preserved and refurbished such houses.  We have termed these as rubbish, bulldozed them and put up something new.</P>

      <P>We have had a long discussion on amendment No. 3 which proposes that there shall be established an authority which shall be known as the Dublin Walled City Development Authority. The Minister in his response said he has designated that area and that designation on its own, with the package of measures which he introduces such as <Col N="413" /> rates relief and other tax breaks will be sufficient to bring forth the type of regeneration which everybody admits will be required.  I suggest strongly that for years the corporation have had the opportunity, with their development plans and all the other facilities about which the Minister has been talking, other than the tax breaks, to cause and bring about a redevelopment and regeneration of that area.  That procedure has failed and been seen to have failed miserably.  What are required are the very special powers that are being brought in under the Development Authority Bill and being used on the Custom House Docks site.  If those special powers are seen to be needed to bring about the redevelopment of the north of the city approximately 300 or 400 yards from O'Connell Bridge equally they are required 300 or 400 yards from O'Connell Bridge on the south side of the river, in what was the heart of old Dublin.</P>

      <P>There is no logic in saying that one needs development authority powers for what is practically a virgin site, which is the Custom House Docks site, and does not need them in what is a very complicated area for redevelopment because of the myriad of ownerships, the complications of the corporation's plans for the area with road reservations and so forth over the years. What is needed is the very special treatment of a development authority in that area.  The whole effect will be to shine a spotlight on the area, to give the development authority the power to come up with the programmes and manage them to allow for regeneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give the example of the new towns around our city, of Blanchardstown, Clondalkin and Tallaght.  Let us take first the example of Tallaght.  This is probably the most developed as far as the number of houses being built in the area is concerned.  I firmly believe that a major mistake was made in the construction of Tallaght.  It was left to the planners who designed a new town.  Tallaght today, if <Col N="414" /> it had had a new town authority with special responsibility for Tallaght itself in its development as a new town, would not just consist of housing.  We would have all the social infrastructure, the shopping areas and everything else needed.  A development authority would have concentrated their minds on the development of the area.  So it is again, with regard to the regeneration of the old walled city area.  It is absolutely essential that we do not continue with the mechanisms which have failed since the foundation of this State.  They have not brought about the type of city that we all cry out for as Dubliners, that we want to see. The city has been crumbling around us.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been given an opportunity in this Bill and I am asking him to take it.  I am offering him the support of this side of the House to extend his development powers into this area and establish a development authority.  The need for these extra powers is evident to anybody who walks or drives through the parts of Dublin I have included in the amendment.  They are the areas in amendment No. 18 which we are discussing here.  They are names that ring into our history &mdash; Grattan Bridge, Cork Hill, Dame Street, Parliament Street, Palace Street, Ship Street Little, Werburgh Street, Bride Street, St. Nicholas Place, John Dillon Street, Lamb Alley, Cornmarket, Thomas Street.  These are areas which are synonymous with this country, not just with this city.  They have everything to do with this country; they need very special treatment, indeed.  I am asking the Minister to take on to himself those powers.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to my colleague, Deputy Skelly, for his complimentary remarks about the forward thinking on this side of the House and for his plea to his own Minister to accept the amendment, despite the fact that it comes from this side of the House.  If it is a question of not being seen to accept a Fianna Fáil amendment, I am quite prepared to withdraw mine, allow the Minister to bring forward his own amendment on Report Stage and take whatever political kudos are involved.  The case for doing <Col N="415" /> what is proposed in my amendment is unanswerable.</P>
    <P>We are discussing amendments Nos. 18 and 19 in association with amendment No. 3 and I want to make the case in relation to the general question of the powers in the Bill to establish further development authorities.  The Minister, in responding, did not reply on this point. He has restricted himself to designating areas but only establishing one development authority in the case of the Custom House Docks site.  He is tying his own hands.  He is making a major error in not giving himself the facility in the future, without having to refer back to this House with amending legislation, to establish development authorities in other parts of the country, if he so decides.  he might decide to establish one in part of Limerick, or in Cork as we had intended.  He might decide to pick a specific portion of a town which is of such historic uniqueness of character that it requires this very special treatment.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept amendment No. 19 because, even if he does not want to do this immediately, it will give him or some of his successors, whoever they may be, the facility in the future to establish development authorities.  I appeal to him, as a representative in this House of the area &mdash; many parts of it anyway &mdash; of the walled city about which we are talking.  He has represented this area down through the years.  I ask the Minister, as a former Lord Mayor of Dublin and a man who has a deep feeling for his city, to accept this amendment for the establishment of a Dublin walled city development authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely about the special features of the walled city area and with many of the points made by Deputy Skelly and Deputy Burke.  It is a very special area of the city and requires very special treatment.  For that reason its treatment should not be equated with the manner in which the Custom House Docks site would be <Col N="416" /> treated.  In that area one can do everything to bring about commercial development and provided one adheres to a general plan one has a free hand.  One can dig down as far as one likes and put in whatever type of foundation one wishes.  If we are looking for commercial development in the walled city area, we have to make very special restrictions. The Minister mentioned the site beside Taylor's Hall in High Street where commercial development was likely.  I think it is still on the map.  About three years ago there was to be a hotel developed. Very detailed examination of the site was carried out.  Part of it had been excavated about ten years ago.  Another portion had not been excavated.  The important feature was to ensure that, if a building was constructed there, the foundation would be placed in such a manner that it would not interfere with the unexcavated site so that future generations, in 100 or 200 years time, could still excavate the site and find it in its untouched state beneath this building.</P>
      <P>One cannot just bring in a commercial company and tell them to construct a building, a hotel or whatever.  Restrictions have to be put on and these will cost money.  There will not be a rush of developments because of those restrictions. Over the past ten years all of these sites should have been archaeologically investigated and excavated.  The money is not available and that is why it is not being done.  Every site, even along the quays, should be tested.  If they are of any value the National Museum should do the archaeological dig.  If the money cannot be provided special restrictions and building regulations should be made in that area to make sure that no site which has not yet been excavated will be disturbed in the construction.  So that if we cannot do the archaeological work, future generations can do the digs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Skelly mentioned the walled area.  If work is to be done there, we would need to have continual excavation to trace the exact position of the wall.  A whole series of things must be done.  To develop the vacant site, special restrictions would have to be made.  For that <Col N="417" /> reason I do not think we can just set up a development authority.  It needs a separate development, but it could not be given the same terms of reference as would be given to the Custom House Docks site.  There would need to be very special restrictions and features.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the previous speaker I find this a fresh approach for the city.  I cannot see any reason why a development authority could not be set up.  Unless we get away from the jaded systems that are perceived to be unworkable, inefficient and cumbersome, we will not attract private enterprise into these areas.  The thrust behind this amendment is an endeavour to encourage private enterprise, to encourage young people, to try to encourage a fresh approach to tackling the inner city problems.  At the founding of the State we inherited a city that was well in a state of decay, even though it was a city that was very well set out as far as open spaces, its central river, open parkland, and so on, were concerned. Many of the buildings up to 50 years ago were in a state of rapid decay. It was patently obvious that as years went by the problem would have to be tackled and should have been tackled in tandem with development as it took place.  We are now at a critical stage where much development has taken place without concern for the previous layout of the city.  Radical action has to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose behind this amendment is to encourage that type of strong collective action.  The previous infrastructural systems have failed in effect.  It is better to admit that they have failed in the minds of people who live in our capital city from the point of view of environmental ecological reasons, for traffic reasons or the difficulty in trying to encourage people into the city centre.  All of these factors combine to point to the central fact that the local authority, with the very best will in the world, cannot cope with the problem.  This amendment is at least finger-pointing a particular area.  It is pointing an archaeological unit structure core from which we can work.  The city has grown out from that area.  It is a <Col N="418" /> tremendous opportunity.  I compliment my colleague, Deputy Ray Burke, and concur fully with him that this side of the House sees the issue as political.  There is no reason whatsoever why we would wish to foist any amendment or pressurise it through for any reason.  The Minister could think about this and come back later with the intention of establishing or extending this idea.  He would have the entire support of interested parties, preservationists and those who have a deep scientific knowledge of the entire area.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister realises that the city is very rich in its heritage of street trading right back to the 17th century.  A whole range of opportunities exists to project not only, as has been spoken about at great lengths, the Viking and Norman parts of the city, but also the mediaeval and later parts through the 17th and 18th centuries.  It is all there in archaeological layers and is of great significance.  That should be developed and put on show.</P>
    <P>I am not one who suggests the creation of quangos or groups that do not get involved in any activity, but I suggest that the Minister advocate the appointment of a Minister for the capital city.  Dublin Corporation could be under that ministry. The local authority seem to be working to Peter's principle as far as the powers vested in them are concerned. They have done so much and do not appear to be capable of projecting into the nineties in regard to the scale of preservation the people want.  Some examples that spring to mind are St. Audoen's Church and the many parks.  Many good ideas have emerged from interested parties.</P>
    <P>Earlier I stressed the importance of appointing key personnel to Dublin Corporation such as a city architect and a city archaeologist.  If they are not appointed we must create a new forum for ideas, the idea behind the amendment.  I accept that the Custom House Docks site is an important one and that it represents a fresh plot for development, but it does not compare with the walled city of Dublin.  Very few realise that the principal street of Dublin was Cook Street, <Col N="419" /> down from Fishamble Street.  All the information about that area is listed in the paper I have referred to.</P>
    <P>It is important to draw the attention of the Minister to the concern among people about the huge number of artefacts that have been removed from the Wood Quay site.  Those items which could fill a museum on their own are lying in the National Museum and have not been chronicled.  They represent only a fragment of the archaeological treasure that lies within that area of Dublin.  We should try to do something about that because, if the opportunity is not snatched now, when will it arise again?  We seldom get an opportunity to discuss such matters. We may table questions or ask Private Notice Questions if Dublin Corporation happen to damage the mediaeval wall or the monument as occurred recently.  On that occasion Dublin Corporation had to admit they damaged the wall but that body did not have an archaeologist to survey the damage.  I will be disappointed if the opportunity to adopt the proposal in the amendment is not grasped.  We must remember that one-third of the population of the country reside in Dublin and that this work will be carried out for the sake of the nation.  Dublin city belongs to everybody.</P>
    <P>Private enterprise should get involved in this work and start by erecting small shops within the old city walls.  We should go further than giving rates or tax relief to those who get involved.  Many people, not just civil servants, are interested in doing something for the city. They are not enmeshed in the bureaucratic entanglements of national or local politics.  Many people who return home after spending years abroad ask what they can do to preserve the old city.  This work should be highlighted internationally particularly in the wake of the Wood Quay saga.  At that time we established that we have a city of international renown, that had flourishing industries within its walls many years ago.</P>
    <P>Big industries do not seem to function too well in Ireland and small industries <Col N="420" /> appear to give a certain amount of protection to employees.  The Government could give a great lead in this regard as far as the development of the inner city is concerned.  I do not want to see this issue politicised in any way.  That is not the intention behind the amendment.  We are giving the Minister an opportunity to shake up Dublin city.  He should call on other agencies to help.  We should not pussyfoot about this but single out those who for one reason or another have the will to get involved.  The Minister should encourage private enterprise to invest money in improving our city.</P>

      <P>On the contrary, for the first time somebody is getting Dublin's inner city by the neck and giving it a shake.  We cannot compare the different sites but they are all of great importance.  With regard to the designated area running along the quays, I should like to point out that the mediaeval portion of that city is within that area and is under the control of either the corporation, the Office of Public Works or some other statutory body.  Some Members do not appear to have confidence in the local planning authority and suggest that they caused havoc in the area but I disagree with that.  Some people are saying that Dublin is tumbling into the river but I do not hold that view.  I accept that Dublin has its problems but it also has great charm around College Green and Merrion Square.  The parks throughout the city are a monument to a progressive local authority.</P>

      <P>In regard to housing the local authority have done a magnificant job in erecting houses in the inner <Col N="421" /> city.  I draw the attention of the House to schemes at City Quay, the Coombe, Ringsend and Pearse Street.  The renewal work carried out there was excellent.  I want to put on the record, for fear that someone might feel there was a shower of vandals wrecking the city, that is not the case.  I am not against the setting up of a commission or authority whether in Cork or Dublin if it is necessary.  What I am saying is we have set up this designated area.  The local authority felt they would be the best authority and were not opposed in any great way to the statutory authority on the port and docks site.  It is a huge site requiring tremendous development and some sort of special authority. It will act as a catalyst for both sides of the quays.  There is now dereliction on the south side of the quay at the lower end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It will act as a catalyst. The reason we felt that a statutory authority was required in the ports and docks site is its vastness.  It is a type of development which has not been undertaken before.  To get it moving, it required this type of authority.  I do not believe the same is required in the mediaeval walled city.</P>

      <P>A different type of treatment and approach is required. Whatever we might say about the local authority and the question of Wood Quay, we all learn lessons.  I know an entrepreneur who is in the process of building a factory in and about that area for which he has planning permission. Before he got planning permission he had to excavate and to get and give a report. There is a greater concern on the part of the local authority before granting permission that there will be no despoiling of any archaelogical remains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take Deputy Mac Giolla's point that if we cannot do it now, it should be preserved for the future.  That is what the <Col N="422" /> local authority are doing before planning permissions are granted.  As I mentioned earlier, they have asked the mediaeval society to indicate to them their views with regard to the formulation of a draft development plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Archaelogical finds in Dublin have gone unreported because they would hold up progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disputing that, but what I am saying is that there is a far greater awareness of that now than heretofore.  No matter what body we set up, that could still happen.  The Deputy knows that as well as I do because if an entrepreneur wants to do something like that, he can do so if he so desires.  I would hope there would be the right spirit in a particular area of the city.</P>
      <P>The local authority's approach is now one of enlightenment.  They are concerned that what is there will be preserved. What I want to see is good development which will be in character with the area.  Surely to goodness, a local authority as the planning authority can lay down their criteria for that as a special commission could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State recommend a city archaeologist for that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter, in fairness, for the local authority.  We do not recommend to local authorities what staff they require as the Deputies well know as former incumbents of the Custom House.  The local authorities are the people who tend to make the case and that is the way it should be if they are intended to be local authorities having some form of self-determination. Given that we have taken the great majority of what the Deputy is looking for within the designated area and under the control of the local authority as the planning authority, they can do a job in planning and directing the type of development which should be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason why we cannot look at this in the future.  I want to say here <Col N="423" /> and now that I am opposed to putting into the Act that we could designate areas for commissions in any part of the country. If we impose a commission or a statutory authority on any area, it is incumbent on us to lay the proposals before the House to have them properly discussed.  I am against the idea that, by order, we can set up something removing the rights of the local authority.  When I was involved in the working party one of the concerns and reservations I had was about removing planning from the local authority in the port and docks site.  That is a fact of life and it is something I had to exercise my conscience on.  If we set up commissions or statutory authorities, they should be thought out and brought before this House so that it can be specifically explained how we are going to go about them, how they are going to be funded and developed.  It should be done through legislation.  That is my strongly held view and I will not depart from that. It is only right that, if we are to remove powers from local authorities we do it in this House.</P>
    <P>I accept the thrust of the argument made on the far side of the House.  I am as concerned about that part of the city &mdash; I have represented it for a number of years &mdash; as everybody else.  I hold the view that it can be done with the kind of generous incentives that are there.  When incentives are reasonably generous you can attract low density business into an area.  It does not have to be high density to make a profit.  There is the write-off on the building, the rates and the double rent relief, all of which make it possible to create a climate for good development. It was Con Power who said we should put the stamp of good developments in all of these areas.  I go along with that fully.  It is important that wherever we develop in the designated areas, they should be buildings of high quality and esteem which will be a credit to our capital city.</P>
    <P>Because it is the capital city of Ireland we are doing this.  We owe it to the city to ensure that whatever we do is properly developed with good quality.  Only time will tell whether we were wise to proceed <Col N="424" /> in this way or whether we should have accepted the Opposition's amendment. Both our hearts are probably in the right place with regard to the area.  It is a question of emphasis &mdash; whether we should have an authority or leave it to the local authority.  On this occasion I come down on the side of the local authority. I might have a change of mind on that in a couple of years if I did not see it was working right, or if the faith I had in them was not justified.  As I see it now, I must trust the local authority.  They may have made mistakes in the past but lessons have been learned and the future of that area will be as well handled by this local authority as it would be by any other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House further on this point.  The Minister said we were suggesting there is some destructive hand at work in this. We are proposing a benign hand to take care of the development of the old walled city.  The Minister says the corporation can do it because much of the property is owned by the corporation and the Office of Public Works.  Why then has it not been done?  Is it because there have not been incentives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The old Dublin walled city deserves special treatment.  The Minister agreed that it is an area of great charm.  It has potential for great development with galleries, restaurants, shopping arcades, etc. Havoc has been wrought in that area in the past 100 years and it can be plainly seen today.  I have no objection to the local authorities participating in the work of the development authority but rather than leaving this to the corporation or the Office of Public Works the site should get the special attention of the development authority which we are proposing in the amendment.  The Minister said he can look at it in the future, have a look at it in a couple of years.  That would be another two years lost.  How can anybody with any knowledge of the destruction being wrought in Dublin and who has seen the continuing decline and decay, say he is happy there will not be further destruction if we wait another couple of <Col N="425" /> years?  He says he is happy to let the incentives work through the system.</P>
    <P>What is needed is a concentration of minds on the old walled city, and that can be done only by the type of authority responsible for the Custom House Docks site.  We are suggesting an authority should be set up for the old walled city. Deputy Mac Giolla said such development would be piecemeal, with a promoter coming in to develop a hotel and that he would be asked to dig in advance of planning permission.  That is not the type of development we need.  The officers of the corporation are very busy men with a whole city under their care. They do not have time to concentrate their minds on the redevelopment of the centre city area.  If they had that time we would have seen development and regeneration before now.</P>
    <P>The development we suggest would require day-to-day supervision.  You cannot build a new town like Tallaght, for instance, by laying out a plan and saying to a developer: &ldquo;You may build in that field but in the field adjoining we will build a road&rdquo;.  There should have been a new town commission for Tallaght which would have been responsible for providing a whole social structure side by side with housing development.</P>
    <P>The sort of regeneration we want in the old Dublin city has not taken place because there has not been a concentration of minds.  The Minister has assured us that his heart is in the right place and that he has a general feeling of support in the House.  He says he may be convinced about the need for this amendment in a couple of years.  We are asking him not to delay for a couple of years, and therefore his suggestion seems to be appalling. <Col N="426" /> We must do it now not only for this but for future generations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have a vote of no confidence in the local authority in Dublin.  I believe they can do the job well.  We seem to be getting mixed up. Because we have a statutory authority in one area we are looking for one in another.  In the other area we have to avoid delay and we require, therefore, very careful planning.  We will agree that there are no better people than the planning authority to look after the walled city area.  I agree that I would not be averse to change but for the moment we should proceed in the manner we have proposed.  The planning authority are the best people to do it.  It would be different if a statutory authority were to come in and develop the area out of their own resources, but development will still have to depend on private enterprise developing in a planned way.  The planning authority can lay down criteria and lay down conditions as to how deep we can dig into the ground.  I do not understand the fears expressed here.</P>
      <P>The special authority suggested would seem to be all right but the practicality is that the local authority are more capable of doing this effectively.  The corporation will have a special staff for such work like all five county boroughs.  Such staff will have special responsibility for planning and development of designated areas. There will be no question of development not being done in a delicate and efficient way.  It will not be a case of Tweedledum and Tweedledee.</P>

      <P>In page 6, subsection (2), line 34, to delete &ldquo;four&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;six&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to the operation by the authority of the proposed Custom House Docks site.  The Minister suggests that the authority should consist of a chairman and four ordinary members. My amendment suggests six ordinary members for a number of reasons.  With a committee consisting of a chairman and four ordinary members, human nature being what it is, it may be difficult to get a quorum.  The authority would be far more efficient if there were six ordinary members.  This would give the Minister the opportunity to invite onto the authority a greater range of experts &mdash; architects, businessmen and so on.  I ask him <Col N="430" /> to accept this amendment.  It is not an earth-shattering proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would increase from four to six the number of ordinary members on the board.  Basically, I am opposed to large boards; the smaller the board the more efficient they are.  What I want is an executive rather than a representative body to get the work done and to secure the development of this site as quickly as possible.  This can best be done by a chairman and four ordinary members.  I am interested in keeping this board to as reasonable a number as possible and therefore I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>To suggest that changing the board from four to six is to set up a large body which will be unable to operate is ludicrous.  I am giving the Minister an opportunity to make the board more efficient by expanding the potential range of expertise which will be available to him.  I am not talking about a representative or representatives of anybody.  I am talking about the Minister's capacity to select the best from the wide range of expertise available in the city of Dublin and the country to run this authority and this unique site.</P>
      <P>As I have explained, from my knowledge and the Minister's of life on committees and boards &mdash; many of us are on them &mdash; for efficiency, for operation and decision making and to have an adequate number for a quorum etc., six would appear to be a better number.  I will not delay the House on this.  I regret that the Minister is taking such a tough line on a relatively minor amendment.  Somehow or other he has this feeling that all wisdom lies in the Minister and Minister of State for the time being so advised by his officials in the Custom House.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Burke that an authority of six would probably be a better number.  I had experience of large groups as compared with smaller authorities.  I was in the Isle of Man recently and I saw that they work very efficiently with committees of three. If you have the right people then the smaller the authority the better.  If the Minister can get four people representing different interests and a chairman, that committee could work as well as if not better than a committee of seven people.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), to delete lines 26 to 31 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(v) to provide such infrastructure and to carry out such works of amenity development or environmental improvements as, in the opinion of the Authority, may be required to encourage:</P>
      <P>(I) the development of public and private housing,</P>
      <P>(II) the industrial development of the area, based, in so far as is practicable on the resources of the area, and to provide secure jobs, particularly for the people of the area,</P>
      <P>(III) the provision of shopping and recreational facilities.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="432" /> Whatever about the whole idea behind creating a new authority to deal with the site, I am concerned about the approach that such an authority would adopt to developing that site.  I was surprised to read in the official journal of the Construction Industry Federation in February 1986 on page 61 that &ldquo;the Department of the Environment and Dublin Corporation have agreed that no public housing should be built in the Custom House Docks site as Dublin's north inner city suffers many community problems due to a huge concentration of existing public housing.&rdquo;  If on the one hand we are talking about regenerating that area of the city we should be doing so in terms of regenerating it for the benefit of the people of the city, particularly those living in that area already. That is why Deputy Mac Giolla and I have put down this amendment.  Section 9 (1) (a) (v) reads:</P>
    <P>to provide such infrastructure and to carry out such works of amenity development or environmental improvement as, in the opinion of the Authority, may be required to encourage people to work, shop or reside in that Area or otherwise to use the facilities provided in that Area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle will agree with me when I say there is no problem whatsoever in encouraging the ordinary people of this city to live in that area if housing is provided in that area by the local authority, but it is virtually impossible to get a local authority house in the inner city of Dublin.  In most cases well in excess of 100 points are needed to get a house in the inner city.  Compare that with the Tallaght area at the moment where a house can be got for 12 points and the disparity between the demand for housing in the inner city and in the outer suburbs can be seen.  Therefore, there is no problem in encouraging people to live in the area.</P>
    <P>However, in this section of the Bill we appear to be talking about encouraging people other than local authority tenants <Col N="433" /> to live in the area.  That is the clear implication of that section.  Perhaps the Minister can clarify the report in the CIF journal of February and whether agreement has been reached that no local authority housing will be built on that site. It seems that if we pursue this line of approach to developing that site we are creating a new kind of ghetto.  In the Sheriff Street area people on very low incomes with very poor job prospects in a very poor environment in terms of facilities and so on are in a ghetto.  If we proceed to develop purely private apartment style living in that area, we will be creating a ghetto at the other extreme of our society, a ghetto for the rich, so to speak.  I would be concerned about any part of the city becoming the full preserve of any income bracket.</P>
    <P>I have argued at Dublin Corporation level that housing in Dublin should be provided on the basis of need rather than income level, residential qualification and so on.  The idea has always obtained that we should have a social mix, as it is called.  The popular idea is that we build a corporation housing estate here and a so-called private estate there and that is supposed to create a social mix.  It does not.  Practically all experience in the city over the years has shown that it does not create a social mix.  It would create a social mix if the housing built by local authorities, or by private builders if we want to push it in that direction, were available to persons whether on the housing list or not, purely on the basis of need. If they can afford to buy a house and can get a loan from the HFA or a building society, well and good.  If they cannot afford to buy, they get the house on differential rent from the local authority. That would require a major new approach to housing provision in the city.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in this amendment I am arguing that at least the principle be accepted that public and private housing be provided on this site, that there be no exclusive building of private apartments, as would seem to be the intention.  At present quite a large number of people who want to live in the inner city cannot live there because the houses are not <Col N="434" /> there.  In other words, the people who need housing and cannot afford to buy a place cannot live in the inner city unless the corporation provide a house or a flat for them there.  This is an ideal opportunity to provide public housing in the inner city.</P>
    <P>The people about whom we are talking about displacing &mdash; let us not put it too thinly because in this Bill we are talking about displacing people living in that area in local authority houses or flats &mdash; will have no say whatever in the authority being established to decide what goes on on that site.  There is no local community representation on it.  The corporation, who are responsible for public housing in the city, have only a consultative role in the development.  Normal planning procedures are being overridden by this Bill. These points are important in support of the amendment I am putting down in relation to housing.</P>
    <P>Another point in my amendment is the encouragment of industrial jobs on the site.  Experience in other cities, especially in London, has been that when dockland sites are redeveloped in this way &mdash; my understanding is that this proposal is largely taken from the London experience &mdash; mostly white collar jobs are provided. In the vast majority of cases, the jobs located on such sites will not be new but relocated from outlying industrial estates or other factories around the city, presumably because of the various incentives in relation to rates and so on.</P>
    <P>There is an inbuilt discrimination against the local population as a result of this development because people living in the area will not have the skills to fill the jobs provided on such sites.  A number of studies and assessments have been made of the unemployment problem in the inner city area and it is clear that the vast majority of people unemployed in that area are unskilled or have manual or industrial skills.  That is why I argue that there should be an emphasis by the authority which we are setting up for this area in the Bill in regard to industrial jobs on the site.</P>
    <P>A number of other points also need to be considered, including the question of <Col N="435" /> encouraging development along the lines of the Bill, although there is no reference in it to the money which will be provided to develop the site.  Judging from the experience in London and similar areas in Britain, most of the investment comes from the State.  It would be wrong for the State to have to provide the bulk of the investment to develop this site while, at the same time, encouraging discrimination against the local population in regard to jobs and housing on the site.  In London the investment ratios have been as low as £1 from the State and £3 from the private sector and, in some cases, £1 from the State and £7 from the private sector.  However, the State must lead in all cases in relation to investment and presumably it is only when the project is seen to be taking off that the private investor comes in.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to accept the amendment and to indicate what status the statement in the CIF journal has that a deal has been made excluding public sector housing from the site.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy De Rossa's concern that this section setting down the functions of the authority should be made clear because there should be no ambiguity in regard to it. Amendment No. 6 in my name says that in performing the functions assigned to it, an urban development authority shall, as far as practicable, maintain a balance within its functional area as between housing, industrial, commercial, social, amenity and other development.  The wording proposed by the Minister in the Bill is far too loose.  There is not enough emphasis on the specifics and I share the view that we must have a balance in housing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We may discuss them together.  My aims and those of Deputy De Rossa are very similar.  I do not want the site to become one commercial blob <Col N="436" /> without any consideration for the housing or amenity needs of the area.  It is essential to specify to the authority that they must operate within certain guidelines.  I want to see that there is a balance within the functional area of housing.  There should be private and public housing on the site.  They must decide the level and density of housing but there should be a mixture because, for far too long, the inner city area was associated with public housing to the exclusion of private housing.</P>
      <P>I do not want the balance to tilt the other way so that there will be only private houses.  There is room for a marriage of the two and, in giving the authority their instructions when they are established, it is important to specify that there must be a balance in the housing area. We also want to see a balance in so far as industrial units are concerned, I do not want to see the site covered with factories because it is a unique site, only a couple of hundred yards from O'Connell Bridge. It is an opportunity to hand on to the next generation a redeveloped area and it is incumbent on us to do it properly.</P>
      <P>We must have a balance which will be correct from a planning, living and employment point of view.  Therefore, there must be public and private housing, industrial units to provide jobs on the site and for the area generally and shopping arcades.  I should like to see something on the lines of the Wharf project in Boston and other cities.  There should be good commercial development on the lines of the Powerscourt centre although it could be bigger on this site.  There should also be social activities and amenity projects as far as open space and recreational facilities are concerned.  It is a unique site and the section dealing with the guidelines and functions of the authority is far too loose.  This would be wise to accept the amendments before him to tighten his guidelines because his proposals are far too vague.  The Minister needs to be more specific.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in a number of cities in Europe but no city has seen the progress which we have made in local <Col N="437" /> authority housing in the inner city area. The local authority have developed some very prime sites.  This programme began under the 1973-1977 Government with the development of City Quay.  That stands out as a prime development.  In no other city would that site have been given for public housing.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy De Rossa regarding points.  The last house on City Quay was given out for 72 points and I understand that the number of points required for the north side of the inner city is 60.  The Government and Dublin Corporation intend to continue that policy of public housing.</P>
      <P>I do not believe we have to build local authority housing everywhere.  Certain sections of the city can be excluded. Deputy De Rossa did not do justice to those living in the inner city.  There are many people who have second-level education and, indeed, on my side of the city many have third-level.  They would be well qualified to work on any development which takes place in the inner city.</P>

      <P>Not always.  Section 9 deals with the functions of the Authority and imposes a general duty on the Authority to secure the redevelopment of the Custom House Docks area.  Paragraph (v) will enable the Authority to provide such infrastructure and carry out such amenity or environmental improvement works as are necessary to encourage people to work, shop or live in the area or otherwise to use the facilities that will be provided.  Initially the Authority will help to prepare the site for redevelopment, do any necessary clearance work and provide the infrastructure.  What is to be built on the site will be published in a plan made by the Authority under section 12 of the Bill.  What goes into the <Col N="438" /> plan will receive wide discussion and will be approved of by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I agree with the concept of the amendment but I should not like to see it written into the Bill.  What we want is balanced development.  The working party report makes that clear.  We have never said that we do not want local authority housing on this site.  We are appointing a statutory authority and will leave them to do the job.  The Minister will have the last say on it.  The working party report clearly indicates the type of mix we want.  It includes housing, commercial, industrial and leisure amenities on one site.

We are appointing a statutory committee to do the job and we are giving them responsibility.  We will give them a broad instruction on how to approach it.  They will draw up a plan which will be discussed with the local authority.  There will be public participation in it and then it will come before the Minister who will either make or accept amendments to it.  Only then will the development go ahead.  I take the Deputy's point.  We are not disagreeing about it, but have different attitudes on how to go about it.</P>

      <P>Surely that last point illustrates that it is essential to write into the Bill exactly how we want the Authority to operate and how they are to perform their function.  We do not want them playing footsie with some developer who will be able to persuade them, in the preparation of their plan for the Custom House Docks site, to go too far one way or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we want to do is write into the Bill a specific instruction to the Authority that, in the carrying out of their functions, they will maintain a balance. This is not too specific.  It is a general instruction to maintain a balance as <Col N="440" /> between housing, industrial, commercial, social, amenity and other developments. The Minister agrees with me point by point with regard to each of the items I have listed there.  He assures the House that this is where his heart is, that this is what will happen.  Unfortunately, the record of this House has no legal standing as far as the board or the Authority are concerned.  What they will look at is what is written down in the legislation as passed by this House.  They will not look at the record of this debate as it goes on. They will merely look at the legislation as it is passed.</P>
    <P>The Minister agrees totally that his aim is to achieve this balance that I speak about in my amendment.  The Minister agrees with the principle.  He says that is what he hopes to see achieved and what he intends to see achieved and that if the authority do not do it the Minister will, at the end of the day, instruct them to achieve that balance.  But what we are passing is a legal document, a Bill, an Act of this Oireachtas.  What we need to do is write into the Act a clear instruction as to what they are to go for, and that is a balance between the list of items, housing, industrial, commercial, social, amenity and other developments.</P>
    <P>This cannot be achieved in any other way.  No instructions can be given to the Authority other than by writing it into the legislation.  With due respect to the Minister, he is not doing justice to this Bill unless he accepts this amendment. That is what the Minister wants to see achieved, but he has not written it into the legislation.  There is no constitutional obligation on the Minister to reject every proposal just because it comes from the Opposition.  The Minister sees the wisdom of it and agrees with it but, at the same time, he will not write it in.  He is saying that in some vague way the Authority will know it and the Minister will tell them and they will do it this way, and that way and so on.</P>
    <P>We are not saying that half an acre is to be housing, two acres open space, three acres commercial or whatever.  We are putting this in the broadest possible terms.  What we want to see, without <Col N="441" /> tying it down or chasing away any developer or potential investor, is a balanced development, because it is a unique site, a unique opportunity for this generation to hand on something to future generations. It will be a developed site only a couple of hundred yards from the main thoroughfare of our capital city.  Surely, with that sort of obligation on us, we should write into the legislation the type of balance we want.  It should not be vague.  It should be written in the way it is there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points I want to return to including points raised by Deputy Doyle and the Minister.  Deputy Doyle indicated that I might be doing less than justice to the people living in that part of Dublin in implying that they would not be in a position to take up the white collar jobs which would be on offer if experience in other similar types of development abroad is anything to go by.  That is not in any way a slight on the abilities or otherwise of the people in the area.  It is a recognition of the fact that the vast majority of the unemployed in that area and in every other area are not white collar people; they are not people who have experience of white collar work; they are people with experience in industrial work, manual work.  It is not in any sense a comment on their ability, whether they be educated or otherwise.</P>
      <P>I do not for a minute hold, for instance, that a person is better or worse because he holds a particular certificate.  I do not have any great number of certificates myself and I do not regard myself as any better or any worse in terms of ability or otherwise than any other person in this House or outside of this House.  I do not regard it as a slight to state the facts, that the vast majority of the unemployed in the north inner city area will not be in a position to avail of the jobs that will be provided on this site.  That is a statement of fact.  To try to believe otherwise is an illusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Doyle also made the point that we do not have to have local authority houses on every site and that there is no <Col N="442" /> reason local authority houses should not be excluded from some sites.  If we were talking about a general principle, I would agree.  But we are talking here about a major part of the inner city which will have very wide and far reaching effects on the whole city, an area in which there are thousands of local authority tenants already residing, in some cases, in very poor conditions.</P>
    <P>It is clear to me that what is intended is that Sheriff Street will be cleared not only of tenants but of flats.  What I am arguing is that we must ensure that those people will be able to live and stay in the area in which they were born and reared. It is my contention that, unless we include the kind of amendment which I am proposing here, we will have a development on that site which is totally geared towards commercial and up-market apartment living.  Experience in other countries has indicated that that is so. The Minister said he intends to see that there will be balanced development on the site.  He goes on to say he is not too sure what balanced development means. I draw his attention to the fact that section 9 (1) (a) (i) provides for the acquiring, holding and management of land in that area for its development, redevelopment or renewal either by the Authority or by any other person.  There is no reference at all in the section to the right of Dublin Corporation to be engaged in development on that site.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is correct in saying he would like to see local authority housing on that site, how will that be facilitated if only the Authority have or any other person has the right to develop or redevelop the site?  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong, but certainly I am not aware of local authorities, in any legislation that I have come across, being referred to as a person.  They are always referred to as a body or a borough council and so on.  There appears to be no opportunity in that section to permit Dublin Corporation to develop housing on that site.</P>
    <P>The third point I want to make in relation to the Minister's response is that this Authority are required, under section <Col N="443" /> 9(1)(a)(iii), to develop that site to secure the best use of any such land.  Paragraph (iv) says they are obliged to dispose of land on the completion of its development, redevelopment or renewal to secure the best use of the land.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with an Authority which will be primarily concerned with the commercial development of that site.  I am talking about a development which will ensure that they do not go into the red.  They will be looking for the best possible return on any development which takes place on that site.  If it is housing I argue that it will be mainly private apartments.  It can be factories or amenities.  I hope I am proved wrong, but you may find that the amenity area, the marina, will be confined to those who can afford to pay to moor their boats there, or whatever people do at marinas.  It is the people who can afford to pay to use the amenities who will be facilitated.  No provision has been included in this section to ensure that there is an obligation on the authority to provide public housing.  There is no obligation on the Authority to ensure that development on that site will be anything other than geared towards the best possible financial return from the use of the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the question of balance being written into the Act, I indicated earlier that directions can be given to the body.  Section 9(6) empowers the Minister to give a general directive in writing to the Authority as to policy in relation to the performance of any of these functions and the Authority must have regard to any directions so issued.  There is no ambiguity about that, and I can see no problems there.  Eventually, the plan comes back to the Minister and there can be amendments from the local authority or from the public which he may accept or reject.  He may ask for changes in the plan of the statutory authority.  There are sufficient safeguards here to ensure that the balance is right, without literally nailing it down and tying anybody's hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> With regard to Deputy De Rossa's comment on employment, there are two elements here which would well serve the particular area.  First, the redevelopment will probably go on for five to eight years, which is the opinion of most people and will need building operatives on the site and provide building jobs all during that period.  The particular skills of many people in that area will be needed.  On a site as large as 27 acres there would be a number of service jobs and I am not ruling out the possibility of there being some industrial development also.  Considering the commercial sector alone, there would be a large number of service jobs.  Following that period of up to eight years, there would also be a large number of service jobs on the site.  The general workforce in the area would be quite capable of taking on that type of work.  I am not going to pre-empt at this stage some light industrial development within the site, but that is a matter for the Authority.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa expressed doubts as to whether a local authority could be regarded as a person.  A person can mean any corporate body within the legal terminology. Therefore, there is nothing to prevent the local authority from developing housing on the site as a body operating there.  I want to make that point quite clear.  I hope the contents of section 9(6) will allay the fears of the Members who have put down this amendment. General directives will be issued on the standards expected, but they will not be hard and fast rules.  That is the way to do this.</P>

      <P>That is a nice back-up there.  I wish to make a point in regard to subsection (6) which is supposed to be all-facilitating and enables the Minister to do this, that and the other.  It is surprising that the word &ldquo;directive&rdquo; is used here.  In that case it is a directive which is not a directive at all, as the following subsection shows.  The Authority must have regard to it, but they do not have to accept it.  If it were a directive, they would have to accept it.  Subsection (7) says:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this section shall be construed as enabling the Minister to exercise any power or control in relation to the performance . . .</P>
      <P>The Authority can say: &ldquo;Within our terms of reference that directive does not apply.  We do not like it.  We will have regard to it, but we are not implementing it.&rdquo;  This does not mean anything; it is a cover for the Minister.</P>
      <P>I should like to mention housing and jobs.  I emphasise that the expectation of the citizens living in this area are rather high in connection with this site.  It has been talked about now for years, first by the Dublin Port and Docks Board, with the local people talking to that board about it, then by Dublin Corporation who were discussing the matter with the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  Various plans and ideas were put forward and the local people had input into these and suggested amenities, housing and jobs. These were the three things they wanted and that they have not got.  Housing is developing just outside that area and there is a very good Dublin Corporation housing development in the general area, but housing is still a major issue for people in that immediate area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However most important of all are <Col N="446" /> jobs.  I am sure the Minister is well aware that the whole inner city problem began with the loss of jobs in the whole port area, the movement of all industries out to Finglas, Ballyfermot, Tallaght, Clondalkin and so on, and the emptying out of jobs from the area.  The potential and resources of the area were in connection with the port and the railhead, which goes right out into the port.  The cattle industry also collapsed.  The lack of jobs created problems with regard to housing, drugs and other social ills in the area. They are looking to this development as being important not just for the city but for the citizens in the area.  That is what both these amendments are about.  They have the appropriate balance for development that will give jobs.  The Minister has not given any great thought to industrial development, which is very important.</P>
    <P>In regard to housing, I am delighted to hear the Minister giving a guarantee that nothing has been decided.  It is surprising that he has not corrected the very specific and strong statement in the official journal of the Construction Industry Federation. It is rumoured that the site may ultimately house the new north Dublin Garda headquarters.  It states that the Department of the Environment and Dublin Corporation agreed that no public housing should be built on the Custom House Dock site, probably due to a huge concentration of existing public housing. It is the understanding of everybody in the construction industry that that decision has been made.  I accept the Minister's statement that no such agreement has been made.  I hope that, either through his statement in the House or in some other way, this will be conveyed to the Construction Industry Federation and to Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>We can take it that when the Minister speaks about housing he is talking about a mix of housing in the area.  I cannot see why he cannot accept both or one of the amendments put down, which simply state &mdash; not in specific terms but in general terms &mdash; what industrial and housing development it should contain.  If the Minister accepted them there would be <Col N="447" /> less apprehension among people generally, and in particular among the people living in the area, about what type of development is in mind.  There is no alternative method of appeals or of public participation in the planning of the development. When the Bill is passed neither Dublin Corporation nor the citizens will have any say in this.  The Minister can give general policy directives which they may or may not have regard to.  I would like to see something in the Bill to show that this balance that Deputy Burke and Deputy De Rossa spoke about will exist in the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point that has been highlighted with regard to subsection (6) and subsection (7) of section 9, the Minister was hanging his case on the basis that he did not have to accept the amendment before him requiring a balance within this development between housing, industrial, commercial, social amenity and other factors.  Subsection (6) states that the Minister has the right to give a general directive in writing to the Authority.  As has been clarified, subsection (7) shows that nothing in this section shall be construed as enabling the Minister to exercise any power or control in relation to the performance in particular cases by the Authority of a function assigned to it by or under this Act.  The longer we discuss this the more the case is proven that it requires a specific instruction to be written into the functions of the Authority of the type that I have laid out in the amendment.  It asks that in performing the functions assigned to it an Urban Development Authority shall, as far as practical, maintain a balance within its functional areas between housing, industrial, commercial, social amenity and other developments.  This is becoming more and more obvious.  It is essential to write this into the Bill for the security of this historic site which has become available to the people of Dublin only a couple of hundred yards from the main thoroughfare of our capital city.  We owe it to this and to future generations to get it right with regard to development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="448" /> It is essential that the Minister accept this amendment or a variation of it.  My own amendment is loose enough to leave the Authority a free enough hand and at the same time give them specific instructions with regard to their terms of reference. If this is not written into the terms of reference, no ministerial directive will have the force to make them do what we want them to do.  It is vitally important because, as has been clarified, there is no right of appeal in this Act with regard to planning appeals as would exist in a normal third party appeal.  That is not in this Act because we want to see development take place as fast as possible. Because we are doing away with many of the safeguards in the planning Acts, it is incumbent on the Minister to ensure that the Bill, when it is passed by this House and becomes law, is specific as far as the type of development that we want to see and that the Minister assures us will take place is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the House that there will be a reasonable number of jobs in the development of the site.  With regard to the industrial content, I cannot give any assurances until the plan is drawn up.  As chairman of the working party, I spoke to the IDA to see what they could do to bring industry to that site.  In all our deliberations we spoke about the whole concept of industry coming into that site because we wanted a mix.  The IDA are better equipped to encourage the type of industry that would come in there.  I hope that in the final plan we will have industry coupled with building jobs and service jobs.  The number of jobs will be substantial for the area.  Unemployment is high in the area and I hope that when the scheme is in operation industries can be attracted to that district.  There is no reason why the people in the area cannot be trained in the various skills while a factory is in the course of construction.  I am optimistic that that will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great play has been made about subsections (6) and (7).  Subsection (6) empowers the Minister to give a general directive in writing to the Authority.  That <Col N="449" /> is the general practice and I am sure Deputy Burke when he was Minister issued directives to planning authorities of which they had to take note.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave one directive, the only one ever given under the planning Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the Deputy knows what I am talking about. Subsection (7) states that the Minister may not exercise any power or control in relation to a particular case or in particular circumstances.  In other words, he cannot be nit-picking in regard to what the Authority does.  However, if the Minister issues a general directive it must be taken into account, but the Minister should not have power to say where a house should be erected.  He will have overall control when the plan is sent to him.  I am sure all Members agree that the Minister should not be involved when the plan is being prepared.  I am satisfied that under subsection (6) the Minister has power to direct the Authority to take account of his directions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a question in relation to the Minister's right to direct under subsection (6) and the obligation on the Authority to make the best use of the site.  For argument's sake, if the Authority in their plan exclude local authority housing on the basis that they do not think it would be feasible to include such housing &mdash; they may not consider the erection of houses to be making the best use of the site and may say that it would make it difficult to encourage companies to take up factory space &mdash; and the Minister issues a direction to the Authority to include a specific percentage of local authority housing on the site, in what way will the direction have precedence over the obligations on the Authority to make the best use of the site?  If it is the intention of the Minister <Col N="450" /> to ensure that there is industrial development and local authority housing on this site, I cannot see any valid argument for not including that in the Bill.  To say that he has the power to direct the Authority to do that seems to me to be saying that he will get the Bill through as it is and he will see then how things develop.  He appears to be saying that, if the Authority feel that local authority housing, a certain type of industrial development or a particular type of public amenity should not be on the site, they have a free hand to refuse it.  They have a free hand to develop it because they were appointed to do the job.  Presumably the members of the Authority will be selected on the basis of their expertise in this area.</P>
      <P>There is a contradiction in that.  If the Minister feels a certain type of development should take place on the site, he should include that in the Bill.  He may argue that he has the power to do that anyway, but there may be a conflict between what he might direct them to do and what the Authority may see as their duty under the legislation to make the best possible profitable commercial use of the site.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to put it on record that the statement I read out from the official journal of the Construction Industry Federation is not true, that there is no agreement between the Department of the Environment and Dublin Corporation that there will be no public housing on that site.</P>

At the end of the day we will have to see what we have in the pot and include that in an action plan which will be sent to the Minister for approval.

      <P>What I want to assure the House on is that the Minister will give broad directions.  When the plan is submitted he then will have further time to consider whether it should be changed. Deputy Mac Giolla indicated that the local authority and the general public in the area have no say.  The general public in the area can make submissions about this site, as can the local authority. Obviously, the Authority do not have to accept what they propose but they do have to take account of what they say and consider it.  That is a reasonable approach, given the type of Authority we are setting up.  There should be consultation with the local authority and the general public.  I would have to refute the allegation that there is no direct consultation and no one has any say other than the Authority.  The Authority will finally make up their minds on what they want, but after they have listened to the other bodies.  That is a reasonably civilised approach.</P>

    <P>If we define what we want in the Bill we can run ourselves into trouble.  Section 9 (6) clearly indicates the powers the Minister has.  Irrespective of whatever arguments are put up, the facts are there. Deputy Burke knows the facts are there. He admitted himself that on one occasion he issued a directive.  That is a fact of life. Authorities such as these have to take this into account.  They cannot ignore a Minister's directive, because it is the law of the land.  That is important.  I understand the fears of Members of the House and I respect the amendments which they have put down.  I believe my approach is flexible and gives power to ensure that the development we all appear to want <Col N="453" /> will be there at the end of the day when the plan is drawn up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

      <P>On a number of occasions the Minister took the opportunity to refer to a directive which I issued while I was Minister for the Environment with regard to the development of shopping centres as distinct from local shops to try to protect the interests of local shopkeepers. That was a directive under the specific planning laws of this land which give the Minister for the Environment the right to issue directives to An Bord Pleanála.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I say to the Minister of State that the thrust of the legislation is to disregard the planning laws so that one will no longer be subject to third party appeals or all other types of appeals?  This legislation scraps for the designated area the planning laws with regard to directives.  On a number of occasions the Minister of State made the point that he does not want specific guidelines written into the Bill because they might delay development and hinder discussions between the Authority and developers, who would want to see the site developed in a particular way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister of State suggesting that a single developer or a consortium of developers will be working with the Authority in the preparation of the plan, so that the Authority will produce a plan which will suit a particular consortium and so that the consortium can say we will build a hotel or a shopping arcade that the Authority have suggested?  Why does he keep emphasising that he does not want it to be specific?  Amendment No. 6 is anything but specific.  It sets down general guidelines, which the Minister of State says he is going to issue as a directive anyway.  What we want to see is that they are written into the Bill.  There is no question of delaying the development of the site.  We all want to see the site develop but we do not want to see it <Col N="454" /> developed in some sort of cosy relationship between a consortium and the Authority.</P>
    <P>We want to see the Authority preparing a balanced plan which will meet the housing needs of the people in the area, private and public, their job needs and their commercial needs, along with the commercial and amenity needs of the city as a whole.  The plan should not comprise just tower, flat and industrial blocks but should be something that we, from a visual point of view, will be very proud of.  Because it is so near to the main thoroughfare of our capital city it is vitally important that this be done correctly.  I insist, and I will continue to insist, because the Minister of State has not convinced me.  The Minister of State has not given me one good reason which I can hold onto as to why he will not accept the amendment.  All the Minister of State can say is that he can accept the thrust of the amendment but does not want to write it into the Bill because it will delay development.  I do not accept that.</P>

      <P>We have gone over the ground fairly well.  Whether it is a planning authority, this Authority or any Authority, they have to take account of the directive.  That was the only point I was making.  I was not making a point on planning.  The Deputy indicated that we are removing the planning powers from this site.  If we are, it is the only site we are removing from them.  Under the Deputy's Bill, planning powers were removed from all the designated sites.</P>

      <P>If the Minister changes his mind and says this will be an industrial site and he instructs the Authority accordingly, the Authority according to the Minister of State will have to take that instruction.  What we want in this House is to write in that this unique site will be developed in a balanced way for the people of this country generally and not at the whim of some direction from a Minister or some cosy arrangement between some authority and developers. We want it written into the law as it passes through this House.</P>

      <P>I want to say this, that it will not be at the whim of an individual Deputy who sat down to write what will be on this site in 1992.  I can well understand the Deputy's concern if he was prepared to site away under those circumstances.  There is no question of that in this Bill.  I can assure the Deputy that there will be clear directions for a proper balance.  It will not be written by one individual in this House who would not have the responsibility of doing it. That is all I want to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that this site is being brought forward, first of all, to develop a particular area which has been lying derelict for so long.  The north inner city has been deprived and starved of development. In the last 20 or 30 years only 15 per cent of all office development was north of the river and 10 per cent of that was by Irish Life in the Brooks Thomas complex.  In other words, only 5 per cent of general development in the city occurred in the north inner city.  One must question that.  If we could get good prestige development in that area it would act as a catalyst for development right down the quays.  We hope that further up the north side of the Liffey the area will <Col N="456" /> become known as a location for good development.  That will happen only if we take the correct steps.  This Bill will enable us to take those steps.</P>
    <P>This is the most important site ever to become available in this city, the jewel of the city.  We now have an opportunity to polish it up and display it properly so that it will act as a beacon for further development along the north quays and across into the lower end of the south quays.  That area has been the cinderella of our inner city, and as a Dubliner I am satisfied with the probable effects of this legislation.  The south inner city has been over-developed.  Planning there has moved into Dublin 4.  The office developments in the Blackrock area should have been directed to the north inner city but people felt it was more prestigious to develop in the south city.  We hope this legislation will give the incentive to people to move into the north inner city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is obviously not aware of the 1982 Urban Development Areas Bill dealing with this site.  Section 4 of that Bill is similar to the section we are now dealing with and it dealt with the functions of an urban development commission.  Subsection (1) (b) provided:</P>
      <P>In performing the functions assigned to it by paragraph (a) of this subsection, an urban development commission shall, as far as practicable, maintain a balance within its functional area as between housing, industrial, commercial social, amenity and other development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were the clear instructions laid <Col N="457" /> down in the Bill introduced by us in 1982. The Minister here now is not prepared to give the same guidelines to the Urban Development Authority to be set up by this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to this site as the jewel in the city, a unique site which he wants to polish up.  I have been arguing in the last hour against letting the Minister or any other Minister steal that jewel. We will defend and put up burglar alarms against Ministers so that this national asset will be protected from the whim of any Minister.  It must be specifically written into this Bill that there will be balanced development there, as was provided for in the 1982 Bill.  If it was correct then it is doubly correct now that no Minister should have the legal right to direct the Authority so broadly that there would not be a balance.</P>
    <P>The Urban Development Authority to be set up may advise the Minister that because they could not get a developer to go in to build houses and create a balance of commercial, industrial and social developments they might get a consortium with a couple of pension funds who would be prepared to go in to develop commercial and industrial interests, but not housing or to look after the social or amenity aspects.  What would happen around the Cabinet table?  The Government would look at it and say: &ldquo;We need jobs.  We will go ahead with this though it is not exactly as we would like &mdash; we will go ahead with just the commercial and industrial development.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We on this side do not want that sort of development.  Because of the uniqueness of this site we want to see it protected for the country in generations to come.  I accept the Minister's good faith.  I accept that he wants to see this site developed properly, but there can be commercial pressures.  The Authority may say that they cannot get sufficient interest in the site to develop it as quickly as they would like, but they might have a consortium made up of a pension fund or two prepared to go in to cover half the site in factory space.  That would not be in the <Col N="458" /> best interests of the people of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be protecting himself and future Ministers if he inserts a provision like that in the amendment.  If the Minister does not accept it today, on a change of Government it will be put into later legislation.  I accept the Minister's bona fides, that he wants a balance, but it is the height of folly to reject the advice he has been getting from all sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us have different opinions about the development of Dublin and I hope that what I have to say will be taken in the spirit in which it is said.  What dragged me from the office down here was the Minister's statement, which I heard on the monitor, that this is the jewel of a site in Dublin city, that it is the most important site.  In my opinion it is not a jewel of a site, not the most important site in the city.  It is very far from it.  The most important site in the city centre is the other designated area, up along the Liffey going westwards towards Heuston Bridge, between O'Connell Street and Heuston Station.</P>
      <P>That is where the jewel is, on the north and south sides of the Liffey.  The redevelopment of that area, properly and sensitively, would be in itself a clear statement of faith in the future of our capital city.  If it were properly developed it would encourage and even compel redevelopment of the rest of the quays. That is the most important thing.  Developing the docks area will not do anything for the quays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development I am speaking about proposes the River Liffey as the cultural and business artery of the capital, as Deputy G. Brady said earlier, not the unknown quantity, the 27-acre site in the docks area.  This part of the city could be developed into a new commercial epicentre for Dublin and could become a magnet for shoppers and others.  The infrastructure there has cost billions of pounds during the years.  It is there <i>in situ.</i> I am amazed this has not been appreciated.  I have pushing this for the past three or four years but it has been <Col N="459" /> ignored totally.  I know from experience elsewhere that we have a long way to go before the development is carried out and it is difficult to know if it will be successful. It may be a success in the long term.</P>
    <P>The jewel I am talking about is in the area up the river.  If we develop that it will arrest the advance of the city towards the mouth of the river, away from its established starting point of Heuston Station to the Custom House building.  All of us have strong opinions about this matter and I am not being over-criticial about anyone else's view.  If we could provide public transport from the railheads to be revitalised centre by means of a tunnel or rapid transit link interconnecting with the DART, we would underwrite the success of the venture and of the development in this area.  We need a much improved and dependable bus transport system for the city.</P>
    <P>We are making an error here.  I understand the reservations the Minister has about the site and his reluctance to commit himself on the matter.  I do not think there will be any rush to develop it.  I do not think it will happen overnight. I think the considerations mentioned in both amendments will be taken on board but the Minister will make a mistake if he commits the area to development now in one way.  We are talking about an unknown amount of money and an unknown type of development.  We do not even know who will be willing to do the work or whether the site will be a success.</P>
    <P>Recently it was stated clearly and unambiguously by commentators that we are making a mistake in moving to the docks area of the city and concentrating development in that place.  Many people have spoken today knowingly and authoritatively about Dublin.  The jewel must be in the centre of the city.  It must be where the people are and where we have the decay, not on a barren site around the docks.  Having the pious hope of attracting people and investment here will not be enough because developers will only go where there is a profit for <Col N="460" /> them.  I hope the venture will be successful but options must be left open.  I wish to emphasise the other area which has been left out of all the considerations.</P>

      <P>The amendment seeks to guarantee harmony for the development of this site but that point seems to be missed here.  It is uniquely situated close to the Custom House designed by Gandon but there is no guarantee that the new development will harmonise with that building.  We do not have a city architect and we cannot guarantee that the new development will harmonise with the existing landscape.  Deputy Burke's amendment must be written into the legislation.  Otherwise, we could end up with a mixture of offices that would not achieve what I think the Minister is seeking to achieve.</P>

It has taken three years to bring the measure to this House and the legislation is being rushed through now. There are 22 sections in the Bill and we have got to only section 9 at this stage.

I <Col N="461" /> should like to remind him that allowance should be made for churches, schools, public buildings such as courthouses as well as offices for the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare, for the Southern Health Board, cinemas, hospitals, educational centres, roadways and waterways and places of entertainment.  This morning the Minister was asked to consider an extension of the area in recognition of the fact that development is proceeding but he resisted.  I shall quote my amendment which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In addition to the areas specified in Part IV of the Fourth Schedule to the Finance Act, 1986, the Minister shall make, with consent of the Minister for Finance, an order under subsection (2) of this section, to include Watercourse Road, including the Watercourse Road Industrial Site, Gerald Griffin Street, the remainder of Shandon Street and the proposed commercial centre at Mahon in the designated areas for Cork City.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister even at this late stage to agree to accept either amendment No. 5 or amendment No. 6.  We are dealing with the development of an important site, whether we agree it is a jewel.  It is an important site; it is a major portion of the city, and it needs development.  We must ensure that the kind of development that takes place is suitable not only to the commercial developers who will hope to make money out of developing it but that it is also suitable to the people living and working in the area.  That is why we have pressed the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he has power to direct the Authority if they come forward with a plan he does not like.  That is fine as far as it goes, but we do not know the mind of the Minister.  We do not know what notion may take him in six months time when the proposal comes before him, or what pressures he will come under from any one of hundreds of different interest groups concerning development of the site.  If we had <Col N="462" /> inserted in the Bill the requirement that there be a balance, that there has to be industrial development and public housing included, we would be satisfied that the Minister would be obliged to comply with the legislation.  As it stands, the Minister will decide, in discussion or consultation with the Authority, what will go on the site and I am not satisfied with that.</P>

      <P>Once again we in Fianna Fáil are forced to highlight the plight of the poor and the needy in our motion condemning the failure of this Government to provide funds to adequately run the health services.  The total inadequacy of funding is reflected in every region in the country and in every hospital, be it health board or voluntary.  Concerning the Minister's amendment, may I point <Col N="464" /> to the presentation to the Dáil Committee on Public Expenditure recently where Donal O'Shea, chief executive officer of the North-Western Health Board, pointed out that the real value of spending on the country's health services had fallen by about 25 per cent during the past five years?  He said that the constant cut-backs in the health budgets and the fact that new developments had to be funded from these reduced allocations meant that the real value of current health spending was now only about 75 per cent of the 1980 level.</P>
      <P>I have said repeatedly in the past that what astounds me more than anything else is the fact that it is the Labour Party, and a Labour Minister, who are orchestrating this entire fiasco.  They claim they represent that section of our population, the underprivileged, the poor and the needy, but surely it must be evident that by not providing adequate funds for our health boards it is this sector of our people who are going to suffer.  Maybe we could understand it if it came from the Fine Gael Party alone, who have never claimed to represent this group or if it came from the newly formed Progressive Democrats whose commitment is to the higher income groups, but surely not the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as I am limited to ten minutes in this debate I obviously can not dwell in depth in every area, but as I am a member of the South-Eastern Health Board &mdash; in fact I am the Chairman of the General Hospital Subcommittee &mdash; I intend to use that as an example of the hardship being inflicted because I know from reports from other areas the measures we are being forced to take by this Minister are also being inflicted on all other health board areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocation for the South-Eastern Health Board in 1986 is £85.55 million, which is £6.345 million short of the level of funding needed in 1986 to maintain expenditure and services at the 1985 level.  We all know that the 1985 allocation was inadequate.  We in the south-east had a deduction of £1.385 million because of our overrun last year.  We are <Col N="465" /> now expected to run the services with a shortfall of £6.345 million this year.  It cannot be done.  There will have to be cut-backs, there will have to be hardship. As a doctor and a consultant in one of our general hospitals in the south-east, it is my duty to say that there must be a danger to the health of the patients and that patients lives must be in jeopardy.  I do not want to sound an alarmist, but when you hear what we have been asked to do in the south-east you will see what I mean.</P>
    <P>We have been asked to save £200,000 on the reduction of locum costs at all levels.  This is hoped to be achieved by closing beds during the holiday period. Now not only has this Minister invented the five day syndrome, but now we are being asked to get sick between the months of October and June, not during the summer.  Let me give an example of what effect the cutting back of locum cover will have in most of our county hospitals.  Most county hospitals operate a two man practice &mdash; in other words, we have two surgeons, two physicians, two anaesthetists, and so on.  If we do not provide locum cover when one of these people is on holidays, the other person must be on call seven days per week, 24 hours per day.  That must put both doctors and patients at risk.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve further cuts the South-Eastern Health Board asked that Ardkeen close 50 per cent of its beds in the surgical, eye, ENT and orthopaedic units fully for one month.  Maybe the Minister is not aware, but Waterford and the south-east in general is a seaside area, with Rosslare and Tramore etc.  Our work and patients rather than decreasing show a marked increase during the summer months.  Rosslare is, after all, the main tourist gateway from Britain and the Continent to the south-east, or has that fact escaped the Minister?  Is he going to close off one of the few industries that remain viable in this country?</P>
    <P>May I read you the first paragraph of a letter I got from the consultant staff at St. Luke's General Hospital, Kilkenny? It reads:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="466" /> Stringent financial cutbacks are being imposed upon South-Eastern Health Board by the Minister for Health, Barry Desmond.  Specific proposals have been made at Health Board level to implement these cut-backs. These proposals have centred mainly on savings occurring from Ward Closures.  Any closure, partial or temporary, of a ward facility in St. Luke's General Hospital will have immediate and serious repercussions for the emergency health care of the people of the Carlow/Kilkenny area.</P>
    <P>These are not my words, but the words of the people responsible for providing health care in the Carlow/Kilkenny area. What with the treatment already being meted out to St. Dympna's Hospital in Carlow, is it any wonder that Minister Séamus Pattison, who is not here this evening, should feel so worried at the moment?</P>
    <P>May I also read to you a letter, I received from the Irish Nurses' Organisation on this matter, dated May 1986?  I quote:</P>
    <P>A Chara,</P>
    <P>We, the members of the Irish Nurses' Organisation by our presence here today wish to highlight our grave concern at the reduced level of health care existing in the Boards area due to the continuing cutbacks in the hospitals and Community Care programmes. We ask you, members of the South-Eastern Health Board, to oppose any further proposed cutbacks that will reduce the present inadequate service to an unacceptable level.  With the interests of safe patient care our top priority, we would appreciate your co-operation.</P>
    <P>If we in the south-east were to live within our financial budget we would have a reduction of £1.5 million in the general hospital area.  This would mean a saving of £500,000 at Ardkeen alone.  To achieve this, does the Minister know what we would have to do?  We would have to close 36 surgical beds for an equivalent <Col N="467" /> of six months, we would have to permanently close the maternity unit and, wait for it, we would have to close the dialysis unit in that hospital.</P>
    <P>Neither the Minister nor the Department paid one penny towards the setting up of this unit.  It was funded by the people of Waterford and the south-east. They paid for the staffing and equipping of the unit.  Now the Minister suggests, in the interests of cutbacks, that we close this unit.  Somebody must be losing his mind.</P>
    <P>On the psychiatric side, in the South-Eastern Health Board area we have been asked to achieve a saving of £500,000 in order to live within our allocation.  This means &mdash; and I want the Minister to be clear on this &mdash; a loss of 50 jobs.  It is also important to realise that the present long stay occupants of psychiatric hospitals are heavily dependent on nursing care by reason of age, mental handicap or general chronic deficits in their personal capabilities. It follows from this that if we are to reduce staffing numbers we must transfer these patients out of care and into the totally inadequate community service. Until we have adequate community care facilities we cannot expect them to cope with this additional patient load.</P>
    <P>These are the measures we in the South-Eastern Health Board area are being asked to consider, and all the other health boards are being asked to perform similar miracles.  The Eastern Health Board face a shortfall of £8.9 million and as a result they intend to leave one-third of all medical vacancies occurring after 1 June unfilled.  The Midland Health Board will face a shortfall of £2.5 million and will have to close wards during the summer. The North-Western Health Board will face a shortfall of £3.2 million having received an additional allocation of £300,000 recently from the Minister. Among the issues they have considered is the abolition of the transport services to clinics and outpatients in Dublin and within the health board area.  If we are not providing the transport to get to these facilities, why not close them altogether.</P>
    <P>Today we saw a massive demonstration <Col N="468" /> from the Irish Nurses' Organisation who braved the elements to express their condemnation of the Minister's actions.  This is not a militant or crank organisation but a responsible body committed to providing the greatest possible care for their charges.  They are not demonstrating for better conditions for themselves or looking for an increase in salaries.  They were there simply to highlight the plight of their patients and to indicate to the Minister the dangers as they see them.  They are not a vested interest group.  They are aware that the patients will suffer.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I appeal to the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish in the first place to say a few words about the trends of health expenditure since the early seventies.  In 1971-72 the non-capital expenditure on health services in this country amounted to a net figure of £86.6 million representing 4.54 per cent of GNP.  This figure had increased to £701 million by 1980, representing 7.8 per cent of GNP.  The figure for 1986 amounts to £1,194 million net, representing about 7.1 per cent of GNP.  This net figure can be grossed up to £1,274 million, representing the amount available for spending when account is taken of receipts of the health agencies from patient charges and other minor income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the mid-fifties the highly industrialised countries spent about 4 per cent of their resources on health care.  Estimates for the year 1977 show that some countries were spending between 9 per cent and 10 per cent of their resources on health care.  When the economies were buoyant the increase in expenditure on health care at a rate faster than GNP did not seem to be a great cause for concern; <Col N="469" /> but when the rates of economic growth slowed down in the early seventies, the continued rapid growth of health care spending gave rise to action being taken by most countries to try to contain or to reduce costs most of which had to be met from the public purse.  Questions began to be asked as to whether the public were getting full value for the vast resources being devoted to health services.  This gave rise to analysis of services, analysis of costs and an awakening of the need to eliminate any unnecessary services, to cut out wasteful practices and to establish priority areas of care.  We are not, therefore, unique in our efforts to contain expenditure on health services.  Despite the difficulties, the Government are concerned to maintain the fabric of the health services and to ensure that anybody who needs essential health care is provided with it, without delay, and without causing him or her any hardship. The Government's record in this regard is beyond reproach.</P>
    <P>The overall gross amount of £1,274 million, which is available for health services, can best be assessed by looking at how it is divided between the various programmes and services.  As has been mentioned by the Minister, institutional services of all kinds absorb about three quarters of the total.  The percentages of the total which is spent on the various programmes are as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The thrust of the national plan and the Minister's policy is to bring about a shift in resources from the institutional setting to the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>We gave the Deputy a certain amount of time to express his <Col N="470" /> opinion and nobody interrupted him while he was doing so.  By institutions I am referring in this context mainly to the acute general hospitals, psychiatric hospitals and long stay hospitals.  In the case of acute general hospitals there is a need for a greater emphasis on outpatient and day care facilities and greater use of five day wards.  If this shift can be effected to any significant degree, it should be possible to reduce the number of acute hospital beds.  There is little point in increasing alternative forms of hospital care and leaving the bed stock untouched.  This would only result in an increase in expenditure because available beds tend to be filled irrespective of the necessity for in-patient care in all circumstances. Redeployment of resources is essential in times of financial constraints if any progress is to be made towards the attainment of health policy objectives.  In this connection it is interesting to note that if, say, a saving of 1 per cent could be made on general hospital services and the saving applied to the community welfare services, it would enable the provision for the community welfare services to be increased by about 6.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Minister, when notifying health boards of their allocations for the current year, referred to the need to protect certain services.  The boards were advised to maintain, at adequate levels, key services for the old and the housebound, such as community nursing services, home help services and meals on wheels; child care services, particularly day care and preschool services for deprived and disadvantaged communities; and the funding of boarding out payments for children in foster care.  That the health boards are concerned about the need to protect the deprived and the disadvantaged is illustrated by an episode which occurred in the Southern Health Board area earlier this year.  It was alleged that the elderly poor were being discriminated against in relation to admission to Cork city hospitals even when they were seriously ill.  No evidence was produced to substantiate this accusation which, on investigation, was found to be totally unfounded.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants to listen to this he can and if he wants to refute what the programme manager of that health board wrote to <i>The Cork Examiner</i> on 8 April 1986 he is entitled to do so.  Also he should instruct his party members who are members of that health board to stop the scaremongering and get on with the job they were elected to do and they might be much better occupied.</P>
      <P>As I said, no evidence was produced to substantiate this accusation, which on investigation was found to be totally unfounded.  Commenting on the situation, the health board's programme manager wrote to <i>The Cork Examiner</i> on 8 April 1986, and I quote:</P>
      <P>I submit that this (accusation) amounts to a degree of irresponsibility amounting to recklessness in the conduct and direction of a public controversy about a matter of serious concern to the public.  I further submit that the use of the terms &ldquo;well authenticated evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;fully documented cases&rdquo; in respect of unchecked scraps of allegations with no documentation whatever, was a deliberate attempt to deceive the public.</P>

Deputy O'Hanlon listed deficits in funding at mid-year as if they were actual, factual figures, despite the fact that last year the Southern Health Board claimed they were £9 million short, although they ended the year with a deficit of less than £1 million.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon was also critical of the opening of an acute psychiatric unit in Beaumont Hospital. Does he object to the provision of such facilitis in acute general hospitals &mdash; a major issue in the report on the psychiatric services, <i>Planning for the Future?</i> I should also like to remind Deputy O'Hanlon of what the Minister said about the numbers of nurses employed in the health services.  In 1981 there were 26,100 nurses employed, by 1984 the number had increased to 28,000, and by 1985 it had increased to 28,200.  Indications are that this trend has continued into 1986.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, remuneration of nurses represents about 46 per cent of total remuneration costs. Where is the evidence here of dismantling the health services?  Like the Minister, I am somewhat puzzled about accusations of the so-called dismantling of the health services.</P>
      <P>Dr. O'Hanlon also referred to the allocations for the voluntary hospitals for 1986 and compared the allocation levels for some voluntary hospitals in respect of 1985 with those which have been approved for 1986.  His comparisons are, however, erroneous because he compared the final outturn allocation for 1985 with the original allocation for 1986.  For example, in the case of St. Vincent's Hospital, the original allocation for 1985 was £20.299 million.  The 1986 allocation is £21.34 million, representing an increase of over £1 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of homes for the mentally handicapped, the Deputy's comparisons are similarly distorted.  The Minister has not adopted a stand-off attitude in relation to the budgetary problems of voluntary hospitals.  For example, officers of his Department met representatives of St. Vincent's Hospital and agreed a series <Col N="474" /> of adjustments which substantially improved their situation.</P>

      <P>A meeting will shortly take place with the Mater and other hospitals which have difficulty in coping with their financial situation.  This is a small but perhaps significant point &mdash; Deputy O'Hanlon referred to St. Vincent's Hospital as the nearest to Sir Patrick Duns.

      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon also referred to certain restrictions imposed by health boards in relation to transport services.  The demands on the transport services and the costs which health boards had to meet to provide this service have increased very substantially over the last ten years.  For example, in the case of the North Western Health Board, total mileage for car hire service is now over three times the level it was ten years ago.</P>

      <P>The cost to the health board, if the 1985 levels were to be maintained, would be over £600,000.  The health board, therefore, decided that they had to modify the service but will continue to provide for genuine hardship cases by refunding reasonable expenses incurred.  The service to day hospitals and workshops is to be continued.  Surely it is not contended that what has happened in the case of transport services amounts to a dismantling of the health services?</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> Deputy Conaghan referred to the developments carried out in the North Western Health Board and alleged that the Minister failed to provide the board with adequate funds.  My understanding from the Minister is that the resources at his disposal were distributed by him equitably between all health boards and health agencies.  There was no discrimination whatsoever in favour or against any health board.  Indeed, the Minister tells me that the same arguments have been advanced by other health boards in relation to their share of the resources, but some, who shall remain nameless, were prompted by the political interests within them who were more vociferous than others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing at a time. Although they claimed to have a deficit of £9 million it was closer to £1 million at the end of the year.  I have already quoted from a letter written by the programme manager of the Southern Health Board to <i>The Cork Examiner</i> denying statements made by members of the Southern Health Board.  He said that there was no basis for their allegations and they have been challenged openly to prove their statement.  So far, they have refused to do so.</P>
      <P>The measures to be adopted are basically for selection by the health boards themselves.  In the case of the Midland Health Board, an extra £500,000 was made available to the board following their very sensible decision to close an old and outmoded hospital.</P>
      <P>The report on the health services for 1983-86 which the Minister published recently provides ample evidence of his work for the period 1983 to the current year.  I advise those who subscribe to the motion before the House to read it carefully.  It provides conclusive evidence of the Minister's concern to ensure that the services are maintained, particularly services for the poor, the deprived and the handicapped.  It refers to the many new initiatives&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is incumbent on health agencies to come up with initiatives which would have the effect of achieving real control of expenditure without affecting the quality of patient care. International surveys have shown that there is a growing awareness about the need to control the resources input to health services.  Personnel numbers and wage rates matter most.  This is followed by equipment and various supply items, particularly drugs.  As prescribers, doctors are critical in the effort to control costs and must be involved in limiting activity to the resources available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Control is not tantamount to dismantling. The Opposition are continually critical of the Minister for Health and the manner in which the health services are administered.  It was not so long ago since one of them was sitting over here as Minister for Health.  He was a good Minister, but he still had to work within the resources that were available.

      <P>It clearly will not be possible to deal at length with the points raised.  We have no problem in supporting the Fianna Fáil proposal except that it is not specific.  It does not indicate that there is any intention to restructure the health service, which, we would argue, is fundamentally required.</P>
      <P>Our amendment condemns the failure of successive Governments to deal with underlying structural problems with the health services.  We require reform of the VHI, abolition of tax relief on VHI premiums for luxury hospitals, separation of private and public care within the public hospital system, extension of eligibility for hospital services to all and a radical reform of the GMS in order to make it possible to extend eligibility to more of the population, It is not possible to do that simply by calling on the Minister to restore funding to the services.</P>
      <P>Our health services have developed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  I know that the Eastern Health Board, which is supposed to be responsible for the provision of health services in the Eastern Health Board area, which is Dublin city and county, Kildare and Wicklow, has virtually no control over the development or provision of health services in a wide range of areas within their area of jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What all Ministers have failed to do is to tackle the vested interests in the Health services.  No attempt has been made to take on the voluntary hospitals, <Col N="481" /> who appear to be able to write their own cheques as regards expenditure, by this and previous Governments in what they see as the development of the health services. No Minister has taken on the medical profession, who seem to be a law unto themselves as regards how money is spent and how services are developed.</P>
    <P>In answer to a recent question which I put to the Minister for Health he revealed that the tax relief on VHI premiums had increased from £6.5 million in 1981 to £30 million in 1985.  There needs to be a very clear and precise analysis of why that has been.  About 25 per cent of the population entitled to full eligibility in the hospital services are also on VHI and the reason is that consultants and the medical profession in general are dealing with people on the VHI in preference to people who are entitled to their services under the State system.</P>
    <P>Many consultants are being paid twice, once by the VHI and once by the State, to see certain patients.  This is an area that this Minister and previous Ministers have failed to tackle.  They have failed to take on the vested interests of the voluntary hospitals and the medical profession. The money which is being spent at present on tax relief for VHI and which is now being given for the use of luxury hospitals would be better spent by extending eligibility under the GMS to general hospital services.  It is a disgrace that at a time when money is being cut back in the public health services we have the development of private hospitals supported and funded by the medical profession themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this motion.  At the outset I want to refer to what Deputy Donnellan said.  There is a real crisis in the Southern Health Board and the Minister must be quite well aware of that from the representations made to his own Department by the Southern Health Board.  It is alarming that there is a .3 per cent shortfall in the GMS.  In the past three years the <i>ad hoc</i> schemes for optical and dental treatment have all been abandoned because of the lack of finance. <Col N="482" /> Under the medical card scheme people between the ages of 18 and 65 cannot avail of treatment if they have no contributions or do not qualify under the social welfare code.  This is creating great hardship and I find it very difficult to advise them what to do because they have not the means to finance their own treatment.</P>
      <P>The primary school dental scheme has collapsed in the north Cork community care area.  In my area, which is not very large, there are 215 people awaiting orthodontic treatment.  One family in my area came to my attention.  The husband was on unemployment assistance because of the appalling state of the economy but was anxious to get dental treatment for his child.  He got an estimate from his dentist for orthodontic treatment for £700.  He could not afford that.  I got back on to the health board and got the standard reply that there was a waiting list and he could not be taken off the queue and would not be treated until July.  That is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>We had to look at cutbacks in the whole health area which have been of a penny-pinching nature.  They have been quantified in the minutes of the health board meetings.  There have been seasonal ward closures.  There have been cutbacks in transport and this is alarming because people cannot afford to travel to the various hospitals so their health is being put at risk.  The <i>ad hoc</i> community care service is vital and it cannot be highlighted enough.  It is a serious indictment of the administration that people are put in a situation where they cannot avail of these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in the geriatric area is alarming.  In the Southern Health Board area there are 61,800 people all over 65 years of age and only one bed in 51 is available to such patients.  In the Eastern Health Board area there are about 101,000 people over the age of 65 and the number of beds available there is one in 17.  I appeal to the Minister to tackle this very vital and important area immediately. Geriatric patients in the Southern Health Board area are entitled to as good a service as those in the Eastern Health <Col N="483" /> Board area and there is a gross inequality in the services of the two health boards when one compares like with like.</P>
    <P>There is a grave shortage of public health nurses in the Southern Health Board.  There are only 38 in an area where there should be 70.  The present administration have failed the people in the whole health service area.  Public health nursing is a vital component of community care.  That shortfall has to be tackled immediately and people appointed in the southern region.  We have had ward closures which are a national disgrace.  No words of mine could describe the problems this is creating.  As a public representative I visited a hospital recently to see constitutents and friends of mine and was alarmed and appalled at the overcrowding caused by the closure of wards.</P>
    <P>Nurses cannot provide proper care and services because of the present situation. I have seen patients in narrow corridors; I have seen beds placed against fire exits and against windows.  There is total overcrowding and a serious fire hazard, all because of cutbacks.  I have seen the finest wards left vacant because of ministerial orders and directives to the health boards.  I appeal to the Minister who represents the social element of the Government to influence his colleagues in the Cabinet to correct this situation so that we will once more have a health service that is worthwhile, the type of service we had under Deputy Haughey, the leader of Fianna Fáil, when he was Minister for Health and Social Welfare. People are thankful for the type of health service he gave them when he was in office.</P>
    <P>There are no substitutes available for nurses who are sick, on annual leave or maternity leave.  The whole system is stretched to the limit.  There is definitely a risk, and patients are not getting the proper care.  We had a very fine demonstration by the INO today on behalf of the hospital services.  A very decent and honest group came here and I met the Cork contingent.  They brought one glaring anomaly to my attention, that is, the <Col N="484" /> closure of the Bantry Hospital in the Southern Health Board area and the closure of the maternity unit.  They are still accepting patients.  Babies are being delivered and nurses have been called from busy wards to perform that duty.  They do not have the medical history of the patient.  We have a very modern and fine maternity service here but I understand that, if one does not have the medical history of the patient, there is serious risk to both the patient and the infant involved.  It is a glaring case of black-guardism by the Government not to have that situation corrected.</P>
    <P>In regard to the staffing of intensive care units, in the past there were four staff nurses and now this has been reduced to two.  There definitely is a serious anomaly there and a crisis in the intensive care unit of the hospital in my area because of the new low levels of staffing.  At the maternity hospital two nurses have to care for 44 mothers and babies, where there always were four or five nurses.  I appeal to the Government to come to the rescue of the health services, to give the Southern Health Board the £5.5 million they will be short this year and to get away from the penny-pinching attitude adopted and Barry Desmond&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all saddened by the wording of the amendment in that the Government are taking pride in the fact that they are providing more money for the health services.  The stage has long since gone when our elderly and those unable to help themselves should be victims of a budget.  We cannot accept this amendment or any suggestion that section 31 will be imposed to ensure that there is no additional expenditure on behalf of the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall confine my remarks to the North Western Health Board region in general <Col N="485" /> and Donegal in particular.  We have found it necessary to reduce expenditure by £3.5 million.  This is an area where all discretionary cuts have been applied prior to this financial year.  Any further cuts in that region imposed by the Government can only cause hardship, as we say in our motion.  They will put at risk the lives of many in that area.  It has been necessary to reduce hospital expenditure by £2.6 million, community care by £700,000 and central management by £200,000.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that the north western region and Donegal in particular cannot be compared with other parts of the country.  It is not new to us to find these heavy impositions by a Coalition Government, but I would have thought cuts such as these would not have been allowed because we had expected a socialist input into the policy.  The removal of the transport facilities from people in my area effectively means that all those who heretofore availed of transport are now being denied secondary medical care.  We live in an area which is without an adequate public transport service.  The cost of transport to and from the general hospital at Letterkenny from our area, or the Sligo hospital regarding the Sligo-Leitrim area, is prohibitive. Furthermore, many old and infirm people who find it necessary to travel to Dublin for appointments cannot now do so.  They are being denied this secondary care which is absolutely necessary for their survival.</P>
    <P>Last week, I visited a patient in my own constitutency living on an island off the west coast, who had to pay £200 for the trip to and from Dublin.  He has been called for a further appointment but has had to cancel it because he is not in a position to pay this money.  He may be told that he can avail of the public transport at £10, but he is not in a position to travel to Lifford or Letterkenny and needs care and attention while travelling to Dublin.</P>
    <P>In our region, people are cancelling their appointments and are even embarrassed to tell public representatives that they cannot afford the transport cost to <Col N="486" /> the east of the county to pick up the public transport from there.  If we cannot provide this means of transport, I put it to the Minister that there will be no difficulty caused by closure of beds and hospitals because our people will not be able to travel to them.  No consideration is given to rural areas such as mine as against the urban areas.  Donegal, a peripheral area, should be treated in isolation, but that is not so.  This is discrimination against rural areas and it saddens me that a Minister of State from the west can come in and defend such policies.</P>
    <P>The Government Deputies are conspicuous by their absence but when they speak in a constituency they are very critical of the Minister of Health.  Where are they tonight?  They will march through the lobbies as usual, not representing the interests of those whom they are supposed to represent.  We have been told that, in order to achieve the proposed cuts amounting to £3.5 million, we must have extended summer ward closures.  In effect, people are being told to become ill only between January and May and between October and December; between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. from Monday to Friday.  How ludicrous can the situation become?  There is a reduction in bed numbers and the substitution for full hospitalisation of outpatient day care, an increase in single hospital rooms and the decentralising of weekend emergencies. Staff are quietly asked to take leave of absence without pay.</P>
    <P>We look at the long term institutions. When the Minister announced the closure of a number of hospitals he quietly suggested that there should be a phasing out of St. Joseph's Hospital in Stranorlar. When questioned, he said there would be no difficulty, that this would be done over a long period.  However, immediately we are told that 50 beds there must close before any community care centres are opened throughout the county.  We would accept that many patients in St. Joseph's geriatric unit should remain there and that people from rural areas should stay in rural areas, but not until <Col N="487" /> such time as the community care hospitals and day centres are opened for them. The people in St. Joseph's have been asked to leave, or be removed to district hospitals.  St. Joseph's is their own environment.  They were told coldly and callously on television by the Minister that, in effect, the roof was being taken from over their heads.</P>
    <P>Any confidence or hope these people had remaining was dashed.  That is a Minister who has no compassion and is not familiar with the problems of such people.  The suggestion that they be put in district hospitals implies that such hospitals were serving no purpose.  Those district hospitals have served well the communities over the years, as far as short term illnesses were concerned. There is a back-up and we will find that the short term patients will have no beds available in hospital.  They must now stay at home and will not be provided with community care facilities or home help. I put it very bluntly that these people will be allowed by this Government to drown in their own excrement in their own homes, as a result of Government policies.</P>
    <P>In addition, in our region the gynaecological wards are being closed down for a period of six weeks.  There is no consideration for the women of that area and their health.  These women must ensure that they do not become pregnant and deliver their babies during the summer months because there might be no hospital care for them.</P>
    <P>The imposition of charges on the elderly has resulted in many of them not being in a position to pay, and care will be withdrawn from them.  The Minister of State at the Department of Fisheries, Forestry and Tourism suggested tonight that we were only scaremongering and that we were implementing the policies of the Government.  We or the health boards are not here to implement the policies of this Government, including section 31.  We are here to look after the interests of the elderly and infirm and those who cannot afford to pay for medical care.  There is no point in boasting <Col N="488" /> about our excellent health services and the new hospitals in Dublin if we cannot look after those people.  We will be judged by our health services.</P>
    <P>We have been told we should be grateful that a payment of £310,000 was made in addition to the original allocation for the North Western Health Board.  That is something that we should not be too proud about.  It was to service an absolutely essential dialysis machine provided by the people of the north western region and not one penny of that capital expenditure was provided by the Government. It appears that this Government consider people in need of care to be a liability to the country.  That is not our attitude.  We ask many rural Deputies, who are fully aware of the serious impositions, to support us in our motion tonight.</P>

      <P>At the outset, I am amazed at the absence of the Fine Gael and Labour Deputies, which shows what little interest they have in the health services. The Progressive Democrats are also missing.  They are on record as saying they would do exactly what the Government are doing.</P>
      <P>On 16 May 1985 Minister Desmond said the care of the elderly is an important issue facing the health and social services in this country. He said that he would accept that generally speaking the elderly are less well off than the rest of the population. He added:</P>
      <P>As far as possible we must try to anticipate the needs of the elderly and develop the kind of services which we would like to see in existence when we grow old.  It seems to me that we should plan our services on the basis of the principles of independence and dignity. We should place the emphasis on community care.</P>
      <P>What a gap there is between this vision of an independent elderly population leading active and fulfilling lives in their old age and the squalid reality of undignified deprivation which the present Government's health cut-backs have achieved for the elderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="489" /> There are at present some 369,000 people over 65 years of ago, of which 132,000 are under 75 years of age.  About 65,000 of those live on their own.  Professor Brendan Walsh estimated that by 1991 the number of elderly will increase by 10 per cent while the number of those over 75 will grow by more than 20 per cent.  In rural areas 53 per cent of the elderly live in dwellings built before 1919 compared to 4.6 per cent of the population generally.  The elderly suffer more frequently from health problems than the rest of the community.  They are therefore bound to suffer more from cut-backs in the health service as a consequence.</P>
    <P>In May of last year the Minister praised the public health nursing service.  Nearly 70 per cent of all patients visited by the nurses are over 65 years of age.  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The importance of the public health nurse in the provision of basic health care for the elderly cannot be over-emphasised.</P>
    <P>Why then, at a time when the number of elderly people in the community is increasing, does the Minister not increase the number of public health nurses? Indeed, he is even refusing to replace those who resign or who are on leave.  It was reported recently that some nurses in the Cork area have up to 120 old people on their list.  Why then have their petrol allocations and travelling expenses been reduced in real terms?  Public health nurses nowadays cannot deal adequately with the patients under their care and yet the Minister stressed that this was one of the most important areas of health care.</P>
    <P>The failure to practically encourage effective home nursing service, especially for the care of the aged, makes an absolute mockery of the commitment in the national plan to a health system based on community care.  The Minister's commitment to develop more day hospitals as part of a more comprehensive service for the elderly in need of medical care has proved to be a very hollow promise, given his failure to secure the extra resources from the Government to honour this commitment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="490" /> In October 1984 Minister Desmond and his officials acknowledged that the national plan would have considerable implications for the health services.  A reduction of between 2,500 and 3,000 health service jobs in the 1984-87 period was envisaged.  However, the Minister insisted at the time that all the essential services now in the excellent fabric of the health services will be maintained. Despite the Minister's contention, financial cutbacks are adversely affecting health care.  The public at large now realise that.  The cut-backs are holding back achievements of the Government's stated aim of deinstitutionalising health care.  They threaten nursing homes, day hospitals, welfare homes, meals on wheels, home help for the disabled, sheltered accommodation for the disabled &mdash; all services which are an integral part of any move towards a community health service.</P>
    <P>In April 1984, the National Planning Board, when recommending an annual reduction of 4 per cent in real terms in health spending between 1985 and 1987, maintained that these savings could be made by good management without any sacrifice in the standards of services.  But warned that there is a danger that this recommendation would be implemented in such a way that the costs are borne primarily by patients and the public in general rather than through increased cost efficiency in the health system. Patients and the public are now suffering more and more and many of their lives are in danger as a result.  Institutional and community services are clearly suffering from cut-backs.  Patient care must suffer as waiting lists in hospitals for major operations grow longer, as staff shortages worsen and as essential health services are eroded.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board, with a projected deficit of £14 million, envisage that they may be forced to close St. Brendan's psychiatric hospital and St. Ita's with over 2,000 resident patients, in an effort to achieve the major cuts in spending being sought by the Minister for Health.  Can the Government seriously contemplate ejecting 2,000 patients from institutional <Col N="491" /> care before the necessary framework is built up to care for them in the community? I say it cannot.</P>
    <P>The professionals involved in health care have warned repeatedly that the health boards are incapable of effectively implementing a community-based psychiatric care service before the structure for such a service is firmly in place.  This structure will not appear overnight.  It needs careful thought and research.  To coerce the health boards into accepting a community-based service before the necessary facilities are in place is criminal. It would assuredly have tragic results for hundreds of patients ejected from institutional care into a society that is unprepared to receive them and care for them in an adequate fashion.  This whole reckless uncaring policy direction by the Government gives the lie to the Minister's asserton on 16 May 1985 when he said:</P>
    <P>As Minister, I will do my utmost to maintain the various health services for those most in need of them.</P>
    <P>By his own yardstick the Minister has failed.  He has failed miserably to put up a solid and caring defence of the weakest and most vulnerable section in our society.  It is ludicrous to think that the community care services can be expanded to adequately cope with a health service based in the community while the existing level of community care services are jeopardised.</P>
    <P>The present community care services are carrying an increased burden, with the number of dependants growing all the time, expecially in the new suburbs. Funding is not keeping pace with the increased demand.  The Eastern Health Board estimates that they will spend £50.2 million on the provision of community care this year as compared with £46 million in 1985.  They say if they attempt to maintain services in line with departmental policy directions it is likely that the provision of new facilities will be halted in the new outlying suburbs and new growth areas most in need of the health infrastructure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="492" /> In the mid-west the Department have provided money to build a new theatre in Croom, new day centres in the region and new industrial therapy units at St. Joseph's Hospital in Limerick and Our Lady's Hospital in Ennis.  Yet, if the present trend continues, the staff to operate these facilities will not be available. Last night the Minister said that at present there is no danger of lives being put at risk.  Can he seriously believe this? Seriously ill patients are being accommodated in corridors because of ward closures. It is more difficult now to have elderly people admitted to hospital than heretofore because the beds are not available.  If the Minister knows anything about what happens in the outside world he will recognise that there are not now enough beds in hospitals for old people.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to see the members of the nursing profession outside the House today.  They realistically understand how the health services are seriously being curtailed and how patients are suffering.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Health will go down in the history of this State as being the most callous, cruel and uncaring Minister who has ever held this office. The public at large are now frightened and concerned about the harrowing decisions which he has taken.  He has an obsession with cut-backs and closures and history will record that, when his term of office is over, he will have created an unprecedented record of closure of hospitals and hospital beds, A record, may I say of a Minister who so often in the past espoused his socialistic views and shed crocodile tears so often about the inefficiencies of the then existing health services and how they should have been expanded and extended.  We know now what a hollow cry that was and what a hypocrite he is.  We know now that the Minister is a typical poacher turned gamekeeper who has himself and himself alone to blame for the crisis in the health services at every level.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope the Minister is ashamed of his performance as Minister for Health because the public at large are certainly ashamed of him.  They clearly recognised that his arrogant authoritarian <Col N="493" /> style of approach has devastated the health services.  Morale has never been lower and the Minister has antagonised all those who work in the health services, &mdash; the administrators, the doctors, the nurses, community staff and others. Never was morale so low and it is high time the Minister changed his ways and showed a little kindness, care and compassion towards the sick and the elderly who are certainly deserving of better treatment than they are getting from the Minister and this Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand all the charges that have been made this evening about the dismantling of the health services, realising that the cost of the services this year will be £1,274 million to provide a basic health service for the community and give employment to 62,500 people.  The Minister has acknowledged that difficulties will arise in balancing the health budget.  This situation is not unique to this country. Throughout Europe and, indeed, on a global basis the escalating costs of health services in the seventies gave rise to serious concern that, unless corrective action were taken, the situation could get out of control.</P>
      <P>It is thus perhaps fortuitous that the Government's policy in relation to public expenditure generally, inevitably included the containment of expenditure on health services because health services revenue expenditure absorbs 19 per cent of overall public services revenue expenditure. Despite the difficult economic situation, however, the Government have clearly provided very substantial funds for health services in 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to note that, despite the difficulties, the Minister has found it possible to provide funds to enable certain improvements in services to be carried out.  Even when resources are limited it is important to free up some funds to secure a forward progression, modest though it may be, in the development and re-orientation of services and in meeting new services.  The health services are so <Col N="494" /> extensive and diverse that inevitably situations requiring extra funds arise from time to time.  I am sure the Minister will be prepared to respond generously within the resources available to him when he is convinced that funds are needed for a necessary health requirement.</P>
    <P>In the past there appears to have been a dichotomy between the delivery and the development of health services and the costs involved.  Persons directly involved in the delivery of health services such as doctors and nurses paid little or no attention to the question of financing the services.  I am not blaming them for this. The system simply did not involve them in the management of hospital and health service budgets.  Their reaction to any budgetary constraints is thus, perhaps, not surprising.  This has got to change. Many countries throughout the world are considering new management techniques aimed at involving the main generators of expenditure in the process of aligning activities with the resources available. This would seem to be a fairly straightforward, and commonsense approach.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House will do nothing to improve the health services or associated funding.  As the Minister has said, the motion is extreme and emotive and should be rejected, primarily because it causes so much unnecessary upset and concern to people in particular, the old and the needy who require services and who are made fearful that they will not get them.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil spokesman on Health was more realistic recently when he addressed the Association of Health Boards.  On that occasion he said that, even with a change of Government, he could not envisage additional increases to the health boards.  He also clearly indicated that section 31 would not be removed. My information is that the words he used were: &ldquo;He who pays the piper calls the tune&rdquo;.  Deputy O'Hanlon, for whom I have tremendous respect, made the following clear, concise and praiseworthy statement:</P>
    <P>The boards' elected representatives and professional persons working in <Col N="495" /> this service have combined with good management teams to provide what is really an excellent health service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this timely and realistic motion I should like to inform the House that the Southern Health Board are short £5.5 million.  That amount of money is required to enable the board to run the services as the members, the CEO and the medical and administrative staff deem it necessary to run a decent health service within the area covered by the board.  In County Kerry many serious problems have arisen due to the fact that the Minister either does not care or is so weak that he cannot get adequate funding from his Cabinet colleagues.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment amounts to nothing more than waffle and the progress report on the health services from 1983 to 1986 is completely irrelevant as far as the people I represent, the people of south Kerry, are concerned.  The health of the less well off people of south Kerry is suffering and, indeed, lives are at risk as a direct result of the failure of the Government, and the Minister for Health, to fund an acceptable level of health services.  I shall give a number of examples to prove my point.  In regard to medical cards I should like to state that no more medical cards are being granted on the grounds of hardship as was the case under Fianna Fáil Ministers for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The eligibility limits for applicants, as laid down by the Minister, must be strictly adhered to and medical cards are no longer granted on the grounds of hardship alone, no matter what effect that will have on the well being of patients who through hardship and family circumstances find it impossible to pay for regular visits to the family doctor as well as paying the first £28 of the cost of medicines each month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a complete lack of funding for the payment of the cost of the transport <Col N="496" /> of medical card holders to clinics or hospitals. This year's budget for this service will mean that many medical card holders who are ill will miss out on visits to clinics or hospitals.  Those people cannot afford to pay the cost of car hire.  There are long waiting lists for the following services in Kerry: spectacles and glasses &mdash; up to two and a half years; dental extractions, six months; dentures, 18 months; and children in the ten to 14 years age group who require and are entitled to orthodontic treatment must wait four to five years. The Minister must be aware that by then permanent damage is done to those children. There is an upward limit of 136 people who can be facilitated with joint and hip operations in the Tralee Regional Hospital in 1986.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not have to deal with many such cases in his constituency but I can assure him that I meet many people seeking those services on my visits around south Kerry.  Little can be done to help those people due to the inadequate funding to the Southern Health Board.  I should like to tell the House that for the want of £500,000 to repair sophisticated equipment which has broken down in the Cork Regional Hospital it is necessary for a certain category of patients to travel from Kerry and Cork to Dublin for tests. That is disgraceful.  When will the Minister provide that money to repair the equipment in Cork?</P>
    <P>The unkindest cut of all in relation to the operation of the health services in Kerry arose from decisions taken, following presdure from the Minister for Health, to close down hospital wards. This has caused serious problems for the medical profession to have to take tough decisions in the towns and rural areas of Kerry as to what to do with patients they consider to be seriously ill and for whom hospital beds are not available.  Indeed, some of those patients may be ill because they could not afford to pay for their medication and went without it.</P>
    <P>The Minister's decision to close the Killarney Isolation Hospital, and to reinforce that decision by a majority vote in the Dáil, caused panic and confusion among the people of South Kerry.  The <Col N="497" /> people of that area have lost confidence in the Minister.  I am aware that following representations by public representatives, nurses and other caring people in Killarney, the Minister eased the situation somewhat and backed down to some extent.  However, I am convinced that he will pass on the ultimate decision as to how this serious error of judgment on his part is to be resolved to the Southern Health Board, a board who are in financial diffiuclties to the tune of £5.5 million.  This exercise has had the effect of creating a very serious division between the staff of the Killarney Isolation Hospital and their next door neighbours the staff of St. Columbanus' Home.</P>
    <P>It now appears that the Minister wants the Southern Health Board to close down wards and 41 beds at St. Columbanus' Home in Killarney and transfer 25 of these patients to the isolation hospital. Would the Minister tell the House what will become of the other 16 patients?  I am warning the Minister that the continuation of the embargo on the employment of hospital staff will lead to the closing of more hospital beds, due to the lack of sufficient staff to run the hospital services. I can assure this House that the people of County Kerry want the Minister to provide the necessary funds for the Southern Health Board or else to resign.</P>

      <P>In answer to the Minister of State, Deputy Moynihan, I did say at the Association of Health Boards that section 31 would remain if Fianna Fáil were in Government as it has been operated by successive Governments for the past ten years.  The problem is that the Members of the Government party who were there believed that the implementation of section 31 means that we would not provide adequate funding for the health services.  That is not correct.  I did not say that there would not be more money available.  In fact, we are committed to ensuring an adequate level of service. I am sure that Deputy Moynihan, who is Minister of State for Tourism, never envisaged he would be in here defending, as a Labour Deputy in this House, the most savage cut-backs in the <Col N="498" /> history of the State.  The Government speakers who spoke in this debate spoke in figures all the time mainly in percentages without any sensitivity to the needs of people.  Every one of our speakers one after another spoke about the practical realities on the ground and about the hardships people are suffering.  Neither the Minister nor the Minister of State answered any of the points that were raised, except one.</P>
      <P>The only thing I heard which in any way one could apply practically to the health services was that Baggot Street was nearer to Sir Patrick Dun's than St. Vincent's Hospital.  We heard that from the Minister of State, Deputy Donnellan, tonight.  If the Minister of State believes that because Baggot Street is nearer to Sir Patrick Dun's it will be able to cope with the 4,500 admissions to Sir Patrick Dunn's and the 12,500 outpatients, the reality in Baggot Street is that last year they had an outturn of £5.165 million and their allocation this year has been reduced to £5 million.  Yet they are expected to cater for the needs of Sir Patrick Dun's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No mention was made of the problems in the acute hospitals.  Letterkenny, Sligo, Longford and St. Vincent's were referred to.  St. Vincent's Hospital, one of the largest voluntary hospitals in Dublin, had a decrease in real terms and closed 100 beds last year.  The Minister of State told us that the Southern Health Board had an estimated deficit last year of £9 million and ended up with a deficit of £1 million.  We heard from Deputy O'Keeffe tonight the reality in the Southern Health Board.  It is no credit to any health board that they had a deficit of £9 million at the start of the year and reduced services to an unacceptable level and ended up with a deficit of £1 million.  The Eastern Health Board last week had to introduce proposals to save £9 million this year, £8.95 million to be exact.  We are going to have ward closures.  The Minister of State said that that was the usual thing. Specialist units were closed in this city last summer and consultants will tell us today that as a result of the closures for six weeks of some of these units there is <Col N="499" /> now a backlog which is causing chaos.  If that happens again it will put more lives at risk.  The problem with the Government is that it is all percentages and figures with no knowledge of what is happening out there in the country.  The effect of the ward closures is that there are longer waiting lists for admissions and outpatient departments along with early discharge of patients.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said tonight that it was unfair to compare the outturn with the original allocation.  The outturn is what is important because that is what it cost the various health agencies to run their reduced services in 1985.  Their allocations are down this year and their outturn for last year.  This means further serious problems.  As Deputy McCarthy said, the nurses came here today to express their concern, not about their own conditions of service or about their salaries &mdash; although the Minister, in this House last night and in a statement released to the Press, comment on their salaries and how the nurses were remunerated &mdash; but because they were anxious, first of all, to meet the Minister to explain the situation to him and, secondly, they were concerned at the cut-backs. They wanted to highlight that and did so here today.  The Minister said he was puzzled at the fact that they were coming here.  It does not surprise any of us on this side of the House that the Minister was puzzled because he and the Government are totally out of touch with what is happening, as was highlighted by my colleagues on these benches over the last two nights.</P>
    <P>We dealt with the psychiatric services last night but no reference was made tonight on the points which were raised. Since last night I am informed that a further communication has gone to the Western Health Board telling them that they have got to close Castlerea Hospital and that the order to close it stands.  The Minister last night referred to capital developments for the mentally handicapped. He referred to Cheeverstown but he did not refer to the fact that there is no staff for part of the hospital.  There <Col N="500" /> is a hostel for the mentally handicapped in Cootehill for which over the last three years the Minister has not provided the funds for staff.  There is a decrease in real terms, for example, to the Order of St. John of God's in the nature of £500,000 this year.  This is going to cause very serious problems.  In the Midland Health Board area there has been a reduction in the rehabilitation allowance to those in receipt of the allowance by as much as £10 a week.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how any Minister can come in here and tell us we have a good service when the most vulnerable in the State are suffering.  The Minister of State, Deputy Donnellan, referred to the general medical service and said that there was no reduction.  In Mayo 5,000 fewer people were eligible for general medical services at the end of 1983 than at the end of 1982.  A letter from the Minister's Department on 12 December last to the health board stated:</P>
    <P>Accordingly, there should be no increase in the number of patients covered by medical cards during 1986. Any increase in demand for cover should be offset by the uniform, rigorous application of the guidelines.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister for State, Deputy Moynihan, agree with that sentiment going out from the Department to the health board telling them, in regard to people who cannot afford to provide medical services for themselves, that under no circumstances are they to receive a medical service if it is going to mean that the number of people covered by medical cards will be increased?</P>
    <P>The Minister told us last night that we should have the co-operation of the Western Health Board instead of &ldquo;spurious, appalling, political point-scoring, more concern about keeping the name of the Minister for Health off a foundation stone.&rdquo;  That is what the Minister is concerned about.  When he was referring to the CATT scanner in Galway, that is the only reference he could make &mdash; about a foundation stone that his name was not on.  The Minister should recognise that <Col N="501" /> there are any amount of precedents where Ministers were big enough to go along and make their contribution at a foundation ceremony without first having to have their name on some sort of stone. The Minister also told us last night that he had issued unambiguous policy decisions after seeking, and for the most part accepting, the professional medical, administrative advice of the senior staff of the Department of Health.  He is now trying to blame the Department of Health for his decisions.</P>
    <P>What about his U-turn on Monaghan Hospital, where he wrote to the hospital telling them they had to close the whole hospital and dispose of it before he would sign the contract for Cavan Hospital? Then, he did a U-turn and was going to keep the medical and surgical units and close the maternity unit until a court case decided he could not do that.  We have the same situation with the psychiatric hospital in Carlow and the isolation hospital in Killarney, where he said that was to be closed by the middle of this year.  He has done another U-turn on that.  Where is the Health (Amendment) No. 2 Act which was going to give power to the Minister to close anything he liked without any reference to health boards or the Green Paper he promised us on the health services in May 1983 and again in this House in 1984?  We are not now going to have a Green Paper.  Where has it gone to?  Why is he not going to <Col N="502" /> introduce it?  I believe that the services are now in such chaos as a result of the Government's administration that the Minister would be afraid to produce a Green Paper in this House.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's amendment we are asked to note that the level of resources provided is sufficient to ensure the delivery of essential health services to the community and it commends the Minister of Health for his radical reform.  We reject that.  It all depends on one's interpretation of &ldquo;essential&rdquo;.  There has been radical reform in the wrong direction. Fianna Fáil are conscious of cost: we are concerned, naturally, at the cost of any public service.  We will act responsibly in Government and we promise the people that we will deliver an adequate level of services.  The Government are either unaware of what is happening or they will not admit what is happening.  We ask them to go out and see for themselves. Even in their constituencies they should admit the problems that exist and cooperate with the health boards and the health agencies.  We appeal to the Government, and we are asking the House tonight to vote to ask the Government to provide sufficient funding to ensure that there will be adequate and proper levels of health services for the people of this nation.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that actions in the High Court for damages for personal injuries will be tried in future by a judge sitting alone, rather than by a judge and jury as at present.  Juries will remain available, however, in cases involving false imprisonment, or intentional trespass to the person, that is assault and battery, even if the damages claimed include damages for personal injuries.  Juries will also continue in actions for defamation, malicious prosecution and for certain probate and matrimonial matters.  I will have a little more to say about these exclusions later, but at this stage I will just mention that they account for a small fraction of jury cases, and that the cases affected by the Bill, primarily negligence actions for personal injuries as a result of road accidents or accidents at work, account for the vast bulk of jury actions coming before the High Court.  I need hardly say that the Bill will not affect juries in criminal cases. There is, of course, a constitutional right to trial by jury on a serious criminal charge which is subject only to the exceptions set out in Article 38 but the Constitution does not contain any reference to trial by jury in civil cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing with the questions of policy that are involved, it might be useful to say something about the history of civil jury trials, and about important developments that have affected their availability in the courts.  For a long period after jury trial had achieved its present form by the 15th century &mdash; trial by one's peers envisaged in Magna Carta was an essentially different process &mdash; trial by jury was the only form available in the common law courts.  In the Court of Chancery a jury's findings on issues of fact could be obtained by sending that issue to a common law court but that was rarely availed of and for all practical purposes chancery cases were decided by a judge sitting alone.  There has been, for well <Col N="508" /> over 100 years now, a gradual erosion of the right to jury trial in civil matters.</P>
    <P>The Common Law Procedure (Ireland) Act, 1854, provided that the parties might, on consent, and with the approval of the court, allow issues of fact to be tried by a judge alone.  The same Act provided that where an issue consisted wholly or mainly of matters of account it might, on the application of either party, be determined in a summary manner by a judge, or might be referred by him to an arbitrator &mdash; the outcome in either event to have the same effect as the finding of a jury.  Rules made under the Judicature (Ireland) Act, 1877, obliged a party requiring a jury trial to state this when setting down his action for trial.</P>
    <P>The Chancery (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1858, provided that the right to a jury in chancery actions should be in the discretion of the judge.  The Courts of Justice Act, 1924, provided that no party to an action for a liquidated sum, or for damages for breach of contract, or for the recovery of land, should be entitled to a jury unless the court considered that a jury was necessary or desirable.  The result of these developments is that jury trial in the High Court, which as I have indicated was once the only form of trial in the common law courts, now occurs, for all practical purposes and with limited exceptions, only in personal injury cases.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps mention previous consideration given to the question of civil juries in recent times.  In their Third Interim Report in 1965 the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, by the narrowest of majorities &mdash; six to five &mdash; recommended that the right to civil jury trial should continue in the High Court. They also recommended that the right to civil jury trial in the Circuit Court should be abolished and this was effected by a provision in the Courts Act, 1971.  The committee returned to the issue in their 20th Interim Report in 1978.  Although they considered the matter only incidentally, they reaffirmed their earlier view that no change should be made in the High Court jury system.</P>
    <P>In 1972 the &ldquo;O'Connor Committee&rdquo;, who were established to inquire into the <Col N="509" /> insurance industry, concluded that juries should be retained to decide liability in negligence cases, but that the responsibility for deciding the quantum of damages should rest with the judge assisted by assessors.  More recently the Prices Advisory Committee on Motor Insurance &mdash; the &ldquo;McLiam Committee&rdquo;&mdash; concluded in their report in 1982 that, while in their view the jury system should remain, certain changes were needed to deal with problems of inconsistency and unfairness that arose from the operation of the system in deciding motor insurance cases.</P>
    <P>I have dwelt at some length on these aspects to show that historically the trend has been to reduce the use of juries in deciding civil cases, and to show that the question of the abolition of civil juries has been a matter of debate for some time.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the court committee's report that strong arguments arise on both sides of the issue, and that there are strongly divided views on the matter.  This is true even of the judges.  Professor Bryan McMahon in his article <i>Jury Trial for Personal Injury cases in Ireland</i> published in May 1985 in <i>The Irish Times</i> found that High Court judges who responded to a questionnaire from him were evenly split on the central issue and views given to my predecessor by some of the superior court judges also revealed strongly divided opinions on the part of the judges.</P>
    <P>It was against this general review of the present operation of the civil jury system and in the context of the renewed debate on the issue in relation to insurance matters, that the Government decided in principle last year to change the present system and asked my predecessor to examine alternative arrangements for deciding these cases.  The Bill which is before the House is the end product of that exercise.  During his examination of the question of alternatives, my predecessor considered the various possible options for reform of the jury system.</P>
    <P>These include:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="510" />&mdash;first, retaining the present jury system for determining liability and damages in personal injury cases, but empowering the trial judge to indicate the going rate for general damages in comparable cases to the jury, who would be free to depart from such range in the particular case;</P>
    <P>&mdash;second, retaining juries to determine liability but not damages;</P>
    <P>&mdash;third, replacing juries by a judge sitting with assessors to advise or make recommendations on damages;</P>
    <P>&mdash;fourth, introducing a statutory tariff for general damages for personal injury cases;</P>
    <P>&mdash;fifth, introducing a statutory maximum for general damages;</P>
    <P>&mdash;sixth, replacing juries by a judge sitting alone to decide on liability and damages in all cases;</P>
    <P>&mdash;seventh, allowing juries to decide on liability and damages in exceptional cases, with all other cases being decided by a judge sitting alone.</P>
    <P>After careful consideration of all of these options the Government decided that the best arrangement was to replace civil juries with a single judge sitting alone to decide the issues of liability and damages in personal injuries cases.</P>
    <P>The growth in personal injury cases coming before the High Court in recent years has focused greater attention on the awards being made by juries in those cases.  The high level of some awards attracted much publicity and a growing belief in some quarters that the incidence of excessive awards in these cases had become unacceptable.  The &ldquo;McLiam Committee&rdquo; found evidence that awards given by juries were sometimes remarkably unpredictable, varying widely between cases where the circumstances appeared to be similar.  They emphasised the unfairness of such a situation on litigants, and the difficulties which this unpredictability created for the insurance industry.  They concluded that it would be in the interest of justice, and conducive to the proper management of motor insurance, if a greater degree of consistency could be achieved in the assessment of <Col N="511" /> damages, bearing in mind the over-riding requirement of doing justice between the parties.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court was also concerned about excessive jury awards, and in three important judgements delivered between 1983 and 1984, brought about substantial changes in the basis for assessing the quantum of damages in personal injury cases.  In the last of these cases they indicated that a limit of £150,000 should apply generally to awards of general damages for pain and suffering and loss of the amenities of life in the most extreme cases of personal injuries unless there are particular circumstances which suggest otherwise.  The then Chief Justice had remarked in that case that in attempting to compensate for very serious injury &ldquo;all sense of reality may be lost&rdquo;, and he considered that &ldquo;a yardstick of a reasonable nature must be applied if reality is to be retained in the assessment of such compensation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The court decided also that in cases where sufficient damages had been awarded to cover all loss and bodily needs and to enable the plaintiff to live in comparative comfort, having regard to the disability, that fact should be reflected in the amount of damages for pain and suffering; that, where damages have been assessed under several headings, the total sum and the income it could generate should be considered by the jury in order to enable them to judge whether it is out of all proportion to the circumstances; that in assessing the amount for future loss of earnings actuarial figures are only a guideline and on making the assessment the jury should consider evidence relating to the risk of unemployment, redundancy, illness, accident or marriage prospects. The cases show a concern on the part of the Supreme Court at what it regarded as clearly excessive awards.</P>
    <P>The high level of damages awarded in the courts in such cases have a major bearing on the amounts for which insurers will settle personal injuries claims outside the courts.  Insurers say that such claims are settled under the shadow of a <Col N="512" /> court hearing and that the proven unpredictability of jury awards has had a destabilising effect on the settlement process, reflected ultimately in the cost of insurance. One judge of the Supreme Court, in a recent case, observed that the proliferation of personal injuries claims, and the significantly high number of serious cases, appeared to have induced among lawyers and insurers alike a degree of what he called, &ldquo;monetary punch drunkenness&rdquo; that had tended to remove reality from such settlements.  The levels of awards by juries for personal injuries are inevitably reflected in the amounts agreed in settlements which comprise about 95 per cent of personal injuries claims.</P>
    <P>Of course it could be argued that the changes which the Supreme Court has been introducing recently in assessing damages might, of themselves, cure the problems associated with excessive jury awards.  Again I have to stress that the issue has been looked at by the Government on its merits, in the light of the historical arguments for and against having civil juries to decide personal injuries cases, as well as recent judicial developments, and debate on the issue. The Government's conclusion was that the balance of advantage now clearly favours the abolition of juries for such cases.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to some of the main points that have been raised in regard to trial of civil liability cases by a judge sitting alone.  One of the most important arguments made in favour of juries is founded on the social, civil and educational values of juries.  Jury service, it is said, gives a sense of community responsibility, is an educating force in the community and acquaints citizens with justice as it is in practice administered.  It helps, it is claimed, to teach the members of juries that they have a share in the society in which they live and tends to make the law intelligible.</P>
    <P>While there is undoubtedly force in that argument, it would constitute a far stronger argument if jury trials were used at present over the whole range of civil litigation.  But that is not the case.  As I <Col N="513" /> have mentioned, for all practical purposes nowadays civil juries are used only in cases arising out of motor accidents and accidents at work.  All other civil cases, with a few exceptions, have either always been decided by a judge sitting alone, or have been so decided for a very long time.  There is also the plain fact that in modern circumstances most people regard jury service as a burden and many go to great lengths to avoid it.  This is an inevitable conclusion from the most recent figures provided to me by the courts.  They show that only about 30 per cent of those called for jury service in the High Court for civil actions actually attend.  The others either claim exemptions to which they are entitled, seek and obtain exemptions at the discretion of the court, or simply do not turn up.  I understand that it is very rare for the courts to receive a request to participate in jury service.  This means that it is necessary to call over 10,000 people a year to service civil jury trials in the High Court in Dublin, so that much marshalling of resources and a significant amount of High Court time is involved.  It is also worth noting, although perhaps not too much should be read into it, that the strong minority view expressed in the Committee of Court Practice and Procedure in 1965 in favour of abolition of civil juries was subscribed to by three or the four lay members of the committee.</P>
    <P>There is an assumption in some quarters that the object of the Government's proposal to replace civil juries is to reduce awards in personal injuries cases generally. That is simply not correct.  The purpose is to avoid excessive awards as far as possible and to bring consistency and predictability into awards given.  It is necessary to be very cautious in speculating what effect the measure might have on the general level of damages awarded apart from the expected effect that it will obviate excessive awards.  For one thing, it is quite possible that the impact of the recent Supreme Court decisions on the assessment of damages may be greater than any effect on the general level of damages that might follow from the replacement of juries by judges sitting <Col N="514" /> alone, or at any rate that it may be impossible to distinguish between the two cases.  Moreover, although the incidence of personal injuries cases heard in the High Court by a judge sitting alone with the consent of the parties has not been great, what indications there are show that a judge can be no less generous than a jury when it comes to assessing damages in serious cases.  Furthermore, judges sitting alone have been deciding personal injuries cases in the Circuit Court since 1972, and there has been no public reaction as far as I am aware, against the level of damages awarded in the Circuit Court. Since the jurisdiction of that court to hear tort actions was increased to £15,000 in 1982, more serious cases are now being decided in the Circuit Court and I am not aware of any claim that Circuit Court judges are making inadequate awards, even in cases where minor injuries are involved.</P>
    <P>Some of the concern about the possibility of unduly low awards from judges sitting alone arises from the fact that awards in England, where jury trials have disappeared for all practical purposes, have traditionally been much lower than awards made by Irish juries; but comparisons with the situation in England are not valid.  Without wishing to go into the matter in too much detail, I must point out that there are crucial differences in the way in which damages for future pecuniary costs or losses are assessed in the two jurisdictions &mdash; one important difference is the reluctance of English courts to make use of actuarial evidence &mdash; and as to how account is taken of inflation.</P>
    <P>The maximum general damages which British Courts are prepared to award in respect of pain and suffering and loss of amenities in connection with injuries of maximum severity have been considerably lower that the amount of £150,000, already referred to, which our Supreme Court judges have set as a general guideline. In fact, the level of awards for serious injuries in England has come under increasing criticism in recent years for being too low, and very recent awards <Col N="515" /> there have borne out the general expectation that British awards will rise.  For example, in two cases of very serious injury reported in England in December 1985, damages equivalent to £799,000 and £683,000 in Irish pounds were awarded.  These were record awards by British courts.</P>
    <P>Spokesmen for the insurance industry are not presuming that damages will fall when assessed by judges.  In fact, they have expressed the view that it is unlikely that judges will reduce awards from the prevailing levels.</P>
    <P>One can claim with confidence that a greater degree of consistency will prevail in relation to awards under the new system and that excessive awards will be largely avoided.  This is likely to come about when all personal injuries cases are being decided continually by a body of experienced judges, compared with the &ldquo;once off&rdquo; shot by a jury who have no prior experience of the task.  If, as no doubt will happen, variations arise between individual judges in the amount of damages they award, the Supreme Court will be available to correct awards that deviate from an acceptable norm, not only to reduce awards that are too high but also to increase such awards as are unacceptably low.</P>
    <P>It is to be expected that the Supreme Court will be more ready to interfere with a reasoned decision of a judge and over the years an acceptable and more or less predictable pattern should emerge.  This is of the greatest importance to litigants who need to know with some certainty what they may expect to receive if they incur the expense of going to court, not least so as to enable them to decide whether and for what amount they can settle their claim without going to actual trial.  There is good reason to believe that the increased predictability of awards in personal injuries cases under the new arrangement proposed will enable insurers to settle claims more quickly.</P>
    <P>Insurers say that the benefits of this will be passed on to the general insuring public, through, at the very least, a <Col N="516" /> reduced need to increase insurance premiums and, depending on the overall outcome of the new arrangements, in possible reductions in premiums.  I can assure the House that my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who has responsibility for supervising the insurance industry, will be concerned to ensure that economies that arise for insurers from the changes that are proposed in this Bill will be passed on the insuring public.</P>
    <P>Among the main objections that were put forward in 1965 when the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure were considering the question, was the fact that there were only four High Court judges available at that time to hear cases; that judges were inclined to be either plaintiffs' judges or defendants' judges and that the result of cases would be a foregone conclusion; and that judges, by reason of their occupation, would be isolated and out of touch with present day standards of conduct and value.  It was urged on the committee that where only three or four judges were available, that tendency would be more marked.  However, the position has changed since then and there are now 16 judges in the High Court, including the President.  I am confident that the powers that will be invested in the High Court Judiciary by this Bill will be discharged in a fair and proper manner, and in a way that will have due regard for current values.  I have already referred to the availability of the Supreme Court to correct awards made in the High Court which are either too high or too low.</P>
    <P>There has never been much doubt that civil trials by judges alone are likely to take a considerably shorter time than jury trials.  Some people who are close to the operation of the courts estimate that the saving in time could be of the order of one third or one half.  This has obvious benefits for litigants.  They can expect to have their cases dealt with more quickly and possibly at reduced cost as fewer cases may be expected to come before the courts and those that do would be dealt with more quickly.  The need for the multiplicity of legal representatives <Col N="517" /> who appear for both sides in these cases at present will be looked at critically in the context of the new arrangements.</P>

      <P>Coming to the specific provisions in the Bill, the Government considered that its scope should be confined to actions involving personal injuries, and that juries should remain for other types of High Court cases that are heard by juries at present.  These are cases such as libel and slander, probate actions, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution. In these types of cases the evidence often relates to the actions, motives and behaviour of the parties, sometimes over a period of time and the liberty of the individual and his good name are involved in some of them.  The Government accept that jury trial is the most suitable way of deciding such cases.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) of section 1 is the substantive provision to abolish juries in personal injuries cases in the High Court. The extension of the scope of the measure to include cases arising under section 48 of the Civil Liability Act, 1961 and section 18 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, is to ensure that dependency actions for damages arising from the death of a person that is caused by the wrongful act, neglect or default of another, will come within the new arrangements.  Issues arise in such cases similar to those in personal injuries cases, and already the amounts of compensation that may be awarded in such cases for mental distress resulting from the death fall to be decided by the judge alone under the legislation to which I have just referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 1 specifies the actions for personal injuries that are covered by the Bill.  These are actions claiming damages in respect of personal injuries based on negligence, nuisance or breach of duty whether the duty exists by virtue of a contract or a provision made by or under a statute, or independently of any contract or any such provision.  I draw the attention of Deputies first of all to the exclusion of cases where the <Col N="518" /> damages claimed include damages for false imprisonment or for cases of intentional trespass to the person, more commonly known as assault and battery cases.  Such cases are not intended to come within the scope of the Bill for the policy reasons I have just mentioned.  But because personal injuries may arise in such cases it is necessary to have a specific provision excluding such cases from the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The only other provision I want to comment on at this stage is subsection (3) of section 4.  That is a saving provision for cases where notice of trial has been served before the date on which the Act is passed.  When a notice of trial is served it is necessary for the party setting it down to indicate if trial by jury is required.  The Government considered that where this had been done in a personal injuries case before the Act was passed the case should be heard with a jury.  Given the existing delays in the High Court in hearing cases which have been set down for trial, the effect of this saving provision is that juries will continue to operate in personal injuries cases for a period of between 12 to 24 months after the Act is passed.  Sections 2 and 3 are purely consequential.</P>
    <P>It has been claimed that a much more radical approach is needed to the settlement of claims for personal injuries.  At present our system, which exists in the area of tort law, is based on proof of fault by somebody &mdash; if no fault is proved compensation for the injury cannot normally be claimed.  It has been urged that we should follow the example of some other countries and work towards the creation of a no-fault system of compensation. I recognise the force of that argument.  For now, I will say only that any such development would be a very long term one which would require long and careful consideration.  Very difficult constitutional and other problems could arise.  We have not entered into that area with the measures proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's proposal is that the right of a citizen to pursue an action in the High Court to recover <Col N="519" /> damages for personal injury shall not in future be accompanied by the right to a trial by jury which at present is provided under Irish law.  The Government are seeking to abolish juries in such civil cases so that in future all claims, no matter how large or serious for the injured citizen, which are pressed to a court decision will be decided by a judge sitting alone without the assistance of a jury.</P>
      <P>The Government set out on this course initially by stating on 7 February 1986 that their aim was &ldquo;to make litigation in this area easier and cheaper&rdquo; and to bring &ldquo;more predictability into awards for personal injuries&rdquo;.  That was in the press statement of 7 February 1986 issued through the Government Information Service by the then Minister Deputy Noonan.  It outlined the general purpose of the Bill which is along the lines stated by the Minister here tonight.  It concluded by saying that the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism who had responsibility for supervising the operation of the insurance industry would be concerned to ensure that savings accruing to the industry from the new arrangements would be passed on to the insuring public.  At that stage the Minister had in mind that savings would accrue and that those savings would be passed on to the insuring public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The media coverage at the time made it clear that this was the Government's understanding and intention at the time. On 25 May 1986 the Taoiseach said, that when the Government took away the right of citizens to a jury trial in personal injury and accident cases, they would expect cheaper insurance premiums in return.  There is no doubt that the Government's intention originally, and even as late as last week, was that this measure of itself would lead to savings in this area which could be passed on to the motorist in particular and to employers in relation to employers' liability.  In the middle of all that the insurance industry stated quite clearly that this measure will not result in a fall in premium costs, although they claim that it could contribute to greater stability in insurance costs <Col N="520" /> in the future.  That is a very vague statement for such a major measure as is proposed at present.  Many factors can contribute to stability.  The drop in the incidence of stolen and rammed cars which the Minister has referred to in recent times should mean a drop in insurance costs and premiums in the future because, obviously, the spate of expense we all went through at that stage was related to the number of accidents and the number of claims from the Motor Insurers' Bureau.</P>
    <P>In any event, the insurance industry are adamant that the abolition of the jury system will not result in an immediate drop in premiums although it may in time contribute in some way.  This was accentuated in a &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme when the spokesman for the industry, when pressed about the question of premiums coming down, said the hope was that they would be contained and that following the abolition of the jury system other things would follow, such as the streamlining of the whole system, the reduction in the severity and the number of accidents, the surveillance by the Garda authorities of the alcohol problems and the dangerous driving problems, the absence of over-representation by the legal profession, particularly barristers, in court hearings.</P>
    <P>The industry are not claiming that the abolition of the jury system will of itself have an effect in reducing premium costs and we should be honest about that. Tonight the Minister has been at pains to point out that this measure on its own will not result in a fall in premiums which is a change from what the Taoiseach said only last week and from what the Minister's predecessor said in introducing this measure.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil have considered this matter at length and have taken into account the views expressed by the Government, the employers' organisations and the representatives of insurance companies who all favour the abolition of juries and, on the other hand, the views expressed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Bar Council and the individual trade unions who oppose <Col N="521" /> the measure.  We have come to the conclusion that the case for the abolition of juries has not been established.  This is borne out by the findings of three independent commissions.  In addition, the direction of what the Government are saying has been changed to something more vague and general than what has been said publicly up to this time.  They speak about stability and predictability in the future, but gone is the thing the motorist is interested in, the reduction in premium costs as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>We all recognise the burden that has been placed on the motorist and on the employer in relation to employers' liability insurance.  The question is: is this measure the measure that it was supposed to be in the first instance and will it have those effects?  I hardly have to ask that question because the Minister has answered it.  He said clearly that it will not result in a reduction at this time and he is now talking more or less along the lines of the industry and saying that sometime in the future there will be more stability.  The conclusions we came to have been borne out by the findings of three independent commissions the latest of which was chaired by Mr. Niall McLiam and referred to by the Minister. It reported in December 1982.  Each of these commissions concluded that the citizen should retain the right to a jury trial in the more serious cases.  But what we are proposing here is the abolition of juries in all cases as defined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>However, we do not accept the <i>status quo.</i> While we would prefer to see the jury system retained in the interests of the ordinary citizen, we are proposing the following steps which it has been shown will definitely reduce insurance costs.  The industry are clear that, if we want a reduction in costs, we need to do other things mentioned by the industry.  The first of these is the reform of the jury system by allowing the judge to give guidelines to a jury on the level of general damages which may be appropriate for a particular injury, for example, the loss of an eye or a leg.  The Supreme Court have already placed an upper limit of £150,000 on general damages.  It is important here to <Col N="522" /> remember the kinds of people we are talking about in this instance when talking about the upper limit.  We are talking about people who have been very seriously injured &mdash; paraplegics and quadri-plegics and people with massive brain damage whose future life may be totally destroyed.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court have already put an upper limit of £150,000 on general damages in this respect.  The Minister mentioned this matter but did not elaborate on it.  He gave seven options but said that after careful consideration the Government decided that the best arrangement was to replace civil juries by a single judge sitting alone to decide the issues of liability and damages in personal injury cases.  The Minister did not tell us why he did not go for the first option put forward, which was the option proposed by the commission of inquiry which did a very extensive and interesting study into this whole area.</P>
    <P>Secondly the jury must continue, in our view, to decide the degree of negligence or liability.  This, in effect, is the legal determination of the guilt or fault of an individual.  In this respect the jury have a particular relevance, especially in very serious cases.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, special damages are not a problem for a jury, since both judge and counsel can already give guidelines and advice to the jury, for example, in relation to medical costs.  That appears to work to most people's satisfaction.  Why not then allow a similar freedom to the judge in relation to general damages?</P>
    <P>The cost of awards and legal costs in civil actions could be reduced by some or all of the following measures: first, to drop the requirement for two senior counsel.  The Bar Council say that two senior counsel should be required only in complex or difficult cases.  Nobody is obliged to have two seniors and one junior.  The principal reason for having two is apparently the listing system.  The unpredictability of this system means that barristers are obliged to operate what is effectively a limited partnership arrangement to cover the vagaries of the system. <Col N="523" /> It is noteworthy that the insurance companies use two senior counsel in each case to protect their interests.</P>
    <P>Here we have a system which has grown up over the years and which now is causing very considerable public concern, if not even public scandal.  It is time somebody addressed this problem but it is not quite as simplistic as we are often given to understand.  There are complexities. There is the question of providing for people who do not have the money to challenge and pursue a case in court and the fact that these counsel may pursue a case on a no fault, no fee basis is tied in with the arrangement in relation to the two senior counsel.  With the way in which the listing system operates, because of the uncertainty and difficulty of getting back into the court, counsel may have to stay around the court for a number of days on a particular case. Obviously, they can deal with the situation more efficiently.</P>
    <P>This probably started out as a response to a system which was not catering adequately for requirements.  Surely we have come to the stage when the system can be overhauled to ensure that this is not necessary.  The Bar Council have indicated that on simpler cases there should not be need for two senior counsel. This is something that should be looked at.  The Minister made no reference to it tonight although it should be urgently examined and could, according to all the reports, quite clearly contribute significantly to a reduction in costs.  Of course, it will also create a cost at court level in providing more judges.  That is probably one of the main requirements.</P>
    <P>Secondly, with regard to changing the listing system, the motor insurers regard this system as a major cause of their problems.  They say if the juries go, so does the list.  This is not the case.  Lists will still apply if a judge replaces a jury. The solution for the listing system is to provide more High Court Judges.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal of reference to the system in England and the way in which it operates.  In England <Col N="524" /> many more judges were provided.  Therefore, they could forecast accurately when a case would be taken.  The Minister has referred to the bottleneck in pointing out, for a different reason, that in 1965 there were only perhaps four or six judges available.  The number now is 16. Obviously, there was a bottleneck and one of the great concerns of the House in the past few years has been to increase the number of judges so that cases could be heard.  The whole organisation and arrangement contributes to significant savings in time and cost.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, to raise the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court from its present limit of £15,000 to a new ceiling of £25,000 to £30,000 would limit the possibility of a jury trial to claims above this figure, again retaining the jury trial for the more serious claims.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, to reduce medical costs &mdash; these can account for the major part of an award.  For example, in a High Court case an award of £181,000 was made which included £119,000, or almost two-thirds, for past and future hospital expenses.  I know of a case of a young man who had a very tragic accident.  While crossing the road, he was knocked down and lost a leg.  His case eventually came up, but he had been very worried in case there would not be a jury.  I am getting correspondence from people who have the same concern.  I know the Minister has said that any of the cases listed at the moment will still be covered but that is the kind of worry affecting the victims of car and other accidents.</P>
    <P>When it came to determining the cost in this young man's case a of providing a replacement leg over the future years &mdash; this was a very young and fit man &mdash; the insurance company wanted to give him something of the order of £13,000.  The Rehabilitation Institute assessed it at £50,000 or £60,000, to be realistic about what he would be facing in the future. He was very worried in case the insurance company's offer proved inadequate.  In the event, the case started in court before a jury but after the first session the insurance company withdrew and gave him a halfway allowance for the replacement <Col N="525" /> leg, of the order of £27,000 or £30,000. That probably is not adequate for what the man must face in the future.  His accident happened two years ago and he is already on his fourth replacement leg, each of which cost over £1,000.</P>
    <P>These matters do not work out quite so simply as one might think.  The insurance company were not going to go above their very meagre offer, despite the advice of the medical people, which is probably very realistic and honest in relation to the actual cost in the future.</P>
    <P>However, because the jury were there the insurance company assessed the situation. It looked as if the jury might go with them.  They made an offer on that and on other things in the interval for the lunch break and the case was settled. Obviously it will not be enough to meet his requirements for the future.</P>
    <P>As regards serious medical cases we are not talking about leaving people in clover.  The medical costs can be very high.  In this way the State levies some £4 million per annum on medical costs on motor insurance which does not apply to other accidents.  The McLiam report suggested that the State demand for payment for services associated with car accidents should be restricted to the period of one year from the date of the accident.  After that one should go back to the normal State provision of medical care without having it deducted from the allocation which was received.  Nothing has been done about that.  At present it has been stopped following a Supreme Court challenge.  New legislation will bring the system back into operation shortly.</P>
    <P>The fifth point is the control of specialists' costs.  Specialists can claim £320 a day for standing by in case they are called. More written reports should be accepted in advance.  These costs apply whether appearing before a judge alone or a judge and jury.  I have heard it said that these specialists costs would be much simpler if there were not a jury.  I do not see how that can be because the case will have to be proved before a judge if not a judge and jury.  There may be a means of simplifying the procedures.  There have been <Col N="526" /> recommendations that they could be simplified but this could be done in any event &mdash; whether there is a judge alone or a judge and jury.</P>
    <P>The sixth point is the elimination of the cost of uninsured drivers.  This is astronomical. It is estimated by the Motor Insurance Bureau that the cost of outstanding claims in 1986 would be £48 million.  Elsewhere I saw the figure of £25 million as the amount to be paid out in the course of 1986.  The McLiam report gives various figures.  They increased very much over the period 1981-84 which relates to the very high incidence of car robberies, stolen cars, car rammings and so on.  This is one of the largest potential areas for saving and it must be tackled immediately.  These are measures which will give a response.  We will be able to reduce the premium because the cost will be cut down.  It is estimated that at least £70 of the average motorist's insurance is used to meet claims against uninsured drivers.  I am sure most drivers would welcome a reduction of £70 or even £50 in the cost of their motor insurance.  That area can and should be tackled.  It could have a direct bearing on the costs which we are all very anxious to see reduced.</P>
    <P>The seventh point is to cut accidents and enforce the law.  The greatest potential for savings is in reducing accidents on the roads and in the workplace.  Better driving, more effective law enforcement and more attention to safety at work would cut insurance costs.  It is extraordinary that companies which pay many hundreds of thousands of pounds in employers' liability insurance make little effort to bring the statutory safety measures onto the factory floor.  I have looked into a number of these cases.  The companies who complain about paying out that sort of money will not adopt the safety procedures which have been spelled out very clearly not alone by this House but by inquiries and studies, the most recent being the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work report, 1983.  We have difficulty in getting these measures adopted by people and in tackling the basic causes of accidents both on the motor side and on the shop floor in industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="527" /> I spoke to older people who say that, down through the years, the employee was always regarded as the one who was at fault and who was accident prone.  This report throws that overboard.  It analyses and examines this question in great detail.  It gives statistics and facts which show that is a lot of rubbish and is not true.  Yet we go on reading about it and listening to it.  Old people will think there is nothing new in that, that it has been the same story year after year.  Why do we go on doing things this way?  When we know what must be done why not do it, so that we will cut down the rate of accidents?</P>
    <P>The incidence of road deaths per head of population in the Republic, as stated in the McLiam report in December 1982, was twice that recorded in Britain.  They also found that it was reducing.  They urged more intensive law enforcement particularly in regard to driving with excess amounts of alcohol and various other areas of law enforcement. Obviously if we reduce the incidence of accidents we will have substantial savings</P>
    <P>The eight point refers to periodic payments and risk reviews.  The purpose of these is to relate the compensation more closely to the real needs.  In England at present there is a basic payment against the risk of getting arthritis later in life. The payment in that respect is minimal. This is adjusted upwards after some years if the arthritis actually occurs.  There is less reliance on guesswork and there is a follow on.  A combination of advance lump sums followed by periodic payments may be more equitable to all concerned. That should be looked at.</P>
    <P>The eighth point refers to periodic payto reviewing the social welfare code as it applies to compensation.  It is claimed that it is possible to get 180 per cent of salary through a combination of social welfare payments and compensation.  It states that this matter should be considered in depth to ensure that the outcome is fair, equitable and reasonable.</P>
    <P>I have just outlined some of the measures which will directly influence the cost <Col N="528" /> of premiums for motorists and employers. If dealt with, they can reduce the cost of insurance.  The measure the Minister is proposing &mdash; the abolition of juries &mdash; on his own admission and on the admission of the industry will not reduce the cost of premiums.  At best it will be a factor which could, in the view of some people, contribute towards future stability; but even the industry has pointed out that the other measures outlined should be adopted urgently.</P>
    <P>When we look at the role of the jury we find that in themselves they cost very little.  All the people who sit on juries get is their lunch.  They are not very expensive. The Minister has told us that there is considerable inconvenience, but there is inconvenience in any democratic process such as this.  The Minister made the point that the man in the street does not want to be bothered with juries.  I do not find it that way; and, when I questioned some local people about jury service, they told me they were very happy to have participated in that service.  I accept that some people, because of their work and so on may not wish to act on a jury. The Minister said that others claim exemptions to which they are entitled, but they are entitled to those exemptions for very good reasons.  When the Minister is working out his figures he should not take them into account as part of the overall percentage.  The Minister feels that it is an inconvenience to be calling people during the year for civil jury trials in the High Court.  He has a point in that it means inviting those people to come along, meeting them and giving them a lunch, but is democracy worth the crust? I am sure the House is inconvenienced by our discussing business which must be regarded as very important but is left for debate late at night.</P>
    <P>Suggesting that people who are asked to serve on juries in civil actions are being inconvenienced is going a little too far in relation to the participation by people in any of our democratic processes.  Juries cost very little, but they set the standards for the treatment of citizens who have been injured.  That is their key, central role.  They come, they give their view and <Col N="529" /> they go.  They have no vested interest other than their understanding and compassion. Any error on their part is likely to be on the side of the ordinary citizen. If one counts the number of times a jury erred one will find that it was more often on the side of the ordinary citizen who has been injured, and, possibly, maimed for life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing wrong with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  What is wrong with that?  How hard-faced have we become if we are not prepared to suffer the inconvenience of calling people up and arranging lunches and so on for them so that they can set the standards which we live by?  Are juries to be condemned because of their understanding and fairness?  We must remember that they are the paymasters.  It is those people who pay motor insurance premiums, tax and PRSI.  If we could get them closer into the system it would be interesting to get their views.  It is unfortunate that it is hard to bring them into the front line of the system as it operates.  Clearly, they are not part of the professional or financial establishments.  That is a strong argument in their favour.  Should a jury of 12 men and women not be the arbiters of the will and standards of the people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not mind what is done in England. The authorities there are welcome to do what they like.  The reality is that the jury system was abolished in England during the last war.  To be honest, England is very much an establishment country and this system was a great inconvenience to them.  It was left aside and fell into disuse. I was interested to hear the Minister's comment on this tonight, because he was more honest than either his predecessor or the Taoiseach have been in relation to this area.  He indicated that the fact that awards in England are lower must be seen in the light of many circumstances and in the light of the type of compassion people have for those who are handicapped or injured as a result of accidents. I understand that in England they are saying that perhaps they have not been <Col N="530" /> treating people very well; but how did they get into that predicament?  They did not get into it by having juries of ordinary decent English men and women who would indicate the standards which should apply.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a quotation by Justice Douglas of the American Supreme Court in regard to juries.  He said:</P>
    <P>A jury reflects the attitudes and mores of the community from which it is drawn.  It lives only for the day and does justice according to its limits.  The group of 12, who are drawn to hear a case, makes the decision and melts away.  It is not present the next day to be criticised.  It is the one governmental agency that has no ambition.</P>
    <P>Is it not wonderful to think that we can have 12 people give a verdict and set a standard?  Those people do not have any connections?  Certainly those people are not open to backhanders or any involvement. Justice Douglas went on:</P>
    <P>It is as human as the people who make it up.  It is sometimes the victim of passion.  But it also takes the sharp edges off a law and uses conscience to ameliorate a hardship.  Since it is of and from the community, it gives the law an acceptance which verdicts of judges could not do.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of truth in what Justice Douglas had to say.  We should listen to such views before we throw away an institution which sets a standard for us in this area.</P>
    <P>While the Minister made much play on the fact that in the Circuit Court cases are settled in a fairly streamlined way and without great difficulty, I could give him cases where one judge was giving £500 and another £15,000.  There is no point in going into that as there are variations between judges.  We have a study going on on the other side in relation to sentencing policy to try to find some means of getting greater uniformity in sentencing because judges vary considerably in their sentencing approach.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="531" /> The jury system is a very valuable institution. Although juries do not sit in the Circuit Court, I am suggesting that those figures should be raised.  We must remember that the standards set &mdash; this is a point which is made on the other side of the argument in favour of abolishing juries &mdash; by the jury affect the whole system.  If we get rid of that we could presumably drop the standard and that would result in the lowering of awards generally.</P>
    <P>In criminal cases the State relies on juries.  There is a specific constitutional guarantee of a right to a jury trial in serious crime.  I was glad to hear the Minister say tonight that he had no intention of doing away with that right.  He even went so far as to say he does not intend to do anything with it.  I was afraid to mention it because if it was not in the Constitution, we might find somebody trying to get rid of that because of its inconvenience.  The Minister has made his position clear on that.</P>
    <P>Are the victims of serious accidents and negligence to be treated less seriously than persons accused of crime?  The civil jury trial is an old and long established institution.  In the United States of America there is a constitutional right to a jury trial in civil cases.  Reports on the civil jury trials in Scotland in 1959 and in Northern Ireland in 1970 came down in favour of retaining jury trials in civil actions.  I spoke to a man recently about employers' liability.  Employers on our side of the Border were complaining that in Northern Ireland the cost was much lower.  This man made the point that we should do away with juries.  They still have juries in the North of Ireland and they have them on our side of the Border, and yet the cost is much lower in the North.  Therefore, it is not the jury system which is affecting it.  That is the point which seems to have been generally admitted and agreed at this stage.  Even as recently as last week it did not seem to be.  It is an interesting comparison that in the North of Ireland they decided not to do away with the jury system.  Indeed, if they had I am sure the Minister would <Col N="532" /> have been telling us that was a reason for doing it.</P>
    <P>The Pearson Commission in 1978 did a very extensive and exhaustive study of the area and looked at the situation all around the world.  Although not willing to revive the jury action in England where it lapsed during the World War and has not been used since 1965, the commission refused to recommend its abolition in Northern Ireland where it still survives. Here, in Ireland the question has been examined exhaustively by three separate independent commissions to which the Minister referred earlier tonight.  These included representations from the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>Although each report put forward measures to reduce the cost of insurance, none of them favoured the abolition of juries.  The most recent of these reports was in 1982 entitled the report of inquiry into the cost and methods of providing motor insurance.  In the light of their findings, they made numerous recommendations which they were confident would collectively lead to a substantial reduction in the cost of motor insurance. The report is dated 30 December 1982 so it was available to the Minister from day one in 1983.  It is a very interesting and extensive report which sets out measures which will lead directly to a reduction in the cost of insurance and premiums.  It did not favour the abolition of juries. The commission detailed the numerous measures which could be taken to cut insurance costs substantially including the review of legal liability and the system of assessing liability and damages or compensation. Although, they recommended changes in the operation of the listing system for civil actions, here we are in 1986 and nothing has been done.  The one thing they found that would not contribute to a reduction in costs and which should not be done was the abolition of juries.  That is the one which comes forward to us.  I find this very strange and illogical.  They also recommended the simplification of procedures and said that the relevant laws were adequate but enforcement was lacking.</P>
    <P>Although they recommended these <Col N="533" /> changes and many more, nevertheless, they concluded that the jury system should be retained and said:</P>
    <P>There should be no change in the system of jury trial other than that in a High Court hearing for damages for injuries.  The trial judge should be permitted to inform the jury as to what he estimates to be the going rate of general damages for the sort of injuries proved in the circumstances of the particular case.</P>
    <P>As the system operates at present, neither counsel nor the trial judge may suggest any figures to the jury for general damages whether past or future.  It is in the area of general damages that variations in awards are more likely to occur. By and large special damages, for example, medical and hospital fees and loss of earnings are a matter of proof and mathematics.  Figures are suggested to the jury by counsel and the judge and actuarial evidence is given but, in the case of general damages, neither counsel nor the judge may give any assistance to the jury.</P>
    <P>The committee of enquiry recommended that this rule should be changed to allow the judge, but not the counsel, at his discretion to inform the jury as to what he estimates to be the going rate of general damages for the sort of injuries proved in the particular case bearing in mind other jury awards and especially awards as assessed by the Supreme Court while, at the same time, making it clear to the jury that they are at liberty to depart from this normal range in the particular case if they think fit.  This seems to be an eminently practical proposal and one which would meet any reasonable objection to jury trials.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Inquiry, having considered submissions from the Federation of Insurers in Ireland and the Irish Insurance Association, concluded that whatever the merits or demerits of trials by jury, &ldquo;It is so essential a part of our system of justice that we do not consider that it should be called into question in relation to the legal determination of guilt.  In the context of motor insurance <Col N="534" /> claims, this is the determination of comparative negligence or liability of those involved in accidents.  The object must be to secure a level of award which is just, fair, and practicable&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would have a higher regard for the determination of what is fair and just and practicable by a jury or ordinary citizens than by a judge sitting alone.  The MacLiam Inquiry was a particularly interesting one, covering all the areas we are talking about.  It pointed to many of the remedies that should be taken.  It indicated the position of the Motor Insurers Bureau and went through the increasing demands on the bureau.  In 1978, the cost of the bureau was £2.1 million; in 1979, it was £2.6 million; in 1980, £5.4 million; and in 1981, £8.9 million.  It has escalated rapidly since then.</P>
    <P>We hope that the costs of those claims will be brought down if attention is given by the Garda and if they are supported in dealing with the theft and driving of uninsured cars.  As recently as 1979 the cost to the bureau was £2.6 million and this year it is £25 million, without estimating outstanding claims.  The increase has been dramatic and car thefts, the smashing of the cars and claims in respect of uninsured driving have driven the cost up steeply.  That could taper off again with the decline in car thefts.</P>
    <P>The driving of uninsured cars is still at a high level.  The MacLiam Inquiry pointed to the steps that should be taken and dealt with special and general damages, repair costs, etc.  One must bear in mind that repairs had a 23 per cent VAT rate which was reduced to 5 per cent and was increased this year to 10 per cent. That should bring about a reduction in costs to the insurers.  That could be a large contributory factor in insurers' costs.</P>
    <P>The MacLiam Inquiry spelled out the legal costs and the difference between Ireland and Britain in this respect and the need to deal with the court listing system and procedures generally.  The inquiry pointed to the kind of savings that could be made and dealt with uninsured driving, the number of such offences during <Col N="535" /> the years and the rate at which it was increasing.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, therefore, the cost of awards would not be affected greatly by the abolition of the jury system.  The MacLiam report showed that only 20 per cent of all accident claims went to solicitors and of these 20 per cent were listed for court hearings.  Only 4 per cent of all claims go to the courts and only 0.2 per cent of these are heard by juries because of the tendency of insurance companies to settle on the steps.  The number of cases actually heard by juries is extremely small.</P>
    <P>These figures are very important because one of the arguments made by the Minister and others is that if you do away with juries you will speed up the court process.  The Minister said that a jury would take a third longer than a judge to determine a case&mdash;one and a half days instead of one day.  A jury would take longer than a judge, but if so few cases are actually ending before juries what possible influence can that have on actual cost?  The effect must be infinitesmal. Even if the whole 4 per cent of claims went before juries it would have very little effect on the cost.  How, therefore, could the 0.2 per cent cases heard by juries have any influence on the cost of anything?  It could not.  It is no wonder the insurance industry say that the abolition of juries would not result in savings. Therefore, the argument in favour of abolition of juries is not tenable and it is not particularly helpful because it would tend to confuse people, allow people to think that there may be some benefit which they would receive but which obviously they will not.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that even the small proportion of claims determined by a judge and jury contributes to the standard of settlements for injuries.  The argument is that, even though cases dealt with by judges and juries is small, that number contributes to the standard of settlements for injuries.  This brings me back to my original question of who will set the standards for the victims?  How do we want <Col N="536" /> to live our lives and what kind of standards do we want?</P>
    <P>I accept the argument that even the small number of cases that come before juries have an influence in setting the standard; but why should not the ordinary citizen, with guidance from the judiciary, be the arbiter of standards for his fellow-citizens who fall victim to accidents and who may be maimed for life? The alternative is for members of the legal profession to control totally both the procedure and the level of compensation and consequently, the standards to be observed by employers and drivers.  If we do away with juries we will leave the legal profession totally to control the procedure and level of compensation and the setting of the standards which will have to be observed by all.  The availability of a jury trial serves the useful social function of discouraging and even preventing litigation from becoming the domain of an exclusive professional group of lawyers, judges and advocates. It is based on the belief that a decision by one man or woman alone is potentially inferior to a collective decision of ordinary citizens.  That is the basis on which the jury system is founded and it is an important one.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not pursued the argument tonight but it is what has been made prior to this in favour of the abolition of the jury system, namely, that premiums could be reduced.  That argument is not tenable and even at this stage it is not being pursued very actively.  The basic question still being pursued is that of the standards that are set in the area generally.  There has been much talk about variations, consistency and predictability. These are nice phrases for deflecting attention from the basic element, namely, the standards we apply as a community in respect of people who are maimed or seriously injured.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement was comprehensive. He mentioned that the Supreme Court has set a limit in recent times and that that is a factor to be considered. He said &ldquo;the proven unpredictability of jury awards has had a <Col N="537" /> destabilising effect on the settlement process&rdquo;. I do not think that is a tenable argument.  They may set a standard possibly higher than some judges would set, but unpredictability can apply to judges as well.  The Minister hopes to cover that point by the Supreme Court setting the standard and ensuring that the guidelines and parameters are correctly laid out and are known.  If that is to be the case, why not leave the parameters to a jury?  I trust the House is aware that jury awards have moderated greatly in the past year or 18 months.  In a way it reflects their attitude to inflation and other factors.  The Minister referred to &ldquo;monetary punch drunkenness&rdquo;, but he was quick to say he was citing someone else's quotation in case he might be taken as saying that himself. It is a clever use of a quotation while avoiding responsibility for it in the long run.</P>

      <P>I think the Government have shared that monetary punch drunkenness in the past few years and I do not say that to deride the Government. The whole country went through that period with the increase in inflation. Probably much of that was due to the massive oil problems we had to face earlier, quite apart from anything else. Juries had to deal with that situation and it was very difficult, but the indications are that it has stabilised considerably in the interim.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned a figure of £15,000 in relation to the Circuit Court. That was the 1982 figure and I have suggested it should be increased.  That would be helpful and beneficial.  I appreciate very much that the Minister has put the situation in England very much in perspective. He covered that matter very well and he indicated clearly and honestly the situation in relation to that country. It is very heart-warming to find such a frank and forthright admission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1983 report on safety, health and welfare at work was a very valuable one. I refer it to the House because many of <Col N="538" /> the items in it are relevant to this debate. The report showed that the number of fatal and non-fatal accidents reported to the Department of Labour was 2,800 in 1979 and that increased to 4,670 in 1982. There is a constantly increasing spiral of fatal and non-fatal reported accidents in that area but of course, generally the number of accidents is much more than that.</P>
    <P>In the report there is an interesting diagram showing the number of claims for occupational injuries in respect of various parts of the body affected.  For instance, injuries to the hand or to fingers amounted to almost 31 per cent of all injuries, injuries to the eye were 5.4 per cent, to the foot or toe 8.9 per cent while injuries on the back and shoulders amounted to 17 per cent.  People suggest that perhaps complaints about back pain are concocted by employees.  I am sure that may be true in some cases, but for many other people it is real problem. Equally it is quite obvious that no man or woman wants to lose a hand or a finger in an accident at work.  The argument that employees are prone to such accidents has been debunked in this study. Accidents should and could be avoided if the measures suggested here were taken by industry.  I suggest that the Minister ask his colleague to pursue this actively.</P>
    <P>Various people have approached us about this measure.  The Federated Union of Employers are very interested. In their annual report they say their campaign was successful to the extent that the Government announced that the jury system would be abolished.  They are very anxious to see the jury system abolished but have they analysed the effect its abolition is likely to have?  If they did, they would find many of the other measures will have far more serious effects than the jury system.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions were also very concerned about the measure.  They pointed out in July 1983 that the Government Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work chaired by Justice Donal Barrington, also recommended that employers' liability insurance be immediately made compulsory on a <Col N="539" /> selective basis.  This would have the effect of spreading the cost.  They went on to say that Congress were opposed to the further restriction of the rights of citizens to participate in the judicial system.  They said Congress were surprised at the Government's decision to introduce this Bill without first holding a major inquiry and that in deciding to proceed in this way, the Government were ignoring the recommendation of the Commission of Inquiry of Safety, Health and Welfare at Work which reported in July 1983.</P>
    <P>They went on to say that Congress were also concerned that this decision was taken by the Government without a review of employers' liability insurance. They said that the Executive Council of Congress were requesting the Minister for Justice not to proceed with the Courts Bill, 1986, and the Executive Council also requested that employers' liability insurance be made compulsory and that a major inquiry be undertaken into current and alternative arrangements for compensation in cases of personal injury.</P>
    <P>The Congress of Trade Unions representing workers and employees are very concerned about this measure to the extent that they have written to the Minister asking him to withdraw it and to consider some alternative measures. At the same time, they put out a press release in which they said that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions were demanding that employers' liability insurance be made compulsory.  They went on to say that a Government committee of inquiry into the insurance industry recommended, as far back as 1976, that employers' liability insurance be made compulsory.  They also said that Congress had written to the Minister for Justice requesting him not to proceed with the Courts Bill, 1986, which provides for the abolition of juries in personal injuries cases in the High Court.  The press release went on to say that the Executive Council of Congress were totally opposed to this change in particular to further restrict the right of citizens to participate in the judicial system.  In seeking the withdrawal of the Courts Bill, 1986, Congress <Col N="540" /> had asked the Minister to hold a major inquiry into current and alternative arrangements for compensation in cases of personal injury and they appealed to the Minister to desist from this approach.</P>
    <P>I have examples of individual cases but I will not delay the House by reading them into the record.  It is very hard to get copies of these documents but if one keeps digging one will get information. When we talk about legal costs and legal outlay, we are talking about many different things such as paid fee for abstract of Garda report, £7; stamp duty on plenary summons, £14.15; stamp statement of claim, £256; medical report, £16.80; second medical report, £17; Law Society fee for a room, £8; stamping, £24; more medical reports, fee for actuarial report, £104; fees for rooms, meetings and so on, paid availability fee to doctor for court attendance £31; two senior counsel £525 each.  Then the State took 23 per cent VAT &mdash; it is now 25 per cent &mdash; and that has to be included in the costs.  Then there were solicitors' fees, £4,400 and the VAT on £4,500 came to £1,035 &mdash; there was a substantial VAT element in this too &mdash; and the junior counsel got £350. All these costs were involved in a claim for £55,000.  These figures give some idea of what is happening.</P>
    <P>Various surveys have been carried out in this area.  Mr. Brian McMahon produced a very useful document on 16 September 1985 which deals with many of the questions relating to the role and function of juries, the comparison between juries and judges and the type of awards granted.  Each point he raised could be discussed and debated here.  The Minister referred to some points but Mr. McMahon's document covers this subject very extensively.  He pointed out that the problems in the insurance industry were related to management problems.  This applied to the PMPA and the ICI.  It is very difficult to listen to lectures from some of these people who have been involved in these massive management blunders complaining about the ordinary citizen's claim &mdash; he might only get his lunch &mdash; when he comes to do jury work. He pointed out that the PMPA reduced <Col N="541" /> their losses from £27 million to £13.5 million in 1983 without any change in the jury system and this figure will be halved in 1985, still without abolishing the jury system.</P>
    <P>When these insurance firms ran into difficulties they blamed the jury system for their problems.  We all know that ICI's biggest problem arose from the reinsurance they took on through London.  If they had not got involved in that extremely high risk area, which other firms were running away from, they would not have had such serious problems. He goes into that kind of thing and points out the reality.</P>
    <P>I will not delay the House because probably I have spoken for long enough on it, but when you come to such a fundamental change it is very difficult just to walk into the House and say a few words on it because then people ask why you did not say something about this, why you did not analyse it or tease it out.  We have a function and a responsibility in Opposition to tease out these things and see what is really going on, and when you do so what you find is amazing.</P>
    <P>He points out that insurance costs in the non-life area have been affected significantly by the increasing crime rate which is especially noticeable in the case of car thefts, burglaries and the like. Again we are back to the fact that if we can deal with the crime situation we can deal with many of the problems that arise in this area.</P>
    <P>The debate has taken place in public about much of this question.  Michael Houlihan in <i>Business and Finance</i> of June 1985 said:</P>
    <P>In my view insurers concentrate their energies too much in complaining about the juries, the effect they have on high awards and also on the overburdening of cases by the necessity to employ three barristers in each case. Changes in these procedures will not in my opinion in the least effect the savings for which the insurers are hoping.</P>
    <P>He goes into many of these questions and gives his point of view on them.  The <Col N="542" /> Minister may be interested to know that some states in Australia abolished jury awards and expectation there was supposed to be that the permiums would come down subsequently.  I notice that the Minister has been careful not to get himself into that position here tonight. Anyway, the evidence afterwards was that there was no reduction in premiums or in the level of awards, not was there any change in the consistency of the awards.  This is interesting because one looks around for a similar case and some experience in that respect.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me make a brief mention of the Fifth report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses, <i>The Insurance Problems of Small Businesses.</i> Small businesses are having considerable difficulty in this area.  I congratulate the chairman, Deputy Ivan Yates, the vicechairman, Senator Michael Lynch, and the members of that committee for the work they did in this area and the very excellent report they have produced. They go into the whole question of industry, safety in industry and the measures which could be taken to reduce accidents in industry.  They suggest things like incentive schemes for good safety and claims records, practical things that matter to small businesses and the people in them and encourage people to improve their leval of safety and security and the training of their workers.  Under the heading &ldquo;Speculative Claims&rdquo; on page 57 of the report they state that companies should now show much more greater firmness in resisting the more speculative type of claim.  On page 58 they say, &ldquo;We recommend that the insurance companies must play a greater role in developing positive attitudes to risk management on a widespread basis&rdquo;. They go on to the area of measures to reduce insurance cost.  They state, and I quote from page 62:</P>
    <P>. . . We recommend:</P>
    <P>(i)  the termination of the 1% levy on the turnover of the insurance companies, at a cost to the Exchequer of £6m. per annum;</P>
    <P>(ii)  the replacement of the present <Col N="543" /> system of the broker's commission as a fixed percentage of the premium by a scale of standard charges subject to price control;</P>
    <P>I am sure that the broker's commission will have a bigger effect than the abolition of juries will have in terms of the premium cost.  I continue to quote:</P>
    <P>(iii)  a far more active role by the Department of Industry and Commerce in controlling premium rates of the companies.</P>
    <P>On the legal system they say that the General Council of the Bar of Ireland should terminate the &ldquo;Three Counsel rule&rdquo; immediately and the insurance companies should refuse to retain more than two lawyers in each case.  They see quite clearly that the option is there with the insurance companies if they want to take it.  They can refuse to maintain more than two lawyers on each case.  They could set the standard.  On page 63 of the report the committee state:</P>
    <P>We recommended that the Superior Courts Rules Committee fix the final date for an agreed settlement at the fifteenth day before the scheduled hearing.</P>
    <P>In the event of failure to meet the deadline the full hearing should proceed.</P>
    <P>That is an interesting suggestion that might help to get over some of the problems that the Minister sees facing him.  I continue to quote:</P>
    <P Just="Center">Pre-Trial Procedures</P>
    <P>Following the abolition of the jury system in personal injury cases we recommend that the Superior Courts Rules Committee avail of the opportunities to expedite procedures and achieve further cost saving through pre-trial directions . . .</P>
    <P>They give the kinds of directions that they see applying.  They go on to say that there is a need for additional High Court judges, an increase in the number from 15 to 17, an increase of two.  They feel <Col N="544" /> that the District and Circuit Court limits should be raised, from £15,000 to £30,000 in the case of the Circuit Court.  They were thinking along lines similar to what I am suggesting.  The committee have made practical, usable and workable suggestions and I congratulate them on the very excellent report they have presented which, if adopted and acted upon, would contribute to reductions in costs.</P>
    <P>I have said all I want to say about this now.  We come to the conclusion that in the measure which the Minister proposes the case has not been made for the abolition of juries.  It has not been established and will not result in the savings which have been mentioned.  We have considered this matter long and hard.  I have put some points, but this is a debate to which one could contribute a great deal more if time allowed.  I would like to let the next speaker in before the debate is adjourned tonight so that he will have the opportunity to start the debate the next day, since he has been here waiting this evening.</P>

      <P>He contributed in his usual very detailed, informative way. Obviously he put a great deal of research into this topic.  This measure was brought fairly suddenly into the Dáil and it is absolutely essential that it be debated fully.  Let me say in the two minutes I have that this is one of the times when I do not feel happy about being a member of a party having to vote under the party Whip because I am very much opposed to the removal of civil juries, and in my contribution to this on the next day I will show why.  The argument put forward for it has not been strong; it has been a very weak argument.  The Minister in his speech gave a historical appraisal as a background to his general review of the present operation of the jury system and <Col N="545" /> said that, in the context of a new debate on the issue in relation to insurance matters, the Government considered in principle a change in the system.  I think it has been in response to a very well orchestrated campaign by the insurance companies to have civil juries removed, and they have succeeded in a very short time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to divide my time with Deputy Kitt.  This matter was brought to my attention and I wish to thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise it on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to pass judgment on the negotiations which are still going on in some counties between the Department of the Environment and the relevant personnel involved, or to comment on the rights or wrongs of the level of compensation being offered.  I am here on behalf of constituents to request the Minister to extend the deadline for a decision from these personnel which has been set for next Friday as to whether they will accept the arrangements.  I do not wish to have an acrimonious or divisive debate as I know that heated negotiations have taken place and it is obviously a matter for the Department and the unions who represent the rate collectors to come to an amicable arrangement which will be acceptable to all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the last two years the personnel involved have accepted that there must be a new role for rate collectors because domestic rates and those on agricultural land have been abolished.  The fact that they have been asked to collect water rates, to add to their present responsibilities, is welcome.  However, while they will have an increased workload &mdash; although I admit that the workload has been reduced by successive Government policies in relation to financing local authorities&mdash;there should be an <i>ex gratia</i><Col N="546" /> payment for those who agree with the abolition of the old posts and who are taking on new ones.</P>
    <P>Some rate collectors may have 12 or 14 year's service and I understand that they will become revenue collectors with rates of pay on the next increment available on the scale.  That means that they will not go in at the top of the scale at which revenue collectors are paid.  Under the new arrangements, after five years as a revenue collector, he or she would then reach the top scale.  In view of the fact that rate collectors in the past discharged their responsibilities in an honourable way and proved to be men of integrity, recognition of their service should be a matter of paramount importance to ensure that the transition from the post rate collector to revenue collector should be as free from difficulty as possible.</P>
    <P>The workload of rate collectors in the last few years is perhaps an argument for not recognising their level of service but that is not a balanced view.  Perhaps the Minister would agree to employ the rate collectors on the same levels of pay as those applying to revenue collectors as in some cases their workload has trebled.  I admit that rate collectors whose present rate of pay is in excess of the highest grade which will be available to the new post of revenue collector will retain that rate of pay as revenue collectors as they are in receipt of such pay at present anyway.  I accept that that is a recognition by the Department of their contribution and level of service.  There is a slight dichotomy in that people of senior rank as rate collectors who will soon be revenue collectors are being allowed to maintain their rate of pay whereas rate collectors who do not have a salary in excess of the highest rate for revenue commissioners will not have their years of service recognised in the same way.  Many rate collectors are senior members of the community and if the Department granted an extension of time perhaps they could agree to award them an <i>ex gratia</i> payment.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy <Col N="547" /> Cowen for giving me some of his time to speak on this matter.  I wish to thank the Minister also for coming in to answer the question we have raised.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister say if this agreement is voluntary?  Can he say also if undue pressure will be exerted on rate collectors who find the proposals unacceptable? There are many points people want to know about.  Have people been offered alternative employment?  In some cases the salary on offer could be less than their current salary.  The Minister will accept that no rate collector should be asked to do alternative work for a lower salary than he or she already enjoys.  There is also the question of people who are willing to retire and take redundancy.  There are people who had previous employment with semi-State bodies, for example, with CIE, and they are concerned about superannuation.</P>
      <P>I know the Local Government and Public Services Union have been negotiating on behalf of the workers.  The fact that we have raised this matter tonight is not a reflection on them, but to see if the deadline can be extended.  My main concern relates to the voluntary nature of the scheme.  That is of crucial importance and there should be no question of abolishing the office of rate collector if the workers do not accept what is offered.</P>
      <P>Negotiations have been going on for some time in County Galway and some progress has been made.  If the deadline is extended I appeal to the Minister to allow the management and unions to conclude the arrangements.  I am reluctant to speak on the matter as the unions are involved in negotiations but I have been approached by a number of constituents. I am chairman of our local authority and I know the people who have given such long and outstanding service in County Galway.  I hope any points I make will help resolve the matter.  The deadline is 30 May.  I appeal to the Minister to extend the deadline so that the negotiations may conclude.</P>
      <P>My colleague Deputy Gallagher is chairman of local authority in County Donegal and now wishes to contribute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to become involved but I wish to raise one case in which the Department have been more than helpful.  A rate collector was employed by County Donegal Railways. They were taken over by CIE and apparently the problem does not lie with the Department of the Environment but with CIE.  They are not in a position to pass on this service.  Perhaps in the next few days the Department might come up with some views on this.  I do not expect an answer from the Minister tonight.  He is not directly responsible.</P>
      <P>Hopefully there will be an extension to the Friday deadline and some loose ends can be tidied up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputies who have paid tribute to the performance of rate collectors over the years.  Sometimes their contribution to the revenue of their respective local authorities is not always recognised.  Their rate of collection was outstanding.  It is significant that since the domestic and farm rate was abolished the percentage collection rate has fallen sharply.  Other income sources which were attempted by the local authorities have not produced the same performance rate.</P>
      <P>The rate collectors are to be congratulated on the efficacy of their efforts over the years.  However, there is no doubt that in the past nine or ten years rate collectors have been unable to collect warrants which they previously did, first because of the abolition of the domestic rate and then, following court judgments, the abolition of the farm rate.  A number of local authorities have rate collectors who do not have justifiable warrants.  It is fair and reasonable that this matter must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms offered to rate collectors are generous.  They could opt for a severance payment together with immediate payment of pension irrespective of their age and with a degree of added years depending on their service.  That is very generous in public service terms.  Alternatively they could become revenue collectors. I may have a degree of bias in <Col N="549" /> this because as Minister for the Public Service I was involved in the final determination of these terms.  The terms were accepted by the union which represents the rate collectors.  Any minor difficulties which might have emerged in the interim are a matter for local management and the individual collectors.</P>
    <P>Many local authorities have decided to keep on somebody as a rate collector taking on an expanded warrant in return for other collectors retiring.  Others have become revenue collectors.  I know there was apprehension on the part of an individual rate collector in Deputy Cowen's constituency but, as of today, that individual has decided to become a revenue collector.  I am not sure if the Deputy's question was prompted as a result of the natural apprehensions of that individual who felt that the job he was doing could not be done during normal office hours and that a requirement that he might perform as a revenue collector during normal office hours would not be workable.</P>
    <P>All of these things are matters between local management and the rate collectors. There is a suggestion now from the Deputy that, in order for rate collectors &mdash; many of whom no longer have real warrants to collect &mdash; to translate into becoming revenue collectors, we should give them an <i>ex gratia</i> payment.  But from what source is that to be funded?  There is no pot of gold, and rate collectors for some years have been collecting less and less money.  Now they are being invited to become revenue collectors so as to collect enough money to justify their salaries and generate income for their local authority.  I cannot understand where the local authority would find the money to give them some <i>ex gratia</i> payment.  I certainly have not got the money, unless the Deputy wants me to impose additional taxation on the general public.  As I said previously, as long as I am Minister for the Environment I have no intention of doing anything that imposes one extra penny of tax on any member of the general public.  So I cannot respond to the request that rate collectors should get an <Col N="550" /><i>ex gratia</i> payment to become revenue collectors.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a lot of confusion about the salary scales of revenue collectors and the existing salaries of rate collectors. Both Deputy Cowen and Deputy Kitt seemed to be apprehensive that a rate collector becoming a revenue collector might suffer a loss of income.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Any person translating from one position to the other will carry his salary on a personal basis if it happens to be higher than the appropriate level on the revenue collectors' scale.  Some rate collectors might enter the scale an increment or two higher and thus be financially better off as a result of the transfer.  The situation is that we cannot carry on indefinitely with a situation where we have rate collectors but no domestic rates, no farm rates&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not seeking that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I am not suggesting that any of the three Deputies who spoke suggested that.  But the reason for this rationalisation is that nobody could countenance a situation where we have rate collectors and no incidence of domestic rates and no farm rates but only commercial rates to be collected.  The situation must be rationalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's approach in this matter has been fair and reasonable. They have offered severance pay, immediate payment of pension, the option to become a revenue collector.  In addition, the union involved participated and eventually agreed to the offer that was made by Government.  More than six months was given for the individual members to consider their situation.  But in Ireland there seems to be a confusion between consultation and procrastination. In an effort to defer decision-making, requests are made for more time on the basis that the extension will bring about a miracalous transformation in the situation.  An extension will not change the situation here.  All the rate collectors must be well aware of the terms that are on offer.  Over six months to consider the <Col N="551" /> situation is more than reasonable and it is an option which many people in the private sector do not have.  I do not see that any person who has had that length of time to decide on the future is going to materially change his mind if the time is extended at this stage.  Furthermore, the negotiations were conducted nationally on behalf of my predecessor with the Staff Negotiations Board and the unions <Col N="552" /> and it would be unfair to both the unions and the negotiations board if I were to change the mutually agreed operative date.  I do not want any rate collector to feel that I do not appreciate the contribution they have made.  With a great degree of reluctance, I have to say that I see no merit in extending the time at this stage.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in a reply to a similar question on 31 October 1985, exploration for gas in west Cavan is being carried out under exclusive onshore exploration licence No. 2/80.  Aran Energy are the current <Col N="365" /> operator for this licence which covers 2,785 sq. km of the North West Carboniferous Basin, including approximately 570 sq. km in County Cavan.  Following the drilling of two exploratory wells in 1984, a thorough review of the hydrocarbon potential of the Basin is now being carried out by the licensees.  The licensees are using all the well, seismic and other exploration data already available to them, in conjunction with the results of other work recently undertaken in the area which involved different exploration techniques, to produce a Basin report.</P>
      <P>The results of this work should be available to my Department by early 1987, when a decision will be made as to what future exploration work is appropriate in the licensed area.  In accordance with the confidentiality provisions contained in the licence, the findings will not become available to the public until four years after their completion or two years after revocation, surrender or expiry of the licence, whichever is the earlier.  The licence is currently scheduled to expire on 30 April 1987 but the licensees may seek its extension for a further period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): In considering the proposed take-over notified to me involving the supermarket in question I had regard to the list of criteria scheduled in the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978. These include the effect of a proposed merger or take-over on competition, on continuity of services, the interest of employees and employment in general as well as the interests of shareholders and partners in the enterprises involved and of the consumer.</P>
      <P>In particular I had regard to the fact that the take-over entailed the acquisition of the business of a major UK-owned supermarket by a much smaller Irishowned company and that it ensured continuity of service and the maintenance of employment in the business concerned.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, there are no official figures available for the market shares of the total grocery trade enjoyed by the various supermarket chains at present.</P>
      <P>I am aware that certain private surveys, based on a limited number of common grocery items purchased in a number of homes, attributed a total market share (before the take-over) of about 30 per cent to the two non-Irish supermarket groups then operating in this country.  I am also advised, however, that the market share of these two groups calculated in relation to an updating of the 1981 household budget survey (carried out by the Central Statistics Office) would have amounted to around 15 per cent in 1985 terms.</P>

      <P>The problem in this case concerns a driving licence which has been endorsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 37 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, provides for the carry over of endorsements on a driving licence to subsequent driving licences.  Under this provision a person whose licence has been <Col N="368" /> endorsed must, before he can obtain a licence free from that endorsement, satisfy the licensing authority that he has held a driving licence either during a continuous period of not less than three years or a series of discontinuous periods amounting in the aggregate to not less than five years after the date of the original endorsement.</P>
    <P>A three year licence held by the person referred to by the Deputy was endorsed on 11 April 1983.  This licence expired on 15 July 1984.  He applied for and was granted a one-year licence on 16 July 1984 expiring on 15 July 1985.  This licence was not, however, renewed until he applied for and was granted a further one-year licence on 30 September 1985. The five year rule referred to must, therefore, apply.</P>
    <P>The earliest date on which this person will be entitled to a licence free from that endorsement will be 26 June 1988.  This will be conditional on his ensuring that he does not allow any break between the expiry date of one licence and the commencement date of the next one during the interevening period.  To ensure that this does not happen, the person concerned should apply for a licence well in advance of the expiry date of his current licence &mdash; he is entitled to make such application up to one month before the latter date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Committee on Public Expenditure recently received a report from an advisory panel establishd by them to examine forestry matters which <i>inter alia</i> put a valuation of £366 million on State forests.  I do not accept that figure as a reasonable valuation of the State forests nor the assumptions on which it was based and my Department has so informed the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I explained in reply to a question in the House on 8 May, there is no definitive method of valuing the national forest estate.  Because of the long term nature of the forestry enterprise, the valuation of the estate at any time is highly sensitive <Col N="373" /> to assumptions made as to the rate of interest, in real terms, that may be expected on the investment and the likely trends in timber prices over a period extending up to 50 years.  By assuming different rates of interest the review group on forestry in their report estimated the value of the State forest estate at between £350 million and £2,500 million. The group did, however, state that the State forestry enterprise had succeeded in achieving profitability of 2 per cent over and above inflation and assuming a continued profitability level of that order the value of the estate would be in the region of £1,100 million.</P>
    <P>The methodology used by the review group in their calculations is set out in appendix 4 of their report a copy of which is available in the Library of the House.</P>
    <P>There are no proposals before me or my Department for the sale of State forests to the private sector.  In this connection I would refer the Deputy to my statement of 7 May 1986 on the matter to Seanad Éireann.</P>

      <P>In March 1981 my Department, with the approval of the Government, entered into a contract with Medite of Europe Limited for the supply of pulpwood for processing in their proposed new factory at Clonmel. A contract along similar lines was entered into in May 1984 with Finsa Forest Products Limited for the supply of pulpwood for their factory at Scarriff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="374" /> The non-disclosure clauses included in these contracts were in line with the long established practice of Government Departments in not disclosing commercial information in relation to individual firms and are, of course, designed to protect the firms concerned.  Indeed it has long been the practice of my own Department for very obvious reasons not to disclose to third parties details of individual contracts whether they be long term pulpwood supply contracts or agreements for tender sales to sawmillers.  This is normal commercial practice and is not just unique to my Department.</P>
    <P>I agree that the disposal of State assets should be in accordance with clearly defined criteria and indeed this is the case with my Department's tender sales system for timber from State forests.  In the case of Medite and Finsa the special supply contracts entered into by the Department were in the context of the arrangements made to attract suitable pulpwood industries to this country.</P>

      <P>The basic mechanism for gathering Irish tourism statistics has been Bord Fáilte's survey of overseas travellers.</P>
      <P>In 1981, the Bord, in conjunction with the Central Statistics Office, established the country of residence survey to improve the extent of information available on tourist traffic.  Up to 1985 these estimates were based mainly on information obtained at departure points in Ireland.  Last year, with a view to achieving greater accuracy, estimates also took into account information gathered from passengers at arrival points.  The introduction of this survey has extended and increased the accuracy of Bord Fáilte's own survey of overseas travellers.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in the light of its possible adverse effect on industry, he will consider altering the provision in the Finance Act, 1986, for a 12 per cent stamp duty on section 84 loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 94 of the Finance Bill, 1986, imposes by way of stamp duty a levy on interest arising from &ldquo;section 84&rdquo; loans at a rate of 12 per cent where the effective rate of interest is 6 per cent per annum or greater and at a rate of 8 per cent where the effective rate of interest is less than 6 per cent.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that this levy will have adverse effects on industry.  The levy is a modest one as is evidenced by the fact that, whereas &ldquo;section 84&rdquo; loans cost the Exchequer over £85 million per annum in revenue foregone (which must be made up elsewhere), the yield from the levy in 1986 is estimated at £6 million only.  The continued availability of &ldquo;section 84&rdquo; loans thus provides Irish industry with marked advantages provided at a significant cost to the Irish taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he considers it may be appropriate to create special arrangements for types of investments which enable employees in the public sector and in small and medium-sized undertakings to participate in productive capital formation and which also allows small and medium-sized undertakings the possibility of investment using the investment wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Provisions already exist which not only enable but actively encourage employees in small and medium-sized undertakings to participate in productive capital formation. For example the smaller companies market launched by the Stock Exchange in March 1986 is designed to stimulate productive capital formation in such companies.  Participation in the smaller companies market does not affect the eligibility of a company for the scheme of relief for investment in corporate trades.  Accordingly, an employee of a small or medium-sized eligible company may obtain income tax relief on investment in the company of up to £25,000 in any one year.</P>
      <P>Similarly, there is a positive incentive, irrespective of the size of the company for employees to participate through the investment wage concept in a company profit-sharing scheme.  Where the terms of such a scheme have been approved by the Revenue Commissioners, shares to a maximum value of £5,000 can be appropriated to each employee in any one year without the employee incurring an income tax charge on the benefit received.  The Deputy may be aware that in the recent Finance Bill I increased the attractiveness of the scheme by providing for a reduction from seven to five years in the period for which shares acquired under an approved profit-sharing scheme must be retained to benefit from the full income tax concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another incentive, which I introduced this year, is the Finance Bill provision whereby an employee or full time director of a company can obtain income tax relief on money used to buy ordinary shares in his company up to a total <Col N="383" /> amount of £750.</P>
    <P>The question of extending similar facilities to employees in the public sector is more complex.  It is difficult to envisage how such employees could participate in productive capital formation in the context of the existing incentive without the implementation of a privatisation programme.  I have no plans at present to introduce proposals for the privatisation of State companies.</P>

I have already provided in this year's Finance Bill a wide range of tax incentives to promote development and reconstruction in certain inner city areas.  As I indicated to the House in my speech at the commencement of the Second Stage debate on the Bill, anticipated activity in the designated areas as a result of these incentives, along with activity generated by the new home improvement grants, have an employment potential of more than 3,000 jobs per year.  Tax reliefs to encourage the provision of new or refurbished residential accommodation for renting and for the construction of multi-storey car parks and toll roads and bridges are, of course, also available still and continue to stimulate activity in the construction industry. These tax incentives are additional to the major input to the construction industry provided through the public capital programme.</P>

The inspector of taxes will now communicate directly with the taxpayer requesting the details which are required to enable reviews of her tax liabilities for 1984-85 and 1985-86 to be carried out.  The question of the taxpayer's <Col N="385" /> entitlement to a refund of PRSI. deductions is one for the Minister for Social Welfare to consider.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that certain night porters in hotels were not taxed in respect of their tips in recent years because of an oversight on the part of some members of the staff of the taxes inspectorate.  This position has been rectified with effect from 1986-87 and will of course, have the normal consequence of reducing the take home pay for that year of the employees concerned. However, income tax will not be assessed on such income in respect of the tax years prior to 1986-87.</P>

This has the double benefit of maintaining close contact between the mentally handicapped persons and their parents and relatives and also facilitating staff in taking their holidays without the need to incur additional expenditure on temporary staff.</P>
      <P>This year Stewart's Hospital are encouraging the relatives of all residents to try to take them home on holidays for a period during July and August.  As a result, it is expected that more residents will have family holidays this year than in previous years.  There are, however, some residents whose circumstances are not suited to a family holiday and they will remain in the hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not given any direction to the health boards in regard to the issue or withdrawal of long term illness books.  I am aware that some health boards have withdrawn long term illness books from persons who previously held both a medical card and a long term illness book and from other persons holding long term illness books who were subsequently found to be eligible for a medical card.</P>
      <P>Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, would be unable to provide general practitioner services, including the supply of drugs, for themselves and their dependants without incurring an undue level of hardship.  The long term illness scheme provides drugs, free of charge, where these are prescribed for the treatment of one of a specific list of scheduled illnesses.</P>
      <P>Given the nature of the services provided, possession of a medical card comprehends the benefits of a long term illness book and provides for the additional benefits of a free family doctor service.  Long term illness books may therefore be withdrawn on issue of a medical card.</P>
      <P>If a person suffering from a scheduled long term illness who holds a medical card only is prescribed any medication not available through the GMS scheme, arrangements are made by the health board for the supply of that medication to the patient concerned.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the disabled persons rehabilitation allowance is to provide an income for persons who are pursuing a suitable course of rehabilitation training for the disabled.  The Midland Health Board is of the view that disabled persons who are in training for a period exceeding three years can no longer be deemed to be in receipt of training proper, and are in fact in sheltered employment.  An allowance at the rate approcriate to those not in training is therefore paid to such persons.</P>

      <P>One of the qualifying conditions <Col N="392" /> for the receipt of a contributory old age pension requires the claimant to have a yearly average of at least 20 reckonable contributions from the beginning of the 1953-54 contribution year or from her year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before she reaches pension age.  The yearly average is based on a person's own insurance record.  A spouse's record cannot be taken into account for this purpose.  The person concerned has no record of insurance since the beginning of the 1953-54 contribution year, and therefore, she does not qualify for a contributory old age pension.  Her husband is in receipt of a contributory old age pension at the rate of £51.40 per week.  She is in receipt of a noncontributory old age pension at a rate which is greater than the increase in respect of an adult dependant to which he would otherwise be entitled.</P>

      <P>The decline in pig prices in recent months is a direct reflection of the difficult market for pigmeat at home and abroad.  The recent introduction of an EC scheme of aids for private storage of pigmeat has averted a further drop in prices and, combined with a decline in feed prices, has prevented a further erosion of producer margins.</P>
      <P>For some time past I have been pointing to the pressing need for the industry to rationalise its slaughtering capacity and modernise its processing plants.  This is essential if the industry is to gear itself to meet the increasing competition it faces on all markets.  Government support for rationalisation is provided through the generous grant aid which is available from the IDA, supplemented by funds from FEOGA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An aggressive approach to marketing is also required and it is important that <Col N="399" /> the firms involved should vigorously pursue the development of value-added products.  The services of CTT are available to help with export marketing arrangements but firms themselves must be prepared to devote more resources to this area.</P>

However that Act applies only to insolvencies which occurred on or after 22 October 1983 whereas the firm in question was put into receivership and the employees were made redundant before that date.
