      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 9 and 30.  By agreement, No. 9 and the Second Stage of No. 30 shall be taken together for the purpose of debate.  Also by agreement, the proceedings on No. 9 and the remaining Stages of No. 30, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.30 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments include only amendments set down by the Minister for Communications.</P>

      <P>As you know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I have had a running battle all week with the Ceann Comhairle, who is out of the country today, as also with the Minister for Labour.  I was attempting to ask the Minister for Labour to follow through on a commitment he gave this House last Friday during the Labour Estimate to convene a Labour Court meeting to instruct the Chairman of the Labour Court, Mr. John Horgan, to bring both sides in the Dublin Corporation dispute together to try to come to a resolution.  When this strike started there was very little between the two sides.  With the Army and Garda interventions and the nasty scenes which took place last night, which I do not condone <Col N="1438" /> in any way, and with the potential trouble at the weekend at the various tipheads&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Several months ago in this House we passed the Free Ports Bill.  Following on that, the Minister was supposed to formulate regulations under the Bill to implement the Free Port Authority.  Draft regulations have not even been made yet.  It is now two and a half years since the task force reported on the need for a free port for Cork.  Can I ask the Taoiseach who leads this clumsy Government the reason for this inordinate delay?  No job has yet been provided for Cork.  He is coming to Cork in a few weeks' time regarding other issues.  I would like to know what the position is.</P>

On the Order of Business, could I ask the Taoiseach, implore the Taoiseach, in view of the seriousness of the situation, will he give Government time today to make a statement?</P>

I am aware of the matter being raised by various Deputies in the Dublin area, but I am watching it very carefully from this point of view: that another precedent is being set in Dublin which I would not like to see extended to Cork should we have that kind of dispute.

      <P>I will, but I have a request to make on the Order of Business which is that, in view of the seriousness of what is happening in this country at this time, the Government give time to this House to debate this issue because we are in a dangerous and anarchical situation.  The Government are sitting silently on the matter hiding behind the Minister for Defence's contribution on the Adjournment debate last night.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the <Col N="1445" /> terms of the proposed agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United States of America relating to the preinspection in the State of persons travelling by air to the United States of America, copies whereof were laid before Dáil Éireann on 5 June 1986.</P>
    <P>The copies of the draft agreement now laid before Dáil Eireann contain one minor alteration compared to the copies of the draft previously laid before the Dáil and scheduled to the Air Navigation and Transport (Preinspection) Bill, 1986. In subsection (5) of Article VII the word &ldquo;passenger&rdquo; is replaced by the word &ldquo;person&rdquo;.  This is a minor drafting amendment which has been agreed with the US Authorities.  In so far as the draft agreement scheduled to the Bill is concerned, I will be moving the necessary amendment on the Committee Stage. The debate on this motion is being taken in conjunction with the Second Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide a legislative framework for the establishment of US immigration and public health preinspection facilities at Shannon Airport in accordance with an agreement proposed to be made between the Irish and US Governments.  The proposed agreement has been laid before the House and is scheduled to the Bill.  It will be formally signed following the enactment of the legislation.  The urgency in dealing with the legislation arises from the need to have a legal framework in place so as to permit the establishment of the preinspection facility, on a trial basis, with effect from 1 July 1986.</P>
    <P>For some years past, arising from an Aer Rianta initiative aimed at increasing traffic through Shannon Airport, the question of establishing US customs, immigration, and public health preclearance at Shannon has been discussed from time to time with the US authorities.  The US already have such arrangements with Canada, the Bahamas and Bermuda.  In the early stages of the discussions, a full preclearance arrangement was considered, but it was not proceeded with <Col N="1446" /> because of Aer Lingus concern about the delays which would arise for the company's services to the US due to the necessity to off-load baggage at Shannon in order to process it though customs.  In any event, the US customs authorities themselves did not appear to be very enthusiastic about the proposal, so interest in customs preclearance at Shannon tended to recede somewhat.</P>
    <P>Last year I decided to pursue the matter further with the US authorities and at a meeting with the US Secretary for Transportation, Mrs. Elizabeth Dole, in Washington last October, I raised the preclearance question again.  Our meeting turned out to be very productive and, following discussions between officials of our two administrations, the text of a draft agreement was finalised on a more limited preinspection arrangement. Under the proposed agreement officers of the United States Immigration and Naturalisation Service would conduct in Ireland, at Shannon in the first instance, inspection of passengers and aircraft crew required by United States immigration and public health laws and regulations for entry into the United States.  Customs clearance would be carried out in the normal way on arrival in the United States.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are no doubt aware, airlines operating long-distance routes between parts of the US and Europe, or operating with certain types of aircraft, have to make a technical stop for refuelling purposes at an intermediate airport and Aer Rianta over the years have marketed Shannon as a suitable transit stop. The principal benefit to Ireland of preinspection is that Aer Rianta will be able to market it as another reason why airlines should operate through Shannon, thus generating additional traffic movements at the airport.</P>
    <P>In the light of the possibility of avoiding what are often lengthy delays at immigration on arrival in the US, preinspection at Shannon would mostly benefit business people and passengers holding other than US passports.  Aer Rianta believe that preinspection should be of particular interest to airlines operating between <Col N="1447" /> Europe and the US with significant numbers of non-US citizens on board.  Indeed, I see no reason why it should not also be of interest to airlines operating schedules services between the US and Ireland, particularly those which turn around at Shannon.</P>
    <P>To test the value of preinspection to Shannon Airport, agreement has been reached on an initial trial period of four months, commencing 1 July, after which the results of the trial will be evaluated by both countries and a decision taken as to whether preinspection should be established on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>Initial estimates were that preinspection could result in 100 extra landings at Shannon during the four month trial period, generating significant net additional revenue for Aer Rianta from aircraft landing fees, inflight catering, sales of fuel and sales in the duty free shop. Aer Rianta estimate that the additional revenue generated would more than compensate for the &ldquo;once off&rdquo; cost to Aer Rianta of providing the physical facilities required at Shannon for the preinspection facility.</P>
    <P>Recent developments with regard to international terrorism have affected the Aer Rianta projections somewhat, as it is now generally accepted that fewer US visitors will come to Europe this summer. However, this new situation makes it all the more necessary for us to take all possible measures to maximise the attraction of this country and its airport facilities to airlines flying between the US and Europe.  The Government have decided, therefore, to press ahead with the proposals for preinspection at Shannon.  I have been assured by Aer Rianta that, on the basis of commitments already received from a number of airlines, the preinspection scheme will still be well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Under a permanent arrangement, the additional cost to the US Government of providing preinspection at Shannon compared with the cost of inspection on arrival in the US would fall on Aer Rianta.  However, in accordance with the terms of the proposed agreement and normal practice in the US preclearance <Col N="1448" /> arrangements with other countries, these costs could be recouped by Aer Rianta from the participating airlines.  In the course of the negotiations, however, the US side accepted a suggestion from the Irish delegation that the United States Immigration and Naturalisation Service should bear the costs of posting INS officers at Shannon during the trial period and that the cost of the required physical facilities at Shannon would be borne by Aer Rianta.  This should make participation in the trial period more attractive to airlines.</P>
    <P>I should mention that Aer Lingus, who have expressed concern lest preinspection might cause delays at Shannon to their services to the US, nevertheless propose to avail of the trial period to put some of their flights through preinspection. I was glad to hear of this because my Department have been assured both by Aer Rianta and the US authorities that sufficient resources will be made available to ensure that delays will not occur.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is intended to give legal effect to the terms of the proposed agreement with the US.  There are two aspects of the Bill and the draft agreement to which I think I should draw particular attention.  They relate to the questions of national sovereignty and law enforcement.</P>
    <P>The exercise by a sovereign power of jurisdiction on Irish soil is obviously a matter of concern in principle and in practice. Deputies will note that paragraph (1) of Article I of the draft agreement defines preinspection as the procedure whereby the INS conduct in Ireland inspection of passengers and aircraft crew required by US immigration and public health laws and regulations for entry into the US, while Article V links the powers of INS officials with the same laws and regulations, The provisions of the draft agreement which could be held to touch on Ireland's sovereignty, for example, Article IX which deals, <i>inter alia</i>, with the question of immunity for US citizens assigned to INS duties in Ireland, Article V which deals with the powers of INS officers, and Article VI, paragraph (4) <Col N="1449" /> which deals with law enforcement, have been drafted as restrictively and tightly as possible.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill specifies the preinspection duties which INS officials will be authorised to carry out in the State while Section 6 provides for immunity from civil and criminal prosecution for such officials while carrying out those duties. Section 6 also provides for protection of the facilities used by the INS officials and for the grant to the INS officials of such privileges as may be agreed between the two Governments.  The immunities are strictly limited to acts performed in the course of duties at the preinspection facility, which have been carefully defined in the Bill and in the draft agreement.  It should also be noted that provision is made in section 6 (3) of the Bill, as in the draft agreement, whereby the immunities granted may be waived by the US Government.</P>
    <P>The provision made in section 6 (5) of the Bill reflects the undertaking contained in Article IX (4) of the draft agreement regarding privileges to be accorded in the future to the relevant US officials. Deputies will note that the question of the privileges to be enjoyed by the US officials concerned will have to be the subject of further consultations and agreement between the two Governments.  It is envisaged that these privileges will relate principally to the areas of income tax and customs examination on transfer of residence.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that the text of the draft agreement, by imposing obligations on the US authorities to consult with and/or to seek the agreement of the Irish authorities in relation to a number of important operational aspects of preinspection, provides an important element of control by the Irish authorities.  For example, Article VI (2) provides that the preinspection facilities to be provided must be the subject of agreement between the competent authorities of both countries; Article VI (3) requires the agreement of the competent Irish authority to any communications and inspection aids and equipment required by the INS for preinspection purposes; <Col N="1450" /> Article VII (1) provides for Irish control over the number of INS officials to be assigned to preinspection duties; Article VII (3) imposes an obligation on the US authorities to consult with the competent Irish authority on matters relating to the implementation of the agreement; while Article VII (5) provides that the INS shall immediately inform the Irish Immigration Service of any refusal of passage onwards to the US and supply the latter with all data relevant to that decision.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the US authorities have accepted, and it is written into the draft agreement and into section 5 of the Bill, that any search of passengers by INS officials would have to be on a voluntary basis.  We regarded this as a very important point of principle.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill is concerned with aliens control.  At present, for the purposes of aliens control, persons who are in transit at Shannon Airport are not regarded as having arrived in the State. Similarly, under section 7 of the Bill, persons flying into Shannon, who are cleared for passage onwards to the US by the INS and then continue their journey to the US, will not be regarded as having arrived in the State.</P>
    <P>Where, however, a person is refused passage onwards by the INS, it is necessary that that person should be deemed to have arrived in the State and should, therefore, have to present himself or herself to an Irish immigration officer for permission to land.  This will be necessary because there may not be an early return flight to the person's point of embarkation or place or origin.  Persons refused passage onwards will be given or refused permission to land in the State having regard to their individual cases, to the Aliens Act and orders made under that Act.</P>
    <P>In the case of persons refused permission to land in the State, it may be necessary in some cases to keep them in detention pending suitable flights out of the State.  It is not envisaged that the number of people refused passage onwards will be large or that their numbers should pose any problem for our immigration officers.  Accordingly, no <Col N="1451" /> extra staff will be needed to deal with this category of person.  As I have indicated already, the INS will be required to provide information to our immigration officers about persons refused passage onwards.  Such information would be of use to our immigration officers in the event of such persons seeking permission to land in Ireland.  This arrangement will not result in any expense to the Irish taxpayer as the draft agreement provides that the air carrier will be responsible for all expenses and arrangements in connection with return to the point of embarkation or country of origin of persons refused passage onwards by the INS.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that, under the terms of the draft agreement, law enforcement at the proposed preinspection facility will remain in Irish hands.  Under Article VI (4) of the draft agreement, the Irish Government undertake to provide appropriate law enforcement assistance to prevent persons refused passage onwards from boarding a preinspected flight.  Such assistance would be confined to cases where there was a threat of a breach of the peace or, for instance, where there was a threat of an assault or where an actual assault had taken place. That type of situation can arise at present at any of our airports.  A passenger may not, for example, have the necessary documentation and, for that reason, may be refused permission to board a flight leaving the State.  Normally, such persons accept the decision of the air carrier staff but occasionally it can happen that they create a scene or remonstrate about the decision.</P>
    <P>Therefore, what is envisaged in the draft agreement in relation to law enforcement is not new, in the sense that similar situations can occur at our airports at present and, on occasion, they have to be dealt with by authorised officers, that is, the Airport police or the Garda Síochána. Indeed, boarding or attempting to board an aircraft by an unauthorised person is already a prohibited act under Article 4 of the Airport Bye-Laws 1978.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill provides for increased penalties for offences such as <Col N="1452" /> obstructing, impeding or assaulting authorised officers or for refusing or failing to leave a State airport when required to do so by an authorised officer.  The existing penalties were laid down by the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1950, and are very much out of date.</P>
    <P>As with the immigration service, it is envisaged that the extra work on law enforcement will not necessiatate any extra staff to deal with matters arising from the preinspection operation at Shannon.  Incidents necessitating law enforcement assistance, which are expected to be few in number, will be dealt with as part of the normal workload of the law enforcement officers concerned.</P>
    <P>In view of certain comments made recently outside the House, I should like to make one point absolutely clear.  INS officers assigned to Shannon Airport will not be armed and it was never intended that they should be.</P>
    <P>Over the years, Shannon Airport has had its ups and downs.  The introduction of jet aircraft on trans-Atlantic routes in the late fifties, obviating the need for refuelling stops, threatened the viability of the airport.  This was the stimulus for the establishment of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company who were given responsibility for developing traffic through the airport and for encouraging industrial development in the immediate vicinity of the airport and I think it right that I should acknowledge on this occasion the significant contribution made over the years by the development company in attracting terminal traffic to Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>The efforts of Shannon Development were built on by Aer Rianta from 1969 onwards, when they took over the management of the airport and, or later on, the catering and duty free shops.  The success of the Aeroflot refuelling facility, the marketing of Shannon as a technical stopping point and expansion of mail order and duty free sales have all made substantial contributions to the wellbeing of the airport.  The board, management and staff of Aer Rianta deserve to be <Col N="1453" /> complimented for their efforts, which have largely been responsible for the turnaround in the financial performance at Shannon in recent years.  By contrast with a series of losses in the years 1979-82, which reached a peak of £1.6 million in 1980, results at Shannon in recent years have been much improved, with surpluses of £3.3 million and £3.6 million respectively in 1984 and 1985.  Although in view of the expected downturn in the number of US visitors to Europe this summer, it would be too optimistic to expect the results at Shannon this year to match those of recent years, the proposed new preinspection facility should provide some measure of compensation by attracting new traffic to the airport.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this Bill. As the Minister explained it is to provide for the establishment of a US immigration preinspection facility at Shannon Airport.  It is a welcome development and will provide an attractive advantage especially to Shannon Airport.  The <i>raison d'etre</i> for this facility is twofold from the US point of view.  If they are able to have a preinspection facility at a European destination it would help them from the point of view of security.  It would also help to ease the intolerable congestion at US gateways particularly for non-US passport holders.</P>
      <P>If other major European airports such as Paris, Frankfurt and London had shown any enthusiasm for this facility we would not be discussing it here today.  The facility will provide benefits to passengers travelling to the States.  It will mean that people will not have to queue for immigration clearance in the US.  As many people are aware this has often meant delays of three or four hours at airports. People also had the worry of whether they would be deported as well as the extra cost involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facility will enhance Shannon's position in attracting traffic through the airport.  To make this venture a success there must be participation in it by the four scheduled trans-Atlantic carriers. Delta and North West are prepared to <Col N="1454" /> participate fully in the proposed arrangement but Aer Lingus are not prepared to participate 100 per cent.  As the Minister stated they believe the facility will cause an undue delay at Shannon as a result of offloading baggage.  Hopefully if the trial period proves a success Aer Lingus will participate fully in the facility.</P>
    <P>Article 4 of the agreement provides for this facility to be located in other locations.  I presume that means Dublin and perhaps this might allow Aer Lingus to get over their difficulty.  Air carriers such as TWA and other supplementary carriers have expressed great interest in using the preinspection facility at Shannon. Many more flights will be attracted into Shannon and that can only be for the good of Shannon and the country generally.  As we are well aware, traffic between the US and here this year has been severely hit due to happenings over the past year.  That means that the same level of revenue will not be generated. We need something to overcome the losses which have occurred.  This facility will help to increase revenue to Aer Rianta as there will be extra landing fees, in-flight catering, sales of fuel and so on. Extra flights will also help to promote Shannon and the country in general.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill empowers the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, to prescribe fees in relation to the preinspection of passeengers and crew.  I would be grateful if the Minister would indicate the level of fees and how they are to be utilised.  For example, are they to be used to cover the extra cost of providing the facility or to cover the extra costs likely to arise from increased security, controlling the records which must be held and so on?</P>
    <P>Section 6 stipulates that the State shall take all appropriate steps to protect the security of the facility and also to protect the official archives or documents maintained by the immigration and naturalisation service.  That section should dispel the fear expressed by some that American security forces will take over in this jurisdiction.  However, I am anxious to know if the State will have to pay a great <Col N="1455" /> deal of money to provide the extra security that, undoubtedly, will be required. How will that be financed?  How much is it likely to cost the Exchequer?  Will extra gardaí and airport police have to be employed?  Will gardaí have to be taken away from other duties?  I hope the Minister will deal with those questions when replying.</P>
    <P>Some people expressed fear about the infringement on our sovereignty.  This side of the House would be opposed to any infringement on our sovereignty but we do not believe the Bill will lead to that.  Seán O'Faoláin on one occasion spoke of an auto anti-Americanism syndrome and I expect we will hear more about that from some sources in regard to the provisions in the Bill.  It is our belief that there is not an ulterior motive in providing the facility.  It will ease the problems experienced by the thousands who emigrate to the US from Ireland. Those people go to the US in the hope of getting employment, furthering their ambitions and benefiting from the American education system.</P>
    <P>The Bill deserves support and we should not view its provisions as being sinister or an attempt to subvert the State.  Cancellations by American tourists will severely hit Shannon airport this year but the new facility will help.  However, the Minister should consider extending the trial period from four months to 12 months.  I wonder why it was decided to limit the trial period to four months.  It is our view that the provisions in the Bill have been watered down by the decision to exclude customs clearance facilities.  If such a facility had been included it would be of great benefit to those using Shannon airport.  The Minister told us that Aer Lingus were concerned about customs delays in the US and I hope that after the trial period for the new facilities the Minister will take the question of customs clearance up with the US authorities.  I should like to know if it will be necessary for the US Congress to pass similar legislation before the facility is introduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I am glad to note that it has received general acceptance and support from all Members.  I should like to compliment the Minister, and his officials, on producing the Bill.  It is innovative and anticipatory in its thinking.  The main thrust is to give a greater emphasis to Shannon airport and the nearness of Ireland to the US.  It represents an attempt to focus the attention of airline companies and passengers on Shannon.  I am hopeful that it will result in great benefits for the area.  It is up to Shannon airport to capitalise on the facilities and from their track record, I have no doubt that the authorities will do so.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the facility is being introduced at a time when the volume of American tourist traffic to Europe is at an all time low.  However, with the threat against American citizens receding I am hopeful that the number of Americans travelling to Europe will increase.  I understand that discussions have been held over a number of years with the US authorities with a view to establishing a US immigration and public health preinspection facility at Shannon.  Such arrangements exist at airports in Canada, the Bahamas and Bermuda and I urge the Minister to send his officials to inspect the facilities at those airports.  It is essential that the new scheme does not run into any difficulties during the four month trial period.</P>
      <P>Following negotiations, which were initiated in talks in October 1985, between the Minister and the US Secretary of Transportation a draft agreement was finalised for the preinspection facility at Shannon airport.  That draft agreement envisages preinspection facilities being conducted at Shannon for a period of four months, commencing on 1 July next. After that the facility will cease pending a decision on a permanent scheme.  It is my hope that there will not be a break and that once the scheme is in operation and proves worthwhile it will be continued on a permanent basis.  If there is a break it could affect the future of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement includes provisions <Col N="1457" /> covering, <i>inter alia,</i> law enforcement assistance to US officials, the powers of those officials, the treatment of health matters, costs, and certain limited immunity for US officials from prosecution before the Irish courts in respect of acts performed in the course of their duties.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta's initial assessment of the benefits of preinspection have been adversely affected by the public reaction in the US to terrosism in Europe.  The current assessment is that the extra traffic which preinspection can now be expected to generate at Shannon will be considerably below earlier expectations.  Aer Rianta are predicting a drop of up to 25 per cent in US tourist traffic although so far terminal traffic at Shannon has held up.  In fact, it is 9 per cent more than for the same period last year, from January to April.  They are expecting technical transit traffic to be badly hit as traffic from the US to southern Europe seems to have totally collapsed.  Overall, for all traffic for Shannon, Aer Rianta are predicting a 10 per cent drop on 1985 figures which represents a 17 per cent drop on their original projections for 1986.  That is all the more reason why we should pursue initiatives such as the preinspection facility in an effort to attract more business to Shannon airport.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta are of the view that it will be worth proceeding with the experiment this year although they expect to be working under adverse conditions.  If the scheme succeeds under adverse conditions we can expect that in normal conditions the benefits will be worthwhile. Anticipated benefits from sales, aircraft landing fees and inflight catering will, of course, be far greater when the American tourist industry returns to normal.</P>
    <P>The benefit to passengers will be in the avoidance of the bottlenecks at the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Airport in New York when several B747 aircraft arrive within a short period causing a queue of several hours at US Imigration.  Preinspection at Shannon will be a rapid process and the INS Section of the US have guaranteed that sufficient staff will be deployed to ensure that no delays will arise.  I urge the <Col N="1458" /> Government to provide all other facilities and arrangements so that there will not be delays, because it is in the first four months that the air carriers and passengers and tourists will decide whether it is worth while to participate in the scheme.</P>
    <P>There will be benefits to passengers with non-US passports and to airlines carrying appreciable numbers of such passengers.  Lists of the airlines which have already agreed to participate and airlines with which discussions are still taking place include TWA and American Trans-Air.  Those two have agreed to participate fully in the preinspection scheme. Tower Air and Skystar are considering the position.  In the case of the four scheduled carriers currently using Shannon, Delta and Pan Am will participate fully and Aer Lingus will do so to a limited extent.</P>
    <P>It might be asked whether passengers preinspected at Shannon would still face queues at customs on arrival in the US. There are not the same difficulties at New York in relation to customs as in regard to immigration.  As we all know, passengers with nothing to declare are subjected to only a cursory inspection and a minimum of formality.  In any event, custom dues would still have to be paid by passengers emerging from long delays at immigration.</P>
    <P>Questions have been asked about the exact powers the US immigration officials will exercise and whether they will be armed.  This probably is a throw-back to the visit of President Reagan in 1984 when many citizens objected to the behaviour of some of the officials.  In this case, he laid down in sections 5 and 6 of the Bill, the powers will be to carry out special specified duties under the agreement. Immigration officials will not have power to compel passengers to answer questions, produce documents or undergo searches.  However, passengers who refuse to co-operate with US immigration officials may be refused permission to travel to the US.  Passengers so refused will then be dealt with under normal Irish alien control procedures.  I am glad to learn from the Minister that US officials at Shannon will not be armed <Col N="1459" /> and that that was never the intention.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask some questions about the Bill itself.  Section 5 provides that persons assigned to carry out duties at a preinspection facility will be all citizens of the US.  Will Irish employees, Irish nationals, be precluded, or must such persons be citizens of the US?  Could an Irish person trained for the job carry out such inspections?  Section 8 (3) provides that, having left a State aerodrome in pursuance of the requirement of an authorised officer acting under the section, or having been removed from a State aerodrome, a person returns thereto on the same day, that person shall be guilty of an offence.  If that person returns the following day what would the situation be?</P>
    <P>Article III of the Schedule refers to a test period of four months.  Rather than have a break-off point at the end of four months could arrangements be made so that when this agreement terminates on the last day of the fourth month, the new agreement could take over immediately rather than have a break-away point? Such a break would interfere with the continuity of the whole scheme.  The Department officials should know by the third month whether the agreement would be worth renewing.</P>
    <P>Article IV refers to additional locations in Ireland.  If the agreement is a success at Shannon, such a facility could be established in Dublin and elsewhere if the volume of traffic necessitated it. Article VIII of the Schedule states at paragraph (b) (4):</P>
    <P>has undertaken to be responsible for the removal of any such person to his point of embarkation or the country of which he is a national and to bear any costs (including, where necessary, accommodation and maintenance costs) arising therefrom.</P>
    <P>In the event of a person arriving here and it is not possible to put him on another flight back to his country of origin and if he has to be maintained overnight, would that necessitate Garda surveillance so <Col N="1460" /> that he could not abscond?  We will have a number of such people who will want to gain entry to the US and who will be prevented from so doing at Shannon.  If such people are given hotel accommodation will they be policed until they are seen safely back on another plane?</P>
    <P>In the January 1986 issue of the OECD <i>Observer,</i> No. 183, I note that the thrust of this preinspection scheme is in keeping with modern thinking, particularly with the OECD Tourism Committee.  A new decision making recommendation has been adopted by the OECD Council mainly directed towards tourism.  The objectives are broadly in keeping with this Bill.  The paragraph setting out the objectives reads:</P>
    <P>The first general aim of the Decision-Recommendation is to avoid measures that distort competition and impede the movement of people, goods, services and capital.  The second is to encourage equal treatment of foreign-controlled and domestic enterprises in sectors related to tourism.  The third objective is to reduce administrative requirements and formalities.</P>
    <P>The obligations include:</P>
    <P>The second part of the Decision-Recommendation is a set of obligations which Member countries have accepted (though some have lodged reservations so as to have time to adapt), intended to encourage progress on such matters as duty and tax-free import of personal effects and other goods for personal use, the easing of customs regulations connected with the import of tourist publicity and of items temporarily imported for tourist-related industries and with the international circulation of cars and caravans.</P>
    <P>All these provisions add up to the appreciation that international tourism is no longer a secondary activity but one that is vitally important to employment, the balance of payments and the overall economy of many member countries.  All OECD members recognise that the freedom to travel is a right and not a privilege.</P>
    <P>In speaking to the Bill, I wish to refer <Col N="1461" /> briefly to the most recent Aer Rianta annual report and accounts.  The statement by the chairman indicates that 1985 was a most successful year for Aer Rianta and for Shannon.  The statement tells us that there was a record surplus of £11.5 million for 1985 and that income at £83.5 million was 10 per cent greater than in 1984, with an improvement in the overall surplus of 8 per cent.  The chairman said that this must be seen in the context of a 2.5 per cent growth in passenger traffic but, unfortunately, this was below the volume increases reported by our European counterparts for reasons all of us know.  Total through put at the airports at Shannon, Dublin and Cork was 4,119,315 passengers.  The chairman made the following comment:</P>
    <P>For Shannon we must continuously develop policies to protect its hard-won place in the transatlantic market.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a fresh and innovative approach to the problems affecting Shannon in order to maintain it as the number one airport for transatlantic flights.  The chairman continued as follows:</P>
    <P>Central to this objective is the availability of competitively priced aviation fuel for certain airlines flying between North America and the European mainland.  During 1985 a decision was taken to further strengthen our position in the fuel supply sector and Government approval was secured for the development of a larger fuel terminal costing IR £1 million.</P>
    <P>When this Bill is passed and when the agreement is effective, I hope there will be a spin-off for the duty free and other services in Shannon airport.  The Chairman continued:</P>
    <P>Although duty free allowances were regularly discussed by the EEC during 1985 no agreement was reached on the long-term future of this important contributor to Aer Rianta's income.  To most international travellers the availability of duty free shopping is a desirable services feature.  However, the contribution which duty free and VAT free sales make to the overall viability <Col N="1462" /> of airport operators like Aer Rianta is less well understood.  No matter what cost efficiency measures might be taken by the company it would be virtually impossible to avoid a very serious decline in Aer Rianta's fortunes without the right to operate duty free shops.</P>
    <P>I hope that the increasing numbers of passengers passing through Shannon will avail of the excellent duty free facilities at that airport and that the success rate of the duty free shops will be increased.</P>
    <P>There are many other interesting items and details in the report for the year ending 31 December 1985.  There has been an increase of 3.7 per cent in the numbers of transatlantic passengers and there has been an increase of 2 per cent in freight traffic, including mail.  In all, it has been a successful story in 1985 and I hope that this Bill will make possible even greater success in the 1986 accounts.</P>
    <P>I must refer to the splendid work of the Shannon Free Airport Development Authority.  Unfortunately south Tipperary is not included in that fine development but I know of the excellent work of the Authority for small indigenous industries and also in respect of the many tourist attractions such as medieval banquets, castles and folklore parks and other amenities.  I commend the Authority for their initiative and their approach to the tourist industry.  I am sure their projections for 1986 will be achieved.</P>
    <P>As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the foundation of Aer Lingus, it would be remiss of us not to pay a public compliment to the splendid work of that organisation and to the courtesy, kindness and attention given by their staff.  This has made Aer Lingus a unique airline in a difficult and competitive industry, Their tradition of putting people first has certainly paid off.  Like other Members of this House I have used various air carriers but I can truthfully say that the courtesy and attention shown by the staff of Aer Lingus is second to none.  It is a unique Irish quality that is difficult to define but it is a refreshing experience for visitors <Col N="1463" /> to see the smiling faces of the staff and to know they are genuinely interested in the welfare of the passengers.  I should like to compliment Aer Lingus and to wish them continued success as they enter their 51st year.</P>
    <P>There are new developments taking place at Dublin Airport.  A new runway of 8,650 sq. ft. is being constructed and also ancillary buildings.  The development will cost £32 million and those concerned must be congratulated.  I am told that, for the first time in the 24 years of their existence, Cork Airport are out of the red and are making a profit.  Even though it is small it is most welcome. Finally, I wish the Connacht Regional Airport every success.  It would be remiss of us on this occasion not to do so.  It had an inauspicious start due to inclement weather&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish the Bill well.  It has been introduced at a difficult time for the tourist trade.  I hope that the initial four months will be successful.  Every effort must be made by the Department and the officials concerned so that we will be ready to cope with the expected increase in American tourists when the unfortunate memories of the recent past have been forgotten by them.  I know that with the drive and enthusiasm of those people at Shannon Airport the undertaking will succeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Limerick man I am very proud of the success story of Shannon Airport.  We are all proud of it. It has proved itself over the years.  It is a headline maker, and once again it will set further headlines in the European sense as regards the facilities being provided there.  The history of Shannon is near and dear to every Member of this House, <Col N="1464" /> particularly those from the Munster region.  It would not be right when discussing Shannon Airport if we did not give a personal thanks to the great men who provided the airport against all odds and advice of the day and to the people with responsibility for developing the airport and making it the success story it is. In particular I want to pay tribute to the former chairman Brendan O'Regan and to Paul Quigley who recently retired.  I wish them well in their retirement.  They have made an important niche for themselves in the region and in the country, with their success in Shannon Airport.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties airport management face in ensuring that airports survive in these difficult days.  I do not want to go over the ground already covered this morning about the possibility of a fall off in tourism this year, but nevertheless, Aer Rianta are to be complimented for taking the initiative in looking for new ideas.  They were not content to sit back and draw their salaries from the State and do nothing to protect their future.  They showed the get up and go we would like to see other State bodies adopting.  This spirit of enterprise was instilled into the people of that region by Brendan O'Regan, Paul Quigley and the many others on that team.  I do not always agree with everything they do, and I have always maintained the right to criticise constructively whenever it was necessary, but one can only be full of praise for what they have done to date as regards the development of the airport.</P>
      <P>At the end of the fifties and early sixties the cynics predicted doom and gloom for that airport when the jets came on the scene and we did not have as many planes stopping for refueling.  Thank God the cynics were proved wrong.  The airport has gone from success to success.  Every taxpayer will be pleased to know that Shannon made a profit of more than £3.3 million in 1984 and £3.6 million in 1985, and I would not be surprised if, despite circumstances over which we have no control, they made a profit in 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister said this morning but there are one or two questions I would like to ask.  He made it <Col N="1465" /> quite clear that the question of increasing traffic through Shannon Airport was mooted by Aer Rianta.  This I know from informal discussions I have had with the staff of Aer Rianta when I passed through Dublin and Shannon airports.  As a matter of courtesy these staff members always try to talk to members of the Oireachtas and let them know a little of their activities.  I thank Mr. Guerin and Mr. Dully for their very great efforts on behalf of Aer Rianta for letting us know informally what they plan to do when they see that we, as taxpayers, are worried about what is happening.</P>
    <P>The idea was that in Shannon we would establish customs, immigration and public health clearance.  This was a big project but it would appear to me&mdash; and I am open to correction&mdash;that the group who put obstacles in the way of the full plan going ahead were our national airline, Aer Lingus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is not right then I apologise.  Perhaps the Minister will tease this out more fully later.  The Minister said the United States already have these arrangements for customs, immigration and public health with a number of other countries.  He said:</P>
      <P>...a full preclearance arrangement was considered, but it was not proceeded with because of Aer Lingus concern about the delays which would arise for the company's services to the US&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will clarify that in my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is more than welcome to do so.  The Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1466" /> In the early stages of the discussions, a full preclearance arrangement was considered, but it was not proceeded with because of Aer Lingus concern about the delays which would arise for the company's services to the US due to the necessity to off-load baggage at Shannon in order to process it through customs.  In any event, the US customs authorities themselves did not appear to be very enthusiastic about the proposal, so interest in customs preclearance at Shanon tended to recede somewhat.</P>
    <P>I am glad to put on the record that there was no attempt by Aer Lingus or anybody else to take this type of project from Shannon which could only benefit Shannon in the long run.</P>
    <P>In the past Deputies have said that Aer Lingus would prefer if Shannon were overflown because it is regarded as a bit of a bore to have to touch down at Shannon. This has never been accepted by any Government to date and any erosion of that position must be resisted.  If this position is not being eroded in any way at present.  I welcome that.  Having put down the marker which will be readily seen and understood by my colleagues from the region, I will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>It appears from what the Minister says that Aer Lingus will only use this new clearance on a selective basis.  Why should our national airline not co-operate fully in implementing this agreement?  Is there something we should be told about? If Delta, North-West Orient and other airlines are going to use it fully, why is it that Aer Lingus will only use it selectively? I admit there may be difficulty in handling baggage, but perhaps Aer Lingus could leave Dublin 30 minutes earlier and spend that time at Shannon Airport.  That might get over any time delays baggage handling might create.  I am not an expert in finding remedies to get over delays at airports, but those advising the Minister are, and they might let us know what these difficulties are and if they can be overcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Under the proposed agreement, <Col N="1467" /> officers of the United States Immigration and Naturalisation Service would conduct in Ireland&mdash;at Shannon in the first instance&mdash;inspection of passengers and aircraft crew required by United States immigration and public health laws and regulations for entry into the United States.</P>
    <P>Was this suggestion made by our side or the American side?  Was the suggestion made from this Government or by this Minister in regard to the preinspection base that the option be held open for an inspection base in Dublin, Cork or anywhere else, or was this requested by the Americans?  I am referring to section 4.  If that is part of the agreement I would like to hear the Minister's views on it.  I must be wary here, as I know my colleague Deputy Prendergast from Limerick, will be also, to ensure that we allow nothing whatsoever to erode the position of Shannon Airport.  It is just a note of caution on my part, being that sort of person&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has a sad record in regard to Knock and I would rather not knock him or Knock or anything right now.  Let us try to deal with the Bill.  If the Minister had a second chance he might not have been as unwise as he was in saying some of the things he said at the time.  Let us leave Knock. I am not mentioning Knock.  I will not mention Knock.  Is that not fair?  I will not mention it, but I do not approve of the way the Minister conducted himself over that issue.  Time will prove him wrong.  People in this House behaved as he behaved when Shannon Airport was getting off the ground.</P>

      <P>I am not going to say whether the Minister was misquoted or not.  I leave it to him.  He will have to get <Col N="1468" /> himself out of the tangle he got himself into over Knock.  Let us leave it at that.</P>
      <P>With regard to this discussion here this morning, it is very desirable that this facility be provided.  It will be very helpful. Those who are familiar with the very long delays that can take place in Kennedy Airport for people getting into the US know that these delays can be avoided.  It is worth while in this day and age to try to minimise delays where possible.  I hope the results will be seen very early on when this gets going.</P>
      <P>Is there some reason why we are having only a four month period, commencing I July and August, September and October? I appreciate that for this year we are doing tremendously well.  The Minister realises the co-operation he is getting from this side of the House.  Legislation presented for discussion on 6 June will be cleared in this House and in the other House so that it will be operable on and from 1 July, but why only four months? That intrigues me and I would like to hear the reason for it.</P>
      <P>Initial estimates were that preinspection could result in 100 extra landings at Shannon.  That is 25 extra landings a month, six extra landings a week, and I suppose I would be forgiven if I said approximately one a day.  We would have one extra landing in Shannon Airport per day or thereabouts according to the figures the Minister gave here this morning. Purely from an academic point of view, am I right in assuming that the landing fees for the type of aircraft we are talking about, 747 or perhaps slightly smaller, are £1,200, £1,500, £2,000 or thereabouts?  Is that the sort of fee we are talking about?  The Minister is not helping me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps my friend, Deputy Prendergast, can help me when the time comes.  He will, of course.  I am trying to work out what the landing fees are.  They are around the sort of figures I have mentioned.  Of course, additional <Col N="1469" /> benefits are to be gained in inflight catering, sales of fuel and sales of duty free goods which are all extremely important, and no doubt the additional traffic through the airport will help considerably in this area.  The Minister says Aer Rianta estimate that the additional revenue generated would more than compensate for the once off cost to Aer Rianta of providing the physical facilities required at Shannon for the preinspection facility.  I am glad that is so, because with the state of the economy at present we must be very careful how the taxpayer's money is being spent.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not really given us very much information on the running cost of this additional facility.  It would appear&mdash;I am open to correction here &mdash;that for the four month trial period the preinspection cost would be borne by the US Government but that on a permanent basis the cost would be borne by the Irish taxpayer directly or indirectly. We should know about this.  Under the permanent arrangement these costs would fall on Aer Rianta.  In accordance with the terms of the agreement, costs would be recouped by Aer Rianta from the participating airlines, and naturally that would lessen the load on the taxpayer. That is worth noting.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to deal with the problem about only Aer Lingus being in a position now to put some of their flights through preinspection.  I am glad they are helping and becoming involved and I hope they can become fully involved as early as possible.  I noted earlier in the newspapers that those who were opposed to this development were quick to point out&mdash;some of the papers went to town on it&mdash;that we were going to see Americans wearing Stetsons and high heeled boots and gunbelts with 45s protruding from them swaggering in John Wayne fashion around the mid west region, but I knew that was not true.  I am glad this is spelt out clearly by the Minister because this sort of opposition to a facility such as this is not worthy of those who genuinely oppose it for whatever reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill specifies the duties which the INS officials will be authorised <Col N="1470" /> to carry out while in the State.  Deputy Michael Ahern said here that they will not be involved in any security duties whatsoever.  This is important.  They will not be, because anything to do with security in this State rests solely with the Government and any security effort required in enforcement of law and order will be a matter for the Garda authorities here.  It is important that this be made known, they say, because of the scare-type tactics used.  As Deputy Ahern says, a demand will be made now on the Garda to provide additional members of the force to do what they have to do, to help out there, and perhaps additional Aer Rianta personnel will be there.  The trial period will clarify this and it would be too much to expect the Minister to know now what additional staff might be required for the extra aeroplane per day which is envisaged for the preinspection period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Article VII (5) states:</P>
      <P>where a passenger is refused passage onwards to the United States in accordance with Article V, arrange that the INS will immediately inform the Irish Immigration Service of the refusal and supply all data relevant to that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is extremely important because we must know what is going on.  I was also glad to learn that the US authorities have accepted&mdash;and it is written into the agreement&mdash;that any search of passengers by INS officials will have to be on a voluntary basis.  The Government and <Col N="1471" /> the Minister regard this as an important matter of principle.  Perhaps the Minister might let us know in a little more detail how people who present themselves for clearance in immigration and public health are asked to submit themselves to a voluntary search.  If they do not allow themselves to be voluntarily searched, what happens?  That has not been spelt out clearly.  As the Minister regards a voluntary submission for search by INS officials at Shannon Airport as an important point of principle, perhaps he could help us in regard to what is involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that when persons are refused the right to travel to the United States it may be necessary in some cases to keep them in detention until a suitable flight is arranged for them out of the country.  He said that it is not envisaged that the number of people who will be refused passage to the US will be large and that their numbers will not pose problems for our authorities.  He went to great pains to stress that no extra staff will be needed to deal with this category. I hope he is right and that nothing will happen in this area which will require the services of a large number of people at any time.  I do not know if there are sufficient facilities to hold people or whether the Garda have the capacity to accommodate those who might have to be held in detention.  This aspect will have to be examined.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and my only regret is that we did not provide a US customs clearance facility there also as this would have generated employment opportunities for people in the region.  Many of the thousands unemployed in the area would have welcomed it or indeed anything else that the Government and the Minister might do to help them to live and work at home.  We will be watching the progress made by this facility now being provided for immigration and public health preclearance at Shannon from 1 July.  We wish it every success and we thank those whose idea it was, especially people involved with the management of the airport and Aer Rianta, for their initiative in doing something <Col N="1472" /> worth while in trying to generate more traffic through the airport, helping further development and to cushion them against any losses which might occur as a result of circumstances over which they have no control.</P>

      <P>In welcoming the Bill and as the senior trade union official of the mid-west region of my own union and someone who has been involved with the negotiation of argreements at Shannon Airport, which would help to make the airport more competitive in a fiercely competitive industry, I know I am speaking on behalf of all the workers in the airport and in the region.  It should be remembered that Shannon is a national and not just a regional asset.</P>
      <P>As President of the Limerick Council of Trade Unions in the early seventies, I remember leading deputations to the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Brian Lenihan, when the American airlines, under the CAB, were putting tremendous pressure on the Irish Government to overfly Shannon when going to Dublin.  I sympathised with the Minister and the Government at that time for having to yield to the industrial muscle of the Civil Aeronautics Board in America and having to allow the overfly. In spite of that, it should never be forgotten, especially by people in this part of the country, that the tourist industry, of which Shannon Airport is the lynchpin of the west, is different from that of most other countries in Europe because in other countries the tendency is to visit the capitals first, Vienna, Paris and London, and then to visit the rest of the country concerned.  There is a marked distinction in that regard in Ireland, where four out of five Americans landing tour the west first in spite of the fact that they have the right to overfly Shannon.  Sometimes, unfortunately, they overfly Dublin and go on to London, perhaps they think London is the capital of Ireland.  At any rate, it is a disturbing feature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to be associated with the <Col N="1473" /> tributes paid to people who are patriots of international standing.  I refer to Brendan O'Regan, Paul Quigley and others who had the vision, courage, guts and tenacity to provide an asset like Shannon.  I am not an old man, but I remember cycling out past Bunratty in the early fifties when there was only a skeleton of a castle there.  The people of Limerick used to cycle out to shoot duck where there is an airport now; it was one of the great hunting areas in Ireland at that time. The young people between Limerick and Shannon Airport had all gone to Dublin to join the Civil Service or the Garda because there was no employment there. SFADCo transformed the whole scene.</P>
    <P>At Dublin Airport yesterday week I was involved in a farewell party for the Chinese Foreign Minister.  He paid tribute to what was happening in the mid-west region.  He was not invited by our Foreign Affairs people, but asked himself, to go the mid-west region to see what was happening there and was tremendously impressed with the duty-free concept as it was operated and, indeed, pioneered at Shannon, and with the folk park there.  Obviously the Chinese think this is a very good idea.  So here we have the Foreign Minister of one of the foremost major powers paying tribute to some of the ideas which emerged from the Shannon development company in the mid-west region.  It is very interesting to hear that kind of comment in the context of what was said by the Minister for Tourism here last night looking for more innovative ideas to promote tourism.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it should not be forgotten that Shannon Airport generates about £50 million a year, approximately £1 million a week.  It is a huge lynchpin for the entire mid-west.  That is why I say the workers in Shannon Airport will welcome this with open arms.  Under the International Air Transport Authority regulations, Shannon Airport are now imposing a code of limitations on all airlines where there must be daylight landing. There is a natural fluctuation in the usage of Shannon by foreign airports and there are very good peak periods during the summer.  This must be the reason for <Col N="1474" /> the four month trial period.  It will be tested at its busiest.</P>
    <P>It must be pointed out that it was Aer Rianta, the local airport people there, who looked for that concession at the very start, not the Americans.  We in this region were pushing for that because it will have a huge spin-off effect which people do not realise.  We are talking about the main kitchen at Shannon, the flight kitchen, the duty-free shops, mail order, the commissary agents.</P>
    <P>I am the trade union official who negotiated the redundancies in January 1984 when Pan Am pulled out and two years later when TWA made junior assistant flight dispatchers redundant.  I know the trauma that not only the employees but the airport suffer when these airlines pull out.  We are delighted to have them back because there is a huge spin-off not only for the airport but for the farmers in the region supplying meat, eggs, milk and butter to the flight kitchen, and to the guesthouses and the hotels.  People should remember that when talking about what we are discussing here this morning.</P>
    <P>Basically it is proposed that the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service are to establish a US entry preinspection facility at Shannon on 1 July of this year for an experimental four month period with voluntary participation and without charge to any carrier.  At the end of that time the situation will be reviewed with all the parties concerned and the establishment of a permanent US entry preinspection facility at Shannon or its discontinuance will be decided.  We looked for that but, for choice, the INS would want this facility at a major traffic generating area like London or Frankfurt as they consider preinspection provides a prime security element, an easement to the intolerable congestion, particularly for non-US passport holders, at major US airports.</P>
    <P>We are all familiar with stories of the stacking up situation at Kennedy Airport and other US airports where planes are flying around and using up fuel, unable to get in because of these delays.  If that problem is exported back here to us it <Col N="1475" /> means more money for us and additional work and we should welcome that.  The major European airports have no enthusiasm whatever for preclearance and preinspections because they read it as the exportation of a US domestic problem.  The INS for their part are only too glad to accept an invitation to establish on a trial basis at Shannon what they see as a foothold in Europe which they will operate with specially handpicked officers and whatever strength is necessary to make it a European showpiece.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta are backing the experiment because they see it as a prerequisite to full US entry preclearance which would enhance Shannon's potential in attracting additional traffic.  Aer Rianta also realise that had London, Paris or Frankfurt housed this experiment, Shannon would never figure in this scheme.  A prerequisite to the success of the venture is participation by the four scheduled trans-Atlantic carriers, Pan Am, Delta, North-West and Aer Lingus.  Some of these are using them fully or on a part-time basis and I hope that, in time if this experiment works well, it will induce all the major airlines and the flight carriers coming in here to use that facility.  The INS, with the support of the US Department of Transportation, the Irish Department of Communications and Aer Rianta have jointly participated in the establishment of the experiment which will have the protection of an intergovernmental bilateral agreement.</P>
    <P>What we are saying is that Shannon Airport will be the first in Europe to introduce these new procedures sponsored by Aer Rianta and Irish airports to facilitate airlines and passengers on nonstop flights to the USA.  These procedures do not include customs inspection and, like Deputy Collins, the Fianna Fáil spokesman, I hope that in time we will have customs preclearance because that will mean even more valuable employment for people in the Shannon region. At Shannon the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service will inspect passengers documentation such as passports, visas and so on to ensure compliance <Col N="1476" /> with the immigration and public health regulations for entry to the United States and Canada.  There will be no more queueing for immigration clearance in America itself which can sometimes take over two hours at major US airports.  It will make easier onward flight connections for our own people and anybody else using our airline to go to America, and the business travellers with carry-on baggage only can bypass immigration in the USA on arrival and go straight to customs.</P>
    <P>This is, on the face of it, an excellent idea.  Preinspection at Shannon is seen, especially by Aer Rianta and our own people here, as a means of tapping a substantial technical transit market from which it was heretofore excluded.  I am talking about technical landings or chartered flights to US non-entry destinations and technical landings of long haul scheduled flights requiring enroute fuel stops. There were very few people at Shannon who held FAA air licences as good as in Europe.  I would see an increased demand for people with that qualification to handle that situation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the whole thrust of the Bill. It is in keeping with the good work done by all the agencies and, in particular, by Aer Rianta in this context.  I wish to compliment people like their chief executive, Mr. Michael Guerin, from the technical point of view and from the administrative point of view, Mr. Liam Skelly.  Since Aer Rianta took over responsibility there, these men have shown the imagination and technical expertise which this country very badly needs.  I am saying, as a member of the Labour Party who supports the development and extension of public sector enterprise, that in Aer Rianta one has a showpiece of what a semi-State body should be.  We have there people who are able to negotiate in Moscow very tough technical details on the provision of flight facilities, fuel farms and so forth.</P>
    <P>I have read in the newspapers comments by some of our colleagues expressing reservations about this whole idea and I hope there will be no opposition to this concept.  The Labour Party stand <Col N="1477" /> implacably opposed to any intrusion or infringement of our national sovereignty and always have.  That is axiomatic and does not need any great emphasis; I am merely putting it on the record.  I think I am right in saying that that also is the policy of every registered political party here.  I hope that any opposition will not be churlish, juvenile, or questionable but that there will be good technical reasons for it.  We are living in an age when there are such unfortunate developments as spy satellites which some of the major powers could put over a city to tap telephone calls 300 miles down, tell what one was eating for dinner and pick up conversations. This is what is happening today, 6 June 1986.</P>
    <P>If having a handful of immigration officers in the country, should be seen as an invasion, or infringement of, or intrusion into our national sovereignty, I would regard that as a highly questionable reason for opposition.  I say that with conviction and equanimity and for the following reason &mdash; and the newspapers here will bear out what I am saying.  When the proposal was put forward to extend facilities to Aeroflot, the late Mr. Constantine FitzGibbon, a member of a distinguished County Clare family &mdash; they produced a very notorious Lord Chancellor for this country towards the end of the eighteenth century &mdash; and a self admitted former member of M15, opposed the idea of Aeroflot landing in this country.  He drew a most dreadful scenario of invasion by the KGB all over the place.  I was the only person that I know of who at that time publicly debated that matter with him, contradicted him and supported the idea of the extension of facilities at Shannon to that major world airline, Aeroflot. I am thankful that we had the good wit and commonsense to allow this.  Aeroflot have been an invaluable asset to the economy of Shannon Airport.  Over the last six or seven years the sight of Russian flight crews walking around Limerick City has been very pleasant.  They are part of the Limerick scene and make a very valuable contribution to that city's economy.  I am sorry that they have decided in recent years to pull out of <Col N="1478" /> Limerick and erect a special building for themselves in Shannon Airport.  We might not see them around so often from now on.</P>

      <P>We are very glad to have them in Limerick.  I do not see anything sinister in extending this facility to the Americans.  The more we can do to build up Shannon, especially over the winter period, the better.  It must be remembered that there have been several very good schemes.  This is one of the major flight training airports in the world because, I believe, it is the most fog-free airport in the world, which is a very useful and beneficial asset to the economy of the region which depends on a good many training planes using it, as anybody living in that region will see.  On behalf of the workers of Shannon, I welcome this whole concept and express the hope that any difficulties which may arise will be successfully dealt with.  People might come in who would not be acceptable to the American authorities and it should be made quite clear that it is the American authorities who would be rejecting these people for their own particular reasons; it would not be the Irish Government.</P>
      <P>I wish to pay tribute to the Airport Police Force in Shannon Airport.  They are one of the most diligent and vigilant airport security forces in the world.  They have proved this from time to time when people with questionable backgrounds were passing through Shannon and were very quickly picked up by them and the Special Branch people down there.  I commend the APF and the Garda Síochána authorities at Shannon for their viligance.</P>
      <P>We should be given credit for being a mature nation, competent to deal with our own affairs.  We need not be looking for bogeymen, whether they come from Russia or from the United States.  We are well able to handle that kind of situation. Again, I support the Bill, wish it every success and commend it to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am glad to support this Bill and am pleased to see it brought forward.  However, it is a matter of great regret that it is as late as the middle of 1986 that we see this Bill.  The possibility was there as far back as 1981 and 1982 of having facilities of this kind introduced at Shannon Airport, but they were blocked at that time and the House would do well to contemplate why they were blocked and by whom.  If the Irish authorities had not given in at that time to internal pressure in Ireland, we would not be discussing the rather limited facilities contained in this Bill simply of clearance of immigration.  We would also be discussing the whole question of clearance for customs.  In terms of the employment which would be given at Shannon, it would be very considerably more important than what we are talking about now.  It is great to hear speaker after speaker pay tribute to everybody when we are producing something which is about five years behind its time and is about half of what it should be.  Those of us who would have wished to have seen this development five years ago were perhaps a little ahead of our time.  We were told that we were anti-national and anti-Aer Lingus because we wanted this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was interesting to hear Deputy Prendergast quoting, without acknowledging the source, a letter dated 30 May from Mr. Michael Guerin, Deputy General Manager of Aer Rianta at Shannon.  The Deputy quoted the letter verbatim until he came to the reference to the fact that Aer Lingus would not take part fully in this scheme.  At that juncture he stopped quoting and skipped over the next number of lines.  We should place some emphasis on this aspect of the matter today.  The excuse given in 1981 and 1982 for the non-introduction of full preclearance of both immigration and customs at that time was that Aer Lingus were implacably opposed to it, saying that it would cause delays because the baggage of the relatively small number of passengers whom they bring from Dublin would have to be unloaded from the plane at Shannon, inspected and put back again. They may or may not have had a point; <Col N="1480" /> it would perhaps have been a little inconvenient for them.  If you balance the national interest and the overall value to the economy at large it was obviously the thing to do.  Even if you admitted that they had a point to some degree, they have no point now.  There is no question of customs and, therefore, there is no question of baggage being taken off and, therefore, there is no question of delays.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to ask why various American airlines are prepared to co-operate with this scheme and anxious to avail of it, when Aer Lingus are not.  A direction should be given to Aer Lingus that it is in the national interest that they should co-operate.  They are being very unfair in the policy they are pursuing to their staff in Shannon.  If this idea is to take off, the work that will be generated by the additional flights that will come in for preclearance at Shannon will go to Aer Lingus employees in Shannon.  They are the chief, if not the only, handling agents in Shannon at present.  It is wrong that potential additional business is being lost because Aer Lingus are not prepared to avail of it.  Any foreign airline looking at the possibility of whether or not to use this facility at Shannon are entitled to take the view that it must not be attractive if the Irish State-owned airline will only grudgingly use the facility on a limited and selective basis.  That is not good enough. Aer Lingus have a duty to this country which they should fulfil by using this facility for the benefit of their own passengers in order that their passengers will not be held up for two hours or more at Kennedy Airport in New York as happens frequently. Unfortunately, this seems to arise from an anti-Shannon bias which exists and has existed for so long.</P>
    <P>It is worth drawing the attention of the House to a phrase in the Minister's speech.  He says that officers of the United States Immigration and Naturalisation Service would conduct in Ireland, at Shannon in the first instance, inspection of passengers and aircraft crew required by the US laws.  Is it proposed to have this elsewhere and, if so, why? What the Minister said is borne out by <Col N="1481" /> Article IV of the agreement in the Schedule to the Bill where it says:</P>
    <P>Preinspection may be conducted at additional locations in Ireland by agreement, expressed in writing, of both Governments.</P>
    <P>Why should it be held anywhere else other than Shannon?  Has it to do with the proposal which I regard as rather dubious in terms of public expenditure of a new runway at Dublin?  For what purpose other than trans-Atlantic flights is that proposed runway required at a cost of £30 million?  That proposal has been made for ten or 15 years and it never came to fruition.  I do not see the operation of Dublin Airport being adversely affected by the absence of a very long runway that could take fully laden trans-Atlantic flights.  We are entitled to ask why that should be the case. The context of Article IV of this draft agreement seems to suggest that, as soon as the runway is provided, these facilities will be provided in Dublin.  We have a tendency at official level to think that everything must happen in Dublin and, if it is not happening in Dublin, it is not happening at all.</P>
    <P>This is the time for tributes.  It is well worth recognising the change that has come about in Aer Rianta in the past three or four years in particular.  I will not say why that has happened, but I am glad to acknowledge that it has.  It is great to see the more aggressive frame of mind in which senior Aer Rianta staff, both in head office and in Shannon, are prepared to go out and market aggressively.  I wish that attitude of mind would be copied in some other semi-State areas also rather than the defensive mentality that is so predominant but which, I hope, will be changed by outside activities.</P>
    <P>In view of the Minister's description of the immigration facilities at Shannon and what the Irish immigration officers would have to do if US officials refused entry to somebody in transit.  I want to make reference to what is happening in Shannon in relation to people who are being refused entry to this country even on the basis of refuge or political asylum. <Col N="1482" /> Commercially, it may not be the wisest thing to say, but a time comes when other considerations must be of greater importance than our mere commercial wellbeing. It is disturbing to see that in Shannon every year since the advent of Aeroflot, 15 or 20 people are refused refuge or political asylum in Ireland when they ask for it in transit between Cuba and Havana at one end and Moscow at the other.</P>
    <P>I shudder to think what happens to those unfortunate people who declare their hand by asking the Irish authorities for political asylum at Shannon and are refused it when they get to Havana or Moscow and where and how they end up. We should have a more open and more compassionate attitude to people like that who take the tremendous risk of applying to the Irish authorities for refuge.  It worries me and many people that very few such applicants are allowed to depart from one of these Aeroflot flights at Shannon.  There should not be regular refusals simply on the basis that the airline concerned would prefer it that way.  We are dealing with human liberty and human life.  The fullest consideration should be given to those people.  They should be interviewed away from the airport and from the influence of any officials of their own nationality.</P>
    <P>I do not see any major difficulties in the operation of this proposal.  It has been in operation for many years in Canadian airports, particularly in Toronto and Montreal and also in Bermuda.  I went through it on a number of occasions and there is no difficulty whatever.  None of the authorities of the countries concerned have had any reservations of which I am aware about the operation of these schemes over a long period of years.  Of course, they have also operated customs clearance.  We should press rapidly for the introduction of customs clearance here.  We should make it clear that Shannon is the only airport in the country and indeed in Europe in which it will be operated.  It can be enormously beneficial particularly at a time when there are clearly severe difficulties in terms of American tourists coming to Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1483" /> I do not know whether there is any value in our saying very much about this but the hysteria in the United States in regard to alleged terrorism in Europe is really laughable.  It shows the influence of media coverage of a couple of small isolated events where a mere handful of people unfortunately lost their lives but which were regarded as some kind of major affront on the sovereignty of the United States because of the way they were portrayed there.  That is quite unrealistic and unfairly damaging to many European countries, not least our own.  I can think of many countries in Europe who have had to live with the problem of terrorism and which have had to suffer considerable losses of life among their own citizens, out of all proportion to the very minor losses suffered by the United States.  I would hope that on calmer reflection people in the United States and particularly the authorities there would see things more realistically, realise the times we live in and not generate the level of hysteria which unhappily has been generated in the early part of this year.  It is sad that that should be happening at the very time this proposed scheme or system is coming in.  I hope it will not be used as an excuse for not extending this system after the four month experiment expires at the end of October because the additional flights and revenue which would have been generated by this system will be much less than they would in the normal way.  If this were done in a normal year the benefits would be very obvious and speedy.</P>
    <P>One of the first things which will have to be done is to ensure that Aer Lingus use this system fully and without any reservations.  If they are not prepared to do so off their own bat they should be given a direction to that effect.  It is very much in our overall national interest that it should happen.  I hope they will see fit to do so and that if they do not, they will be given a direction to that effect.</P>
    <P>The fact that this is coming in four or five years after it should have happened and at only 50 per cent of the extent it should be happening is a matter of regret. <Col N="1484" /> This reflects the extraordinary slowness with which Irish official bodies move and the incredible caution with which they operate.  It is only fair to ask, in conclusion, how many flights have we lost in the past five years because we did not do this in 1981 or 1982?  How much money has been lost and how much employment has been lost as a result?  What have we gained from the selfishness which was exhibited at that time?  I would hope that if we take these factors into account that this agreement very rapidly after the end of October will be amended and extended greatly to enable it to be made permanent and extended to customs clearance also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity of welcoming this Bill.  It is a Bill which is good for Shannon and the country.  Like Deputy O'Malley, I would like to dwell on the points raised by the Minister at the outset of his speech where he referred in a subtle fashion to total preclearance.  When that was discussed in 1981 the Minister stated it was not proceeded with because of Aer Lingus's concern about the delays which could arise in their service to the United States due to the necessity to off-load baggage at Shannon in order to process it through customs.  In a later part of his speech the Minister referred to the fact that the major US companies flying through Shannon will fully avail of the proposed preclearance while Aer Lingus will only partially avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be remiss of me as a Deputy for County Clare if I were not to bring the attention of the House to the fact that the attitude of Aer Lingus to Shannon leaves much to be desired.  The attitude they are showing at this point in relation to preclearance is again indicative of their attitude to Shannon.  The Minister would do well to look back at the history of Aer Lingus at Shannon.  Aer Lingus as a company are being unfair to Shannon and to their employees there.  I would wish that Aer Lingus, like Aer Rianta, would show the same degree of dynamism, courage and hard business like approach in pursuing business and taking up challenges. Unlike Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus are <Col N="1485" /> not prepared to take up challenges and pursue new avenues or show courage. Aer Lingus are entrenched in a cossetted position.  They have been cossetted over the years by many Governments and by the Irish taxpayer.  There is a duty on them now to avail fully of the facility being provided at Shannon and to encourage their passengers and anyone else they can to also avail of that facility.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on the Government that if Aer Lingus do not show full goodwill towards this facility, they be directed as a semi-State body to go ahead and fully partake.  There is an onus on the Government to ensure that that is done. Aer Lingus's entire attitude is absolutely appalling and always has been.  This is just another little factor in the long history of their attitude to Shannon and the mid-west region.  One has to ask why North-west Orient, Pan Am and Delta are prepared to fully participate in preclearance while Aer Lingus will only partially participate on selected flights?  This is a question that needs to be clarified and must be answered.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I would like to compliment the Minister for bringing this Bill before the House.  This Bill is good for Shannon.  It will induce and encourage more traffic through Shannon.  As a result, there will be an offshoot of business in the duty free shop, in the flight and regular kitchens and in employment in the Shannon region.  I hope that this four month experiment will be a forerunner of a very successful venture which will eventually turn into full preclearance that will include customs preclearance. There is an onus on the Department to pursue full preclearance including customs preclearance once this has got off to a good start.  I have every confidence that it will get off to a very good start because it has the goodwill of the American airlines and authorities and of the Department of Communications and Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to compliment the local management of Aer Rianta at Shannon, to compliment Mr. Liam Skelly and Mr. Michael Guerin on the consistent manner in which they <Col N="1486" /> have pursued this matter over a long period.  Despite its being rejected initially, they pursued it to a successful conclusion. I am glad also that the Minister dealt in his introductory remarks with the questions which arose in relation to sovereignty and law enforcement because there were many such questions raised in public debate beforehand. Therefore it is good that the Minister has clarified the position.  I am glad to note also that the immunities that will be granted to US officials operating in Shannon will apply to them only in the course of their duties at the preinspection facility, that they will not be afforded the wider diplomatic immunity of Department of Foreign Affairs officials. That is most important.</P>
    <P>The agreement that has been drafted between the Irish and US Governments is a very tight one leaving nobody in any doubt about any infringement of our sovereignty.  I am particularly happy about that aspect.  There had been some fears about the manner in which officials would conduct their business at Shannon. For example, there was a serious question raised as to whether they would be armed.  It is good to know that it has been clarified that they will not be armed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the Bill and feel its provisions will prove of tremendous benefit to Shannon, will encourage more flights through Shannon, resulting in more business and employment. Indeed, I might compliment the Minister for having consistently promoted Shannon over this term of office. Within his term of office it could be said that Shannon has gone from strength to strength, although I know that has come about as a result of a combination of factors, including the goodwill of the Department of Communications and expert management on the part of Aer Rianta at Shannon.  All the other semi-State bodies would do well to look to Shannon for example, noting how the personnel of Aer Rianta operate there, their dedication and the personal interest they take in their work.</P>

      <P>I oppose this Bill, <Col N="1487" /> an opposition which I hope will not be regarded as churlish, juvenile or anti-American. As far as I am concerned, my opposition is based on a fundamental principle, that is, the sovereignty of the State and the right of Government here to be totally responsible for law enforcement within the State.  As far as I am aware, this is the first time we have had a Bill before us whose provisions permit another State to have its officers enforce law of any kind on our territory.  I want to make it clear that I would be opposed to this arrangement, whether it be to provide preinspection for the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, the United States or any other country seeking that kind of facility.</P>
      <P>I should make it clear also that I recognise the importance of maintaining and developing Shannon Airport, in particular its importance to the Limerick/Clare area.  I would support any reasonable proposal that that area and Shannon Airport be developed.  However having read through the proposed agreement and the Minister's introductory remarks, I have been unable to overcome my reservations about the provisions of this Bill.  It strikes me as extraordinary that while the question of sovereignty has been referred to by a number of Deputies, including the Minister, the Minister has been the only Member who has acknowledged that our sovereignty is being intruded on by the provisions of this Bill.  Indeed, probably it would not be necessary to have such a Bill introduced at all if that was not the case.  The Fianna Fáil Party have said that as far as they are concerned sovereignty is not affected.  Deputy Prendergast has said that as far as he is concerned sovereignty is not affected, as has been said by another Deputy whose name escapes me for the moment.</P>
      <P>In the course of his introductory remarks the Minister drew the attention of the House to two aspects of the Bill and the draft agreement.  They relate, he said, to the questions of national sovereignty and law enforcement.  The Minister continued to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1488" /> The exercise by a sovereign power of jurisdiction on Irish soil is obviously a matter of concern in principle and in practice.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister continued to outline how he felt the draft agreement had been drafted as tightly as possible in order to limit that intrusion on Irish sovereignty. For example, he cited Articles IX, V and VI, paragraph (4), which, he pointed out, had been drafted as restrictively and as tightly as possible.  He had earlier indicated that the provisions of the draft agreement which could be held to touch on our sovereignty are those articles, because they deal with law enforcement and so on.  Quite frankly, I am surprised that other Deputies have not teased out this issue to a greater extent.  For example, I am more than surprised that the Fianna Fáil and Labour Party spokespersons, who have already contributed to the debate, have not questioned the Minister in regard to that aspect.</P>
    <P>I should make it quite clear that my opposition is not anti-American.  The attacks lauched on American people by terrorists of whatever hue have been condemned by me as often as by any other Member of this House.  Like many other people in this country, I have relatives in the United States, some of whom have been there for generations.  Therefore, there is no connection whatsoever between my opposition to American foreign policy and my attitude to the people of the United States.  I have the greatest regard for the people of the United States.  They are welcome to come to Ireland at any time and as often as they can afford.  I should like to be able to afford to visit the United States very often.  I do not happen to be in that happy position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if that would help.  Perhaps if I had a pension it might help.  I want to make it absolutely clear that it has nothing at all to do with the fact that this facility is being afforded <Col N="1489" /> the United States in particular.  I am concerned that law officers of another state are being given powers to operate within our State.</P>
      <P>The point has been made that this constitutes a good development and will provide greater commercial development and security of employment in the Shannon area.  That contention has yet to be proved.  Nobody has provided us with an estimate of the costs involved in the provision of this facility.  No one has given an estimate of the amount of income which this arrangement will generate.  In his speech the Minister admitted that recent events and attacks on US citizens &mdash; and Deputy O'Malley referred to the hysteria in the US about terrorism in Europe &mdash; would affect the number of flights coming into this country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins said it might work out at one flight per day.  What evidence is there to suggest that all these jobs will be created or that all the funding which has been claimed for it will be generated? Even if there was evidence to show this, we must ask if any part of our sovereignty is for sale.  To what extent are we prepared to permit our sovereignty to be intruded upon, which was the term used in the House.  It could be argued that we could offer the US, or for the sake of balance the Soviet Union, an area on which to establish a military base.  That would also create significant jobs and generate revenue but quite clearly the vast majority of people would oppose such a proposal despite the number of jobs which might be created and the income which it might generate simply because it would be contrary to our declared position as a neutral State which guards and respects its sovereignty.  What price do we put on our sovereignty?  I would argue we could not put a price on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immigration staff will be granted privileges which are not specified in the Bill. It will be done by way of agreement between the Governments.  I understand notes will be exchanged.  The Minister referred to these privileges and said they would be mainly in relation to taxation, <Col N="1490" /> change of residence and so on.  What other kind of privilege has he in mind?</P>
    <P>The staff will have immunity from civil and criminal proceedings arising from their duties.  It is to be welcomed that they do not have a wider degree of immunity. However, it seems strange, and the Minister should explain the reason why any immunity is given to the staff involved. What is the basis for it?  The only people who enjoy such immunity here are diplomatic staff.  Clearly the INS staff will not be diplomatic staff but law enforcement agents.  Why does the Minister think this kind of immunity should be given to them?</P>
    <P>If people are refused permission to fly to the US, or if they are deemed to be a health hazard, the INS staff can seek to have them examined and isolated by the Irish authorities.  My reading of the agreement is that any costs incurred prior to the person being refused will be met by the US authorities, but any costs incurred after they have been refused will be met by the Irish authorities.  How will that work?  To what extent will we be liable for a person who may be very seriously ill and who seeks entry to the US?</P>
    <P>Article 6 (1) of the agreement states that the INS will determine procedures in accordance with their own regulations. What exactly is involved in these procedures? What kind of regulations govern them?  According to the agreement, where a person is refused permission to fly onwards by the INS, Irish law enforcement agents, be they the gardaí or the airport police, will be called on to assist in enforcing that decision.  Can the gardaí refuse to comply with that request?  At present if the gardaí or airport police consider that a person is guilty of an offence at an airport they deal with the case.  They determine whether, in their opinion, the person has committed an offence.  Will the gardaí or the airport police have any option but to agree to the request by the INS officials in relation to what is to be done with a person whom the INS staff have refused permission to fly on to the US?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that the staff concerned will not be armed <Col N="1491" /> and that that was never intended.  I take it that is a categorical assurance that they will not be armed.  On 18 December I made a statement in the House, following publication of the Bill, I was concerned that the practice would be followed in Ireland and that those people would be armed as they are in the Bahamas.  In expressing my concern I was conscious of the experiences we had during the visit of the President of the US some years ago when, to say the least of it, some of the security staff accompanying him were not very pleasant.  They caused considerable concern among many ordinary decent Irish citizens.  I welcome the Minister's assurance and I accept that those officials will not now or ever be armed in pursuit of this agreement.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that we sought this preinspection procedure and I have no doubt that the Minister is correct in saying that we did seek it.  To take that at its face value is to ignore the fact that for some considerable time the US has been seeking a location in Europe for this preinspection procedure.  It is clear, as Deputy Prendergast said, that a considerable number of major European airports refused to permit the preinspection procedure. They considered that it would be transferring problems at US airports to their airports.  That is a real fear.  In my view it is a fear that Aer Lingus have.</P>
    <P>Last week I had a meeting with Aer Rianta staff but I have not had any contact with Aer Lingus staff although I am sure it must be of great concern to them that this preinspection procedure, which may be extended to a customs clearance procedure, may cause them considerable delays in their flights.  Many Deputies who have criticised the reluctance of Aer Lingus to welcome the preinspection procedure put the attitude of the company down to a type of ingrained anti-Shannon bias.  I cannot see how Aer Lingus, if they saw this as a commercially viable proposition, would be opposing this measure or be reluctant to accept it.  That would not make sense.  I do not accept that Aer Lingus, one of our most successful <Col N="1492" /> semi-State companies, would adopt such a churlish attitude, a phrase used by another Member.  If they adopted that attitude they would be acting in a juvenile fashion.  I do not accept that the executive of Aer Lingus would adopt such an attitude. They could not have been as successful as they have been if they adopted that attitude to business.  It would not work.</P>
    <P>It is my view that Aer Lingus are concerned about the delays that may result when the preinspection facility is introduced. The company will lose revenue as a result of flight delays.  Deputy Collins said that, if Aer Lingus were concerned about baggage delays and custom clearance delays, the flights should leave Dublin Airport half an hour earlier with passengers spending an half hour extra at Shannon.  The Deputy admitted, as I do, that he did not know much about the operations of airlines but it seems to me that having a number of huge airlines idle on the tarmac for an extra half hour, or longer, could be costly for Aer Lingus and other airline companies.  I am sure that is the reason why Aer Lingus are reluctant to support the new procedure.</P>
    <P>My reasons for opposing the Bill are genuinely held.  I am aware that many people outside the House, including some of the staff of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta, are not very happy with this move.  Deputy Prendergast told the House that he spoke for all the workers at Shannon when supporting this measure 100 per cent but I am aware of a number of people in those companies who do not support it.  Without getting involved in the numbers game, I do no think it is right to make a bland all encompassing statement that one represents the views of all workers in a particular area.  That is not possible.  I am aware of a number of workers who are concerned about the political issues that I have raised and question the benefits alleged to result from this.  I hope the Minister will respond to the questions I have raised in the course of my contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members who <Col N="1493" /> have contributed, I support the Bill and compliment the Minister, and his officials, on bringing it forward.  It is right that initiatives of this type should be acknowledged in the House.  I should like to be associated with those who have applauded the work of the Minister and Aer Rianta officials in regard to this measure.  As a Deputy for the area, I do not think Ireland's sovereignty will be interfered with.  The draft agreement is an indication of how countries can benefit from co-operation.  I accept the Minister's statement that the agreement has been drafted as tightly as possible.  It must be remembered that the proposal has been under consideration for some time and it is to the credit of the former board of directors of Aer Rianta, which included a Clareman, Mr. Jack Daly, that they pursued this matter to a favourable conclusion.  The Deputies from the area also helped.</P>
      <P>I could not decry co-operation.  Other Members have referred to problems at Shannon in regard to dealing with aliens and those seeking immunity here.  Scare tactics are being adopted by some people. The procedure in regard to aliens, which is operated by the Department of Justice, is very helpful.  The Department do not rely totally on their own resources.  As far as I am aware.  the Department of Justice consult with international bodies who deal with immigration and refugees, and the advice of the Department is sought before any determination is made. People who have sought asylum at Shannon have been in the area for ten or 12 days.  Outside advice is taken in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not share the fear expressed by Deputy O'Malley about the experience at Shannon in dealing with all international airlines.  Aer Rianta are a very powerful body with a wealth of experience and when this Act is put into operation they will prove to be very effective in administering it.  The question is whether the amount of traffic which will be generated from southern Europe and elsewhere will be sufficient to keep the clearance scheme in operation.  I hope it will.  I would not have any fear if the utilisation <Col N="1494" /> is slow in the first period because there are always teething problems in such new facilities.  Thereafter, the Minister might consider extending this agreement, with the co-operation of the US, of course, for a full year rather than four months.</P>
    <P>As far as our national airline and their use of Shannon are concerned, I have been happy that Aer Lingus have been using the airport as the principal international west bound airport.  I hope the Minister will ensure that Shannon will be continuously used as the gateway to the US.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus are entitled to be cautious about this new facility and, if they want to use it on a selective basis they are entitled to do so.  We harangue semi-State bodies about their financial peformances, and Aer Lingus have been losing substantially on the US route because they have to compete in valley periods of traffic across the Atlantic.  Aer Lingus have shown an interest in Shannon and this year they propose to construct substantial warehousing facilities there and they are badly needed.  The employment which will be generated and the facility provided will be of great benefit to industry and to employment in the mid-west.  The Government have indicated that Aer Lingus will take a greater interest at Shannon by the appointment of a Clareman, Mr. Martin Lynch.  I am sure Aer Lingus will take cognisance of all that is being said here today, but they should not be browbeaten into making an irrevocable decision on this agreement.  I have full confidence in them and I am sure they will make the necessary adjustments so that they can use this facility fully.</P>
    <P>The whole idea has the support of Aer Rianta and I should like to be associated with the tributes paid to them for their initiative.  They have been providing cheaper fuel for international airlines since this Government came to power.  I commend them for the way in which they made an agreement with Aeroflot for fuel facilities at Shannon and for the way they have negotiated further agreements with oil companies to provide fuel at competitive prices for airlines.  Aer Rianta will <Col N="1495" /> maintain Shannon as a high priority airport. This Bill will provide increased transit traffic through Shannon which is badly needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much that the Opposition spokesman, Deputy Wilson, could not be present because of illness.  I appreciate the co-operation of the House in agreeing to give me all Stages of the Bill today.  I hope Deputy Wilson will be back quickly.  I appreciate the interest of Deputies and their comments and I hope I can deal with many of the points raised.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal first with the questioning contribution of Deputy De Rossa. He expressed concern at the possible encroachment on Irish sovereignty provided for in the Bill.  I accept his concern as genuine and not in any way motivated by feelings of hostility to the US.  There is no doubt that the provisions of the Bill will cede a little bit of Irish sovereignty, but it is a very small bit and it is for a very good reason.  I hope that the small encroachment will turn out to yield considerable dividends for Shannon and Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exercise by a sovereign power of jurisdiction on Irish soil is a matter of concern in principle and practice.  Article I (1) of the agreement defines preinspection as the procedure whereby the INS will conduct in Ireland the inspection of passengers and aircraft crew required by US Immigration and Public Health laws and regulations for entry into the US. Article V links the powers of INS officials with the same laws and regulations. Those provisions, which could be held to touch on Irish sovereignty, for example, immunity for US Government employees, Article XI, enforcement, Article VI (4), and powers, Article V, as I said at the outset, have been drafted as restrictively and tightly as possible.  In addition, by imposing obligations on the US to consult with and/or seek agreement with the Irish authorities in relation to a number of important operational aspects of preinspection, the agreement provides an <Col N="1496" /> important aspect of control by the Irish authorities.</P>
    <P>Article VI (2) of the agreement obliges the US to seek the agreement of the competent Irish authority in relation to preinspection facilities.  Similarly, the agreement of the Irish authority to the communications and inspection aids and to the equipment necessary for preinspection is a requirement under Article VI (3).  Agreement on the number of INS officials to be assigned to preinspection duties is required under Article VII (1). Article VII (3) imposes an obligation on the US to consult with the competent Irish authority on matters relating to the implementation of the agreement while Article VII (5) provides that the INS shall immediately inform the Irish Immigration Service of any refusal of passage onwards to the US and supply the latter with all data relevant to that decision.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that in so far as there is any ceding of sovereignty it is still under very strict control by Ireland, and I do not think there need be any worry about that.  I have had the opportunity of witnessing how this same kind of arrangement operates in Canada in respect of the US.  As I said earlier, it also operates in Bermuda and the Bahamas.  Certainly, in Canada it is of great advantage to the Canadian airports concerned.</P>
    <P>There have been comments during the debate about other European countries not wanting this facility.  Many European countries would like to have preinspection facilities and the fact that we are the first to have obtained them is an achievement worth recognising.  As Deputy O'Malley and others have said, this matter has been on the agenda for some years not only in respect of this country but of several other European countries. Unfortunately, the matter got bogged down because under the preinspection title a number of different areas were being considered.  Two of those areas are now covered in this Bill, namely, health preclearance and immigration preclearance. There is also agricultural preclearance and customs preclearance.  The customs preclearance in particular has caused many problems and probably <Col N="1497" /> has contributed to much of the delay in making progress on the matter in Europe.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies asked why we have not provided for customs preclearance and one or two Deputies implied that blame for this should lie with Aer Lingus.  That is not the case.  The customs question is one of the principal reasons the matter has been delayed in Europe as a whole. Customs preclearance would need extensive additional physical facilities, including new buildings for customs halls and so on.  Secondly, it would also mean considerable delays in time because passengers and cargo would have to be taken from planes and the whole customs procedure would have to be gone through. One can easily envisage the time that would take and as the objective of preclearance is to eliminate delays it would not make sense to have an arrangement that would cause delays.  That problem has not yet been overcome and it is the principal reason why there is not customs preclearance.</P>
    <P>All these matters got bogged down and nothing happened for a few years in respect of Ireland or the other European countries.  Last October I visited the United States and I met my counterpart in the US Government, the Secretary for Transportation, Mrs. Elizabeth Dole.  It is only right that I should pay tribute to Mrs. Dole for her part in bringing about this agreement.  As a result of my meeting with her, the block that had been on discussions for a number of years was removed and within a month discussions recommenced.  Within a short period thereafter, agreement in principle was reached.  She deserves our warmest thanks and I wish to pay tribute to a very fine lady whom I have had the privilege of knowing for some years.  I thank her for removing the obstacles to discussion. I wish also to thank her officials and the officials in my Department for expeditiously and efficiently dealing with the negotiations and coming to an agreement.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa and others asked what would be the privileges of the US citizens employed at Shannon by the Immigration and Naturalisation Service. <Col N="1498" /> This is a matter for discussion and negotiation. For instance, the matters that would be considered would be the question of the taxation to be applied to the salaries of those officials, whether it should be Irish taxation or US taxation, whether their household effects and goods imported here should be free of duty and other minor matters of that kind.  Rather than having a prolonged and detailed discussion in the negotiations on that point, we decided we would make an enabling provision that would require the agreement of both countries.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks and during the course of this debate there has been mention of the fall-off in passenger numbers from America and the so-called hysteria in America about terrorism in Europe.  I know that every Member of this House absolutely deplores the terrorist attacks on aircraft and on United States tourists in parts of Europe, notably in southern Europe.  While not taking from the gravity of those offences, it is important to have a certain perspective.  Somebody said recently that the number of American tourists who have been killed over the last 20 years is so small that it is safer for United States citizens to be in Europe than to be at home, where they have such a high murder rate.  That covers the whole of Europe, not just Southern Europe, but the comparison is even more dramatic whe we look at safe places like Ireland. American visitors are much safer in Ireland than they are at home, and that message is beginning to get across to US citizens.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte and a number of companies engaged in tourism have done a marvellous job in America over the last month &mdash; and, in the case of private citizens, very often at their own expense&mdash;getting across the message that whatever problems exist in Southern Europe, they do not apply here, where American visitors are very welcome.  The concern felt by American tourists has shown itself in falling numbers visiting Europe, but the fact is that 1986 will be a very good year for Americans in Europe.  It will not be as good as last year because 1985 was the best year ever in which there was a <Col N="1499" /> booming United States economy and a very strong dollar.  The dollar has fallen by about 30 per cent in relation to the punt in the last year, and the US economy is not growing as fast this year as it did last year.  These are other factors which must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The number of terminal passengers at Shannon for the first four months for this year is up 9 per cent on the corresponding period for last year but we do not expect to have an increase in numbers over the whole summer period.  In fact, the number will decrease.  Nevertheless, 1986 will be better than 1984, which was a good year.  We have a tendency to accentuate the negative: people are talking about gloom and doom because business will not be as good this year as last year. As I said, this will not be a disastrous year for tourism; it will be a good year by any standard.</P>
    <P>This Bill is being brought into this House in the aftermath of a major turn around in Shannon Airport's affairs in the past few years.  In 1980 Shannon lost £1.6 million, but last year they made their biggest profit ever.  Last year Shannon handled 1.158 million passengers, slightly below the 1977 record figure of 1.74 million passengers.  Despite the fact that there have been great developments in aviation technology and that aircraft can travel further without refuelling, Shannon had one of its best years in terms of passenger numbers in 1985 and it had its best year in terms of profit.  There are now four airlines serving the North Atlantic route and one for the first time serving the southern United States, although numbers will be down this year. Despite all that, this will be a very good and profitable year for Shannon.</P>
    <P>The total aircraft movement at Shannon in 1985 was 39,377 compared with 36,161 in 1984 and 30,419 in 1983. Between 1983 and 1985 there was a 30 per cent growth in aircraft movements at Shannon.  This has been greatly facilitated by the expansion of Aeroflot. Under the fifth freedom rights Aeroflot fly from Shannon to Havana, Lima and <Col N="1500" /> other places in Central and South America. We have negotiated a new bilateral agreement with the Soviet Union, which remains to be signed pending the necessary clearance by the two Governments. This will mean more good news for Shannon and for Irish aviation in general.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins asked about landing fees.  There is a set scale of landing fees, but deals may be done with carriers.  The charge for all aircraft is £5.45 per metric tonne.  For instance, a B737 has 53 metric tonnes and the landing fee is £288; a B707 is 150 metric tonnes and the land fee is £817; a B747 is 320 metric tonnes and the landing fee is £1,744.  These are standard fees applying to scheduled traffic.  As regard technical transit flights, Aer Rianta make a package deal with the airlines and such deals involve the contractual commitment, usually for one year, and cover landing fees, handling, catering, fuel and so on.  These deals enable Shannon to maintain its competitiveness with other international airports.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins asked about voluntary search.  It would be at the discretion of the INS as to whether a person should be asked to submit to a search.  Under Article V, the INS can, in accordance with US regulations, refuse entry to those who decline to submit to a search. Obviously, a search will not only be requested if the INS officer has reason to suspect that he might find evidence in, for example, a person's wallet, to substantiate the belief that the person in question should not be admitted to the United States.</P>
    <P>Some questions have been asked about Aer Lingus's attitude to preinspection. Aer Lingus's only concern was that flights would not be delayed.  If flights were delayed, we would achieve the reverse of what we want, that is to speed up access to the United States and to reduce travelling time from home to destination by reducing as far as possible delays at airports. The idea of preinspection is to allow speedier inspection of immigration and health here than is possible in the crowded airports of the US.  Obviously, that purpose would be defeated if the nature of preinspection here were to <Col N="1501" /> delay flights.  That was Aer Lingus's very proper concern.  These reservations are perfectly justified.  I repeat that not only Aer Lingus had these reservations.  We and the US customs authorities had worries about them also.  For that reason, as I have said, the customs aspect had been left aside because it was felt that would cause delays and would not speed things up.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley said this preclearance deal could have been done in 1981 but was blocked by internal interests.  He went on to say that a customs clearance scheme would give much more employment. He placed a great deal of emphasis on the fact that Aer Lingus did not propose to participate fully.  He said that directions should be given to Aer Lingus to participate, that foreign airlines could be discouraged from participating if Aer Lingus do not do so and that Aer Lingus have an obligation to participate.  As I said in my opening speech, Aer Lingus plan to participate but I have no intention of directing them to do any such thing. One of the principles I have adopted in dealing with my semi-State companies is that I do not interfere in decisions which are proper to those companies.  We have had too much of that over the years.  It is for Aer Lingus to decide whether and to what extent to use preclearance.  I am glad they intend to use preclearance and I encourage them to use it to the fullest extent possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley also raised the reference in my opening speech to preinspection being located at Shannon in the first instance.  That is provided in the agreement. It permits of a possible extension of preclearance to other Irish airports but I must say I do not see that it will be extended to other airports.  I see Shannon being the only gateway to the North Atlantic in this country and it will remain so.  I see it as the natural place for preclearance and I do not see preinspection being extended to other airports.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern and Deputy Griffin inquired about this also.  As long standing Government policy is that all trans-Atlantic scheduled services must stop at Shannon in both directions, Shannon is <Col N="1502" /> the logical location for preinspection. However, it was felt that it would be desirable to provide in the agreement for the possibility that preinspection might be conducted in the future at some airport other than Shannon and to indicate that preinspection was not being granted to Shannon as an exclusive right to the detriment of other airports in this State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Griffin asked if Irish people could be employed on INS duties.  The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  A condition of employment of INS immigration inspectors is that they must be citizens of the US. Therefore, there is no question that Irish citizens would be deprived of employment opportunities as a result of the stationing of US officials at Shannon under the preinspection arrangement.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to people who return to the airport on the following day having been asked to leave being caught by section 19(3)(b) of the 1980 Act. There was a question as to whether persons refused entry into Ireland require to be under Garda surveillance.  The answer is that persons refused entry into Ireland will be held in Garda custody until there is a suitable return flight or pending an appeal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern was anxious to know if the US Government had to go through the same procedures as we to have this agreement ratified.  I understand their procedures are different from ours.  I have not got full details, but I know the necessary formalities are being gone through and that they, as we, hope to be in a position to sign this agreement very quickly so that we can commence the trial from 1 July.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern and a number of other Deputies asked: why four months?  Why not 12 months?  It was felt that especially over the peak period four months would be an adequate test period to see if preclearance works.  I hope very much that it will work and that when the four months have elapsed both the US Government and we will feel it worth while to make the scheme permanent.  I hope that the results I see possible from this legislation will be realised fully in the context of extra landings at Shannon and, therefore, <Col N="1503" /> extra landing fees.  There will be also the benefits of extra fuel purchases and the profit thereon, extra purchases at the duty free shops etc.  which, of course, should give extra employment in the shops, extra profit for Aer Rianta and downstream benefits for employment in this country because most of what is sold in the duty free shops is, of course, Irish produce.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern raised questions about the level of fees payable by airlines. Under a permanent scheme of preinspection, participating airlines would have to bear the cost of the stationing of US officials at Shannon over and above the costs which would be incurred if inspection was carried out on arrival in the USA.  The costs were to be allocated among the participating airlines on a per passenger basis, each airline being charged a fixed amount on the basis of each of the passengers and crew members being subjected to preinspection.  The cost per passenger cannot be calculated at this stage as negotiations concerning the number of flights and passengers from each participating airline who will be preinspected have not yet been concluded. Obviously, the more passengers who are preinspected the more cost effective the operation and the lower the cost per head will be.</P>
    <P>On the base of the cost of existing preclearance operations in Canada, the Bahamas and Bermuda it is considered that the cost to airlines of participating in a permanent preinspection arrangement would be in the range of 50p to £1 per passenger.  This cost will not arise during the trial period when the only charge on airlines in regard to preinspection will be the charge for overtime and Sunday work by US officials which the airlines would be obliged to pay in any event for inspections conducted in the US on Sundays or outside official hours.</P>
    <P>A number of question were asked about other costs, for instance security costs.  I do not know what, if any, extra security costs there will be but I doubt that there will be any.  This should be <Col N="1504" /> easily embraced in the normal duties of the Garda Síochána, etc. at Shannon.</P>
    <P>In relation to costs on Aer Rianta, given even conservative estimates as to the likely number of extra flights during the trial period, Aer Rianta feel that a significant benefit will accrue to them, that their costs, which are not likely to exceed £100,000, will be well exceeded in terms of revenue.  A significant profit even in the four months should therefore accrue to them.  That is just in the trial period.  If that is borne out, one can imagine the potential for increased profit for Aer Rianta which might accrue in a full year.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa asked questions about health costs.  Any pre-diagnostic medical and hospital costs arising from examination of a person suspected of having an infectious disease under Irish laws and regulations will be borne by the US Public Health Service.  All post-diagnostic medical costs of a person detained in hospital for treatment will be recouped by the health board in the normal way from foreign patients, subject of course to EC reciprocal arrangements.</P>
    <P>I have answered the principal questions raised on Second Stage.  I hope that this agreement will bring full benefits to Shannon. I wish to be associated with all the nice remarks passed by Deputies in relation to SFADCo and Aer Rianta management at Shannon.  I very much admire the great spirit and unity of purpose which exists at Shannon.  It is right to pay tribute not only to the management and the boards, present and past, but also to the workforce without whose flexibility, commitment, co-operation and interest Shannon could not possibly have been the success it continues to be.  I hope that the motion and the Bill will build on that past success and that the future success of Shannon Airport will be even greater.</P>

      <P>This section provides for a competent authority to enter into agreements with eligible air carriers wishing to avail of preinspection.  This is one of the functions which it is envisaged will <Col N="1507" /> be delegated to Aer Rianta under section 2.  Subsection (2) provides that any such agreement must specify the terms and conditions under which preinspection would be carried out.  Article VIII of the agreement provides for certain conditions under which airlines shall have the option to use preinspection including: (1) a reasonable notice period for applications in order to allow the INS to make suitable arrangements; (2) notice period of six months for complete withdrawal from preinspection except in certain circumstances where 30 days' notice will be acceptable; (3) reasonable notice for withdrawal from preinspection of certain flights only and the conditions under which withdrawal of such flights may be permitted.  The INS may decline to permit such withdrawal in circumstances where alternative arrangements cannot be made for inspection in the US.  Nevertheless, the agreement specifies that, in the case of last minute flight disruptions, the notice given by the INS could be very short: (5) a requirement that airlines will, (a) take steps to deny carriage onwards to the US for persons found ineligible by the INS to travel to a preinspected flight, (b) undertake responsibility to return such person to his point of embarkation or country of origin and to bear any costs, including accommodation and maintenance, which may arise.  Provision (a) means that the airlines will make it a condition on the sale of a ticket to any passenger travelling on a preinspected flight that he or she will not be permitted to travel on the flight to the US in the event of being inadmissible by the INS at Shannon.  Provision (b) is self explanatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) defines eligible air carriers as any air carrier which operates a non-stop service between the State and the United States whether the air service originates in the State or elsewhere.  The formula has been used because the greatest potential benefit of preinspection is in the attraction of additional transit traffic, for example, flights originating at various <Col N="1508" /> European points which would not normally land at Shannon but which would do so in order to avail of preinspection.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this section is to provide a legal basis for the status to be accorded to US Government employees who are assigned to preinspection duties in Ireland.  Subsection (1) provides that such US officials shall have immunity from civil and criminal prosecutions before the Irish courts in respect of acts performed in the exercise of their duties under the agreement.  The duties concerned are specified in Article IX (1) of the agreement and section 5 of the Bill.  They are also specified in section 6 (2) of the Bill, as the parliamentary draftsman considered that this was necessary.</P>

      <P>This is a normal provision in international agreements.  If, for instance, one of these people is alleged to have committed an offence in the course of his duty, the US Government might feel that it was serious enough for them to waive the immunity so that a prosecution or whatever was thought necessary could take place in this country.</P>

      <P>This section of the Bill deals with provisions relating to aliens control.  Subsection (1) stipulates that persons arriving at an airport in the State for preinspection are not deemed to have landed in the State and are consequently not required to present themselves to an Irish immigration official for permission to land, in the same way as persons who are merely transiting at an airport are not required to do so.</P>
      <P>However, under subsection (2), persons who are refused permission by the INS to travel onwards to the US are required to present themselves to the Irish immigration authorities to be deal with in accordance with the terms of aliens legislation.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement &mdash; Article VIII (4) &mdash; air carriers participating in preinspection are obliged to refuse carriage onwards to the US to any person found ineligible by the INS to travel on a prein spected flight.  They will also be respon sible for returning any such person to his or her point of origin or country of nationality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the event of such a person being refused permission to land here under the Aliens (Amendment) Order, 1975, the might have to be held in an authorised place of detention, in accordance with the order, should a suitable flight out o Ireland not be available quickly.  Whethe such a person would be so detained, o would be temporarily released, would b <Col N="1511" /> a matter for decision by the Irish immigration authorities.  Article VII (4) of the agreement also provides that in such circumstances the airline concerned would be obliged to bear any costs arising, including accommodation and maintenance costs.</P>
