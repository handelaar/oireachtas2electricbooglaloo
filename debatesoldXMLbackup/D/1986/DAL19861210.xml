    <Title>Single European Act &mdash; Neutrality and Protocol No. 30: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="2048" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann reaffirms Ireland's position of neutrality outside military alliances, and notes with satisfaction that the provisions in Title III of the Single European Act relating to the co-operation of the High Contracting Parties (that is, the Twelve member states of the European Community) on the political and economic aspects of security and the closer co-ordination of their positions in this area do not affect Ireland's position of neutrality outside military alliances.</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann further notes and welcomes the provisions of Article 23 of the Single European Act on Economic and Social Cohesion, which enhances and strengthens the commitment of the Community to the achievement of the objectives set out in Protocol No. 30 on Ireland appended to the Treaty of Accession of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom to the European Communities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Foreign Affairs.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment I had been dealing with the faltering in the development of the European Economic Community, the concern that this caused in the member states and the indications that at Heads of State and Heads of Government level a decision was taken that something had to be done about it. I related that faltering to a deliberate putting aside of the philosophy upon which the whole European Economic Community had been established, a philosophy which was very much to the fore when the attempt was being made to enlarge the original Community and to strengthen the European ideal generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated that when the Community simply decided to concern itself with bread, wine, butter, beef, soya beans and so on the cement which the original philosophy provided was melted down and <Col N="2049" /> the Community was less of a unit than it had been at the beginning when it was guided by the philosophy of men like M. Monnet and the founding fathers who, in the real world, had, as we know, the impelling force of what had happened to Europe in the 1939-45 war.</P>
    <P>I also spoke briefly on the question of security.  I did express shock at some of what Deputy McCartin said with regard to military involvement.  If I read him and Deputy Kelly correctly, they were both advocating military alliances, saying we should join military alliances for the defence of Europe.  That is a legitimate view to hold, no question about it, but I would like to know if that is the Government point of view, if it is the individual Fine Gael Member's point of view in Government, if it is the Labour point of view, or are we to take it that the motion put down in the name of the Minister for Foreign Affairs is the real thinking of the Government?  There are some who think the Minister is simply covering his backside against attacks from the Opposition or from the Labour Party within the Government as of now.  What I am saying is that those views are held &mdash; blatant militaristic views like those of Deputy McCartin or the less blatant views of Deputy Kelly &mdash; and they are legitimate points of view &mdash; but I take it they are not the views of the majority of this House.  They are certainly not the views of the Fianna Fáil Party.  My own belief is that if such a point of view were put by way of plebiscite to the people, it would be totally rejected.</P>
    <P>The qualified majority voting is something we are worried about.  Admittedly, the power of veto is a strong and very effective one.  Admittedly, it can be used to hold up developments and to neutralise any action that is attempted to cause stagnation at decision-making level.  An té nach bhfuil láidir ní foláir dó bheith glic.  We do not have strong voting powers in the Parliament or in the Council of Ministers where the decisions are actually taken.  As the veto applies to the activities of the Council of Ministers we should be very careful about using it.  We should also be very careful and cautious <Col N="2050" /> about shedding this power, in particular in regard to a whole range of economic interests in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey, Leader of Fianna Fáil, while speaking yesterday made an intensely practical proposal, namely, that there should be a balance sheet of advantages and disadvantages of membership of the EC.  Let us be blunt about it.  The advantage has been great.  Funds have been transferred to Ireland from the EC. The statistics are given in the explanatory guide to the Single European Act.  We should realise that and appreciate that it has had an impact on our social fabric and, although not as big an impact as we had hoped, on our regional development. It has also had an impact on our industrial and economic development.  We did not lose out.  This is where the idea of a balance sheet was an eminently reasonable one.  Labour intensive industries have fallen by the wayside since we joined the EC.</P>
    <P>When the debate about our joining the EC was in progress in the early seventies people involved in those industries at the time expressed fears.  On one occasion I attended a party hosted by a shoe manufacturer. He stated that the only way he could survive was if we in Ireland decided to purchase what was made in the country and to exercise discrimination in that regard.  I could not help but notice at that party only Scotch whiskey was served. There was a total lack of logic in his approach.  He could not see that he was breaking the counsel of perfection which he was advocating with regard to his own business.  That industry has since died, as have many other footwear and textile industries, as a direct consequence of our joining the EC.  The balance sheet is important.  It would be a matter of political judgment as to when the strength of the veto should be called upon to protect our national interests.</P>
    <P>That is linked to the desire to have the internal market completed by 1992.  In the explanatory guide articles 13 to 19 of the internal market are explained.  It stated:</P>
    <P>the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured in <Col N="2051" /> accordance with the provisions of the EEC Treaty.</P>
    <P>The Community want to move that law. In theory, we should be 100 per cent in favour of that if we have subscribed to the Treaty.  Taking this desire for a quick movement in the establishment of the completely free internal market with the idea that more power will be delegated to the Commission, we could run into serious problems with regard to the development of the internal market.  The explanatory guide also states:</P>
    <P>the Commission has the power to take rapid decisions to adjust refund payments for the export of agricultural products to countries outside the Community so as to take immediate account of any decline in world market prices.</P>
    <P>That is true.  It gives the positive side.  It also has the power to reduce prices.  The converse is not adverted to in this booklet.</P>
    <P>I mentioned yesterday that the social policy has deserved well of Europe and has benefited this country.  We are told we have an advantage in the fact that a market comprising 320 million people will be available to us a result of the internal market being achieved by 1992. It will require very careful thinking on the part of the Community in regard to the social and regional policies in order to avoid the serious traumata that this will mean for this country.  Throughout the seventies we gained from the Common Agricultural Policy, the social policy and the regional policy although this has always been disappointing.  It may well be the fund of the future as far as this country is concerned.  Very careful thinking with regard to those structural policies will be necessary.  Effective thinking and thinking that will result in a proper and tightly organised policy for what are called peripheral regions &mdash; I do not like using the word &ldquo;peripheral&rdquo;&mdash; will be necessary.</P>
    <P>There are five million people on this island and 320 million people in the European market.  We had our doubts whether <Col N="2052" /> people whose one objective would be to maximise profits would choose Belfast, Dublin, Galway or Cork for major industrial expansion.  That was a legitimate objective in their philosophy.  The Government's guide mentions that with 320 million people in the Community we are bound to be in a position to attract foreign investment.  That is true and it has happened.  We know from statistics of the number of people employed by foreign companies that located here but it is also true that we have a 12 member Community and that Portugal and Spain are very attractive propositions for the establishment of industries and the location of investment from outside the Community.  We should not forget that they have land frontiers with the mass market in Europe.  It is important to remember that as a counterbalance against the euphoria of thinking of a market for 320 million people.  We should take cognisance of that and be proud of the challenge but we must not forget that we are not the only people in the market for investment or trying to sell into the big market.</P>
    <P>In modern industrial development the large corporation has a great advantage. It has the funds to advertise, something that means so much nowadays.  We will have direct broadcasting by satellite soon and those large industrial projects will have unlimited money to spend on pressurising people to buy their products. That being so we will have to be extra careful about qualified majority voting and so on.  We have achieved world markets with some products and established them in those markets.  We are proud of such products like Waterford Glass. Baileys and linen from my own province although the latter product is not being produced to the same extent.  However, it has a world reputation.  We should not deny that the opportunities exist or deny that the country can achieve success if we specialise and are right up with production and marketing techniques.</P>
    <P>I am tired of Ireland being cast in the role of a mendicant people, of bowing and saying, &ldquo;Baksheesh, Baksheesh,&rdquo; to the European Community.  For that <Col N="2053" /> reason we should gear our young people in our third level institutions to feel that they are well equipped to take part in the fight for development of that new market with the caveat all the time that we should not jettison the protections we have with regard to our national interest and its protection by a veto.  When in Government I visited Athens and I came across a pamphlet from the EC which I felt was flattering as far as Ireland was concerned. It was written for the guidance of Greece which was not a member of the EC and indicated that Greece should model its expenditure of the Social Fund on the Irish model, that the Irish model was something Greece could look at and use to good advantage.  Perhaps that was because of the social conditions of the two countries.  The pamphlet stated that we utilised the Social Fund with considerable wisdom.  I know some people have expressed doubts about certain expenditures on the training of young people.  I am prepared to concede that there may have been mistakes in that area but in some instances people who did not do all that well at school got excellent training from AnCO that equipped them to take up jobs in factories. Some of those people got well paid jobs, even in my constituency.  They would not have been considered at all in the first instance had they not got this training in welding or some other skill from AnCO, an organisation which is mainly funded from the Social Fund.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions about the health and safety of workers.  Last night I mentioned research and technological development and indicated that this was an area where we should try to support the policy as a European policy and get as much advantage out of it as we can. The indications are that in that area in our formal centres of learning, and in the informal training centres, we had made very rapid progress.  I mentioned yesterday how proud we should be of the fact that on a number of occasions our Aer Lingus Young Scientist of the Year took first place in competitions covering the EC and, in other instances, took first place in competitions involving young <Col N="2054" /> people in the US.  We have good material and for that reason we should take a deep interest in this development.  Admittedly for the wrong motives the pressure is coming on this area now.  The Japanese and the US, in that order, are putting the pressure on.  We know all the names such as Mitsubishi or Toyota from advertisements. Advertising campaigns indicate that that pressure is on very heavily. No matter what the motivation is it is a worthwhile policy development and we should be in there pitching to get the maximum advantage from it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question on security I have mentioned the near shock I got in listening to Deputy McCartin last night. Deputy Kelly's views were known to me and, as always were very colourfully presented but the thrust in both cases seemed to be that they would feel less ashamed if we had decided to join a military alliance in Europe.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the other hand, has tabled a motion that seems to indicate that he is protecting himself against somebody, whether it is somebody in Fianna Fáil or the Labour Party I do not know.  The Fianna Fáil declaration refers to Protocol 30 and covers our programme of industrialisation, economic development and the evening out of regional differences.  It also covers the whole area of neutrality, and states:</P>
    <P>Ireland states that the provisions of Title III do not affect Ireland's long established policy of military neutrality and that co-ordination of positions on the political and economic aspects of security does not include the military aspects of security or procurement for such purposes and does not affect Ireland's capacity to act or refrain from acting in any way which might affect Ireland's international status of military neutrality ...</P>
    <P>When one examines that alongside the motion tabled by an tAire Gnóthaí Eachtracha one will see that there is very little difference.  The only difference is that we are pushing for this declaration to be included in the Act.  If it is desirable that the Dáil pass it as a motion I cannot see <Col N="2055" /> opposition to it being included as a formal declaration in the Act.  I do not think it will rock any boats or cause any upsets in Brussels, Luxembourg or Strasbourg. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will not lose any face if he accepts what we are urging.</P>
    <P>I will have a quick look at a report of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Community, a document well worth studying.  Deputy G. Collins and his committee did creditable work and so did Deputy Manning who was chairman of the sub-committee which studied the matter in depth.  I commend them for their work.</P>
    <P>The committee complained that their work is simply done and shelved and that there should be an obligation on the Oireachtas to debate their work, particularly important matters like this.  Indeed we have a legitimate complaint about the Taoiseach and the Government and their lack of provision for debates on the Single European Act.  We would have cut the ground from under them if we had been given an opportunity to debate the report I am now referring to.  Before Deputy FitzGerald became Taoiseach, before he was elected to the House, he was a noted European, supposedly, but important reports like this are never brought before the House for discussion.</P>
    <P>The committee considered that the Single European Act is an unorthodox sort of instrument.  It weds two things, the EPC being one.  The committee say that the EPC does not come within the framework of the Treaty and like other provisions it is not included in the Bill to amend the 1972 European Communities Act.  There seems to be a strange marriage here, whether of legislative convenience or whether one is expected to carry the other.  I suppose it is true of any legislation, even domestic legislation, but the committee expressed criticism about possible difficulties in interpreting the Act.  I am sure they expressed that fear because in the Act there is more scope for difficulties of interpretation than in most others.  The analysis by Deputy <Col N="2056" /> Haughey yesterday indicates that there is scope for difficulties of interpretation already apparent in the Act.</P>
    <P>The internal market was dealt with by the committee and they give a rather shocking figure from the Albert and Ball Report called &ldquo;European Economic Recovery in the Eighties&rdquo;, which is cited, to the effect that technical, fiscal and bureaucratic barriers to trade are estimated to cost European business £8 million per annum, or 2 per cent of GNP. Though we consider that the transfers we are talking about in Ireland, which are substantial and welcome, though not to be clothed totally in euphoria, are less than £1 billion, they constitute a very substantial sum that could be saved, and it is something we would desire and support. The only problem I can see about it is the cost to European business.  If that money were saved, where would it be deployed?  I repeat what I said earlier about the structural funds.  That area should be supported from any savings through completion of the internal market.</P>
    <P>On page 50 of the report, Jacques Delors, President of the Commission, called for a co-operative growth strategy which, by adding 1 percentage point to the Community growth rate could reduce unemployment by 30 per cent to 40 per cent in the next five years.  I cannot tell the House how sweet that music sounds to my ears.  Whether anything will be done about it is a different matter, but the Government should listen to that type of suggestion.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions here I cited an Economic and Social Research Institute document prepared some time ago called &ldquo;Employment and Unemployment in Ireland&rdquo;.  It was never debated in this House.  It analysed unemployment and the labour market; it indicated what the labour market would be because of increases in the population and more women coming into the work force in a period of years; it analysed what the employment requirements would be and it had scenarios indicating <Col N="2057" /> what would happen with minimal or non-existent emigration, moderate emigration and severe emigration, which is what we have at present.</P>
    <P>Ireland is the best country in the world for analyses but the important thing is to do something about what we discover from them.  That is where we fall down. The Government never even considered what should be done with regard to developing unemployment and emigration. The study I have just referred to &mdash; it is a bit out of date now &mdash; could be brought up to date.  It contains suggestions about what to do to tackle the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>Jacques Delors had the right idea.  He expressed a development philosophy. The important thing is to do something about it.  Yesterday Deputy Haughey indicated that there are 16 million people unemployed in the Community.  That is no recipe for smugness or lying back and doing nothing.  There is nothing that would breathe life into the whole idea of a vibrant and living community more than a comprehensive effective policy to deal with unemployment in the future.  We have heard what would happen if West Germany allowed reflation, and if France and the other stronger countries would do something along the same lines.  There we are talking about individual countries while Jacques Delors was talking about community action.  It could be done.  If it were seen to be a road down which progress could be made the member states would not be as reluctant as they have been in the past to provide the funds for that kind of development.</P>
    <P>I have already made the point about competition.  Our weakness will be that large industries, large economies will be in a better position than we are for dealing with that.  The joint committee make a comment about temporary derogations. We do not want to be doing the baksheesh bit all the time, but the possibility for temporary derogations should be there.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt briefly with economic and social cohesion in the Community in the context of Jacques Delor's statement.  We only just got the contribution <Col N="2058" /> up to 1.4 per cent of VAT returns.  There was a battle about that because some states felt it was nearly all being absorbed by the CAP.  There must be a blueprint for improving employment within the Community.  We are in a very bad state in this respect, as are Spain and the UK.  A policy thrust should be initiated and kept up until something effective is done about it.</P>
    <P>I commented last night on the provisions about the European Parliament, which is being brought more into the picture.  There will always be a difficulty about the Parliament due to the difficulty of cohesion.  It is difficult ever to see it in a legislative role, but we do not want it to be purely a talking shop.  It has done some very good work already and is a wonderful concept, but it will be a good few centuries down the road until we see the European Parliament being a legislative essembly in the sense of the Dáil or the House of Commons, or the US Congress.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy has been at the top of the pile as far as our interests are concerned.  Some of us feel aggrieved about what actually happened, about where the large profits went, whether it was to East Anglia, or north west of Paris in the cereals area, or to the dairy industry, sustained by imports of feed from the Far East and elsewhere. There has been a distortion of what we thought would be achieved by CAP.  We cannot blame people who are working within the rules.  I am not sure about the importation of feed.  We have all expressed doubts about the continuation of facilities to other countries for the importation of products to the EC.</P>
    <P>Nothing is simplistic.  We know there are political and strategic considerations that must be taken into account in this area but we should bluntly and stubbornly hold on to CAP in so far as that can be done.  We should see to it that we salvage as much of the original idea as possible.  Perhaps we may have to take a different line in production and ban all kinds of artificial stimulants to growth and specialise in having organically produced <Col N="2059" /> products.  There is a growing market for that kind of thing but it will take a lot of study.  We have now developed agricultural expertise through Macra na Feirme, ACOT, An Foras Talúntais and the media to a far higher degree than when we joined in 1973.  The soil is fertile for some close thinking regarding where we are going.  If we specialise and have available products for the Fortnum and Mason type of shop, they will be purchased.  Only a few years ago French housewives went on strike because the veal in the shops was contaminated with growth promoters and antibiotics.  That practice was stopped very quickly because the meat was left in the shops.</P>
    <P>The joint committee believe that the commitment in the Act to strengthen the structural policies of the Community must allow for appropriate compensatory measures for the farming community in the most disadvantaged areas where agriculture plays a major role in the local economy.  The original concept we were debating and discussing in 1973 involved a concentration on the highly developed and industrialised central quadrangle. The selfsame thing is true of the agriculture industry and I welcome that recommendation of the committee.</P>
    <P>The joint committee also caution that there are strong indications that CAP is running out of political goodwill.  Shallow but influential commentators in this country &mdash; sometimes their influence is enhanced, the more shallow they are &mdash; are following that simplistic line with regard to this CAP.  It is something to which we must address ourselves.  The committee say that an inflexible approach to other aspects of the Single European Act, such as the completion of the internal market, might not serve our best interests in negotiations relating to CAP. This is where I come back to the suggestion made yesterday by Deputy Haughey about the balance sheet.  We have loud complaints coming from certain heavily industrialised countries about the CAP's absorption of funds but there is no mention at all of the balancing advantages <Col N="2060" /> which those countries have.  West Germany is always mentioned as the member state paying the piper.  An analysis of the benefits to West German industry would indicate that they did exceptionally well &mdash; I am only taking that country as an example &mdash; out of membership of the EC.  There has been a concerted and very subtly-conducted campaign against the Common Agricultural Policy in Britain from the word go.  There is the kind of illogical situation in which the Minister of Agriculture in Britain is fighting on the Council of Ministers against the best interests of farmers.</P>
    <P>I might say a quick word on the monetary capacity of the Community.  Again the Prime Minister in Britain is indicating that, had she the power, she would rid herself of the Common Agricultural Policy in the morning.  She said yesterday she was a highly &ldquo;communitaire&rdquo; person, so is her Government and so is Britain. Nevertheless, when the European Monetary System was established, she remained out.  That has had an impact not merely on the general European Monetary System but as we know has had a special impact on this country.  We had an unfortunate devaluation in the autumn of this year which compounded our problems in that regard.  I would not mind but quite conservative-minded economists in Britain have been urging that Britain should join the EMS.  There is no question but that if Britain did there would be some evidence that that Government was communitaire-minded.  The fact of the matter is that it is generally believed that it is the Prime Minister in Britain herself, personally, who objects to joining the EMS.  Writers in <i>The Economist</i> now for a number of years have been advocating that Britain should join the EMS, that that would help not merely the British economy but also those of the other EC countries and help to bring order to the Community's finances which, as we all know, constitute a serious problem.</P>
    <P>The joint committee also dealt with science and technology &mdash; I have already referred to that &mdash; and said how important it is that there would be a mandatory <Col N="2061" /> requirement on the Council to adopt a science and technology strategy for the Community.</P>
    <P>I will leave the lawyers to deal with the question of the courts.  As somebody who has no qualifications in that area it seems to me to be a good idea that there is now a court from which there is the possibility of an appeal to the European Court as it obtains at present.  In the course of their report the joint committee dealt with the Treaty on European Co-operation in the Sphere of Foreign Policy.  The joint committee said they should have preferred to see Title III as a separate Treaty fully severable from Titles I and II of the Single European Act.  They said at the very beginning of their comments on the Single European Act that it was a strange kind of wedding together of two different things.  They said they would have preferred to see Title III as a separate Treaty fully severable from Titles I and II of the Single European Act and that this would allow for a separate debate on the whole issue of European political co-operation.</P>
    <P>We are having, if you like, within this debate a separate debate on European political co-operation.  I have already referred to that.  With regard to it and the security aspects mentioned, the House should accept our declaration.  It is, in substance, what the Minister for Foreign Affairs himself has put down by way of a motion but unconnected with this.  Everybody who has had any contact at all with Europe knows that there has been a certain urging of us towards security areas, towards alliances, towards military commitment, a subtle not brash, urging in that general direction.  I do not believe that is the policy of the majority of this House.  Neither do I believe it is the thinking of the majority of our people.  There are Members of this House, such as Deputies Kelly and McCartin who hold different views.  They are entitled to hold those views.  We are also entitled to know how far those views are held by the Government.  If our declaration was formally annexed to the Single European Act then we would have a more up-front view on the matter.</P>
    <P>The joint committee said that to avoid <Col N="2062" /> any possible ambiguity or misunderstanding of Ireland's position and to prevent any possible erosion of it, they called on the Government to append a formal reiteration of our position of military neutrality to the act of ratification. Nothing could be stronger than that recommendation.  It is very important.</P>
    <P>The Leader of our party did mention the Articles of our Constitution &mdash; I think Articles 30 to 34.  The joint committee addressed themselves also to those Articles.  They said:</P>
    <P>The provisions of Articles 30 to 34 (dealing with the elimination of quantitative restrictions between member States) shall not preclude prohibition or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on the grounds of public morality, public policy or public security ...</P>
    <P>I do know that Members of the House had communications with regard to that. The joint committee, in their wisdom, think it is adequately covered.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be a resurgence of the spirit and philosophy on which the European Economic Community is based.  When the late Deputy Seán Lemass first mooted the proposition of joining the Community when, as the House will remember General de Gaulle knocked it on the head through knocking the British application, those of us who at that time established associations like the European Association of Teachers and so on, and worked on the European idea and ideal feel now somewhat fooled by what happened.  We feel that this was used at the time to prepare people's minds for the Community and that, as soon as the Community became a <i>fait accompli</i>, the decision was taken to move away from it into the bread, the butter, the beef, the wine, the olive oil area and forget the philosophy on which it was based.  If there were a renewal of that ideal, and there could be, it would do great good.  We should advocate European studies as a compulsory subject, if necessary, though I am reluctant to use the word &ldquo;compulsory&rdquo;, in our secondary schools.  The whole thing will wither if it <Col N="2063" /> is based purely on the <i>réal politique</i> of economic development; it will wither and die.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Parliament has been brought more into the situation than heretofore.  The House should give due consideration to the amendment on the Order Paper in the name of Deputy Vincent Brady about having this included as a formal declaration.  There are many other declarations from various countries. The Government have one down about insurance, so it would not in any way be damaging to the commitment we have to Europe, to our economic well being or to the political development of the EC.</P>

      <P>In his speech Deputy Wilson referred to the report of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  I have the honour along with Deputy Joe Walsh to chair this committee in an exercise of grant coalition based on the West German model of the sixties.  We did a joint report on the Single European Act and its implications for us.  This document has been of use to Members of this House in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like most other groups in the country our committee came somewhat late to examine this subject, although as far back as last April we had discussions with relevant EC commissioners on the implications of the Act and we produced an earlier report on the completion of the internal market.  In the course of our discussions we heard oral submissions from the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Irish Council of the European Movement, the Irish Sovereignty Movement, the European Parliament office in Dublin, ACOT and An Foras Talúntais. We had written submissions from Conradh na Gaeilge, CND, the Neutrality Study Group and from Pax Christi.  It is important to say that the Oireachtas had access to a wide variety of differing views on both the content and implications of the Act, and especially from groups who were hostile to the Act.  The essence of the objections and the fears of these <Col N="2064" /> people is accurately summed up in our report.  We are grateful to these people for their help in trying to clarify our minds on the implications of this complex legislation.</P>
    <P>Few advances in the European Community over the past number of years have created anything like the controversy which is now being evoked by the Single European Act.  In part, this is because certain groups have read fears and threats into the Single European Act, which are not there.  In part, because some groups sought, either deliberately or otherwise, to misrepresent the intent and purpose of the Act.  At different times we were told that the Act was a threat to our neutrality which it is not. At other times we were told that we would find ourselves as part of a nuclear arms industry in Europe, which we will not and we were told that the adoption of the Act could lead to the imposition of divorce and abortion here against the wishes of the people and, more extraordinarly, outside of the protection of Bunreacht na hÉireann.  As the people studied the implications, and the media have played a very constructive role in this discussion by giving television, radio and newspaper space towards analysing the Act over the past number of years, their fears have been shown to be fanciful. The genuine fears which many people had because of the complexity of the Act and the slowness of the country in coming to debate it, have been allayed. This has been a particularly constructive debate.  We have had valuable contributions from both Deputy Lenihan and Deputy Wilson who gave very constructive sober assessments of the implications and the negative effects of the Act.</P>
    <P>I would reiterate the fundamental point made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs here yesterday as to the nature of the Community.  When we voted overwhelmingly in 1972 to join the EC we did not vote to join a mere economic entity or an institution which had reached completion and perfection.  We joined a Community which had as its objective some form of European union freely entered <Col N="2065" /> into by the free nations of Europe, designed to strengthen their mutual economic basis and commercial prosperity, designed to deepen understanding and to make impossible the disagreements which had plunged Europe twice into a World War in the space of 30 or 40 years. It was designed to create a Europe capable of competing with the super powers in all areas of trade, research and development and an entity which would respect the separate identity and individuality of the member states.  In 1972 we did not join a static immobilised Community, but a Community moving in a certain direction.  From that point on we had a say in charting both the direction and speed of movement.  From the perspective of the hard pressed politicians or of the hard pressed civil servant the speed of development over the past 14 years has often been frustrating and we have tended to judge the evolution of the Community in terms of progress or lack of progress from one Summit to another. Every six months there is a reckoning of the degree of progress made within the Community.  It is more realistic to judge the evolution of the Community against the backdrop of European history, even in this century.  Against that backdrop more realistic measurement can be made especially when we contrast the degree of harmonisation, co-operation and progress made between such traditional enemies as the French and the Germans against our slow rate of progress in trying to resolve our national problem in Northern Ireland in the same time span.</P>
    <P>It is possible to place the Single European Act in a proper context.  In doing that it will be seen as a significant and major advance, as bringing to fruition moves which have been talked about over the past number of years and which are needed to allow the further evolution of the Community along the lines I have outlined.</P>
    <P>In relation to the section dealing with the completion of the internal market, the fragmentation of the European market has been one of the main obstacles to economic growth in Europe.  A common market has been created in name, but not in reality.  Deputy Wilson <Col N="2066" /> referred to the Albert and Ball report commissioned by the European Community. As the Deputy said this report showed that technical, fiscal and bureaucratic barriers to trade are estimated to cost European business £8 billion a year or 2 per cent of Community GNP.  For a country like Ireland which exports 66 per cent of the products of its manufacturing industry, and 80 per cent of that goes to the European Community, the benefits of freeing trade for us are obvious.  From our point of view, the implications for industry, including financial services sector, are clear.</P>
    <P>Access to a market of 320 million people without the present obstacles should provide an opportunity to increase trade significantly.  For a long time we have talked about removing the existing non-tariff obstacles to genuine free trade in the Community.  We have talked so long about it that there is a tendency among people in industry to be extremely sceptical about the prospects for any real change in this area.  There is now every indication that business and industry in a majority of the member states of the Community now wish to proceed very rapidly with the adoption of the needed legislation which will result from the liberalisation of inter Community trade.</P>
    <P>There is also a danger for us in this.  It was clear from the evidence given to the joint committee that the completion of the internal market will lead to much stiffer competition between the various member states, as the obstacles already in place begin to fall.  This could result in a scale of advantages in which Ireland, one of the weaker and less developed member states on the periphery of the Community, could find itself at the lower end of the scale.  For that reason, and this is a point which was very strongly made at the committee, the inclusion of a new chapter in the treaty dealing with the economic and social cohesion of the Community, to reduce disparities between the different regions, is required as corollary to the completion of the internal market.</P>
    <P>It should be said, however, that the removal of the remaining barriers to <Col N="2067" /> internal trade in the Community should very significantly improve Ireland's attractiveness as a location for foreign investment.  Industries locating in Ireland will benefit very significantly from the improved access to the European market which will result from the completon of the internal market.  Furthermore, a thriving Community would have additional resources to devote to strengthening their existing and future policies, especially the regional development policy.  Ireland as a major beneficiary from the existing policies could expect to gain from such strengthening.</P>
    <P>There were difficulties which could have arisen for this country in the move to majority voting.  These difficulties have been avoided.  Fiscal harmonisation especially could have caused considerable difficulties for us but this has been excluded and still remains subject to the use of the veto.  We, like the other countries, are free to invoke the veto in cases where our vital national interest is at stake.  I do not think any of us would like to see the situation develop where we become veto happy in which the exercise of the veto was to become a regular practice on our part or on the part of any of the other member states.  Such an attitude would obstruct the decision making process and would render meaningless the attempts being made in the Single European Act to improve it but it is right that the possibility of invoking the veto in exceptional circumstances should remain and remain it does.</P>
    <P>The move towards the completion of the internal market cannot be seen in isolation from the enhanced commitment which the Community have made in the Single European Act to economic and social cohesion.  We will benefit from the internal market as an export dependent country but progress on the internal market will also have to take account of the cohesion objective and this will be to our advantage.  In our approach to the Single European Act, in particular the provisions which will bring about a genuine single market, it is very important that our private sector in the months <Col N="2068" /> and years ahead should approach the new opportunities open to it in a very positive way because one thing is quite certain, the private sector in the other countries will be approaching the new opportunities in a positive and aggressive way.  It is up to our private sector to do likewise.</P>
    <P>Some of the most positive aspects in the Single European Act which were referred to at length by Deputy Wilson are the provisions for science and technology. It may well be said that it did not need a Single European Act to improve the level of scientific and technological development within the Community. Certainly, there is nothing specifically enshrined in the Treaty of Rome which would have prevented adequate investment in Community science and technology and thus assist the Community to keep abreast with the developments in other major economies.  The difference between the original EC treaty and the many provisions in the Single European Act is that there will now be a mandatory requirement on the Council to adopt a science and technology strategy for the Community.</P>
    <P>When we held our hearings in the joint committee we were informed by some of the leading people in science and technology in the country that the reason why steps were not taken to bridge the apparent massive gap between the Community and their industrial competitors was very simply a lack of political will on the part of the member states of the Community.  Therefore, the treaty did not prevent the developments which were needed, it was an absence of will.</P>
    <P>Now at least, the provisions in the Single European Act relating to science and technology do provide for an extensive framework programme to be drawn up which will outline a coherent plan for all Community research and development over a number of years.  An effective and comprehensive Community programme of research and development, particularly in the area of high technology, should be of considerable potential benefit to the smaller member states such as ourselves.  It will provide an opportunity for this country to participate in and benefit from large scale <Col N="2069" /> and advanced projects for which we ourselves would not otherwise have the resources.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever from talking to those people involved in the universities and research centres in this country that there is a great welcome for the fact that this vital area of science and technology has now been given a specific basis in the EC treaty by the inclusion of a special chapter in the Single European Act.  We should also support the Commission's proposal for greater investment in research and development by the Community, particularly in the area of high technology.  Such a policy is of critical importance for this country.  It is essential that the Community be fully equipped to compete effectively in the area of science and technology where they have lost considerable ground over the past number of years.</P>

      <P>We have lost in that time to both Japan and the United States. We as a country already derive considerable benefits from the existing Community research programme.  For example, we have the highest success rate among member states in regard to the number of projects accepted by the Esprit programme on information technology. Ireland has also secured the highest financial return on a GNP basis from the Esprit programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our country has made great strides in developing an infrastructure in scientific and technological development over the past decade.  This morning before coming into this House I spoke to a very challenging group of school children in St. Mary's school in Baldoyle who questioned me on various aspects of our membership of the European Community. One of the positive areas which it was possible to point out was the rapidity and the extent of our development in these areas of high technology over the past ten years.  As a people we have shown ourselves capable of being the brightest and most adaptable of work forces in this <Col N="2070" /> area.  Our future development in combating unemployment and in creating economic structures lies to a great extent in this area which is of vital importance to our economy and a major source of job creation.</P>
    <P>One important factor in our success over the past ten years in establishing this country as a centre of technological excellence has been our willingness to look outwards and to establish links with foreign enterprises, with universities and centres of research abroad.  This openness on our part was fostered in no small way by Ireland's integral involvement in Community research and development programmes.  In the universities and the research centres for this reason alone the Single European Act is seen as one of the most significant developments since we became a member of the Community.</P>
    <P>On this issue we should be quite clear on the implications which failure to ratify the Single European Act would have in the area of research and development as well as in many other areas.  We have benefited enormously from the existing Community programmes and we more than any other country stand ready to benefit from the passing of the Single European Act in this area.  In the crucial area of high technology the competitor countries are naturally striving to gain the edge in scientific development and to capture what is a very lucrative market. In this area of rapid change for us to stand still is to go backwards.  The EC must seize every opportunity to further its scientific development potential and one of the ways we do that is by ratifying the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of economic and social cohesion which was mentioned at some length in the report of the Oireachtas joint committee and dealt with also at some length by Deputy Wilson.  Among the most important provisions in this Single European Act from this country's point of view are those on economic and social cohesion which are designed to reduce the regional disparities in the Community.  The importance of economic cohesion to us, one of the less developed member states &mdash; like <Col N="2071" /> Deputy Wilson I dislike the use of the terms &ldquo;periphery&rdquo; or &ldquo;peripheral states&rdquo; which indicate geographical fact but do not refer to our involvement on a day to day basis in the running of the Community &mdash; and in this sense a peripheral state is self-evident.</P>
    <P>When we look at the way in which the regional policy of the Community has developed to date we must have very mixed feelings.  On the one hand we have received very considerable benefits from the Community budget through the regional and social funds.  We have consistently been a principal beneficiary of the Community's regional policy.  On the other hand there has been no appreciable progress towards the overall objective of reducing disparities between the prosperous central regions and those regions like ours on the periphery.  Unfortunately, the disparities which obtained when we joined the Community still persist. That is why the provisions on economic and social cohesion are so especially important from our point of view.  There is now to be for the first time in the body of the treaty a commitment to reducing disparities between the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions.  The regional fund is also given a specific treaty basis which can serve only to strengthen the Community's commitment to regional policy. Perhaps of greatest significance is the new treaty commitment to the objective of reducing regional disparities to be taken into account in the implementation of all Community policies and the internal market.  Thus, not only is the regional policy as such strengthened but a regional dimension, we are told, will be built into all other policies where this is appropriate. Without question these provisions will operate to our benefit.  For that reason also it is important that our commitment to the Act be seen to be fairly full.</P>
    <P>In Deputy Haughey's speech in the House yesterday and mentioned also by Deputy Wilson, and outside the House, there has been criticism that the cohesion provisions do not go far enough.  Maybe <Col N="2072" /> they could have gone a bit further, but what is here in the Act is the best available and works positively to our advantage. The provisions reflect to a considerable extent proposals which Ireland itself put forward.  They are designed, as precisely as is possible in a very imprecise science, to respond to the legitimate aspirations of Ireland and of partners with similar concerns and the motion put down by the Government underlines the importance of the cohesion provisions of the Act in strengthening the commitment already given by the Community to Ireland's development.  As in every other area the provisions of the Single European Act on cohesion do not represent an ultimate solution.  Rather they should be seen as an opportunity for the Community and for this country.  We should have no hesitation in seizing that opportunity to the full.</P>
    <P>This brings me to another major aspect of the Single European Act, the whole question of the institutional improvements which it is designed to bring about. It is also obvious that the procedures for taking decisions in the Community are urgently in need of improvement.  We are now a Community of 12.  The original procedures agreed 30 years ago were designed for a Community of six.  What is surprising is not the improvements in this regard introduced by the Single European Act but rather the fact that it has taken so long to bring about these improvements.  It is difficult to understand the claims that were made from a number of quarters that the Single European Act is being introduced with indecent haste.  The reverse is the case.  The Act has been in gestation for over three years and the changes which it seeks to bring about are long overdue.  The need for a more dynamic Community has been obvious for several years.  Community business has been characterised by lengthy delays involved in coming to decisions.  Inevitably this had lead to stagnation. Against this back ground the institutional improvements provided for in the Act are not overly ambitious.  Certainly they are not being brought in with <Col N="2073" /> indecent haste.  Indeed, they are modest. They are a practical attempt to unblock the whole decision making process.  As a country which benefits substantially from Community policies Ireland will benefit from any unblocking of the whole process. For that reason I welcome these improvements.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act extends the provisions for recourse to majority voting to a number of clearly defined, specifically limited areas.  This extension is designed principally to facilitate the removal of the remaining barriers to free trade in the Community.  There is nothing whatsoever sinister about the changes. Such barriers handicap the Community severely in its attempt to compete internationally with trading partners whose domestic markets are not hampered by internal barriers.  As I have mentioned, as far as this country which is so heavily dependent on its exports is concerned, such barriers impede the efforts of our exporters.  One has only to talk for a short time to those who drive the trucks who bring our exports physically into Europe, export managers, marketing managers and anybody involved in the export business, to realise the extent of the obstacles and difficulties represented by these barriers which are still placed in their way. It is vital that those barriers be removed, and the Single European Acts helps significantly in this.</P>
    <P>An area of great concern has been tax harmonisation.  This area has, rightly from our point of view, been excluded from the move to majority voting.  The retention of the unanimity requirement protects our interests fully in this area and, as has been mentioned, we are free to use the veto when we consider that our vital national interest is under threat.</P>
    <P>We of all countries should make full use of the provisions in the Single European Act for improvement in the decision making process.  We should avail ourselves of the new opportunities offered by majority voting, remembering that we are most unlikely to be in a minority which can be outvoted on a specific issue. Talking to civil servants and Ministers who have represented our country over <Col N="2074" /> the past ten or 14 years, this point is very forcefully brought home to us.  How often have we been the victims of the failure of the decision-making process?  How often have we been blocked by one or two countries in delay over policies which would significantly benefit us?  We have little to fear from an unblocking of the system and a great deal to gain.  There still is the possibility of using the veto should our vital national interests be threatened.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act also includes other institutional improvements.  The important role of the Commission in managing and implementing Council policies is now given enhanced recognition. That, I believe, is as it should be. The Single European Act also provides scope for making more efficient the day to day management of Community policies, while maintaining the necessary safeguards for the Council and for the individual member states.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a quick word about the new role or position of the European Parliament as a result of the Single European Act. Members of the joint committee believe in the new co-operation procedure in relation to the European Parliament as it provides a basis for the development of better inter-institutional arrangements, particularly between the Council and the Parliament.  Both these institutions now have a responsibility to make this procedure work efficiently, thereby providing the Community with well made, effective legislation.  If both Parliament and Council do not react in the spirit of the Single European Act, the new procedure could very quickly lead to delays, to a slowing down of an already cumbersome and lethargic process.  Even worse, it could result in the blocking of the whole system.</P>
    <P>On the joint committee, we very strongly reiterated the view of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee on institutional affairs, the extremely valuable Dooge Committee, that the principles of democracy are not served if the European Parliament's role is restricted to a consultative one.  Certainly, <Col N="2075" /> the joint committee agreed with the general assessment of the European Parliament as having at present merely a role of influence as opposed to power. Any moves to strengthen the role of the elected parliamentarians in the process was welcomed by all members of the joint committee.  In passing, let me say that the provisions of the Single European Act regarding the Court of Justice should ease their workload and improve their function.  There is not much more to be said than that.  It is something which is also very welcome.</P>
    <P>One of the most emotive areas in the entire discussion is, of course, centred around the question of Irish neutrality. Views have been expressed in the House by colleagues of my own party to which I would not fully subscribe.  Any of the fears that have been raised about our policy of neutrality and the continuation of that policy have not been well-founded and are misplaced.  It has been suggested in some quarters that our policy is being eroded through participation in European political co-operation, EPC, and that ratification of the Single European Act and our continued involvement in EPC will erode it further.  There is no truth whatsoever in that idea.  EPC is a process which has been evolving since 1970, before we entered the Community, a process by which member states of the Community, operating on the basis of consensus, exchange information, consult together and, where possible, seek to adopt common positions and to take joint action on the main foreign policy issues of concern to them.  We have been involved in that process almost from the beginning and it has always been clearly understood &mdash; whether Fianna Fáil or a Coalition Government, were in office &mdash; by all the member states that defence and military matters were excluded from discussion because of Ireland's neutral position.</P>
    <P>The fact that our partners are NATO members does not mean that we are, ever have been or will be, under pressure to discuss topics of this kind, or to adopt positions which are not to our liking. <Col N="2076" /> Everybody recognises and accepts the limitations of the scope of EPC which our participation in it involves.  This recognition and acceptance is expressed in Title III of the Single European Act and is done in a way which can only be of advantage to us in the future.  Article 36 (a) refers to co-ordinating positions on the political and economic aspects of security, that is, not on its defence or military aspects.  Furthermore to take account of, among other things, the fact that we are not members of NATO or of the Western European Union, Article 36 (c) says that nothing in the Single European Act shall impede those States which wish to co-operate more closely on security, that is, defence and military aspects, from doing so within the appropriate framework that is &mdash; and again very specifically &mdash; within the Western European Union or NATO.  It is important to spell out that the limits of what is and is not permissible are clearly set out and the Single European Act emphatically does not affect our neutrality in any way.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland, for all parts of the political spectrum, are justifiably proud of the role which our neutral position has assisted us to play in international affairs. I would not be at one with those who deride either the value or the substance of our policy of neutrality over the past years.  I might question many of those who refer to it as being a traditional policy.  I might question some of the historical arguments cited in favour of the genesis of the policy, but on its substance or its value at present, I would be &mdash; as indeed are my own party and the majority of Members of this House &mdash; a staunch defender of our present position on neutrality. Certainly, I would set my face very firmly against any attempt to change that position.  That policy of neutrality has given us a politically important role in international affairs, especially by sponsoring and promoting disarmament measures and by involving ourselves in UN peace-keeping measures.  Our participation in EPC does not diminish our continuing ability to pursue these or other worthy objectives, that is, objectives such <Col N="2077" /> as upholding the observance of human rights, or help in developing countries where we have given a lead to other European States through the work, first of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and then of the Minister of State, Deputy George Birmingham, which has been an example of commitment, effort and a sensible, thoughtout position of genuine help to the developing countries.  Nothing in EPC prevents us from giving a lead or taking a distinctive line in policies of this sort. We can be confident that our neutrality remains intact.  It remains intact because in the view of the vast majority of people in this country that it is the right and appropriate policy and the one which is of most benefit to us.  It will remain so long as the majority of the people want it.  There is no way in which our partners would want to pressurise us, or if they did, there is no way in which we would give in to any pressure to give up this policy of neutrality.</P>
    <P>I say very firmly today that talk about our policy of neutrality being eroded through the Single European Act or through our participation in European political co-operation has no basis in fact. It flies against the stated positions of all political leaders of this country going back over a very long period of time and it flies in the face of the stated wishes of the overwhelming majority of our people.  No Irish Government would have willingly entered into a Single European Act or European political co-operation were there the slightest threat to our neutrality. Such a threat does not exist. There is no threat and we should be very clear on that point.</P>
    <P>It is possible for us to see the extent to which our participation in European political co-operation has been of major value to this country in developing our foreign policy.  It has, to a certain extent, given us a space which we did not have before.  If we go back to the period prior to our entry to the EC, 1973, the issues, apart from Northern Ireland, and the points on which our Ministers for Foreign Affairs focused most of their attention were those which arose at the United <Col N="2078" /> Nations.  This was related to the fact that we had a small foreign service which had to concentrate on a narrow range of issues on which it was worthwhile seeking to bring our influence to bear.  Much good work was done in the &lsquo;fifties and&rsquo; sixties which enhanced this country's reputation and brought credit to those involved.  Our sponsorship in the non-proliferation treaty, and especially the outstanding work done over many dedicated years by Mr. Frank Aiken, when he was Minister for External Affairs, in the United Nations in seeking to focus attention on the proliferation of nuclear weapons and in carving out an independent foreign policy for this country, is something which will, always be to his credit and to the credit of the Government of which he was a member.</P>
    <P>Our involvement in the United Nations peace-keeping operations &mdash; painful as it has been at times and sad as it has been this week when another Irish soldier was killed in the line of duty, trying to keep peace in a war torn zone &mdash; is an example of what we were able to do as a small country with very few resources.  We were not, and we should not fool ourselves, able to influence the major international events of those days.  We did not have the capacity to do this but, if we had tried, we probably would not have been listened to.</P>
    <P>Our participation in European political co-operation has rapidly expanded the range of possibilities open to us.  There is probably no other member of the Twelve to whom European political co-operation has meant so much.  Now, in purely practical terms, instead of having to depend entirely on our own foreign service and on a small network of perhaps 25 to 30 embassies for information on what is happening with regard to issues which are discussed in the EPC, we are able to take advantage of the continued resources of the Twelve which cover practically the entire globe.  Generally speaking, the better the insights into problems which those who take decisions have, the more likely they are to make good decisions. This applies to decisions we take ourselves <Col N="2079" /> and to those which we take jointly with our partners.</P>
    <P>Of course, not all the information available to us within the EPC is of direct relevance to us but we now have a much firmer information base upon which to base the decisions which will influence our policy and our participation in EPC. But much more important than having access to information is having a place at the table where issues of common concern are discussed and having a real input into the decision making process.</P>
    <P>The EPC system of working groups enhances the entire range of foreign policy issues of concern to the Twelve from Asia to Latin America, from disarmament to terrorism.  Joint statements and actions of the Twelve carry weight and are heeded.  It is a great advantage to the smaller EC countries to be able to assist in formulating such statements and in deciding such actions.  We are able to use our influence and our persuasive powers either to try to bring our partners around to our point of view, as very specifically was the case in our attempts to impose sanctions on South Africa and the attempt to speed up the dismantling and destruction of the entire apartheid process, or to dissuade them from discussing something outside the accepted scope of EPC, such as specific disarmament proposals of the super powers or of one of the military alliances.</P>
    <P>We are in a position within EPC to have our point of view listened to and, at times, accepted.  This in no small measure is due to the extraordinarily high calibre of our foreign service.  It may be small in numbers but in terms of the dedication, expertise and commitment given by the members of our Department of Foreign Affairs, it is, I believe, on a par with any of those of the other member states, and better than most of them.  We gain more from the EPC process than we can possibly contribute.</P>
    <P>Nowadays Irish Ministers for Foreign Affairs are better informed and are more familiar with a wide range of issues than their predecesors were 14 years ago.  This is not just a question of patting ourselves <Col N="2080" /> on the back, nor is it a question of academic interest.  The reality is that our Ministers and diplomats are better equipped to pursue Ireland's political and economic interests abroad.  To give an example: Egypt and Hungary are two of the countries to which our Minister Deputy Peter Barry, paid official visits in recent months.  While there, in addition to discussing bilateral matters with his hosts &mdash; both countries are important trading partners for us &mdash; our Minister was able to speak authoritatively on a range of issues, such as East-West relations and developments in the Middle East in which these two countries are closely involved.  Today, any Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs would be able to participate much more effectively than would have been the case without the contacts, information and the position of influence we have through our participation in EPC.</P>
    <P>It is clear to anybody who cares to examine the facts that involvement in EPC does not impinge upon or erode our policy of neutrality nor does it affect our ability to take independent decisions on foreign policy issues where necessary. The Single European Act changes nothing of the practices, procedures or content of EPC.  It merely sets them out formally and provides for the existence of a small secretariat in Brussels to assist the Presidency.  Our interests are therefore no more likely to be constrained in the future than they have been in the past.  On the contrary, it will clearly remain in this country's interest to continue to avail of the advantages which participation in EPC offers us.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make refers back to what I said in my opening remarks about trying to cite the Single European Act within the context of what the European Community and future development within the Community are about. At one level the treaties of the Community are concerned solely with economic, commercial and social matters and do not say anything about political obligations but it is very clear and evident that the founding members of the Community were motivated by aspirations <Col N="2081" /> which went beyond what was set out in the treaty.  In the preamble to the EC Treaty they said they were determined to establish the foundations of an ever close reunion among the peoples of Europe. Since the 'fifties there has existed within the Community a shared ideal to reduce as far as possible the barriers in the member states so that Europe can play a more important role in world affairs and contribute more effectively to international peace.</P>
    <P>The goal of European Union by 1980 was set by the Heads of Government of the Six in 1970.  In other words, since before our accession to the Community we have understood and accepted that by casting our lot with the European Community we were committing ourselves to working with the other member states towards the goal of political unification in Europe.  It was also clearly understood that we were making no commitment of a military or defence nature, and that remains the position.</P>
    <P>The White Paper of January 1972, prior to the referendum on accession, made quite clear that we were joining more than a free trade area or a purely economic community.  It stated that Ireland's application for membership of the EC was made in full awareness of the political ideals and aims of the treaty which inspired the founding members of the Community.  The White Paper also stated that the then Government under Jack Lynch shared the conviction of the then six member states about Europe's role in the world, a conviction which pointed the way ahead towards the goal of political unification.  This view of the future of Europe in which Ireland should play a part was endorsed by an overwhelming vote in the referendum in favour of our membership in 1972.  The commitment to a shared future with our neighbours in Europe has been clearly reiterated by every Government here since our accession to the Community.  It is a commitment which is manifestly in accordance with the wishes of the Irish people and one which they will continue to support.</P>
    <P>We are part of Europe geographically, <Col N="2082" /> historically, culturally, ethically, economically, socially and politically.  It is in association with and in partnership with our European friends that our future lies. What is true in economics and technology also holds good in the political sphere. Only by pooling resources can optimum results be achieved to the benefit of all. Our political decision to join the European Community was a major step.  At the time it was not a very difficult step because when the arguments were made in 1971-72 it was a step which was clearly and logically to our benefit.  The small step which ratification of the Single European Act represents is entirely consistent with that original choice and is equally sensible and logical.</P>
    <P>European union is the goal.  What is at issue in this debate is not the form which European union will ultimately take; it is not how far we are prepared to go in one area or another and it is not how long it takes to achieve European Union.  What is at issue is whether we are prepared by rapidly ratifying the Single European Act along with our 11 partners, and we are doing it along with our 11 partners, to keep pace with them in taking this small step towards our common goal.  The question for us is whether or not we are willing to continue to be involved in the process of integration and unification thus helping to shape that process and helping it conform to our interests.  Are we going to opt for the alternative which is to opt out now and let our partners determine the future of Europe and, in consequence, the future of Ireland without our involvement?  That is not a realistic option.  The Single European Act is one which can be commended to the House and to the Irish people.</P>

      <P>First of all, it is necessary to say a few words in relation to the point on which Deputy Manning finished, that we are faced with a choice of either accepting the Single European Act as it stands or withdrawing from the EC.  That is an extraorinary position given the assurances which were repeated yesterday by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that this House is free and is <Col N="2083" /> entitled to decide on the terms agreed to in the EC.</P>
      <P>In 1972-73 when this matter was being debated the strongest selling point was the Treaty of Rome could not be changed without the approval of Dáil Éireann and of all the Parliaments in the EC.  Now we are being told that we must ratify an agreement signed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in February of this year, with no discussion in this House in relation to its terms, regardless of our concerns about the various aspects of it.  We have reached a deplorable state of affairs both in relation to the authority of this House and in relation to our relationship with the other member states of the European Community.  I do not believe you can reasonably expect a country to carry on being as European as Ireland has been since we joined the EC.  We have accepted virtually every proposal that came from the EC, much to the detriment of many areas of life in Ireland in some cases.  We cannot continue to do that unquestioningly.  We are now told that because an agreement has been signed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs this House must now ratify it or else.  That is an unacceptable position for this House to be in.  It is a position which this Government should never have allowed this House to get into in the first place. It has been a dereliction of duty of this Government to have got us into this position. There should have been adequate and full debate on the Single European Act in this House, as agreed by the 12 members, before it was signed.  If that was done we would not be in the predicament which is being threatened on us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's entry to the EC in 1973 was one of the most significant changes for the Irish economy and, one could argue, for our politics in relation to the rest of western Europe.  If the Dáil ratifies the Single European Act &mdash; it looks as if that will be the case &mdash; the nature of the EC and Ireland's participation in it will be changed once more.  The purpose of the Single European Act is to move the EC towards its main political objectives &mdash;<Col N="2084" /> the creation of a single internal market and west European political union.  The EC has often correctly been described in the past as a rich man's club.  While this may be less true today in that many of the less developed European countries are now members, what has not changed is the fact that it is clearly based on preserving and developing capitalism in western Europe.  Presumably, it is in relation to this preservation and development of capitalism in western Europe that the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated he is not neutral.  Presumably, these are the western values to which the Minister for Foreign Affairs owes his allegiance.  It is also aimed at establishing a power bloc among the western European countries.  If we can accept all that has been said by the other member states of the EC we must assume that the intention is to create a nuclear power bloc in western Europe.</P>
    <P>In the early fifties when the idea first began to take root it was intended to create a European defence community and to amalgamate the armies of western Europe to defend Europe against what is called the spectre of Soviet Communism. That effort failed.  So it was decided to try to create an economic community first of all and the political and military community would follow from that.  That process is in operation.  The Single European Act must be seen in the context of the intentions of the early founders of the EC.  It would be foolish for us to ignore those intentions.  As the last speaker and other speakers, said, the Single European Act is a step on the road towards European union.  Where I would differ from most Members is in how I see European union taking place and the type of European union that will be involved.  In 1972, our party opposed Ireland's entry to the EEC which at the time consisted of only the six original members, five of whom were former imperial powers.  It must be said that some of them still see themselves, if only in their day dreams, as imperial powers.  We believed at the time that it would be possible to develop an independent economy based on association with the EEC and other non-EEC <Col N="2085" /> countries.  However, 13 years later our economy is so inextricably linked to the EC it would be catastrophic for us to pull out.  In addition, the Community has now expanded to 12 member states, including many under-developed countries like ourselves.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party are convinced that our role, indeed the role of the Left in Ireland &mdash; in that category I include the Labour Party &mdash; should be to remain in the EC and form alliances with the progressive forces in other member states to fight and work for socialism and to insist on Ireland's right to develop and promote links with other non-aligned and neutral states on questions of world peace.  The problems of unemployment, of poverty, of decent housing and proper health care that are faced by the Irish working class are the same for the working class of the rest of western Europe. European capitalism has united and regenerated itself.  It has become more aggressive and has pushed for deregulation and privatisation.  It is in that context that the Single European Act must be viewed.  The Government have enthusiastically followed the line of deregulation and privatisation in line with the moves in Britain, France, Germany and, indeed, in the US which is in the NATO Alliance.</P>
    <P>It is my view that the working class of Ireland, and Europe, cannot effectively oppose the new capitalist unity that has developed in the EC and create a united socialist Europe by isolating itself, by withdrawing behind spurious national self interest or protectionism.</P>
    <P>The EC needs a relaunch but it must be in terms that will propel it in the direction of seeking peace, the denuclearisation of Europe, a common jobs policy and a policy to end poverty in Europe.  Unfortunately the Single European Act, as it stands, will harden the direction in which most of the economies of western Europe are going at present, a Thatcherite, Reaganite direction which tends to strengthen capitalism and privatise the State sector where it can and to <Col N="2086" /> deregulate employment to ensure cheap labour is available to be exploited.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party are extremely concerned about the implications of certain provisions of the Single European Act. Indeed, we were the first party, perhaps the only party, to raise a note of alarm about its terms and to have put our views in published form.  In February the Leader of The Workers' Party, Deputy Mac Giolla, wrote to the Taoiseach asking him not to allow the Minister for Foreign Affairs to sign the Act until such time as there had been a proper national debate on the implications of it for Ireland.  In Denmark the Act provoked a major political controversy and the Danish Government were forced to submit it to the people in a referendum before they signed it.  The Coalition Government here, on the other hand, went ahead and signed it, saying as little as possible about it, and without any real debate in the Dáil or elsewhere on its implications.</P>
    <P>Following is the signing of the Act, The Workers' Party undertook a study of its implications and put our views in booklet form, which was made available in order to try to generate the debate we felt was necessary on the Act.  When the document was launched in August Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla called for a renegotiation of the Act and outlined four main reasons why we felt we had to oppose it in its present form.  It is interesting to note that we are the only party in the House seeking to have it renegotiated.  Our four main reasons for opposing the Act are:</P>
    <P>1.  The Act jeopardises Irish neutrality.</P>
    <P>2.  The Act removes unanimity voting in certain areas of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>3.  The Act seeks the completion of the internal market by 1992 without any prior negotiations or proposals on derogations or regional aid for Ireland.</P>
    <P>4.  The Act in its proposals on tax harmonisation would impose a severe strain on Irish public finances.</P>
    <P>Nothing we have seen or heard since then <Col N="2087" /> has caused us to believe that our reservations were unfounded.  Indeed, events at the London Summit last week have emphasised the growing threat to Irish neutrality.  Statements made by the EC Commissioner, Lord Cockfield, confirm our views on tax harmonisation, and statements made by the Irish Council of the European Movement, a supporter of the Single European Act, have confirmed our concerns regarding regional aid.  That statement did not receive any public attention and I should like to quote from a document issued by the Irish Council of the European Movement circulated to all Members and dated 1 October 1986. On the question of economic and social cohesion the document stated:</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the cohesion objective is to be taken into account in the implementation of the internal market and in all common policies.  This provision will help Ireland secure recognition of our needs in the future development of important policy areas.</P>
    <P>There must, nonetheless, be some disappointment that there is no explicit reference to the need to provide additional financial resources for the structural funds.  A clear task of the Community therefore must be to ensure that adequate financial resources are made available to the structural funds to enable them to contribute towards the achievement of the objectives for economic and social cohesion set out in the Treaty.  Unless the question of increased funding is tackled as an immediate priority, there can be little prospect of a proper implementation of this section of the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>That is precisely the point we have been making in relation to regional aid.  There is no guarantee in the Single European Act in relation to the provision of proper regional aid or a policy structure to assist countries like Ireland that are on the periphery of the EC.</P>
    <P>The gradual erosion of Irish neutrality has been one of the most worrying features of Irish membership of the EC and <Col N="2088" /> there is now little doubt that the Single European Act will advance this process even further.  More and more in recent years the independent foreign policy line we had once pursued as a neutral nation has been dropped in favour of an overall EC pro-NATO position.  I must emphasise that The Workers' Party are not opposed to the principle of European political co-operation.  We believe it could be used to promote world peace, nuclear disarmament and the rights of developing countries, but as a neutral country and the only EC country with no obvious NATO connections, we must insist on the right of Ireland to pursue a genuinely neutral and non-aligned position. We cannot accept as a neutral country that foreign policy interests would automatically coincide with those of other major military powers in NATO, including nuclear countries such as France and the UK.  Certainly, if the Single European Act is ratified in its present form, the standing of Ireland as a neutral nation, both at the United Nations and among other neutral and non-aligned nations, will be considerably diminished.</P>
    <P>To see this more clearly it is necessary to look in some detail at the small print of the Act, and in particular at section 6, Article 30, Title III, but before doing so I want to refer to some of the other major problems which the Act is likely to create for Ireland.  Before I do that I welcome the very small, very slight enhancement of the role of the European Parliament. It is our view that the Parliament should be strengthened and democraticised and the power of the Commission reduced.</P>
    <P>One of the major provisions in the Single European Act is the greater use of qualified majority voting at the Council. Majority voting takes place at present but the practice on sensitive issues has been to adopt measures by unanimity.  Ireland has three votes out of a possible 76 on the Council under this weighted voting system.  Under qualified majority voting in order to be adopted, an Act of the Council will require (a) at least 54 votes in favour where the Treaty requires them to be adopted on a proposal of the Commission or (b) 54 votes in favour cast by <Col N="2089" /> at least eight members in other cases.  The extension of qualified majority voting will clearly weaken Ireland's position on the Council.  As a weak economy on the edge of Europe, Ireland needs the protection of unanimity to defend its interests.</P>
    <P>I want to deal specially with regional policy.  Though much of the debate outside has concentrated on neutrality, which of course is a very important matter, we think that regional policy is of equal importance.  The section of the Act on economic and social cohesion seems to include the EC Treaty Articles promoting harmonious development, economic and social cohesion and a reduction in disparity between regions and the backwardness of least favoured regions.  The Act states that implementation of common policies and the internal market should take account of these objectives and contribute to their achievement.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act in Article 130 states that once the Act comes into force the Commission will submit proposals to the Council to amend the operation and structure of the existing funds, to rationalise, clarify and make them more efficient.  The Council will have to act within one year after consulting the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee.  Once the decision has been taken, the Council will make implementation decisions on the ERDF by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission in co-operation with the European Parliament.  Article 8 (b) is also relevant.  It allows provision to be made, including temporary derogations, in the case of economies showing differences in development.</P>
    <P>This part of the Act is very much a pig in a poke.  We are expected to accept the Act imposing an internal market by 1992 without any concrete guarantees or realistic proposals on regional development and without a time limit to implement regional policies capable of developing weaker regions.  As one of the weakest economies, Ireland's position should be a priority one for regional aid, and any further opening up of the EC <Col N="2090" /> through the internal market will require a comprehensive regional aid scheme for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we should be demanding a special regional policy for Ireland.  At present EC regional policies are more geared towards Mediterranean countries. Ireland should demand a special scheme before it even considers implementing the Act and the internal market. In the second periodical report on the regions, published in March 1984 by the EC Commission, covering the period 1970-81 and 1977-1981 and 1983 the position of Ireland is clearly demonstrated in the summary.  This is recognised as follows:</P>
    <P>Over the last ten years regional disparities in production and productivity have not lessened but remained very substantial.  The regions with the poorest performance expressed in <i>per capita</i> gross domestic product are situated in the west and south periphery of the Community.  The effective conclusion is that the serious situation of the regions with a development lag on the periphery of the Community has been exacerbated in the present crisis situation. At the same time, new problems stemming immediately from the crisis are now emerging in the more highly industrialised and central regions.</P>
    <P>Presumably the last reference was to ship building and the textile industry in Europe.  In July 1985 a summary booklet on the Community and its regions, covering ten years of the Regional Development Fund, contains a foreword which states:</P>
    <P>Can we really believe that eliminating obstacles to trade and establishing a unified market could alone ensue or at least facilitate harmonious development?  We would be deluding ourselves if we did.  Similarly, capital flows have not always been in the desired directions.  The less advanced regions have not attracted sufficient investment whereas the more developed ones have profited more <Col N="2091" /> rapidly and more fully from the free movement of goods.</P>
    <P>The general comment is that the basic principle of the Common Market rests on free trade in goods and services, that is to say, trade not subject to any obstacles or impediments.  However, when differences in industrial development are unduly large there is a danger that trade might become one way.  The booklet goes on:</P>
    <P>Worse still, in a free trade system the strongest economics may bring about the collapse of fledgling industries in the weaker economies.  Effective ground rules are therefore needed at Community level for as long as the development gaps exceed an econimically acceptable threshold.  In such cases, aids and grants, though normally prohibited, are allowed and tax concessions may be granted, albeit in conformance with Community rules drawn up jointly with the member states.</P>
    <P>Yet we are being told in effect that unless we agree on the Single European Act, which has no guarantees whatever in relation to aid for Ireland, we may have to pull out of the EC or the other member states cannot be expected to be as flaitheamhlach with us in the future.  It boggles the mind how the Government got us into this position.  We are being asked to ratify the Single European Act which says the internal market will be completed by 1992 and yet we will only start discussing reforms of regional aid and the various regional funds when it has been ratified. It will be a year before any proposals come from it.  We are led to believe then that, in some way, everybody agrees that Ireland and other EC countries will be effectively assisted in terms of the aid we need to protect our economies.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the Single European Act to which I might refer is tax harmonisation.  The proposals for harmonisation of indirect taxes, such as VAT and excise duties, could have a very serious impact on our economy.  It is likely to lead to a reduction of as much as £1,000 million in Government revenue <Col N="2092" /> assuming that the taxes were to be levelled down to their present positions within the EC.  In effect that would be equal to approximately one-sixth of all taxes collected at this time.  That shortfall could be met by cutting public expenditure, on which we know the present Government are quite keen.  Equally it could be met by increasing other existing taxes.  Again, when one examines the position one finds that one is talking about increasing the PAYE taxes, or it could be achieved partially, not wholly, by widening the tax base.  Given the lack of willingness on the part of successive Governments to widen the tax base it can be assumed that inevitably this will lead either to more cuts in public expenditure or to an increase in other existing taxes, creating other serious problems here.</P>
    <P>I recognise that tax harmonisation is one of the areas in respect of which unanimity has been retained.  It is significant that this Government were not even prepared to admit that there was a problem in relation to it until Lord Cockfield, a Vice-President of the EC, came here and spoke about the need to harmonise taxation and to impose VAT on food, electricity and a whole range of other commodities.  Only then did our Minister for Finance suddenly say: we will not agree to this.  It is there in the Single European Act, we should be aware that it is there and that it is a cause for concern.</P>
    <P>I might revert to the question of the threat to our neutrality posed by the Act particularly by Title III because that is where the question of European political co-operation is set.  Article 30.6 (a) of Title III commits members to closer co-operation on questions of European security as a means of developing a European identity in external policy matters. The first sentence of that Article is a clear statement of intent to include security as part of the European political co-operation process, the first time that this has been explicitly expressed in writing.  The second sentence of Article 30.6 (a) states the current <i>de facto</i> position, in other words, that they are ready to co-ordinate <Col N="2093" /> their positions more closely on the political and economic aspects of security. The second sentence can be read as a separate statement.  There is nothing in the section to say that the first sentence is limited to the parameters outlined in the second.  As this Act is intended to formalise the European political co-operation process and the range of its activities for some years to come we cannot assume that questions of European security are limited to the political and economic aspects of security.  This section can also be read to mean that the political and economic aspects of security are merely part of the broader questions of European security outlined in the first sentence. While the Government say they do not see it this way the fact remains that Article 30.6 (a) of Title III is worded so ambiguously that it will allow for different interpretations and so pose a threat to Irish neutrality.</P>
    <P>Also the term &ldquo;economic aspects of security&rdquo; contained in the second sentence of Article 30.6 (a) clearly permits the development of a common policy for armaments and defence industries.... Section 6 (b) more directly threatens this and states:</P>
    <P>The High Contracting Parties are determined to maintain the technological and industrial conditions necessary for their security.</P>
    <P>That sentence must be considered in the context of the multitude of reports, recommendations and resolutions adopted by the EC seeking the development of a common armaments industrial policy for the Community.  It is not alone interesting but important to recall in this context that, at a summit held in Dublin, this country agreed to a report by a Monsieur Fauré, under pressure from President Francois Mitterand, that the Ten approve the guidelines laid down in a report by Monsieur Fauré which provided for consultations on developments in weapons technology and strategic doctrines and support for the rationalisation of research by the Ten &mdash; this was before the expansion of the Community to Twelve &mdash; in the field of military equipment. <Col N="2094" /> It also provided for support for the production capacity of high technology equipment.  The Single European Act backed-off that.  It has to be acknowledged that Ireland, under pressure, agreed to it, as did admittedly also, Greece and Denmark, who were reluctant but nonetheless did agree at a summit.  They backed-off it in the Single European Act.  What is to stop similar pressures being mounted in the future in relation to section 6 (b)?  The step-by-step approach adopted in relation to reaching the positions which have been reached in the Single European Act seeks a common foreign policy, a common armaments industrial policy leading to a common defence policy.  There is no point in any Minister in this House denying that that is the aim of most of the major countries who are members of NATO in relation to the EC.</P>
    <P>The first sentence of section 6 (b) taken in conjunction with 6 (a) &mdash; which refers to the economic aspects of security &mdash; clearly implies a development of a common policy for defence industries. Sections 6 (a) and (b) in this respect, therefore, pose a threat to our neutrality.</P>
    <P>I come now to article 30.6 (c) which I consider to be one of the most important and which says:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Title will impede closer co-operation in the field of security between certain of the High Contracting Parties within the framework of the Western European Union or the Atlantic Alliance.</P>
    <P>The Government maintain that this protects Irish neutrality as it allows those who want to discuss security proper to do so within the Western European Union and NATO, I contend it does nothing of the kind for it is explicit in this section that Ireland is prevented from pursuing a policy which would threaten the participation of other EC States in NATO and the WEU.  Therefore, while European political co-operation discusses the political and economic aspects of security &mdash; and in the first sentence of section 6 (a) it may even allow for discussion of the broader areas of security &mdash; European <Col N="2095" /> political co-operation will be limited by section 6 (c) in how far it can influence NATO members toward a policy of disarmament or non-alignment.  To my mind; that is a restriction on Ireland's capacity to operate as a neutral power within the EC process.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier in relation to threats, unless we agree to this Act, there will be a dire outcome for us.  In my view this is treating Ireland as a less than equal member of the EC, a less than equal member of the European political co-operation process.  Assurances given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and others that the Act does not compromise our neutrality are in direct conflict with the evidence available from other member states.  For instance, evidence given by the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office to a House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee is in complete conflict with the assurances that the proposed formulated European political co-operation has nothing to do with NATO and would not bring us any closer to involvement in that military allience. The Third Report of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, for the 1985-86 sessions quotes a memorandum from the Foreign Office which claims credit for initiating the formulation of the EC process and adds that part of its objective is to affirm as strongly as possible the intention of the member states to cooperate on security questions within political co-operation, and that co-operation on strictly defence matters must remain firmly within the framework of the alliance but the more effective co-operation of the Twelve on the wider aspects of security could make a significant contribution to the objectives of the NATO alliance.</P>
    <P>That shows clearly that the British Governments at least believe that the role of the EPC as envisaged in the Single European Act is basically to contribute to the objectives of NATO.  If, as Deputy Barry claims, the other EC members do not want to do anything to damage Irish neutrality, why have the Government <Col N="2096" /> refused to go back to them and ask them to redraft the controversial Articles to remove all elements of ambiguity or doubt?  The textual amendments necessary to remove all doubt about Irish neutrality would be quite small and would be unlikely to affect the other member states, assuming that their goodwill towards Irish neutrality is genuine.</P>
    <P>Most remarkable of all, the Government have failed to explain why, if the term &ldquo;security&rdquo; does not include military aspects of security, this was not stated in Title III either.  However, the most telling indication of what our position has become was revealed at the London Summit last weekend when matters more appropriate to NATO were discussed informally over dinner, we are told, and when a statement was issued relating to NATO and military matters, apparently without the knowledge of the Taoiseach. These events give a clear indication of the political minefield we will be entering if the Single European Act is ratified in its present form.  Statements made by the Taoiseach and others threatening dire consequences if we do not ratify the Act as it stands raise important questions about the nature of our relationship with other EC countries, as I have alluded to.</P>
    <P>During the referendum campaign on Irish membership in 1972 and in the White Paper, too, advocates of EC membership assured us that one of the greatest protections available to Ireland was that the Treaty we were then asked to agree to could be changed only with the consent of the parliaments of all member states including Dáil Éireann.  Now we are told that if the Dáil does not unconditionally ratify the Single European Act then immediate and terrible things will happen to us.  It has, I might say, echoes of Lloyd George diplomacy.  If we surrender to this moral blackmail on this occasion and agree to ratify the Single European Act with no change, then we will be creating a very dangerous precedent.  If we ratify the Act under this pressure, what is to stop the other EC members in six months or six years coming back to us and saying, &ldquo;You must agree to change the terms again, you must agree to a definition of <Col N="2097" /> security which will explicitly include military security; you must agree to military matters being discussed within the EC or your membership will be in jeopardy or financial aid for Ireland from the Community will be threatened.&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>The Government have not properly addressed themselves to this aspect in the debate on this issue.  They have not explained how it is that we have, at least in theory, the right to refuse to ratify this Act while at the same time we are told that if we refuse we can no longer remain members of the EC.</P>
    <P>The amendment which Fianna Fáil have tabled to the motion before the Dáil is a substantial climb down from the position on the Single European Act expressed by party spokespeople in the past few weeks.  In a letter to the Irish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament dated 20 October, the Fianna Fáil Chief Whip, Deputy Brady, stated that Fianna Fáil &mdash; not himself &mdash; would be opposing the legislation when it came before the Dáil.  Deputy Haughey yesterday in his contribution made it clear that they would not be opposing the Single European Act, they would not be seeking its renegotiation.  In deciding to back the Single European Act the Parliamentary Labour Party are also clearly ignoring the concerns about the terms of the Act expressed by the trade unions, the party's own administrative council and their rank and file members.  The declaration relating to neutrality and regional aid which Fianna Fáil in their amendment are asking the Government to annex to the instrument of ratification would be of little value.  It would not be part of the Single European Act, consequently there would be no legal obligation or any other kind of obligation on any of the other member states to take any notice of it whatsoever.  Fianna Fáil by tabling this amendment and the Labour Party, by asking the Government to arrange for a separate Dáil motion re-affirming Irish neutrality are acknowledging clearly that the terms of the Single European Act as signed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in February last are unsatisfactory, <Col N="2098" /> but for their own political reasons they are failing to follow through the logic of that by voting against the Act in its present form and thereby forcing the Government to re-negotiate it to provide the guarantees necessary to protect Irish interests.  The Labour Party do not want to vote against the Act in case that provokes a general election in which clearly they would suffer huge losses. Fianna Fáil do not want to vote against it because they do not want the Single European Act to be a major issue in a subsequent general election as they fear that such a development might jeopardise their support among the farming community.</P>
    <P>It appears at this point that The Workers' Party are the only ones in this House who are seeking to have the Act renegotiated.  We have tabled two amendments, an amendment to the motion ratifying this Single European Act and a Second Stage amendment to the Bill which seeks to bring to Irish legislation that part of the Act which has to be dealt with in that way, sections 1 and 2.  I ask the House to support that amendment and also our amendment on Second Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>There are two questions which must be addressed in the course of this debate &mdash; a question of fact and a question of judgment.  The question of fact is what the Single European Act actually is.  The question of judgment is whether it is in this country's best interests.  There has been a regrettable tendency among some opponents of the Single European Act over the past few months to seek to make a judgment about the merits of the Single European Act without first addressing the question of what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Judgments which are not based on the facts of a case are without value.  If the facts of this case were different, if the contents of the Single European Act were what its opponents claim them to be, then indeed we would be facing the gravest of choices.  If the Single European Act would, for example, bring about the harmonization <Col N="2099" /> of taxation in the Community against this country's wishes, if it would undermine our sovereignty and neutrality or if it would abolish the veto, then the opponents of the Single European Act might well be right to call for its rejection, but, of course, the Single European Act contains no such implications.  Arguments which attribute nonexistent contents and implications to the Single Act can only be worthless in their conclusions.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, important in this debate never to lose sight of what it is we are actually discussing.  We are discussing a short document which was negotiated with Ireland's full participation and signed with our full agreement.  We are discussing a document which is in its final legal form and to which no provisions or implications can be added beyond what is clearly set down for all to see.  We are discussing a document which has been available for about a year and which has been explained by the Government on numerous occasions.</P>
    <P>The suggestions of undue haste certainly rings hollow.  The suggestion that there has been a lack of seriousness in keeping the Dáil informed is mind-boggling. Throughout the negotiating procedures the Dáil was informed and reports of the Taoiseach after successive meetings of the European Council as to the progress of the negotiations were the subject of comment in the reports of developments in the Community which were laid before the House from time to time.  The procedure being followed here is precisely the procedure that is followed on every occasion when the Government finds themselves engaged in international negotiations.  The negotiations are concluded and on their conclusion the proposals are brought before the House for ratification or otherwise.  That is the procedure that is followed in matters as momentous as the Anglo-Irish Agreement and in matters as relatively trivial as some that now come before the House because of the obligation that anything that can conceivably involve a charge of public funds must be approved by the <Col N="2100" /> Dáil.  There has not been a departure from normal practice, except to the extent that, unusually, it was possible to keep this House and public opinion fully informed about the process of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>What is the Single European Act?  It is overdue, modest and logical.  In its implications, it is very positive from this country's point of view.  The Single European Act is overdue because it has been clear for many years that the Community was in need of a new impetus.  The decision-making process which had been designed for a Community of Six was clearly in need of reform after the successive enlargements of the Community. It was widely perceived that the European Parliament, now directly-elected for the second time, should be given an enhanced role in that process.  I very much appreciate that that objective at least received the endorsement of Deputy De Rossa.  Above all, it was recognised that the Community had in many respects been falling behind its main trading rivals, that the imperatives of international trade and competition advance even while the Community stagnates and that the Community should be enabled to avail of its vast market and thereby to reach its fully economic and technological potential.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act, although worthwhile, is also unquestionably modest in its implications.  It must be recalled that several member states are considerably more reserved than Ireland in their commitment to closer European integration, and that Ireland throughout this whole process has taken an advanced position.  Ireland has stood alongside the original members of the Community. Indeed, at the Milan European Council in June 1985, three member states opposed the decision to convene the Intergovernmental Conference which led to the Single European Act.  It was, therefore, inevitable that the outcome of the conference would not represent the major leap forward in the development of the Community which many member states and the European Parliament had hoped to see.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2101" /> The Single European Act, which has been criticised by many for not going far enough, is modest in comparison with the Draft Treaty on European Union adopted by the European Parliament in 1984.  It is modest in comparison with the report of the Dooge Committee which constituted the principal basis of discussion at the Milan European Council last year and it is modest in comparison with a number of more far-reaching proposals which were put forward in the course of the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act is also a logical development for the Community.  It does not prescribe a new direction for the Community in the years ahead.  It equips the Community to make progress towards the achievement of its longstanding and fundamental objectives.  It does not represent for the Community an impulsive foray into new pastures.  It stems directly from the perceived and experienced need to overcome both particular obstacles and general inertia and to advance along the path long prescribed in the original Community treaties.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act is also very positive for the overall development of the Community and, in particular, from Ireland's point of view.  There is not need to rehearse once again the detailed provisions of the Act.  It would, however, be useful if I were to illustrate briefly how the major provisions of the Single European Act respond to real needs of the Community and, in many instances, to the concerns put forward by this country in the course of the negotiations.  While the positive effect of the various provisions and where they will lead in the years ahead has already been explained on many occasions, I would like to dwell briefly on the seeds of experience from which those provisions have grown over recent years.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the completion of the internal market constitutes a new development.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  That has been an objective from the beginning.  The sense in which that has been a central objective is indicated by the fact that the Community <Col N="2102" /> has so often been referred to as being the European Common Market. That gives some indication of how central this objective has been.  The Community is and always has been much more than a market.  If it is much more than a market, it remains the case that the abolition of obstacles to trade has been a fundamental pillar of the Community.</P>
    <P>Much progress has, of course, been made towards the achievement of a Common Market and tariff barriers within the Community have been entirely removed.  However, numerous obstacles to trade remain.  Different technical standards in the various member states, different health and safety regulations and different public purchasing policies are examples of the fragmentation which persists in the Community market.  This fragmentation prevents the individual member states from deriving full benefit from belonging, as they do, to the largest market in the world and it hinders the Community as a whole from reaching its full economic potential and from competing effectively with its main trading rivals &mdash; the United States and Japan &mdash; which are not, of course, hampered by similar barriers within their own domestic markets.</P>
    <P>Those member states which are most heavily dependent on exports and which export most of their products to other Community countries have particular reason to press for the completion of the internal market.  Ireland is one of the most export-dependent countries in the developed world.  Last year we sold well over two-thirds, about 70 per cent, of our exports to our European partners.  It is evident we have much to gain nationally by moves to facilitate trade in the Community. I pointed out the progress which has been made with regard to the tariffs but obstacles remain and I mentioned what some of them are.</P>
    <P>Why the failure to move towards a single, unified community market?  One of the main reasons for the failure to bring about a single, unified Community market almost 30 years after the signature of the EC treaty has been the requirement that measures to harmonise <Col N="2103" /> the laws and regulations in member states are subject to an unanimous decision by the Council.  That is why it is clearly in the broader interests of the Community and the member states that obstacles to internal Community trade should be removed.  History has shown us that the task of removing those barriers has advanced at a snail's pace in an international trading environment in which the race is so often to the swift.  The unanimity requirement which applied even in cases where no important national interests were involved meant that the pursuit of short term and often marginal national advantage has worked in the broader perspective against the national interests of all.</P>
    <P>It was those weaknesses in the Community's decision making capacity which were ultimately responsible for the Community's market being distinctly less than common and for the inevitable consequences of that failure to move towards a genuine common market.  The provisions of the Single European Act which deal with the completion of the internal market are carefully designed and precisely formulated in order to overcome those specific weaknesses.  They do not represent some blind lurch along the road towards European integration.  They are a direct and calculated response to the needs of the Community which I have described.</P>
    <P>It is worth emphasising that those provisions did not come down on tablets of stone nor was it that members of the Council turned up in Brussels one particular Monday morning to find them waiting for them on the table.  They were negotiated carefully and precisely.  In many respects they reflect the particular concerns of Ireland, for example, in our insistence on the retention of the unanimity requirement for all fiscal matters and in other respects they reflect the particular concerns of some of our partners. They do not, as has been suggested by some opponents of the Act, represent a blanket move towards majority voting. They do involve a limited extension of majority voting.  I acknowledge that this <Col N="2104" /> was conceded by Deputy De Rossa. Majority voting is already provided for in many cases under the existing treaties. Some of those are areas of very considerable importance to the Community and some of them are areas of very particular importance to this country.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a criticism of those provisions, the only valid criticism which can be made is that in responding to the Community's stagnation over a period of many years they have been regrettably slow in coming.  As they were so slow in coming, they are all the more essential for that.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Single European Act concerning the European Parliament also respond to a need which has been recognised for some time.  The original treaty described the European Parliament as an assembly and contemplated a European Parliament consisting of people sent along by their national parliaments. So it was to consist for more than two decades.  But, in 1979, the members of the Parliament were elected for the first time by direct universal franchise. There has been a second such election since.  That represented not only a significant development for the Community but also, in the wider historical perspective, the relationship which is possible between a group of democratic nations.  After the first and then the second direct election it was increasingly evident that the enhanced stature of a directly elected Parliament should be complemented by increasing its scope.</P>
    <P>That is precisely what the Single European Act is all about.  That is precisely what the provisions of the Single European Act dealing with the European Parliament are designed to do.  The new co-operation procedure which Deputy Manning dealt with in some detail means that the Council will inevitably have to take greater account of Parliament's views. The requirement that Parliament's assent will in the future be required before the conclusion by the Community of accession and association agreements self-evidently represents a reasonable development.  Finally &mdash; this is perhaps as much of linguistic importance as anything <Col N="2105" /> else &mdash; the provision that the body to which we directly elect our representatives should be known as a parliament rather than an assembly is long overdue.</P>
    <P>What of the Commission?  One of the functions of the European Commission is to implement the Acts adopted by the Council.  For that purpose the Council confers extensive implementing and management powers on the Commission on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  It is neither desirable, nor, as Deputy Flynn who has served on more than one Council of Ministers would concede, possible from a practical point of view for the efficient execution of Community business on a day to day basis to be the concern of the Council.</P>
    <P>From our point of view what has to be recalled is that the Commission have a key role in the defence of the interests of the Community as a whole which is particularly important to Ireland and the other smaller member states.  What we also have to recall is that the efficient management and implementation of Community policies of which we are major beneficiaries are absolutely in our national interest and it is absolutely in our national interest that delays and blockages should be avoided.  Therefore, the enhanced powers and the streamlining of procedures can only work to our advantage.</P>
    <P>In the process of the negotiations on the Single European Act it was considered that there should be a more systematic basis for conferring implementing powers on the Commission than the essentially <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements which had existed up until then.  It was also recognised that in order to avoid in the future the very lengthy delays which are sometimes involved in determining the procedures which are to govern the Commission's implementing and management powers in a particular case, delays from which we have suffered in the past, the Council should decide unanimously on certain general principles and rules to govern those procedures.  The provisions of the Single European Act respond precisely to those needs and they reflect those considerations while at the <Col N="2106" /> same time taking on board the understandable concerns.  Therefore, continued safeguards for the interests of the member states are stipulated.</P>
    <P>One issue on which there seems to be a broad consensus, I take it from the comments of Deputy Manning and the enthusiastic support they drew from Deputy Wilson, is the provisions on research and technology.</P>

I would ask the Taoiseach to keep a special eye on the progress of these <Col N="2108" /> cases, particularly the case of the Birmingham Six which is coming near resolution in the context of its referral by the British Home Secretary to the court of appeal.  It is absolutely imperative that this case be referred to the court of appeal.

Anything we can do to ensure full and fair consideration with a view to review will be done.  I am only anxious in my reply to preserve the relationship with the political leaders in Britain which is best maintained by not making statements about what has been said.  The Deputy should be in no doubt about our concern.  The leaders of all parties in Britain are aware of our concern and we are pursuing the matter in any way open to us.

In that connection, would the Taoiseach consider giving the House a full and complete statement on these cases during discussion on the Second Stage of the extradition legislation?

      <P>My statutory powers in relation to the operation of cable systems are laid down in the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926 (Wired Broadcast Relay Licence) Regulations 1974, S.I. No. 67 of 1974, and in general are confined to laying down technical specifications for such systems, to approving charges and to ensuring that cable licensees do not unreasonably refuse to provide service.  The technical specifications are designed to minimise degradation of signal from the reception point to the subscribers' connection point and to meet certain safety requirements. It needs to be emphasised that cable systems cannot improve the quality of signal received at the reception point and since UK signals received here are of a fringe nature they will always be susceptible to fading and interference.</P>
      <P>Complaints about the day to day operations of cable television companies are primarily a matter to be dealt with underthe terms of the contract between the subscriber and the cable company in question.  My Department from time to time carry out technical audits of cable systems, particularly where there is some evidence that the specifications are not being met and this practice will continue within the resources available.  However the primary responsibility &mdash; and commercial imperative &mdash; to provide satisfactory service rests on the cable operator.</P>

Sometimes many faults which are attributed to the cable companies are not actually their responsibility but due to the fringe nature of the reception and the fact that it is not possible to improve the reception as taken from the air.  However, there have been indications of laxity on the part of the cable company to have that matter investigated. This can be done and in one case the licence was suspended.

I do not think that the print media can compare with it.  I fully accept what the Deputy says.  RTE's current policy in relation to Irish language programming was set out in Bord na Gaeilge's action plan.  The aim is the provision of 20 per cent of home produced programmes in Irish.  The siting of the television studio near one of the Gaeltacht areas would be covered by Galway in so far as it could be classed, while being a satellite station, as being a television facility, at least.  The objectives of increased resources to meet increased hours of broadcasting of Radio na Gaeltachta, the equipment of researchers and programme staff who have facility in the Irish language, the effecting of an increase in the use of the Irish language in RTE through bilingualism and avoidance <Col N="2112" /> of dumping of imported programmes have been met in part but certainly the 20 per cent targeted programmes in Irish has not been met.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Communications the progress, if any, he has made in acquiring fifth freedom rights for Aer Lingus and other Irish air companies in Britain and other EC countries.</P>

      <P>In recent discussions with the UK authorities on the revision of the Ireland/UK Air Services agreement, the Minister has stressed that fifth freedom rights would have to form an integral part of any package of measures agreed.  In particular, the Minister has sought the restoration of previously held fifth freedom rights which were withdrawn by the UK authorities in the seventies.  He sees restoration of these rights as a first step and is pursuing in the broader EC context the grant of fifth freedom rights on a multilateral basis.</P>
      <P>Last May, following discussions between the Department of Communications and the French Civil Aviation Administration, the French authorities agreed to restore to Aer Lingus fifth freedom rights through Lourdes to Rome, Barcelona and Malaga, which had been withdrawn some years ago.  The French authorities also agreed to consider favourably possible applications by Aer Lingus to operate pilgrimage charter services between Belfast and/or Glasgow and Lourdes. The agreement is valid for one year but may be renewed annually.</P>
      <P>Generally, the Minister is dissatisfied with the lack of progress in agreeing a more competitive EEC air transport policy.  In the area of market access in particular, he has found it necessary to table additional proposals which include fifth freedom rights and these are the subject of discussion at Council of Ministers level.  He will be pursuing this matter vigorously at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers on 15/16 December, 1986.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned restoration as being his first priority.  Is he referring there to the fifth freedom right which was enjoyed by Aer Lingus, Manchester-Amsterdam, and what are the possibilities of the restoration of this right in the near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring in particular to these arrangements with us and also the freedom rights as far as Air France are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2114" /> The Ireland-UK air service agreement originally provided for fifth freedom rights for Irish airlines on the following lines: Shannon and/or Dublin-Manchester-Brussels and/or Amsterdam and/or Dusseldorf and/or Frankfurt; Shannon and/or Dublin-Manchester-/Amsterdam and/or Copenhagen; Shannon and/or Dublin-Manchester-Zurich and/or Rome; Shannon and/or Dublin-Jersey-Lourdes. These rights were withdrawn by the UK authorities between 1973 and 1978.  In discussions with the UK authorities on the introduction of more liberal air service agreements we have stressed the view that fifth freedom rights would have to form an integral part of any liberalisation package agreed.  We have sought the restoration of the rights that I have just outlined as a first stage, to be followed by additional rights which would require multilateral agreement. The withdrawn rights are still available as far as third countries are concerned. UK agreement is the only obstacle to their restoration.  The UK position has, nevertheless, been a progress in the area of a fifth freedom which could best be made in a multilateral rather than a bilateral context and matters relating to third and fourth freedom rights would first have to be sorted out.  The talks on these matters are expected to resume early in the new year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the talk of liberalisation of air transport which we hear, particularly from the British Minister of Aviation, is talk of pseudo-liberalisation and is not genuine, seeing that these rights were taken away from a company that established business on those routes?  Would the Minister not say that it is a matter of some urgency now that those rights should be restored?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has consistently made the point that he is totally dissatisfied with the rate of progress that is taking place at all levels as far as liberalisation is concerned.  In that regard, we announced today we would grant approval for a UK registered company to <Col N="2115" /> fly a commuter service between Sligo and Dublin which is in progress and an indication of a liberal attitude on our part.  It will mean a twice daily commuter service to Sligo.</P>

      <P>I would be grateful to receive those details.  The Minister mentioned restoration of rights by France.  I know that Aer Lingus had developed a business to France, especially on the Lourdes run, but that Air France then intervened and demanded a certain <i>quid pro quo</i>.

      <P>Negotiations took place in Paris last May between the Irish and French aviation administrations, at the request of the French.

      <P>The east-bound freighters had a fifth right basis between New York, Boston and Shannon because of the contract Air France had with Digital.  They sought the right to operate a second freighter, which they received and, in return, the French agreed to restore fifth freedom rights to Aer Lingus through Lourdes, Rome, Barcelona and Malaga. Aer Lingus had those rights up to a few years ago but they were withdrawn by the French.  The French authorities also agreed favourably to consider a possible application by Aer Lingus to operate pilgrim charter services between Belfast and/or Glasgow and Lourdes.  The agreement is valid for one year from 22 May 1986 and may be renewed at yearly intervals. In the event of the Digital contract being terminated, the agreement will also be terminated.</P>

      <P>The Marine Rescue Coordination Centre which is under the aegis of my Department are responsible for the reception and dissemination of information in relation to marine distress signals originating in the sea areas <Col N="2117" /> covered by the centre and for the coordination of marine rescue measures in these areas.  The centre is located at Shannon Airport and is operated on a 24-hours basis by my Department's air traffic services.</P>
      <P>The system of marine search and rescue in the State involves a number of rescue agencies including the Naval Service, the Air Corps, the coast life saving service, the coast radio stations at Valentia and Malin Head, a number of port radio installations, the Garda Síochána and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. The MRCC can also ask for assistance when needed from the British Navy, the RAF and the British coast radio stations. In addition, shipping in the vicinity of a casualty, and in a position to assist, can be called upon by the centre.</P>
      <P>These various agencies provide a comprehensive marine rescue service.  The arrangements are, however, subject to regular review to ensure that they meet prevailing needs as fully as possible within the constraints of the resources available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that a &ldquo;comprehensive service&rdquo; is a bit optimistic especially in relation to recent craft off the south-west Cork coast?  It is ridiculous to talk about a 24-hour service when we do not even have a helicopter which can operate at night.  Does the Minister agree that our only policy is to wait around for stricken craft to run aground?  Can he give us any assurance in relation to the south-west Cork coast, which is adjacent to a busy shipping lane, that there will be a specific strategy to deal with stricken vessels when they call for help?</P>

      <P>There is a committee associated with the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre who keep all these matters constantly under review.  Naturally, they will all be taken into consideration to see how they might be improved.  Regrettably, we do not have a massive service which can be called <Col N="2118" /> into operation when there is a disaster. However, there is an improvement in regard to helicopters and I understand that two will be made available on a full time basis to the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre.</P>

      <P>In relation to the south-west coast, has any cognisance been taken of the Costello report regarding certain measures which could be taken? It is a bit late to have a committee reviewing this matter &mdash; I know that is the style of the Government &mdash; but we have had reviews to stagnation point by now.  Have any lessons been learned from the disaster of almost a decade ago, from the report of the Costello Tribunal or the difficulties we had with two vessels off the south-west Cork coast three weeks ago?</P>

      <P>As I have already indicated in response to previous Questions, pensioners of Irish Shipping Limited who were in receipt of <i>ex-gratia</i> payments from the company at the time of its liquidation have since had these <i>ex-gratia</i> payments taken up and paid by the Exchequer.  The number of pensioners involved at the outset was 45.  The total amount paid up to 30 November 1986 is £125,752.  The amounts involved range from £4.50 to £784.25 per month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the legal constraints previously mentioned by the Ministers which allegedly prevent the Government from paying adequate compensation to these employees who have given tremendous service to the State and who lost their jobs?  They would be <i>ex-gratia</i> payments as I understand them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>All the former employees of Irish Shipping Limited who made application for statutory redundancy payments have received their redundancy and other statutory entitlements from the Department of Labour.  I concentrated on one aspect of this question because I thought the Deputy was referring to what is technically known as <i>ex-gratia</i> payments. The cost of statutory payments to date is approximately £638,000 and I understand this represents the bulk of the payments to be made.  As regards the extra-statutory redundancy payments, the Government have re-examined the situation in great detail and with the utmost sympathy for those affected but, despite all this, it has not been found possible to overcome the legal and other constraints which stand in the way of extending such assistance.  I have been advised by the Attorney General that it is not wise to go into the nature of these legal and other constraints but they do create an insurmountable difficulty as far as the Government are concerned in giving any further payments.  The matters has been examined from every possible angle and no resolution of the problem has come to light which does not have major adverse implications for the State. I am sorry I have to say that I do not see any way out of this unfortunate situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that for one reason or another he is unable to explain what specifically these legal constraints are.  Could the concern he says the Government feel, and which <Col N="2121" /> presumably the Minister also feels, not be expressed by appropriate legislation to get rid of these legal constraints in order that the Government may be able to honour their obligations to these employees?  If there are legal contraints which prevent the Government from doing something they want to do, then surely the obvious answer would be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that this was a wholly owned State company and that payments above the statutory level were made to Avoca, NET, some private companies like Verolme Dockyard and so on, could the Minister not see his way to do the right thing for these workers who were never involved in industrial disputes, who served the country over a long period and who were left with payments as low as £4.50 a month, <Col N="2122" /> as the Minister had the effrontery to mention to the House?</P>

      <P>I have established an inter-departmental review group to examine the Aer Lingus group's overall fleet replacement strategy and the associated funding proposals with a view to enabling me to make a submission to Government in the matter.  It is not the practice to make public the terms of reference of such review groups.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's decision on new arrangements for financing CIE was announced in 1983 by the Minister.  In accordance with those new arrangements CIE's subvention is now settled on the basis of a formula under which the subvention is determined as 50 per cent of CIE revenue or 33? per cent of expenditure, whichever is the lesser. Subvention moneys paid by CIE are treated as revenue and are shown above the line in CIE accounts in recognition of the board's social role.  The new arrangements include a requirement for CIE to achieve a reduction of 12 per cent in expenditure in real terms over five years from 1985.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not answer my question.  The revenue will accrue in 1987 but, as the Minister said in his reply, the formula has to be applied in the month of January.  How will that formula work? Will it not be guesswork?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  On the contrary I understand that the agreement works to the advantage of the company.  The Deputy should bear in mind the background to this.  At the meeting which set up BTÉ on 1 January 1984 a debt of £745 million was due to the Exchequer for telephone capital.  A total of £305 million of this was annuitised over 15 years and the balance of £440 million was converted into equity, the equity to be converted by dividend payments.  As far as the annuity is concerned I should like to state that in 1985 agreement was reached between the company and the Minister for Finance whereby special payments of £208 million over four years would be paid by the company.  The company are receiving full credit for these payments and since they are allowable off the capital balance for the purpose of calculating interest chargeable BTÉ are not being imposed on.</P>

      <P>The reply read by the Minister is the same as that given on 17 June to a similar question.  Is the Minister aware that the Minister for Communications indicated in June that there were proposals before the House and that he hoped the matter would be resolved quickly?  How long more must we wait? Will the Minister of State acknowledge that Cork local radio, established in 1974, received an extension of broadcasting hours in 1982 from the then Minister, Deputy Wilson.</P>

    <P>18.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications the number of transport officers he has appointed; the total number of those who had not been in employment in his Department or any Government Department previous to this appointment; the type and duration of training which they are undergoing and the priority duties which they will be performing; and whether or not it would be possible to have a 24-hour day schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Nine transport officers were appointed in accordance with the provisions of the Transport Act, 1986. All of those appointed were serving officers in my Department and three had previous experience as general inspectors (tachograph duties).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over a period of eight weeks, the transport officers received intensive training covering the legislative and regulatory provisions to be enforced.  The training programme, which included practical exercises, was designed to equip the officers with the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary to facilitate effective enforcement of the various regulations governing national and international <Col N="2135" /> road haulage and bus passenger operations.</P>
    <P>Initially, the officers will concentrate, as a priority, on enforcing the legislation relating to drivers' hours, the tachograph and merchandise and bus passenger licensing requirements.</P>
    <P>While it will not be possible for the moment within the resources available to provide a 24-hour day operation, it is intended that the transport officers will work outside of normal office hours to ensure the most effective enforcement within those resources.  The Garda, however, provide a 24-hour operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that a team of nine transport officers is totally inadequate for the various duties that arise from the passage of the legislation through the House, during which passage we were assured that the one thing the Government would see to was that those laws would be enforced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>During the passage of the Bill the number to be engaged was made quite clear.  Much work remains to be done but with the support of the Garda and the tactical operations of the team, blanket operations can be done in specific small areas.  A good job can be done to enforce the legislation.  I agree with the Deputy that once we put legislation on the Statute Book and thereby regularised a very difficult situation there is an obligation to enforce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister justify the priority areas mentioned by him, seeing that those obligations and laws do not arise out of the recently passed legislation in connection with which the promises were made for the appointment of transport officers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an increase on what <Col N="2136" /> was there.  It is a move in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Member of the House has been getting communications from the Irish Road Hauliers Association about this.  Does the Minister not think, in view of the increasing concern about weighbridges, that attention to the weighbridges in co-operation with the Garda should be a priority for the transport inspectors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything in the law that requires enforcement should be enforced and in due course should become an obligation on the transport officers.  The Garda and the transport officers operate at checkpoints.  The transport officers are concentrating on the drivers and the licensing requirements.  It is envisaged that the Garda will take on enforcement of other legislation, involving tax, insurance, drivers' licences and so on. The report from the interdepartmental committee on the enforcement of road haulage regulations stated that checking of insurance certificates and certificates of roadworthiness will remain a Garda responsibility for the time being and that checking for tax and drivers' licences should remain the responsibility of the Garda for the present.  The transport officers are being introduced.  They have been well trained for this operation and I believe they will prove to be highly successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the loading of lorries is a very serious problem for legitimate hauliers?  Would he agree that this House is plastered with paper from the Irish Road Hauliers Association because of their worry that the transport officers are not being used to see that the law will be obeyed in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The transport officers have been working to ensure the effective enforcement of the law.  All of the matters are being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister assure <Col N="2137" /> the House that the final objective as far as the transport officers are concerned is to have a 24-hour round the clock service to ensure that our laws are not made ridiculous as they are now by operators in the State and from outside it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  When the Bill was going through the House &mdash; I had the privilege of steering it through &mdash; I was delighted to see the law being put in proper order so that it would be possible to enforce it.  I agree with the Deputy that we must have blanket coverage of the total area so that once we have a law on the Statute Book it will not be abused or laughed at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications if he will give a breakdown of the £51,279,626 <i>(Iris Oifigiúil</i>, 25 November 1986) under heading &ldquo;Other Issues &mdash; Irish Shipping Limited Acts, 1947-1984&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of £51,279,626 is made up as follows:</P>
      <P>Payment to Orient Leasing Limited in respect of the Stipulated Loss Value of the lease of the <i>Irish Spruce</i>, £49,381,745.</P>
      <P>(Only approximately 25 per cent of this figure is attributable to the liquidation of Irish Shipping)</P>
      <P>Payments in respect of the Exchequer guaranteed bank borrowing of Irish Shipping Limited, £1,897,881.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the £51,279,626 mentioned in my question, and the £14,350,752, amount <Col N="2138" /> to a very substantial amount of money, but we have no ship whatsoever at the end of the story?  Would he not agree that with that and the price of the <i>Irish Spruce</i>, roughly £3 million, we could have 16 or 17 ships?  Does he agree that this blatant error of judgment on the part of the Minister and the Government with regard to Irish Shipping should be remedied by the establishment of a small deep sea fleet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the net sum of £45.68 million, when one subtracts £3.7 million recouped by the Exchequer for the sale of the vessel, one will see that 25 per cent only is attributable to the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited, that is £11.5 million.  This represents the entirely of Irish Shipping Limited's obligation in respect of the lease of the vessel.  Half of the cost of the vessel represented subsidies at the Verolme Dockyard and was the responsibility of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The remaining 25 per cent of the cost was the responsibility of the Department of Communications in respect of subsidy to Irish Shipping Limited towards the cost of the vessel.  When the leasing arrangements for the vessel were put in place the funding of the lease costs was divided between the three parties, that is Irish Shipping Limited and two Departments, in the ratio indicated, and the lessor of a State guarantee in respect of the lease payments. Therefore, the State was obliged to meet 75 per cent of the cost of the vessel whether or not Irish Shipping Limited were liquidated.  It should be noted that it was on foot of a Government decision of June 1980 that Irish Shipping Limited were instructed to place an order for a bulk carrier with Verolme (Cork) Dockyard.  Irish Shipping Limited had not indicated that they required such a vessel.  The construction costs of the vessel, around £30 million, were over twice the then going market construction costs and reflected heavy subsidies to Verolme.  Therefore, the figure of £11.5 million is attributable to the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications if he is satisfied with the powers he has to detain ships because their cargoes at any given time may damage the fisheries, the tourist industry or other economic or amenity facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts, 1956 to 1977, the Minister for Communications has powers to detain a vessel, which is within the territorial seas of the State, if he has reasonable cause to believe that the vessel concerned is in breach of these Acts.</P>
      <P>Under these Acts also the Minister has powers to give directions to the owner or master of a vessel to prevent, mitigate or eliminate the effects of oil pollution arising from a maritime casualty.  These powers include: the removal of a ship beyond the limits of a harbour, or the restraint or control of its movements; the unloading or discharge of oil or other cargo; the taking, or restriction on taking, of specified salvage measures, or the sinking, destruction or taking over of control of the ship concerned.</P>
      <P>Under the Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1983 the Minister has power also to detain a ship if it is an unsafe ship, that is to say, if it is, by reason of the defective condition of its hull, equipment or machinery, or by reason of undermining or by reason of overloading or improper loading unfit to proceed to sea without serious danger to human life.</P>
      <P>The Minister has no statutory power to detain a ship which has sought refuge in bad weather.  In order to minimise loss of life at sea this exception was specially provided for in section 6 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1906 to ensure that foreign ships in distress would not be discouraged from seeking refuge in a port for fear of detention.</P>

    <Title>Single European Act &mdash; Neutrality and Protocol No. 30: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann reaffirms Ireland's position of neutrality outside military alliances, and notes with satisfaction that the provisions in Title III of the Single European Act relating to <Col N="2198" /> the co-operation of the High Contracting Parties (that is, the Twelve member states of the European Community) on the political and economic aspects of security and the closer co-ordination of their positions in this area do not affect Ireland's position of neutrality outside military alliances.</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann further notes and welcomes the provisions of Article 23 of the Single European Act on Economic and Social Cohesion, which enhances and strengthens the commitment of the Community to the achievement of the objectives set out in Protocol No. 30 on Ireland appended to the Treaty of Accession of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom to the European Communities.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Foreign Affairs.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Birmingham) George Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned for lunch I had been dealing with the question of the provisions in the Single European Act relating to research and technology, commenting that there seemed to be a consensus on all sides of the House &mdash; judging from Deputy Wilson's interventions in support of Deputy Manning &mdash; about the importance of these provisions and the extent to which Europe has lost ground against its competitors. I want to take up there and say that I am conscious of the fact that this is alimited debate, that there are a number of Members who want to contribute, so I shall endeavour to keep my remarks as brief as possible.  I shall try not to be diverted into argument with previous speakers but rather adhere as tightly as possible to my thoughts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a consensus that the Community has failed to keep pace in the development and export of advanced technology.  The international trade figures and the statistics of market penetration are an ample and painful reminder of that failure.  But the failure of the Community in this area has implications <Col N="2199" /> far beyond the figures and the statistics.  It has implications for the levels of our unemployment, for the livelihood of our people and &mdash; without being theatrical about it &mdash; has the clearest implications in the longer term for the future of our children.  It is not and should not be thought of as being an optional extra.  It is an imperative.  It is imperative that the Community be fully equipped to compete effectively in this area where it has lost considerable ground, most specifically to the United States and to Japan in recent years.  In some respects this represents the greatest challenge facing the Community in the years ahead. But is by no means an insurmountable one.  It is a challenge to the very potential of the Community.  If the Community can harness the strengths of the individual member states in the areas of research and technology then there is no reason on earth it could not compete effectively with its major rivals and indeed surpass them.  Deputy Wilson reminded us that it is not so long ago since Europe appeared to be about to enjoy a lead.  We are not at any natural disadvantage.  We have the educational facilities, the innovative tradition, the committed workforce, what we need is a coherent and comprehensive Community policy in this area.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Single European Act on research and technology are designed to enable the Community to develop such a policy, to overcome the failures of the past and to meet successfully the challenges of the future which I have described.  In so doing, of course, they will also provide significant opportunities for Irish businessmen to participate in large-scale and advanced projects for which we could not ourselves hope to have the resources.  As with the other provisions of the Single European Act, they represent in this vital area a logical response to the clearly perceived needs of the Community in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Single European Act on cohesion stem from the disappointing experience of the Community <Col N="2200" /> to date in its attempts to reduce the disparities in the level of development between its various regions.  In the overview of our membership the Minister gave in introducing this debate yesterday he referred to the failure to see emerging coherent regional policy as being one of the real disappointments of the last decade.</P>
    <P>The Preamble to the original EC Treaty refers to the aim of reducing the differences existing between the various regions of the Community and the backwardness of the less-favoured regions. But &mdash; and this is the crucial but &mdash; there is no provision in the body of the Treaty for the achievement of that aim or for the development of a regional policy. Despite the significant benefits we and some other member states have received from the regional and social funds there has been no perceptible narrowing of the regional disparities.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Single European Act in this regard &mdash; which bring the objective of reducing regional disparities and the means to achieve that objective firmly within the body of the EC Treaty &mdash; are designed precisely to overcome that failure.  They are very significant indeed for the future potential development of the Community.  Most particularly they are of very considerable potential benefit to this country, we having played such a leading part in pressing for their inclusion.  They will greatly strengthen our negotiating position across the whole spectrum of Community policies.  Because of this, and since they will in particular enhance the Community's commitment to achieving the objectives of Protocol No. 30 which Ireland appended to our Treaty of Accession, the Government have put forward a motion inviting the Dáil to take specific note of and welcome these provisions as well as at the same time reaffirming our traditional policy of neutrality.</P>
    <P>The question of cohesion was, of course, central to the discussions last weekend in London and it figures very prominently in the conclusions from that European Council, again representing a <Col N="2201" /> considerable triumph for the arguments we sought to put forward.</P>
    <P>There is a whole series of other amendments relating to the courts and other areas which I have not time to go into at this stage, so I come to the other area that has received particular attention, that is the provision in the Single European Act on co-operation in the sphere of foreign policy.  This represents a logical development for the Community.  In substance its implications have been addressed in great detail in the explanatory documentation and were dealt with in considerable detail in his speech moving the motion by the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday.  Co-operation with our partners in the area of foreign policy is an integral element of our membership of the Community.  It is natural and desirable, and we should not be in any sense apologetic for the suggestion, that Ireland would want to co-operate within a group which in the 1972 White Paper was described as &ldquo;democratic states which in spite of their different national characteristics are united in their essential interest&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In recent months and even during the debate in this House the claim has been made that our involvement in foreign policy co-ordination is somehow detrimental to our role in development matters, a bizarre claim, as anyone who takes an interest in these matters would know that our membership of the Community was a spur and an impetus to our decision to adopt a profile in this area and to establish an official development assistance programme.  There is nothing in EPC, as is clear from the years in which it has operated, nor is there anything in the Single European Act which has involved any threat to or any constraint on our ability to take independent decisions on foreign policy areas or, more specifically, on the question of development. If one looks at the profile of Ireland in the Community, the question of development assistance figures very prominently.  It is no coincidence that when the Presidency of the Council of Foreign Ministers was held by Deputy FitzGerald, later by Deputy O'Kennedy <Col N="2202" /> and most recently by Deputy Peter Barry and Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, the Lomé Convention came for consideration as a key part of our Presidency work.  Again during our last Presidency the Community responded effectively, if belatedly, to the disaster in Africa.  Therefore, the question of development is central to our role in the Community and is an important part of our profile.  There is nothing whatsoever in the Single European Act which would deflect us from this.  In regard to some of those who have expressed concern about the implications for our neutrality, I will paraphrase the well-known quotation and say &ldquo;methinks they protest too much.&rdquo;  Some of those &mdash; among whom I list The Workers' Party who appear to be concerned with our neutrality &mdash; would aspire to our adopting a position scarcely as neutral as Cuba.</P>
    <P>I indicated at the outset of this speech that two basic questions had to be addressed, namely what the Act is and, secondly, the judgmental question, is it in this country's interest?  In regard to that first question, I have illustrated how the Act in all of its provisions responds deliberately, moderately and modestly to the real needs of the Community.  As far as the second question is concerned, I have indicated how the Act responds to Ireland's needs and concerns.  However, it is important that we do not seek to draw a distinction between the interest of the Community as a whole on the one hand and the interests of individual member states, including Ireland, on the other. Such an approach would be altogether misconceived.  Of course, Ireland, like all member states, has national interests which are promoted with determination in the Community's decision-making process by the Government.  Those national interests were fully protected in the negotiations on the Single European Act, but it is important that we never lose sight of the fact that Ireland's national interest and the interest of each member state lie to a very significant extent in a Community which is functioning efficiently and competing effectively.  Therefore, in assessing the Act we should give due weight to the many aspects of the Act <Col N="2203" /> from which we expect to derive particular national benefit of course, but we should also give due weight to the advances of the Community because those advances are in turn very much in our interest.</P>
    <P>To judge by their arguments, some critics of the Act believe that we should leave the Community and some of them believe we should never have joined in the first place.  Others are suspicious of any development in the Community. They seem to approach it in an exclusively negative way, seeing in its institutions and its policies threats expressed or implicit and no opportunities whatever. One cannot but think that behind many of the criticisms made about the Act over recent months lies a very negative approach to the Community as a whole and to its development.  We joined the Community not just with a view to the tangible benefits we felt we would derive from it; we were right about that. We acceded to the Community also because we felt that we could contribute to its development and join fully with our partners in the movement towards European unity.  We were under no obligation to join the Community.  We did not do so with reluctance, we did so with enthusiasm, wholeheartedly and with massive backing from the Irish electorate. The negativism, the suspicion, the enthusiasm for finding in it threats to our interests when no threats whatever exist are incompatible with the approach we took on that occasion which commended itself to the people.  More significant, however, is that that kind of negative thinking is a self-destructive approach which Ireland must reject for several reasons.</P>
    <P>First, we should reject it because if we are going to remain in the Community &mdash; and clearly we must as everyone, including The Workers' Party now accept &mdash; we would be mad to remain on the basis that the Community should be allowed to stagnate economically or on the basis that we stay in but that we allow it to fall behind in the development of advanced technology and thus retain its regional disparities.  It would be folly to have <Col N="2204" /> second-class status in the Community. This point was put very well by the former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, who spear-headed our membership of the Community, when he addressed the Irish Council of the European Movement at a recent reception.  There he rejected very specifically the motion of second-class membership.  One hopes that approach will carry some weight.</P>
    <P>The other reason we should have nothing to do with that kind of negative thinking is that our experience of membership should reaffirm us in our constructive approach to Community business.  Certainly there have been disappointments for Ireland.  There have been disappointments for the Community in recent years.  Indeed, the Act is designed in many ways to respond to some of those disappointments, but there can be no doubt that the economic and political balance sheet of our membership has been overwhelmingly positive.  Generally we have been able to promote our interests very successfully in the Community's decision-making process.  Those benefits have not been automatic, nor should we assume that they will inevitably continue in the future.  They represent the fruit of firm, effective &mdash; effective because they were accommodating &mdash; and Community-minded negotiating approaches which have been pursued by successive Irish Governments.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why we need to have any inferiority complex about our ability to protect our interests through the Community's normal negotiating procedure. As has been explained, the Single European Act does not end the process of unanimity.  It extends the circumstances in which majority voting occurs.  It must be repeated that the option remains an option in all areas where majority voting applied.  As has been said, this country in the past has benefited from those circumstances in which majority voting applied.  Most recently one recalls that when we sought devaluation of the green £ we succeeded.  Had that procedure required unanimous voting, we would have found ourselves in considerable difficulty. Therefore, why these concerns? <Col N="2205" /> Why the fears?  Why the sense of insecurity? Why the inferiority complex? Nothing in the way we have handled our Community business justifies such an approach.</P>
    <P>The third reason there should be no sense of negativism in our approach is that it would be quite inappropriate for a country such as ours which is such a major net beneficiary.  Were we to become involved in obstructing progress in the Community, that is something which our partners, seeing us as major beneficiaries would find difficult to understand. Neither has the case been proved regarding the charges made in relation to our neutrality nor has a <i>prima facie</i> case been proved.  It is evident that there is no substance in the charges that have been made in relation to the implications of the Single European Act for our neutrality. The Act simply formalises the process of European political co-operation in which we have been willing and effective participants for more than a decade.  Our concerns, and the Community's concerns on the question of procedure have been addressed.  The Act presents us with an opportunity.  It is not a panacea for all our problems.  The extent to which we avail of the opportunities presented will depend on the skills of Governments in the future and on the innovativeness of our farmers, businessmen and scientists.</P>
    <P>My first recollection of political involvement was during the campaign for our membership, when I climbed up and down lamp posts in O'Connell Street putting up posters which recorded that the balance favoured entry, so vote yes.  The experience of our membership clearly indicated that the balance at the time favoured entry.  What we are now provided with is an opportunity to confirm our belief that we were right to throw in our lot with our partners in Europe, an opportunity to reaffirm our belief in the European ideal, and I urge the House to take that step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great lack of understanding among the general public on the need for and the effects of the <Col N="2206" /> Single European Act.  This has been compounded by the conflicting views of various organisations, individuals and recognised expert bodies on the possible effects and ramifications of the Act. We are being asked to ratify a new treaty, a new change in the rules and regulations by which the Community will be governed henceforth.  There has always been a commitment by Fianna Fáil to Community membership and we recognise many of the benefits that have flowed from our membership, but we also are not prepared to follow slavishly every dictate that comes from the other states. It has to be recognised that there has been a down side to our membership of the Community and now the danger is that the down side is increasing while the benefit side is slipping away.  Anybody watching the evolving situation as far as the Common Agricultural Policy is concerned can easily recognise this.  It can also be seen in the percentage benefit flow we are getting from the other fronts, such as the regional fund and the social fund.  There is widespread concern over the Government's lack of commitment to protect our vital interests at the formulation stage of the Single European Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the last chance that the Government get to mend their hand and this can be achieved without losing face by the Government, by the simple acceptance of the Fianna Fáil declaration which goes some way to protect our interests and to guarantee the survival of our economy and the continuation of our independent neutral status.  There is resentment at the threatening tones that have been taken by the Taoiseach and some of his Ministers to the principal Fianna Fáil position which sees as its goal the questioning in the minutest detail what is proposed in the Single European Act.  It is a nonsense to suggest that our position would be undermined if we do not bend the Oireachtas needs to the demands of the other contracting parties.  Some exception has also been taken to the wheeling out of named personages from selected organisations and also the involvement of the EC commissioner in trying to generate <Col N="2207" /> a public relations exercise to sell the package to the Irish people.  Legislation of such fundamental importance should not be treated in this fashion and in fact the closest scrutiny of the legislation is the only satisfactory way of giving the people an opportunity of assessing precisely what the Government have committed us to.</P>
    <P>Clearing the legislative hurdle here in Dáil Eireann, with the Government's ramshackle majority, is hardly a true test of the democratic will of the people and their attitude towards the legislation. The Government should have sought unanimity in this fundamental change in law.  This would have been in conformity with the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee, which shared the expression of concern that has been uttered by Fianna Fáil in the matter.  Surely if the concerns as expressed by the all-party committee had any substance, and if the Government are stable in their belief that there is no need for fear on any count, then it is no burden for the Government to accept the Fianna Fáil declaration.  If the Government see it as unnecessary, then its inclusion will be harmless and cause no difficulty in future negotiations.</P>
    <P>If the declaration has substance, then it will secure our economic and political position and will be the bulwark against erosion of our neutral status.  All sides have a vested interest in protecting our status position in Europe and it would seem a reasonable request by the major Opposition party in the Dáil to ask the Government to take on board a declaration which will allow the legislation to pass into law unchallenged.  The major reservations that the Fianna Fáil Party have to the Single European Act can be summarised as follows: we have a reservation concerning the constitutional implications of this legislation; concerning the danger to our economic interests of the widespread adoption of qualified majority voting on the EC Council of Ministers where Ireland will have three out of the 76 votes and where a qualified majority is 54.  We have reservations on the outright liberalisation in <Col N="2208" /> economic matters based on the abolition of non tariff barriers which need not be taken as guaranteeing prosperity or greater employment prospects here.  The effect that the Single European Act will have on the Common Agricultural Policy is also a matter of major reservation for Fianna Fáil.  The Commission is already seen to be dismantling the Common Agricultural Policy and majority voting will increase the pressure of the food importing EC countries on the food exporting countries.  This can work to the severe disadvantage of our agricultural exports.  There is no doubt that large consumer export countries like Britain and Germany will seek to dominate the majority voting in so far as food production and imports are concerned, in their own interests.</P>
    <P>We have reservations as well in that there is no stated intention to improve the EC regional policy, which might go some way to cushion the losses that we are bound to suffer through widespread liberalisation and completion of the European market.</P>
    <P>The inevitability of the harmonisation of taxes which must lead to increased food costs and reduced revenue potential to the Irish Exchequer is a matter of reservation.</P>
    <P>We also have reservations as to the effect on our military neutrality and foreign policy independence.  In relation to constitutional implications the Minister for Foreign Affairs displays a remarkable naivete, when he assures the House that there are no hidden snares in the Single European Act, that we have nothing to fear from it and that it represents no diminution of our sovereignty.  Among the inherent dangers in the ratification of the Act is the real possibility that it will lead to a conflict with the fundamental rights recognised in Articles 40 to 44 of the Constitution.  These rights, notably the right to life of unborn children and the rights of the family based on marriage, are not generally recognised in European law and we have a grave duty to ensure that they are not undermined by the ratification of this Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2209" /> Article 29.4.3 was added to the Constitution in 1972 to permit Ireland's accession to the European Communities, on the basis of Treaties which were limited in scope to the economic sphere and which provided a veto on most important issues.  This Article states that no provision of the Constitution invalidates laws enacted or acts done by the State, which are necessitated by the obligations of membership, or prevents laws enacted or acts done by the Community from, having the force of law in the State.  The effect of this Article is to give <i>carte blanche</i> to the European Communities, without any restriction by our Constitution and subject only to the limitations imposed by the Treaties, as interpreted by the Communities themselves.</P>
    <P>In the absence of any constitutional safeguard, it is vital that we examine very closely the proposed extension of the powers of the Community institutions. The Irish people would not forgive the Members of the Oireachtas if, through an irresponsible haste to ratify this Act, we handed over their constitutional rights to the European Communities without any safeguards.</P>
    <P>The primary aim of Title 2 of the Single European Act is to achieve a harmonisation of laws in the member states on a range of economic and social matters. The possibility that this harmonisation would include an obligation to introduce abortion services into this country is specifically referred to in paragraph 2.32 of the Explanatory Guide to the Single European Act, produced by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government believe that this possibility is removed by the inclusion of a particular provision in Article 18 of the Act which allows a member state to apply national provisions on grounds of major needs on the grounds referred to in Article 36 of the EC Treaty.  Following a detailed examination of this provision the Fianna Fáil Party are not satisfied that the proposed remedy is at all adequate for the purpose stated by the Government. We also believe that the Irish people would be horrified to realise that the Government would have us rely on a <Col N="2210" /> dubious provision in the Single European Act to prevent the introduction of abortion into this country.  The people have voted by a large majority on two occasions in the lifetime of this Government to protect such fundamental rights by constitutional provisions.  We must respect that wish by ensuring that the Single European Act could never interfere with these rights.</P>
    <P>There are several important reasons why we cannot accept the adequacy of the provision in Article 18.  First, the permission to apply national provisions would only apply to measures adopted by the Council by qualified majority under Articles 100A and 100B of the EC Treaty as amended.  It would not be available to counteract measures enacted under other social policy articles, measures adopted by unanimous decision of the Council or judgments of the European Court of Justice.  The national provisions would have to be justified on the grounds referred to in Article 36 of the EC Treaty. This requirement makes the entire provision ambiguous because Article 36 refers only to movement of goods and does not contain the phrase &ldquo;major needs&rdquo;.  Article 13 of the Single European Act specifies that the new provisions are without prejudice to the original Treaties.</P>
    <P>There are no restrictions on the free movement of services in Articles 59 to 66 of the EC Treaty.  It is highly unlikely that the new provisions would be interpreted as permitting new restrictions on the movement of services when the whole purpose of the Single European Act is to liberalise the movement of services, capital, persons and goods.  This provision could certainly not be relied on to restrict medical services in the way the Government suggest.</P>
    <P>The specific grounds cited by the Government as a defence to the introduction of abortion services is public morality.  While that might seem reasonable in this country we must remember that it is the European Court that will ultimately interpret this provision.  It is very doubtful whether it would accept the proposition that abortion permitted <Col N="2211" /> in the other EC countries on health grounds is of itself immoral and contrary to the common good.  Any national provisions invoked under Article 18 of the Single European Act would be subject to the judgment of the Commission as to whether they constituted an arbitrary discrimination. Once again, from the perspective of European law the prohibition of abortion could well be regarded as an arbitrary discrimination against women since it does not recognise any right to life of the unborn child.  We cannot allow such a vital matter to be subject to the decision of a non-elected executive body such as the Commission.</P>
    <P>A further problem with the remedy proposed by the Government is that the application of such national provisions which are in effect derogations would be subject to the rule in Article 13 of the Single European Act which says that all such derogations must be of a temporary nature.  The declaration in Article 100B of the EC Treaty which is attached to the Single European Act makes it clear that this rule is of general application.  On the question of derogation we should not be foolish in our expectations as to what the EC might allow.  We have the recent decision of the Court of Justice which struck down our national restrictions on the insurance business in the interests of free movement of services.  The fact that these national provisions were there to protect the interests of the consumer or that the Government had attached a platitudinous declaration to the Single European Act were of no avail.</P>
    <P>Another major cause of concern in the Single European Act is the inclusion of a statement endorsing the European Convention on Human Rights in the common preamble to the Act.  The original treaties contain no references to fundamental rights as such.  Since then however the institutions of the European Communities have adopted a policy of regarding the protection of fundamental rights as an essential part of the affairs of the Communities.  They have also seen the European Convention on Human Rights as an appropriate standard for such rights. <Col N="2212" /> The Commission and the Parliament are promoting the idea of the formal accession of the Communities to the convention. The Commission is on record as opposing the idea of a member state reviewing any Act of the Communities by the standards of the fundamental rights in its own Constitution.  Once again, the uniformity of Community law is seen as the only absolute principle.</P>
    <P>Our objection to the inclusion of this reference to the European Convention is that it appears to authorise the Court of Justice to apply the terms of the convention as the law of the Community in regard to fundamental rights.  This would certainly lead to conflict with the Irish Constitution as there are important differences in the rights recognised in our Constitution from those of the convention. The principal examples would be the natural rights of the family based on marriage with all that that implies and most importantly the right to life of the unborn child.  Under Community law the decisions of the Court of Justice take precedence over the national courts in the interpretation of the law.  We must make sure that our Supreme Court is given a proper basis on which to hold that the fundamental rights in our Constitution cannot be superseded by any act of the Communities.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the Preamble to the Single European Act refers to a determination &ldquo;to promote democracy on the basis of the fundamental rights recognised in the Constitutions and laws of member states&rdquo;.  In the Irish context it would have precisely the opposite effect. For these reasons we will be proposing on Committee Stage an amendment to section 1 of the Bill to incorporate a provision that nothing in the Single European Act shall authorise in the State any laws or acts which would be repugnant to the fundamental rights of the Irish Constitution.  We see this not merely as a defence measure but as a positive contribution to a true European union.</P>
    <P>We believe that the values which are inherent in our Constitution are valid for the whole of Europe and that we would be doing a disservice to the Community <Col N="2213" /> in the long run if we allowed these values to be eroded.  On the grounds for respect for the Constitution and for the basic principles of democracy we call on all Members of the House to support the amendment on Committee Stage of the Bill.  The 1972 constitutional amendment unlocked the door to actions of the Communities which can contravene our Constitution. Now, the Single European Act opens that door by giving the Communities the power to interfere in matters affecting our fundamental rights.</P>
    <P>The defence mechanism proposed by the Government as they see it in Article 18 is simply not adequate to protect us against this infringement because of the precedence of decisions of the Community over our Constitution.  The Single European Act extends the scope of the original Treaties and it also gives the Community new powers, particularly because of the qualified majority now agreed to enforce the powers of the Community. The endorsement of the Convention on Human Rights gives the Communities a basis for applying the standards of the convention to this country and many of those standards are in direct opposition and contrary to the provisions of our Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil amendment in this matter will give a historic opportunity to Dáil Éireann to protect the provisions of the Constitution which had the support of a vast majority of the Irish people and which had been so infatigably endorsed on two occasions in 1983 and 1986.  Not to support the amendment would be an action of gross political omission and a direct affront to the Constitution of our country.  It is our duty as public representatives to ensure that this measure is examined in an open and objective fashion, with due regard for its economic, social and political implications for this country.</P>
    <P>Our adherence to the goal of working towards greater European integration which we signalled in signing the Treaty of Rome in 1972, was based on the enlightened principles of the Treaty of Rome &mdash; regional solidarity and balanced expansion <Col N="2214" /> of economic growth in the Community.</P>
    <P>In the 14 years which have elapsed since our accession to the Community, many benefits have accrued to this country. Membership has contributed to the modernisation of our agriculture, our infrastructure and the development of modern industry.</P>
    <P>From the perspective of developing our trade, it was recognised that the creation of a unified market throughout the EC for the production and distribution of goods was potentially a most significant development for this country.</P>
    <P>The goal of economic and monetary union, the goal of free trade in goods within a common customs union, and the ending of all technical barriers to trade &mdash; all were highly desirable from the perspective of the Irish economy which depends to such an enormous extent on international trade.  Some 80 per cent of our industrial output is exported.  Our dependence on the imports and exports of goods and services &mdash; at 120 per of GNP &mdash; is twice the Community average.</P>
    <P>Many foreign firms have located here as Ireland is a very desirable location, being part of a customs free common market.  Some 850 foreign enterprises employ about 80,000 Irish people.  Some 90 per cent of the production of these firms is exported to the member states. For these firms and for indigenous Irish enterprise, the development of a single European market is highly significant for the expansion of output, sales and jobs.</P>
    <P>Indeed, while the establishment of a common customs unions was a most important development, we must bemoan the fact that the recession led to the proliferation of protectionist barriers. Effectively, this has retarded moves towards the development of a truly unified market and a common industrial and commercial policy for the Community.</P>
    <P>The continuing existence of different national standards and product regulations, delays at frontiers and the plethora of obstacles to the free movement of goods, all contribute to increased costs for Irish exporters, who have to cross <Col N="2215" /> two seas to get to markets.</P>
    <P>At the European level, no unified home market with a single legal, administrative and regulatory regime exists.  We are, therefore, failing to take advantage of a vast market of 320 million people. Unlike the US and the Japanese, who fully exploit the advantages of their huge home markets, resulting in impressive economic performances, Europe's industrial performance has been sluggish.  The Community is lethargic, as reflected in its appalling unemployment stastistics.</P>
    <P>These trends are reflected even more forcefully in Ireland.  Due to the structural weaknesses in the economy, which include the huge expansion in the labour market, the low capitalisation of Irish enterprise, a low level of R and D, and the relatively under-developed marketing capacity of many firms, certain sectors of the economy over the past decade have been, it must be stated clearly and unambiguously, unprepared for competition. The dilemma this poses for Irish policy makers is heightened by the absence of clear cut policies designed to bridge the gap between the affluent centre and the less-developed periphery of the Community.</P>
    <P>For too many firms accustomed for so long to operating in a sheltered environment, exposure to the cold winds of competition in a free trade environment was too rapid.  I am not, let me state at once, denying the role of Irish industry to set its house in order, but it would be flying in the face of reality to attempt to deny that the structural disadvantages facing the economy in a highly competitive trading climate have seriously retarded the indigenous industrial and commercial sector.  For this sector, conditions have been exacerbated by the failure to respect the principle of regional solidarity in the Treaty of Rome, which calls for a harmonious development of economic activities throughout the member states.</P>
    <P>Economic results since our accession, it must be stated bluntly, have been quite disappointing.  Production in our manufacturing industry actually grew by <Col N="2216" /> roughly half the rate forecast in the 1972 White Paper which was drawn up prior to entry.  Growth in industrial production actually failed to match the levels achieved in the sixties.  Manufacturing industry in the following decade also failed to achieve the employment targets set in the White Paper.  The native sector recorded massive job losses &mdash; 40 per cent of jobs in the textile/footwear sector were lost in the decade after we joined the Community; even bigger enterprises suffered with a 30 per cent drop in employment in native firms with over 200 workers, in the metals and engineering, and wood furniture sectors.</P>
    <P>It is cruelly clear from our massive unemployment and the steady exodus of people from this country in recent times that Irish industry has not been performing at a level which is sufficient to deal with our grave economic problems.</P>
    <P>Economic commentators have pointed to the increased penetration of the Irish markets by manufactured imports.  They have repeatedly pointed to the need for job-creating, export-oriented initiatives by native Irish firms, if we are to tackle the problems of high unemployment and the public debt.  The need for such initiatives &mdash; and the urgency of Government and policy backing for them &mdash; is underlined by the fact that foreign investment, while crucial to jobs and exports, has relatively limited spin-off effects for the native economy.</P>
    <P>As we discuss the Single European Act, we must be mindful that the development of indigenous industry has been adversely affected by the failure to temper the Community's free market policies with genuine measures aimed at economic convergence between the member states.</P>
    <P>It is a bald fact that we in this sovereign Parliament must retain our powers to manage the Irish economy.  We have a duty to point out to our partners that, rather than reducing the imbalances between the Community's different regions, the present drift of Community policies is tending to exacerbate regional disparities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2217" /> While one welcomes the acknowledgement in the Single European Act of the importance of regional policy, one must point to the views of independent experts who maintain that the revised orientation of the European Regional Development Fund does not amount to a realistic policy for dealing with the economic problems of peripheral areas in the Community, including Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is an unpalatable fact which has to be faced.  There is a growing imbalance between the less-developed regions and the rest of the Community, which is not addressed adequately in either the Single European Act or in current Community policies.  Even the Irish Council for the European Movement which has been enthusiastically lobbying for the Act, bemoans the lack of commitment of resources to fund a realistic policy aimed at economic convergence.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Agriculture seem to have closed their eyes to this situation.  Have we reached the stage where being &ldquo;Good Europeans&rdquo; is tantamount to blind, uncritical acceptance of Community proposals?</P>
    <P>We are elected here to represent the interests of the Irish electorate.  It is our duty to point to the implications of the Act, politically, economically and socially.</P>
    <P>It is deplorable how certain quarters of the Government, intent on railroading this measure through the Dáil, have represented the soundly based reservations of many people, including Fianna Fáil, as being anti-European.</P>
    <P>Let us remember also that the present thrust of Community policies, especially in the vital agri-sector, have moved away from recognising Ireland's special position and that we are faced with trends in relation to the Common Agricultural Policy which pose the danger of a rationalisation of the Community's farm policy. This has implications both for our exports and for the development of the food industry.</P>
    <P>Government spokesmen have endorsed the Single European Act, with more enthusiasm than prudence.  It is <Col N="2218" /> imcomprehensible that they have not sought precise clarification on a number of points in relation to the Act.  It is absolutely mystifying that our partners in Europe have not been persuaded by the Coalition to acknowledge the very real difficulties facing the Irish economy, in the spirit of Protocol 30 of the Act of Accession.  Problems associated with the liberalisation of exchange controls, such as a possible increased flow of funds from the country and higher interest rates, would also need to be assessed for their possible impact on the economy.</P>
    <P>In relation to the financial services industry, it is clear that we in Ireland must safeguard and develop our potential in this area.  In relation to the insurance industry, the Government must ensure a derogation for Ireland in respect of the draft services directive for non-life insurance, in line with the recommendation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EC.  This will provide the industry with the necessary breathing space to strengthen its capacity to cope with increased competition which it will inevitably face.</P>
    <P>Considerable comment has been made on the necessity for the completion of the internal market and the possible advantages it might have on the economic situation for Ireland.  It has to be borne in mind that some 300 new EC laws or directives will come into force between now and 1992 if the Single European Act is ratified.  These new laws deal with every area of our economy and much of our social life as well and they will be adopted by the EC Council of Ministers by means of qualified majority voting.  While some of these laws will be of advantage to Ireland, one has to be suspicious that some of them might not be to our advantage. The unfortunate aspect of it is that, irrespective of what the Irish people's attitude towards any of these laws might be and irrespective of what the Government's or the Dáil's attitude might be, we will have no say in the matter as, following the passing of the Single European Act, these directives will be automatically and legally binding <Col N="2219" /> on Ireland and the people of Ireland. There will, in effect, be an end to the greatest protection that Ireland has had up to this, namely the veto, which, in fact, made it mandatory for many of the EC policy decisions to be unanimous. This is now brought to an end.</P>
    <P>There is no reference in the Government's explanatory booklet to the 300 new EC directives and proposals for directives and regulations as they are set out in the Commission's White Paper on the Internal Market, popularly known as the Cockfield report.  There has been no consultation with the Irish interests that will be affected by all these new directives. Perhaps there is good reason for no consultation because if the information were available to the interested parties as to how they would be affected by these directives then there is no doubt that there would be very serious objections raised to the conclusion of this Single European Act.</P>
    <P>It will be stated, of course, that each of the 300 new laws will have to come up before the Council of Ministers over the next five or six years and each will have to be decided upon individually, but we have to remember that with majority voting and with certain States pushing for their implementation for their own interests it can be clearly seen that many of these directives will be pushed through much more quickly than if each has to be cleared unanimously as heretofore.</P>
    <P>The completion of the internal market directives will impinge on every single aspect of the economic life of the country and will deal with such matters as the common broadcasting area, with controls in advertising and the opening up of new information services.  This area might have a very serious impact on the standards applied to Irish advertising at this time.  There will, of course, be a new EC trade mark which will phase out all our national trade marks and will bring to an end any support that exists for our now national products in our own retail outlets. There will also be a directive on non-Irish building societies and financial institutions which can result in an <Col N="2220" /> increased flow of money out of the country. We will also be denied the right to support Irish industry and there will certainly be a phasing out of state aids for industry and national industrial development grants.  It is to be clearly understood that public resources will no longer be used to confer &ldquo;artificial advantage on some firms over others&rdquo;, to quote from the Cockfield report, page 39.  The disadvantage to Irish indigenous industry can be clearly seen from the attitude expressed in the Cockfield report.</P>
    <P>There will, of course, be many directives dealing with agriculture and food and related matters and also controls on our public transport system and many new directives as well dealing with standards and specifications of goods and services which might not be to our advantage.  The decisions that will be taken by majority vote will certainly be influenced by the larger member states and the big multinational firms will be able to press their demands for standards suited to their manufacturing and economic conditions.  The result for small indigenous industries unable to keep up could be catastrophic in the area of job losses and company failures.</P>
    <P>One of the very disturbing aspects of the Single European Act must be the question of the harmonising of indirect taxes and the obligation that will be placed on member states once they ratify the Single European Act.  Lord Cockfield when he visited Dublin in November of this year made it quite clear that all states would have to move towards a common coverage of goods by VAT and excise duties and that this would lead on finally to common rates of indirect tax.  Because of the funding arrangements of the EC it is obvious that the high contracting parties would want the VAT situation to cover the same range of goods everywhere throughout the EC.</P>
    <P>Ireland has more zero-rated items for VAT than any country.  There is no doubt that with the intention of completing the internal market under the Single European Act inevitably and eventually there would be compulsory extension of VAT on food, clothing, energy and transport <Col N="2221" /> costs.  This would all have to take place before 1992.  One can only speculate on the disadvantage this would be to the Irish State and would lead to very serious price increases in sensitive areas.</P>
    <P>Another consequence is the reduction of excise duties on Irish goods to the lower average levels of the EC.  According to the Minister for Finance this could lose the Irish Government up to £600 million in revenue alone and how the Minister could even contemplate this type of attitude is difficult to understand. The Minister is understood to have said that he &ldquo;will continue to support such harmonisation as is necessary to establish and operate the internal market of the EC&rdquo;.  Unless the declaration as framed by Fianna Fáil is taken on board, then we can expect no favourable treatment or compensation from the other member states.  It is absolutely essential that our special position is recognised in a formal way.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act must have serious effects on our military neutrality and foreign policy independence.  Title III of the new treaty commits us to develop a common foreign policy with States that are all members of NATO. The statement of the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Toole, in recent times on this matter must be of grave concern to many people, but it is only following similar type statements from his colleagues, Deputy John Kelly and the Minister for Education, Deputy Cooney.  The Coalition attitude to neutrality is obviously clear now and is stated as being purely a matter of expediency rather than of principle.  That position cannot be accepted by Fianna Fáil. Government Ministers who are prepared to make anti-neutrality statements obviously find no difficulty in accepting the new arrangements of the Single European Act.  However, it has to be stated that a common policy with other States by which we are bound by treaty cannot be an independent foreign policy.  Article 30 (2) of the Treaty requires us to consult with other EC states and to seek a consensus <Col N="2222" /> before deciding our final positions on security matters.</P>
    <P>Our wish to further policies on disarmament, our peace initiatives taken alone or in conjunction with other independent neutral states, could be easily frustrated by requirements to consult with States whose interest or initiatives might be seen to oppose.  We had a very good example of this in 1982 during the Malvinas war and certainly it is a clear indication that occasions can arise when Ireland would wish to pursue a different foreign policy from that being supported by the rest of the Community states.</P>
    <P>Article 30 (6) (a) commits Ireland to the principle that &ldquo;closer co-operation on questions of European security would contribute in an essential way to the development of a European identity in external policy matters&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;security&rdquo; as stated in the Act is without any qualification and must be interpreted to include military as well as political and economic aspects of security.  The Act continues &ldquo;they are ready to co-ordinate their positions more closely on the political and economic aspects of security&rdquo;. This is the present <i>de facto</i> position of the Irish Government.  Following the acceptance of the principle of the desirability of closer co-operation on security without qualification as is stated in the first sentence of Article 30 (6) (a), the second statement can plausibly read to imply that Ireland is not ready, or at least not yet ready to co-ordinate positions on military aspects.  However, they will probably be ready sometime in the future.  This is accommodated in Article 30 (12) when the foreign policy section will be examined by the EC states in five years' time to see &ldquo;whether any revision is required&rdquo;.  It may be by that time we will be in a position to undertake the military obligations they would like to place upon us.</P>
    <P>Chapter 3 of the Government's explanatory booklet does not mention that the foreign policy section is up for review in five years and that it maybe added to then.  Unless the Fianna Fáil declaration is in place there is no way that further involvement in military obligations <Col N="2223" /> can be avoided.  The Government might choose to give a different interpretation to the particular words of the Act.  This is one of the weaknesses of the legislation in that it is full of ambiguity but one thing is sure, that new pressures will be placed on Irish neutrality and on the independence of Irish policy.</P>
    <P>Article 30 (6) (b) goes on to commit the State to maintaining &ldquo;the technological and the industrial conditions necessary for their security&rdquo;.  Once again the word &ldquo;security&rdquo; is without qualification and must be taken to imply military security.  This commits Ireland in effect to be involved, no matter in how small a way in the nuclear military industry as many of the EC States regard the nuclear industry as necessary for their security.  Is it any wonder that the nuclear disarmament lobby is extremely concerned about our involvement in this legislation?</P>
    <P>It has to be seriously questioned that if the Irish Government in their negotiating processes for the Single European Act really wanted to maintain our strictly neutral status then they could have easily insisted on the inclusion of an essential statement such as &ldquo;This agreement shall not govern military matters&rdquo; or &ldquo;Security for the purpose of Title III shall be taken to mean the political and economic aspects of security only&rdquo;.  There would have been no ambiguity in such terminology and indeed that kind of language would have been clearly understood and could not be misinterpreted by any of the high contracting parties or by the institutions of the Community. Quite clearly that would not be pleasing to some of the member States as, for example, the position of United Kingdom thinking in so far as our neutrality is concerned.  It was very adequately expressed by the former British Defence Minister, Michael Heseltine, when some years ago he lashed out at Irish neutrality when he was on a visit to Northern Ireland.  He stated that the Republic was letting others carry its defence responsibilities and taking advantage of the NATO umbrella.  He <Col N="2224" /> also stated that there was no way the Irish would be allowed to opt out of involvement in a situation of threat to the United Kingdom or the Community&rdquo;.  He went on to say: &ldquo;They would be invaded if necessary&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to note that Irish Government's protests at the time were flagrantly ignored by the UK Government.  It is quite clear there is no support for our continued stance on neutrality among the contracting parties and that they would be quite pleased to see the Single European Act evolve in a way that would diminish our competence to follow an independent security line.</P>
      <P>The matter reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> regarding Mrs. Thatcher's wish that all EC States should be part of NATO must be of great concern to the Taoiseach and the House.  This is obviously the intention behind the Single European Act.  Great risks are being taken on board by the Government in the name of the people. We want to put the Government on notice that the Fianna Fáil Party will hold the Coalition responsible for all and every diminution of our independent status which which might result from acceptance of the Single European Act.  If the road to NATO membership is speeded up in any by this Act or if there is the slightest danger that the Act would make it more difficult to resist the military security demands of Community States, then to deny the inclusion of the Fianna Fáil declaration would be an unpardonable error of political judgement and, unlike other legislation, the error can never be corrected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The risks to our independent neutral status are too real and great for us not to take exceptional measures to guarantee our status.  Better to err on the side of cautiousness than to trust all the future actions of our Community partners to be on the side of the angels.  The stakes are high and it is hardly likely that the major <Col N="2225" /> powers will pay any attention to our demands if they wish to pursue their own self interests.  The only way our independent neutral status can be guaranteed is to have it clearly written in unambiguous terms and included in the body of the Act.</P>
    <P>We invite the co-operation of the Government in this matter in our national and constitutional interests.  The Fianna Fáil declaration and amendment give adequate protection to our constitutional position.  We invite the Government to support this and the amendment we will be putting down to section 1 of the Bill which will guarantee for all time, irrespective of the attitude taken by Community institutions, that our safeguards to the unborn and the family as guaranteed by the Constitution can be permanently maintained.</P>

      <P>I cannot hope to emulate the flights of fancy of Deputy Flynn, I will be addressing the House in somewhat more sober and relevant terms.</P>
      <P>Before making my contribution to this debate on the Single European Act I propose to report briefly on the meeting of the European Council held in London last Friday and Saturday which I attended with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Barry.</P>
      <P>The Presidency Conclusions are before the House.  I do not, therefore, propose to go into the details of everything that was discussed.  The main issues at the meeting were: business and jobs; internal market; technology; frontier controls, terrorism, immigration and drugs; cancer and AIDS; Community finance and EPC topics.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of our meeting, we agreed unanimously to reappoint Jacques Delors for a second two year term as President of the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our discussions on the economic situation, I expressed concern that progress in implementing the co-operative growth strategy had fallen short of expectations. This strategy entails a combination of supply side measures like completion of the internal market, deregulation and so <Col N="2226" /> on and also the maintenance of sufficient demand to increase employment over the medium-term.  The strategy involves a contribution from all member states to encourage investment as a basis for higher growth and more jobs in the Community. The rewards of implementing the strategy are high &mdash; the Commission estimated last year that unemployment could be reduced by four percentage points over the period to 1990 if the strategy is implemented.</P>
    <P>I urged, as will be seen from the conclusions and was successful in getting the European Council first to reaffirm its commitment to the strategy and, secondly, to agree that the Commission should report quarterly to the ECO/FIN Council on progress being made in implementing it.  These were useful additions to what had originally been proposed as conclusions.</P>

      <P>We also emphasised the importance of Community action on jobs and called on the Social Affairs Council which will be meeting tomorrow to adopt an action programme for employment growth based on the suggestions contained in a paper which we had submitted jointly with the UK and Italy earlier on this year.</P>
      <P>I drew attention to the absence of progress on convergence in living standards and was instrumental, with like-minded Heads of Government, in having this recorded in the Presidency Conclusions which also, on my proposal, refer to the importance of reducing interest rates.  In this connection the Council also invited the ECO/FIN Council to resume its consideration of the EMS, in order to strengthen the convergence of economic policies and monetary stability in Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are always glad to see the Deputy dropping in but I am sorry he did not inform himself about the business of the House before he came in.</P>
      <P>I stressed particularly that while full discussion of cohesion must await the Commission's proposal on the structural funds in accordance with the new Article 130D being introduced into the Rome Treaty by the Single European Act, it was also important that there should be a systematic application of the provision in the new Article 130B of the treaty to the effect that the objective of reducing regional disparities must be taken into account in the implementation of all Community policies, including such areas as State aids and the CAP.  This intervention is reflected in the part of the Presidency Conclusions in which the European Council renewed its commitment to the principle of cohesion in the implementation of the internal market and other Community policies and urged the Council to adopt the measures necessary to attain the cohesion objective.</P>
      <P>I would also draw the attention of the House to the reference to the President of the Commission visiting EC capitals to report on work currently under way in the Commission on the EC's structural policies and funds, Community finances and the CAP.</P>
      <P>In our discussions, we noted the substantial results achieved at the meeting of the Internal Market Council on 1 December.  We also gave instruction to the relevant councils to expedite their work, as otherwise the target which we had set of completing the internal market by 1992 is under threat.  In this connection it is worth nothing it has been estimated that the completion of the internal market &mdash; making the Community a single trading area without internal barriers &mdash; could add over 2 per cent to the Community GNP.  Ireland, which depends more than most countries on external trade, could benefit greatly from such a development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2229" /> In the course of the discussion I said I was disappointed with the limited progress in Community air transport policy under discussion by the Transport Council. In particular, I mentioned that we do not favour controls on capacity sharing which impede competition and enterprise but that realistically we are prepared to accept that progress will have to be gradual, starting at least with a move from a 50/50 to a 60/40 ratio.  On market access, where we have been insisting on &mdash; the right to pick up and set down passengers from flights between two foreign countries &mdash; satisfactory progress on fifth freedom rights I called for this matter to be viewed on a Community perspective and emphasised that this is an essential prerequisite to real competition in air transport. Our concern for progress in the air transport sector is reflected in the Presidency Conclusions.</P>
    <P>I drew attention to a problem we have with draft directives on travellers' allowances where the Commission is pressing for a relaxation of our present import limit of 12 litres of beer per person.  I explained that an increase in this allowance would aggravate still further the already unacceptable trade diversion as a result of our higher taxes compared with those in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I also availed of the opportunity to repeat our concerns on fiscal harmonisation and the impracticability of an undifferentiated harmonisation of indirect taxes which would cost our Exchequer a revenue loss amounting to 4 per cent of our GNP, a loss which would be impossible to concede.  The very modest nature of the Presidency Conclusions on this matter reflects the concern I expressed.</P>
    <P>On research and technology, we urged the Research Council to reach agreement on the framework programme for Community action which would play an important role in bridging the technological gap between the Community and US and Japan and for the Commission and the Council to make a special effort to secure agreement on standards for mobile radio telephones.</P>
    <P>I played an active role in reviving <Col N="2230" /> the Commission's proposals on the ERASMUS student mobility programme which, following negative reactions from some member countries at a recent Education Council, had been withdrawn by the Commission.  Having persuaded some of those concerned to reconsider their positions, the Commission agreed on my request to resubmit its proposal, and, with strong support from a number of other countries, I secured agreement to the matter being decided on at an early Council meeting.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Safeguarding The Open Society&rdquo;, we had a detailed discussion on how to further intensify our co-operation to combat terrorism, illegal immigration and drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>On health matters, we agreed to designate 1989 as European Cancer Information Year and to develop a sustained and concerted information campaign on the prevention, early warning and treatment of cancer.  On AIDS, we agreed to co-ordinate national campaigns to improve public awareness and information and asked our Health Ministers to consider what further co-operative measures should be taken for its prevention and treatment and for research.</P>
    <P>We had little time for discussion of European political co-operation topics. We agreed to issue a statement on Afghanistan, as the seventh year of Soviet occupation of that country comes to a close.  On the Middle East situation, we had a brief discussion in which the importance of giving an impetus to the peace process was emphasised.</P>
    <P>At our dinner on the Friday night, discussions took place on aspects of East-West relations in the light of the Reykjavik meeting and the Vienna CSCE follow-up meeting.  To the extent that these discussions touched on disarmament proposals under discussion in fora in which Ireland does not participate, I refrained from joining in the discussion in accordance with normal practice in these free-ranging dinner table discussions.</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of the Council, I had a separate meeting with the British Prime Minister where we reviewed progress under the Anglo-Irish Agreement and <Col N="2231" /> reaffirmed our commitment to the agreement in all its aspects.  I also informed the Prime Minister of the unanimous Dáil motion on the closure of Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The London Council was a relatively low-key affair.  Irish concerns on a number of important areas were accommodated and there were useful exchanges on issues such as unemployment, terrorism and health matters. I believe we made some worthwhile progress in highlighting how the Community can complement actions by national Governments in these areas and thereby enhance the relevance of the Community in our daily lives.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to place on record here our indebtedness to the British Presidency for their warm hospitality and for their efficiency and effectiveness in the conduct of the Council's meeting and of their Presidency.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the broader issues raised by the Single European Act.  For Ireland the prospect of membership of the European Community became tangible and real a quarter of a century ago when the Government of the day, led by Mr. Seán Lemass, first applied for membership of the Community.  His action took by surprise almost everyone outside the group of politicians and civil servants directly concerned.  The reason was simple.  When the Rome Treaty was signed Irish industry was in such bad shape that no one believed we could reduce our trade barriers within any normal period of transition. Consequently, free trade was visualised as something that would take 20 years to prepare for, and in most people's minds, this ruled out the possibility of membership as distinct from association.  At that time also the Common Agricultural Policy had yet to be established and the potential benefits of membership of a Community with a preferential trading area within which a single agricultural market would exist were, therefore, not easily appreciated.</P>
    <P>By 1961 work on the massive task of restructuring protected Irish industry to prepare for free trade and started in earnest, and the Common Agricultural <Col N="2232" /> Market was beginning to emerge as a real prospect, likely to come about in the years immediately ahead.  It was against this background that Seán Lemass took the bold step of applying for full membership of the Community, and while that application failed with that of Britain when General De Gaulle vetoed British entry in early 1963 the Irish attitude was nevertheless thenceforward firmly established. It was thereafter clear that it was only a matter of time before Ireland, with Britain, would join the Community.</P>
    <P>There were well-founded and deepseated economic reasons for this decision.  Ireland had suffered, since the mid 19th century at least, from Britains's cheap food policy.  In the post-war era this policy had been intensified with the introduction of deficiency payments, which from the late forties until at any rate the mid-sixties overcame any inhibitions which might previously have existed in the neighbouring island with regard to the free import of surpluses of foodstuffs, dumped from every quarter of the globe.  Irish agriculture remained, therefore in a totally depressed condition. For historical reasons, our market access was confined to the most unprofitable market in the world.  A relationship which, in objective terms, could fairly be described as neo-colonial exploitation existed between Britain and Ireland in so far as agriculture was concerned.</P>
    <P>The EC, with its developing Common Agricultural Policy, represented the only conceivable way of escaping from this economic dependence which brought in its train a degree of political dependence, and a continued Anglo-centricity in national attitudes that was damaging psychologically and politically, as well as economically.  In this respect, though not in others, political independence had proved something of a chimera in terms of our ability to develop our own economy and its potential for growth.</P>
    <P>The economic desirability of ending our dependence on the British market was accompanied by a political and psychological need to move away from <Col N="2233" /> this almost exclusive relationship which had narrowed the vision of our people during the first half-century of independence. There were at least some who still recalled the memory of the links with other European countries which had survived to the end of the 18th century, and who saw Ireland not merely in the limited context of Anglo-Irish relations but as a European country which had a possibility of establishing multilateral links with other countries in Europe, links that would free us psychologically from the burden of our history, dominated as it had been by the neighbouring island.  Participation in a new Europe, within which the old hatreds that had divided its peoples so bitterly and so lethally, would disappear, and would be replaced with a sense of partnership and a mutual interest <i>vis-à-vis</i> the world outside, thus held a particular attraction for this island, because of its tragic history.</P>
    <P>It was in this spirit, and with these considerations in mind, that a number of Irish people joined together in the late fifties to propagate this dream, through the Irish Council of the European Movement. I was chairman of the council during the first four years, when it was starting to open Irish minds to the idea of a European role for this country, and I was fortunate enough also to be Minister for Foreign Affairs during most of the first five years of our membership of the Community.  I have had the honour to be Taoiseach during the period when the idea of a further move towards European unity has been gestating, and latterly taking concrete shape.</P>
    <P>Looking back on this period of over a quarter of a century of involvement with Ireland's European role, I cannot help feeling that in recent years our focus of attention on Europe has narrowed and our vision has diminished.  A sense of defensiveness, totally out of keeping with the buoyant and aggressive spirit with which we entered the Community, has come to inform much of what has been said on the subject of this latest development. It seems to me that there has been a failure on the part of many people, both inside and outside politics, to attempt any <Col N="2234" /> serious assessment of where the interests of our country and our people lie, and of how these interests can best be served within the course of the further evolution of the Community of which we have now been a member for 14 years.</P>
    <P>For myself, I have approached the challenge of this latest development in the history of the Community in a positive spirit, taking the view that it can open up to us new prospects and possibilities, and that without a doubt we have far more to gain from what is now proposed than we can conceivably lose.</P>
    <P>It is on this basis that I have approached the question of amendments of the Rome Treaty at successive meetings of the European Council from Stuttgart onwards and, most particularly, at Fontainebleau when it was given a fresh impetus by the establishment of the Dooge and Adonnino Committees; at Milan where the reports of these committees led to the decision to call an inter-Governmental conference about amendments to the Rome Treaty and the linking of political co-operation with the Community under the umbrella of a Single European Act; and then at Luxembourg, where these amendments and provisions were essentially agreed, and incorporated in a Single European Act.</P>
    <P>Where do our vital interests lie in this matter?  They lie first of all in the strengthening of the Community, because the failure to strengthen it could very easily produce a degree of disillusionment that could threaten the enormous benefits we currently derive from membership.  It lies, secondly, with positive moves to create a genuine internal market which in many areas can bring major benefits to a country that depends for so much of its living standards on the purchase of goods and services from abroad &mdash; goods that have to be paid for with exports of goods and services, two-thirds of which now go to member countries in the European Community.  It lies, thirdly, with the incorporation into the Rome Treaty, in terms that will ensure significant and practical results, of what is technically called &ldquo;cohesion&rdquo; between member states &mdash; a concept that we <Col N="2235" /> would be more inclined to refer to as &ldquo;solidarity&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This principle exists already, of course, in the Rome Treaty &mdash; but hitherto only in the Preamble, which refers to the need to reduce the differences existing between the various regions and the backwardness of the less-favoured regions of the Community. It is true that since we joined the Community significant efforts have been made to give practical effect to these provisions of the Preamble by developing new policies such as the regional policy. Moreover, the Social Fund is being operated in a manner that has greatly favoured countries like ours.</P>
    <P>But regional policy has had to be developed without any solid foundation in the actual terms of the treaty itself and the further development of regional and social policies on the scale which will be necessary in order to ensure for countries like ours a completion of the internal market that would not simply lead to more rapid growth in the better-favoured central areas of the Community, requires something more than this.  It requires a solid basis in the text of the Rome Treaty itself.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, other provisions of the Single European Act which amend the Rome Treaty and which would also be of particular interest to us, such as the development of research and technology policy.  This will help to strengthen the capacity of small countries like ourselves in this area, where we are naturally at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> larger countries. But it is in the creation of a genuine internal market and in the incorporation in the treaty itself of the principle of economic and social cohesion, or solidarity, that the greatest advances are being made from our point of view.</P>
    <P>At the same time in view of persistent &mdash; and it has to be said in some cases deliberate &mdash; misunderstandings about the working of European political co-operation, we have also had an interest in the transformation of this informal procedure into one incorporated in a treaty that will clearly set out the limits of this process and will make specific what has <Col N="2236" /> been the practice ever since this process began in 1972, namely, that the closer co-ordination of the positions of member states through this process is to be confined to political and economic aspects of security without prejudice to certain high contracting parties, namely, the other 11 members of the Community, co-operating more closely in the field of security within the framework of the Western European Union or the Atlantic Alliance.</P>
    <P>From our point of view one of the particularly frustrating aspects of Community membership in the period since we joined the Community, more especially in recent years, has been the manner in which the provisions for unanimous decision-making contained in the treaty with respect to a whole range of decisions affecting the establishment of an internal market have been persistently abused by many member states with a view to preventing the establishment of such a single market.  I should make it clear at this point, in view of Deputy Flynn's extraordinary contribution, that I am not talking about the to-called &ldquo;Luxembourg compromise&rdquo; under which decisions to be taken by a qualified majority under the treaty are sometimes postponed indefinitely by what is loosely called the use of the &ldquo;veto&rdquo;.  The abuse of this practice has also caused problems, but in so far as the establishment of the internal market is concerned the main difficulty has arisen in the fact that there are so many decisions in this area that under existing treaty provisions are not decisions to be taken by qualified majority voting, but rather decisions requiring unanimity under the treaty.</P>
    <P>There are now literally hundreds of proposals designed to remove artificial barriers to trade, to the provision of services, to the taking up and pursuit of activities of self-employed persons, to opening up the medical and pharmaceutical professions in the Community, to removing obstacles in the way of the provision of banking services, to the establishment of common rules that would mean access to the professions. <Col N="2237" /> Most particularly, perhaps, there are proposals for the adoption of measures harmonising national laws in relation to standards and laws which at present inhibit the free movement of goods throughout the Community.  In the period since the removal of tariff and quota barriers in the sixties it has become abundantly clear that those more obvious impediments to free trade represented only part of the obstacles that certain member states place in the way of the free movement of goods themselves.  One of the commonest practices used to inhibit trade in the Community has been the abuse of national standards &mdash; some of which, of course, may appear objectively validated by their historical origins, such as the German law on pure beer which dates back to the 16th century but which, in the manner in which they operate under modern conditions, prevent, and in many cases are clearly now designed to prevent, the free movement of goods.</P>
    <P>As a trading country we have an interest more than most in the removal of such barriers to trade, and also in tightening up public procurement policies where these continue to be operated in favour of a domestic industries, or in favour of a foreign industry established within a particular state.  Our ability to attract new foreign industries to this country can be seriously affected if they find that goods manufactured here are not, in practice, treated elsewhere on exactly equal terms by the public authorities of those countries in their public purchasing arrangements.</P>
    <P>Because we depend so heavily on external trade, which provides us with the means to purchase something like 60 per cent of our domestic needs of goods and services, and because two thirds of what we sell is sold to Community countries, we have a much greater interest than most other countries in the creation of a genuine internal market.  This is why we have fought so hard to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>As in the case of many other members of the Community there are, of course, some problems for us in particular aspects <Col N="2238" /> of the internal market.  In respect of these areas where we have genuine problems, we have sought and secured necessary safeguards.  One of the most important of these relates to the possible dangers to animal and plant health from the import of live animals and plants.  Both Britain and ourselves have, on the one hand, a natural protection from various diseases affecting animals and plants as a result of our insular situation.  On the other hand, this natural protection carries with it very definite dangers because both animals and plants in these islands may lack immunity from diseases prevalent on the continent of Europe, so that the effects of the importation of such diseases could be exceptionally damaging.</P>
    <P>This problem has been met by providing that the adoption of a harmonisation measure by qualified majority under the new arrangements will not stand in the way of national provisions which are justified on the grounds of major needs as referred to in Article 36 of the EC Treaty, namely the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants, public morality, public policy or public security, the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historical or archaeological value, and the protection of industrial and commercial property, and the same is true in relation to the protection of the natural working environment.</P>
    <P>These provisions in respect of these areas in paragraph 36 of the EC Treaty thus cover not only the question of animal or plant health which is of concern to us but a number of other matters, including the area of public morality, about which concern has recently been voiced here despite the fact that at the time the Single European Act was adopted this point was made perfectly clear at our request.  I listened with interest and some amazement to the legal disquisition by Deputy Flynn on the subject of public morality. It is difficult to comment on something as complex as the analysis he put forward without having the opportunity to study it but it seemed to contain some extraordinary references and extraordinary theories which do not seem likely to stand up to any legal scrutiny.  I was puzzled by <Col N="2239" /> many of the things he said, including his reference to Article 13 as being temporary. I do not know what that has got to do with public morality because Article 13 was temporary.  It is the Article that deals with the abolition of customs duties on imports which was completed in 1968.  What that has to do with public morality in 1986 I cannot imagine.  It is difficult to imagine what relevance most of what Deputy Flynn had to say on this subject had to the world we are living in.</P>
    <P>Article 36 of the Treaty deals with the question of public morality and it is difficult to see how that issue could have arisen in any event but, knowing the views that some people here have, and the extraordinary fears they can seek to arouse, it seemed to me at the time desirable to take the necessary precautions against a type of campaign that could be mounted.  That is why I sought, and secured, this provision even though nobody, except ourselves, could see what on earth it was for or how it could in any circumstances become necessary. However, the provision is there to offer the necessary reassurance to those who need it but there are many people who do not want to be reassured on matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>Another area of concern to us it that of fiscal harmonisation which Deputy Flynn mentioned namely the harmonisation of VAT rates or of excise duties.  During the course of negotiations, and since, including at last week's European Council Meeting, I have made it absolutely clear that, under present circumstances and for the foreseeable future, fiscal harmonisation would be impracticable between this country and other EC countries because the exceptionally high level of public spending in Ireland in relation to GNP has made it necessary to impose levels of excise duties, in particular, which are very much higher than in many other parts of the Community.  Loss of revenue from indirect taxation if these taxes were to be harmonized would be of the order of £650 million, which in view of the present level of our current deficit, and the high level of direct taxes, could <Col N="2240" /> not conceivably be accepted in our case. Because of our concerns in relation to this matter, decisions on fiscal harmonisation will not be taken by a qualified majority, but will continue to require unanimity.  I have to say that I was puzzled by Deputy Flynn's reference to the inevitability of something which can only be done by unanimity.  It is a matter for this, or any subsequent Government, not to give agreement to that unless and until the problem of revenue shortfall can be overcome.</P>

      <P>I have pointed out to other members of the European Council that if they are willing to produce an extra £650 million for the purpose we might not have too much difficulty in accepting this but I do not think it is a realistic prospect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from these matters, and the sensitivity of the insurance sector in Ireland particularly because of the two recent <Col N="2241" /> failures, which have been covered by one of a number of declarations annexed to the Acts by the various countries, we see our interest as being best served by the removal of barriers in all other areas on a basis of qualified majority voting. Nevertheless, should some unforeseen difficulty arise in relation to a matter in respect of which decisions will in future be taken by qualified majority, and should this matter involve a vital national interest, the political arrangement which is described as the Luxembourg compromise, under which, in such a case, a member state can indefinitely postpone a decision by way of veto, will, of course, continue to apply contrary to the statement of Deputy Flynn who once again on that issue has the wrong end of the stick.</P>
    <P>While our interests are best served by the creation of an internal market, subject to the qualifications I have just mentioned, it is recognised by our partners that the creation of such a market could in certain ways operate to the greater advantage of the central rather than the peripheral areas of the Community if market forces were left to themselves, and if no provision were made for compensating action to ensure that the peripheral areas not merely keep up with the rest of the Community, but catch up on them.  Thus we, together with other similarly-placed member states, have insisted that new measures in relation to the internal market be accompanied by the incorporation into the Treaty, by way of Articles requiring specific action to be taken, of measures designed to reduce disparities between the various regions and the backwardness of the disadvantaged regions.  These provisions in relation to cohesion, which, as I have said, is probably more appropriately described in our terms as &ldquo;solidarity&rdquo; give the Regional Fund belatedly and for the first time a specific basis in the Treaty, and also provide for the restructuring of the structural funds in a way designed to ensure cohesion.  This objective of cohesion is also to be pursued both through the conduct and co-ordination of national policies by member states and &mdash; this is of particular importance &mdash; by <Col N="2242" /> taking cohesion into account in the implementation of the internal market itself and of the common policies.</P>
    <P>What is involved here, therefore, is not merely a provision for the re-orientation of the structural funds towards the needs of the more peripheral areas of the Community but also measures to ensure that policies, for example in relation to the provision of State aids in member states, shall be operated in such a way as to favour peripheral countries like ourselves. This provides a much firmer basis than has existed hitherto for Community co-ordination of State aids in such a way as to prevent State aids in the better-placed, more central, countries operating to the detriment of peripheral countries like ourselves, pushing up the level of our State aid for industrial development well beyond what would be necessary if more favourably-placed countries did not provide State aid for these purposes.</P>
    <P>A striking feature of the recent European Council was the very strong emphasis placed by the Commission and a large number of member states on the effective implementation of this concept of cohesion, and also the lack of resistance to these proposals from the better-placed member states.</P>
    <P>One well-placed observer remarked to me after the meeting that it was obvious the strength of feeling and determination of the member states most closely concerned with this issue of cohesion had made a considerable impact on other member states, who were left in no doubt as to the seriousness of the commitment involved in the incorporation of this new provision in the Rome Treaty.</P>
    <P>To sum up the amendments to the Rome Treaty, leaving on one side certain other changes which do not have the same significance for us, it is clear that the major thrust of what has been done by these amendments is beneficial to our interests.  It should be clear that in every instance where we have legitimate concerns, these concerns have been met by our partners.  It is rarely that a negotiation of this complexity yields results that are so acceptable to a small country like ourselves. <Col N="2243" /> I have no hesitation whatever in recommending these amendments to the Dáil and to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The other provisions of the Single European Act relate to the issue of political co-operation, in the sphere of foreign policy.  I doubt if there is any area of public policy in respect of which we have witnessed such consistent, ill-informed and misdirected criticism as there has been with respect to political co-operation as it has operated since we joined the Community, and as it is now provided for in the Single European Act. To a quite extraordinary degree these amendments have been marked by the manifestation of a persistent inferiority complex which is one of the most unfortunate inheritances from our difficult past.</P>
    <P>Thus, it is noticeable that in all the critical comments that have been made with respect to political co-operation, involving as it does an attempt to secure where possible common positions in respect of foreign policy, the underlying assumption throughout is that any such system of co-ordination must involve our abandoning our principles or ideals or interests in favour of those of other member states.  Those who make this assumption and who promulgate the theory that political co-operation means we have to fall in line with the views of our partners, whether we agree with them or not, have persistently failed to present examples of where this has actually happened in the political co-operation process. I cannot myself recall any statement issued by the Twelve or any common position taken up by the Twelve in any other forum on foreign policy issues in respect of which any serious allegation has been made that in the elaboration of that common position we have abandoned a position held nationally.</P>
    <P>Yet, there have been very many such statements of common positions adopted, some of them in respect of quite important areas of foreign policy.  I think the three most outstanding examples relate to the Middle East, South Africa <Col N="2244" /> and Central America.  Let me deal with them.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Middle East, the position when we joined the Community was that only two member states &mdash; France and Italy &mdash; then shared our preoccupation with the Palestinian problem. Other member states still regarded it, in 1973, as a refugee problem and did not appreciate its political importance, nor did they see the need for the Palestinians to have their own homeland or state. Over the period of the mid seventies and on to the end of that decade, the position of the six other states then members of the Community, and thus participating in political co-operation, changed significantly so that by 1980 the Community was in a position to adopt at a meeting in Venice a common position on the Middle East which represented effectively the viewpoint which Ireland, France and Italy had held throughout.  Others had moved their positions towards ours.</P>
    <P>The same has happened in varying degrees also in relation to South Africa and Central America.  In the case of South Africa, we have always been strongly committed to an anti-apartheid position.  We have consistently refused to have any relationship with South Africa, whether by way of diplomatic relations or the establishment there of any of our State agencies which would promote trade or tourism or industrial development. Earlier this year we took steps on our own account, independently of our partners, to impose a boycott of South African fruit and vegetables.</P>
    <P>Other countries, for historical reasons, have had a different perspective on this issue, partly because of traditional investment and trade links with South Africa which have made them unwilling to face up to the issues raised by the question of apartheid.  However, during the past two years there has nevertheless been a very significant, although still very incomplete, evolution in the policies of these member states in the direction of the position we have always held.  We do not feel that the common position that has been attained within the Twelve yet meets our views.  Others have not gone <Col N="2245" /> as far as we have done, or are prepared to go, but the shift in policy on South Africa has in this instance, as in the case of the Middle East, been towards the position we have held, and has not at any stage, inhibited us from maintaining our own position, pending a further evolution of that of other member states.</P>
    <P>Again, in relation to Central America we have been for many years committed to the belief that the problems of this area can be solved only by peaceful means rather than by force and that they derive primarily from under-development. Some years ago this perception was not universally shared by other member states of the Community.  It is so today, and expression has been given to it on a number of occasions through positions taken and statements issued on behalf of the Twelve on a number of occasions since the Stuttgart European Council three years ago when, at the instance of Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium, the Community first adopted a common position along these lines.</P>
    <P>Thus, the implied assumption that seems to underly so much of the negative thinking, inspired by this spurious inferiority complex that has bedevilled this country for so long, that is, that co-operation in the area of foreign policy means we have to accept the views of other countries, with which we disagree, finds no practical justification in what has actually happened over the years.  I feel it is time this was said and said plainly.</P>
    <P>There is another point I would like to make and which does not seem to me to have been made previously.  The work of political co-operation does not consist solely in drafting texts and statements to be made publicly.  Indeed it is arguable that in some cases such texts and statements are less likely to achieve results than other diplomatic action.  Issues involving human rights throughout the world are constantly under discussion privately among the 12 member states, and private diplomatic initiatives are being taken all the time on behalf of the Twelve, seeking to bring the most effective kind of pressure &mdash; private pressure rather than public pressure &mdash; on countries <Col N="2246" /> where there are problems with human rights.  In many cases where there has been quiet diplomacy of this kind it has yielded results although there are, of course, other cases where it has failed to do so.</P>
    <P>Of its very nature this aspect of foreign policy co-ordination amongst the Twelve can never be given publicity in any individual instance, for to do so would be totally counter-productive and the secrecy necessary for successful initiatives of this kind has been extraordinarily well-preserved over the years.  I can only comment that from my own knowledge of what is happening in this respect, month by month, and year by year, I believe that Irish participation in this process with other member countries of the Community through the political co-operation process is an extremely valuable exercise and that far, far more has been done to help more people than could ever have been done by us on our own, or indeed by an other single member state acting on its own.</P>
    <P>Having-said all this, we all know that foreign policy does not consist solely of pursuing ideals.  It involves also the pursuit of a country's interests, and sometimes, at the margin, the two come into conflict.  There are times when a prudent concern for important national interests has to be weighed in the balance against the satisfaction that might be derived from public expression of our views on some aspect of foreign relations.  There are, of course, times when concern for these interests rightly prevails, more especially because there are relatively few cases where an Irish expression of view on its own would be likely to influence the actions of another country in some distant part of the globe.  None of us likes this conflict; none of us likes staying silent about something on which we may have very strong personal views, but sometimes we know that the expression of these views would have no effect for good in the area concerned, while it could have a considerable adverse effect so far as Ireland is concerned. While one cannot like having to face these conflicts, no responsible Government <Col N="2247" /> would devote themselves to endorsing sentiments on any and every occasion at the expense of their interests.</P>
    <P>This conflict has always existed throughout our history as a State, and more particularly in the League of Nations and the United Nations we have again and again had to face choices between acting prudently or being vocal in support of our ideals.  This position has not changed significantly as a result of our membership of the European Community, and, in so far as there may be some additional cases now where we feel the need to exercise prudence, this derives not from the political co-operation process but from our participation in the European Community itself, within which we have necessarily been concerned to establish close relations with other member states with a view to having their goodwill in respect of the many problems that may arise within the Community.  The resolution of problems that concern us, and in some instances ones that are of real importance to us, has frequently depended on goodwill of this kind.</P>
    <P>Had political co-operation never been invented, I doubt if we would have acted differently in relation to any matter of significance in foreign policy during the last 14 years, and to the extent that we have occasionally felt it unwise to take up positions on certain issues on which we might previously have been more vocal, because of our interest in maintaining good relations with, and the goodwill of, other member states, this has happened rarely, and in relation to issues of relatively minor importance.</P>
    <P>Thus to sum it all up my experience of the process of political co-operation since 1973 has been, I have to say, a very positive one.  We have seen the foreign policies of other countries evolve in the direction we believe is right.  We have not been required, nor have we felt it necessary, to go along with common positions when we were not in agreement with the views of other countries.  At the same time the whole process has enabled us both to learn much more about many <Col N="2248" /> world issues &mdash; the pooling of information within that process of political co-operation itself is of considerable value &mdash; and also to contribute our particular viewpoint on many matters, as well as to join with others some of them of much greater weight than ourselves in world affairs with a view to seeking and, in many cases securing, the alleviation of human rights abuses in a wide range of countries.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act changes in no way the practice of political co-operation as undertaken since the time we joined the Community and, accordingly, has no implications for neutrality&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to Deputy O'Kennedy's position on neutrality in a moment.  The Deputy should not rush me; I have the quotation here.  The Act simply puts down in Treaty form the practice that has existed during this period. The present text is based on a Franco-German draft introduced at the Milan Council &mdash; a draft which was designed to, and does, take account of our particular preoccupations, by limiting the process of co-ordination of positions on security matters to the political and economic aspects of security and by providing that this shall not impede closer co-operation in the field of security between certain of the High Contracting Parties within the framework of the Western European Union and the Atlantic Alliance to neither of which we belong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the rest, it commits us to doing what we have been doing since 1973 &mdash; namely, to being ready to co-ordinate our positions more closely on the political and economic aspects of security and endeavouring to adopt common position on foreign policy matters.  It is very useful to have this clearly written down.  From that point of view I welcome the text on political co-operation, and its incorporation in the Single European Act. And I hope that when the Act is ratified by the two Houses of the Oireachtas in the near future, we shall see an end to <Col N="2249" /> the hysteria and propaganda which have been a sporadic feature of discussions on Irish neutrality since we joined the Community.</P>
    <P>Wherever else in the House this criticism may come from or this position be raised from, it certainly should not come from the Fianna Fáil benches.  Fianna Fáil have the most advanced position towards involvement of a military kind of any party in this State.  They have taken up a position which no other party that I am aware of has taken up.  May I quote from what Deputy O'Kennedy said in the House on 23 November 1978 at column 1799 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>I have always made it clear, as I think my predecessor also did, that in the event of political developments occurring in Europe and in the event of a situation arising which one would hope never would arise, the Community of which we were a member were under attack, then obviously we would have to face our obligations.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not relate to any future development.  I will read it again for the Deputy.  The Deputy posited two cases; let us get it straight. Deputy O'Kennedy is entitled to have his position recorded in full and accurately. He posited two cases: one in the event of political developments occurring in Europe, and second, even if they do not occur in Europe, if the Community of which we were a member was under attack, then obviously we would have to face our obligations.  So, according to Deputy O'Kennedy, even if there were not an evolution of foreign policy, even in the conditions in which we found ourselves in 1979&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which reads:</P>
      <P>If there has been any change in policy it has not been on these benches since my last statement.  No such interpretation should be made of my remarks.  I have always made it clear, as I think my predecessor also did, that in the event of political developments occurring in Europe and in the event of a situation arising which one would hope never would arise, the Community of which we were a member were under attack, then obviously we would have to face our obligations.</P>
      <P>I will read on, where Deputy O'Kennedy had this to say:</P>
      <P>Equally, I have made it clear that at no stage in my experience and I believe in my predecessor's experience has this matter been raised.</P>
      <P>It has not arisen; the Community has not been attacked.  I shall continue yet again when Deputy O'Kennedy had this to say:</P>
      <P>The only place I can see it raised as an issue all the time is here by way of suggestion and speculation, that what is not happening is happening.</P>
      <P>I agree with the last bit that is what goes on all the time here but, for the rest, the Fianna Fáil position is not shared by any other party in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have said enough to indicate why I believe that it is desirable that the Single European Act be endorsed by this House and by Seanad Éireann.  The Government have put down a motion which seems to reflect a consensus in this House on the issues of cohesion and neutrality.  The motion reflects most of the wording suggested by the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  This wording was taken up by Fianna Fáil in an amendment to the Government motion which would however, involve appending a double declaration to an instrument of <Col N="2252" /> ratification of the Single European Act. This procedure is an unappropriate one, which could, we are advised legally, put in doubt the validity of our ratification, but the sense of what the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Committees has recommended is incorporated in the Government motions in its two parts incorporated in the Government motions in its two parts.  That relating to the need for special consideration of the Irish position has been amended slightly to take into account the important provisions on cohesion introduced by the Single European Act.  The wording of the motion on neutrality has been slightly amended so as to incorporate the position on this issue which the Fine Gael and Labour Parties adopted as part of their Programme for Government.  I feel that, as now drafted the two motions together with the Single European Act should command the support of everyone in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate should afford this House and our people an opportunity of carrying out a full reappraisal of our membership of the EC in so far as advantages or disadvantages accrue to us.  It also affords us an opportunity to have our voice heard as a consistent member of a Community which we joined on specific terms laid down in the Treaty of Rome.  We have a voice and that voice must be heard, particularly when we see the failure of the EC to implement its obligations and ideals.  In such circumstances we would not alone be doing ourselves a favour but also Europe, by reminding our partners and the peoples of Europe that once this was a Community with high ideals, with a spontaneous response from all the people of Europe, particularly as was stated in the Preamble to the Rome Treaty, that it meant something real and vital to the peoples of Europe, something it does not and has not meant for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate affords us an opportunity to have our voice heard in a radical reappraisal of not just what this Community means to us in Ireland but as true Europeans, as the Taoiseach would have us <Col N="2253" /> be to ensure that where we see failure to act on the terms and stated aims of the Treaty itself, we should, at least in the interests of Europe, be honest and sufficiently confident to point out those failures to our fellow members, the reasons they have occurred, and to demonstrate to the peoples of Europe that one member state is not going to engage in a facade of progress in the name of a European new Act, particularly where the established Act &mdash; the Treaties which bind us all together &mdash; is being ignored and not being implemented.</P>
    <P>That is what I find most disappointing, not merely with regard to this debate but, I have to say also in the Taoiseach's lifeless, spiritless address to this House. After all, he is the Leader of this nation. It was he who represented us at the European Council.  It is he who should be contributing to a new dynamism in Europe with a real sense of purpose.  He should be heard not just in his own words on his own achievements when he comes back home as is typical of this and his other speeches.  As a representative of a small, independent State with a total and legitimate commitment to this EC and its ideals, he should be constantly reminding the powerful nations particularly, who have repudiated the very ideals of the EC, of that commitment.  He above all as Leader of this nation at this time has failed so utterly to remind them of that.</P>
    <P>If only on the basis of the lifeless address that we have heard from the Taoiseach today and the complacent element in it particularly in relation to the European Council, it is time the Government and the Taoiseach changed their approach.  They will not be castigated, particularly by the smaller member states, for having the courage and confidence to remind the Mrs. Thatchers of this world and others that they have been the problem of the Community. I will give many reasons why they will be respected and admired by the peoples of the EC for at last having a little courage and the conviction to restore to a great Community what was once there, ideals and inspiration, which are lacking at this time.  In the Taoiseach's speech are <Col N="2254" /> the usual details which are not matters for a Head of Government, such as litres of wine and compositions of this, that and the other.  That would be more appropriate to the officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is so much of that there and the Taoiseach knows it is there.  Part of the problem with the EC is that Heads of Government are stated to be occupied with such details when there are major political issues to be faced openly and admitted honestly.  I hope I am not being too offensive, Acting Chairman, but reading the portion on the European Council one would be tempted to form the view that the Taoiseach was the one who had everything said and done in the areas covered, that he convinced and persuaded the others and brought them around to his position.  There is all of this modesty which is typical of the Taoiseach when reporting in the areas in which he has been engaged such as confidential discussions.  His speech is decorated with decorations of himself. Who will be impressed by this?  Does he think, when the reality is explored and observed, he has persuaded and brought others around to his position &mdash; as is typical of him not just as Taoiseach and member of the EC but as Minister for Foreign Affairs?  Does he think that he is winning friends and influencing people in Europe?  Does he think that he is inspiring change?  For instance, would he like to consult one of the greatest Europeans of my experience, Helmut Schmidt, to see the extent to which the Taoiseach influenced him when he was coming back home and telling us all the time about his great achievements at the European Council, or would he rather think about what that quiet and modest man, Deputy Liam Cosgrave, might have succeeded in doing in persuading Helmut Schmidt to support him?  Would he consider the kind of goodwill that Deputy Jack Lynch won in his time by simple, honest diplomacy as distinct from this self proclamation <Col N="2255" /> which has been the hallmark of this Taoiseach? Would he consider why it was when I joined the Council of Ministers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Another major debate is being conducted here at this time.  I am referring to the debate on extradition.  I want to make this comment relevant to the point I am making.  In introducing that here the Minister for Justice of this Government made no reference whatsoever for the public record in this House of the implications for that convention of Birmingham, Guildford, Annie Maguire or anything else.  He had not the courage to state it here for the public record because it was not an issue. What do we hear since from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs?  Of course they know about our concern.  They have had discussions with us even this day in this House.  It is a matter on which they are fully aware of our position, but when it comes to putting it fully and clearly on the record by the Minister responsible they shy back.  That lack of conviction is doing us no service and is winning us no respect from those with whom we negotiate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding our independent position, some other matters arise from the Taoiseach's address and then I will come to some mis-statements of fact and law which suggest clearly that the Taoiseach believes what he wants to believe. First of all in relation to fact, talking in terms of our independent policy I will give one recent example.  Political co-operation as it has been practised does not require us to take the same position on all issues.  In regard to what the Taoiseach mentioned about the Middle East, let me now be as modest as the Taoiseach is when I say that I played some considerable part in that in 1979 in getting the European partners to adopt another position there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that. The Deputy built well on what had been done in the previous four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to acknowledge much of what the Taoiseach has achieved too and I will come to that in relation to Lomé and other things. When we could in political co-operation at the UN or elsewhere have taken a position which would be demonstrably independent we have failed on some occasions.  Let me give the example in relation to the Malvinas where the UN Council wanted to promote negotiations between the UK and the Argentine. Clearly, this was not particularly popular with the UK because negotiations would imply from their point of view &mdash; which is understandable &mdash; equality of right, of obligation, of control.  Other member states of the EC supported that proposal. As far as I know Greece and Spain &mdash; at least four member states &mdash; supported the proposal for negotiations and what did we do?  In a week-kneed, totally spiritless, lifeless position, we abstained.  This country that has been characterised by independence in foreign policy abstained because we were afraid we might offend one of the &ldquo;great powers&rdquo; of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2258" /> I regret that the Taoiseach has left, but for the record in relation to his address I want to make two points of fact and interpretation.  The Taoiseach said: &ldquo;The Single European Act changes in no way the practice of political co-operation ....&rdquo;  Political co-operation did not by right involve the Commission or any member of the Commission.  As a concession and simply as an observer the Commission could on occasion sit in on political co-operation proceedings.  In time, it became more the practice than the exception that they sat in on the political co-operation process, but they had no role unless called upon to initiate proposals. They were not initiators and on occasions were not even present although I acknowledge that even during the time I was Foreign Minister they would have been present but they certainly had no formal role.  The Taoiseach says that the changes do not in any way affect the practice of political co-operation.  Will the Taoiseach address himself to Title III where it says at paragraph 3 (b):</P>
    <P>The Commission shall be fully associated with the proceedings of Political Co-operation.</P>
    <P>In law &ldquo;shall&rdquo; means that it is not a matter of option but a matter of obligation.  The Commission are now being included as a matter of obligation in the full proceedings of political co-operation.  It also says at paragraph 3 (a):</P>
    <P>The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and a member of the Commission shall meet at least four times a year within the framework of European Political Co-operation.</P>
    <P>That is a new format in respect of the role of the Commission in European political co-operation.  It might not be of such major importance if the matters in which the Commission are being involved were matters in which they were never involved before.  Article 5 of Title III says:</P>
    <P>The Presidency and the Commission, each within its own sphere of competence, shall have special <Col N="2259" /> responsibility for ensuring that such consistency is sought and maintained.</P>
    <P>The consistency of which we are talking is closer co-operation on questions of European security and matters of that kind.  Article 6(a) says:</P>
    <P>Closer co-operation on questions of European security would contribute in an essential way to the development of a European identity in external policy matters.  They are ready to co-ordinate their positions more closely on the political and economic aspects of security.</P>
    <P>The Commission have never been involved in that, and the Taoiseach blandly tells us that the Single European Act does not change the practice of political co-operation.  Why is the Commission role in this so important?  Why do I take up that point, seeing that the Taoiseach apparently has not even read the text which he has agreed?  I do this because the Commission initially, in the institutions set up under the Treaty of Rome, was seen as the guardian, the watchdog of the institutional framework of the European Economic Community. The Commission was seen, as distinct from the Council of Ministers, as being the constant European presence and dynamo.  The Commission was supposed to be the focal point for European development and progression.  When the Commission which has a role exclusively in the social, economic and political area is now being brought into political co-operation in a formal way, it is quite clear that the statement made by the Taoiseach does not pass muster.</P>
    <P>We will not be intimidated by comments from the Government that any criticism we make will put our position in the European Community at risk.  We have an obligation which we will discharge. What I am saying is based on my experience and on the direction that Europe will follow if Europe is loyal to the principles it claims to honour, as established in the treaties.  For that reason I had hoped the Taoiseach would make some reference to the failures of <Col N="2260" /> the European Community to be meaningful to the people of Europe in terms of employment, social dignity and justice. In the last decade particularly, the Community has failed its people abysmally. Yet the head of Government of one of the smaller States whose voice should be heard on this issue has said that no such failure has taken place.  We should acknowledge that the European countries which stayed outside the EC, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Austria, not to speak of Switzerland, have been more economically successful and have been much more inspiring and invigorating for their people than have the member states of the European Community, particularly the member states on the periphery of the European Community. Are we not allowed, as good Europeans, to make the observation? Because we are members of the club are we expected to say that everything that is done in the name of the club by the big members is all right with us?  Have we a voice that will be heard?  The approach we take is that all we have to do is come back from Europe and proclaim that they did this, that or the other and the public will accept it.  The public have had a little too much of that to swallow that philosophy.</P>
    <P>What have we seen as a result of the CAP which is our only common policy? There is inadequate funding for unemployment and there is a whole range of areas which have not been dealt with. The Single European Act does not advance the cause of Europe at all.  It is an attempt to conceal the fact that there has been a dismal failure to honour the commitments enshrined in the treaty. That is the main motivation behind this Act.  It is time our voice was heard expressing our reservations.  I will quote the treaties, so as to have it recognised that the Community we joined had very specific commitments which any member state who acceded at that time would have been ready to honour.  The Preamble to the 1957 Act establishing the European Economic Community which followed the Coal and Steel Community established in 1951 says that the purpose <Col N="2261" /> was to lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe and it was to achieve this by affirming as the essential objective of their efforts the constant improvement of the living and working conditions of their peoples.  Some small Europeans, little men of today's generation, when they want to don the mantle of Europeans, pay homage to the founding fathers of the European Community who were respected because what they were doing was real for Europe.</P>
    <P>The European response from all the peoples of Europe was vital.  It means something to the individual members of the individual member states.  The European Community then had a dynamism which it has long since lost.  We saw an example of how much it had lost in the direct elections to the European Parliament. I regard that period as the high tide in European democracy and I contrast it with the response of the peoples of Europe to the European Parliament elections where the turn-out was so abysmally low that it demonstrated for most of them it was not relevant, it was not helping, it was not aware, it was not vital and it did not count in their daily lives and problems.  They repudiated it by their abstention.  That could be called the ebb tide of democracy in Europe and it is of that which we have to remind our partners.</P>
    <P>The Community we joined had a sense of purpose and an idealism which meant something to the original founders whom we all respect.  The Community we are talking about today, particularly that represented in the lifeless cold address by the Taoiseach, has none of that dynamism or idealism.  It is not as if there are no problems to be tackled and crushing burdens to be relieved.  We bound ourselves for that reason by a constitutional amendment. We bound in a sacred pledge the people of Ireland to accede to those treaties which had those preambles, provisions and obligations.  We are now asked to adopt an Act which amends in almost every paragraph the treaties we acceded to by referendum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2262" /> I will give a few examples of where it amends them very significantly.  It amends the treaties without a referendum and that is a matter the Government have to consider.  If they take it on their responsibility that what they propose to the Irish people does not warrant a referendum and are satisfied on the legal issues so be it, but they should have researched it a little more closely because not only are we not going to have a referendum but we are having a shameful debate in this House.  It is shameful in the sense that something which is of vital importance to this nation and to Europe is being pushed through at the end of the Government's ebbing life and at the end of this term.  We are all looking to see how much time we have to contribute to this debate.  Deputy Blaney, understandably, who has a direct experience in Europe &mdash; and I do not mind saying a voice which has been heard and should be heard &mdash; has to wonder when will he get his time and when will O'Kennedy shut up.  It is ridiculous that we should be confined to this kind of timetable on this important issue when there are so many things that have to be said.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example of where there is a very definite change.  We do not have to go very far into this Act before we find very definite changes in the treaties. Article 2 states that the European Council shall bring together the heads of state or Government of the member states and the President of the Commission of the European Communities, that they shall be assisted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and by a member of the Commission and that they shall meet at least twice a year.  I wonder if the Taoiseach or any member of the Government is aware of the fact that very deliberately the founding fathers of the European Community excluded a European Council from the treaties.  There is no reference to a European Council in the treaties we acceded to for the very good and sufficient reason that they had sufficient foresight to know that at that level meeting three times a year as suggested, the big would dominate the small and would, in the glare of summit publicity, <Col N="2263" /> try to give the impression when they went back to their own member state that they were the dominant figures.  I am sure they are all doing the same today.  Some may have some justification.  The Taoiseach made his paltry contribution on the same basis.</P>
    <P>Having sat at the European Council for two and a half years I can tell this House that, in contrast to the Council of Ministers, it is dominated by the major member states in a way which is detrimental to the development of the European Community.  We are told there is no need to have a referendum or debate. That is a very significant change.  There was a very good reason why it was not included in the original treaties.</P>
    <P>I can give some other examples of where there is a definite replacement of what is in the existing treaties.  For instance, paragraph 3 of Article 6 states:</P>
    <P>In Article 49 of the EEC Treaty the terms &ldquo;the Council shall, acting on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee&rdquo;, shall be replaced by &ldquo;the Council shall, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, in co-operation with the European Parliament and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is a radical change.  I am not going to argue whether in some instances it could operate for good or ill, but I am saying it is a radical change in the existing treaty provisions.  A first year law student would see it in the very first section of Chapter I.  We are being told that it is not a radical change.  The whole section is littered with that kind of radical change.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5 of Article 6 states:</P>
    <P>In Article 56 (2) of the EEC Treaty the second sentence shall be replaced by the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;After the end of the second stage, however, the Council shall, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from <Col N="2264" /> the Commission and in co-operation with the European parliament, issue directives for the co-ordination of such provisions as, in each Member State, are a matter for regulation or administrative action&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it can now be done by directive. If that is not a radical change of the treaties and every single provision in them I woulder what a radical change is. It is the original treaties we acceded to and it is the original treaties the Irish people adopted in the referendum. Article 7 states:</P>
    <P>Article 149 of the EEC Treaty shall be replaced by the following provisions:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;ARTICLE 149</P>
    <P>1.  Where in pursuance of this Treaty, a Council acts on a proposal from the Commission, unanimity shall be required for a Act constituting an amendment to that proposal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to give many examples because is not the time or the place, unfortunately, even though it should be. This should be a time when we should be able to spend three weeks on this issue if necessary.  We could then go through it in a legal and analytical way.  Because of the time constraints and in deference to other speakers who have a conviction on this issue and a major contribution to make I cannot take any further time. The Taoiseach might do well to read the provisions with regard to the harmonisation of taxes and read them properly and closely.  Article 13 states:</P>
    <P>The Community shall adopt measures with the aim of progressively establishing the internal market over a period expiring on 31 December 1992, in accordance with the provisions of this Article and of Articles 8B, 8C, 28, 57 (2), 59, 70 (1), 84, 99, 100A and 100B and without prejudice to the other provisions of this Treaty.</P>
    <P>Let us read that again: &ldquo;The Community shall adopt measures with the aim of progressively establishing the internal <Col N="2265" /> market over a period expiring on 31 December 1992.  We shall adopt measures to introduce the elements of the internal market before the period expiring on 31 December 1992.  In relation to the harmonisation of taxes Article 17 states:</P>
    <P>The Council shall, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, adopt provisions for the harmonisation of legislation concerning turnover taxes, excise duties and other forms of indirect taxation to the extent that such harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and the functioning of the internal market within the time limit laid down in Article 8A.</P>
    <P>Article 8A states that we shall adopt these measures within the period expiring on 31 December 1992.  There has to be unanimity regarding the harmonisation of taxes but it must be done by that date. Suppose in 1991 we are holding out because it does not suit us.  We are living in an unreal world if we think that in 1992 our partners will not remind us that we signed this Act and adopted it into our law and it specifies that it shall be done before the end of December 1992.  If we do not comply we will be repudiating this Act.</P>
    <P>It is time that the Taoiseach and his advisers &mdash; legal, political or otherwise &mdash; read the terms of this Act which is presented to us as being essential to maintain our place in Europe, not to offend our partners and to continue to benefit. We are all fully aware that there are benefits.  Why do we need this kind of proclamation?  We should have a very detailed analysis of provisions which involve a radical change in legal and constitutional obligations.  But this Government say there is no need for a referendum or for informed debate.  That is a shame, not just for Ireland and its Parliament but for Europe.  I know enough about them to know that some of the smaller countries would expect to hear from us, having regard to our consistent <Col N="2266" /> position.  They will hear very little now.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Taoiseach's attempt to misrepresent the position I have taken. The purpose of the instruments of the Treaty of Rome are all economic and social and they impose obligations.  The development of the European Community was on the basis of achieving equality of living standards among the peoples of the member states.  All the policies of the European Community, including the Common Agricultural Policy, the Regional and Social policies, the fisheries policy etc. were to be implemented in that direction.  Clearly they have not been.</P>
    <P>As recently as ten years ago the stages for political union were stated and restated by the Commission, by Mr. Jenkins when he was president of the Commission, by Leo Tindemanns and many others.  The first stage was elimination of regional imbalances in Europe; the second stage was greater or more balanced economic development throughout Europe; the third stage was economic and monetary union; and the fourth stage was greater cohesion leading towards political union.  Only on the firm foundation of political union does the whole question of common foreign policy arise.  This is what I was saying in that piece which the Taoiseach distorted by taking it out of context.  As Seán Lemass said so clearly when we joined, when we get to that stage and we are part of a political union brought about through those economic developments, then our common purpose would also be to play our part wherever it would arise in defence of that union.  We are nowhere along that line. I resent that the Taoiseach extracts for distortion something I said, with the purpose of saying that Fianna Fáil were the first who went for security <i>holus-bolus</i>.  I resent it because it is not accurate and I will not leave it on the record.</P>
    <P>When talking about political cohesion two elements might have been brought to the attention of the member states. The common market which we are strengthening will operate to the benefit and advantage of the major member <Col N="2267" /> states because they have the capacity to exploit the market.  The Federal Republic of Germany was always supporting the enlargement of the Common Market because they knew they had the capacity to exploit new opportunities in Spain, Portugal and Greece.  The same applies to France.  It has happened as they expected.  Since Spain acceded to the European Community the benefit of growing trade is in the ratio of 5:1 in favour of Germany.  Germany has benefited enormously from expanded market because they have the technological and industrial capacity to exploit the market. It is the same in respect of France or Britain, if she had the heart to do it.</P>
    <P>The Common Market will always operate to the advantage of the strong.  To maintain a balance we must have adequate resources and policies to ensure the cohesion and co-ordination we have talked about.  Instead of that, the necessary budget funds are being limited to 1 per cent of VAT.  That might rise to 1.4 per cent but everyone knows we need 2 per cent of VAT to fund a meaningful programme.  I resent the notion that any country, be it Britain, the Federal Republic of Germany or any other country which contributes, should be proclaimed as paymasters.  They gain more from the operation of the Common Market than any of the smaller countries gain from transfer of funding through Community policies.  It is time we said that and that we reminded those heads of Government that when they meet they had better recognise their failure to provide adequate funding for a Community that they now want to move into a new stage through a Single European Act. This is a facade to cover their own failure and lack of purpose.  We should not allow that facade to be erected without protest, as good Europeans, really committed Europeans.  That is what real political cohesion means.</P>
    <P>There was, as part of European economic and monetary union, which is meant to be one of the stages for European integration, an essential part &mdash; the European Monetary System.  I attended the <Col N="2268" /> European Council at which the EMS was launched and promoted.  Every member state at that time thought it a very good idea, that it was monetary stability and that they knew what it would mean to Ireland, for instance, regarding problems <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling, what it would mean to give us all an equal break in a stable exchange regulation.  Britain has been allowed to stay out as an associate member without even a word of meek protest from any country and particularly from our country.  It is inevitably and terribly damaging that sterling is floating outside the European Monetary System. We are devaluing within the EMS all the time and it has no effect, good, bad or indifferent, on our relationship with sterling and we are even afraid to say that. It is time that was said.</P>
    <P>This Europe which is presenting a fabrication of a great initiative in the Single European Act has failed to act on its own terms in the European Monetary System. There was a time when the term &ldquo;<i>just retour</i>&rdquo; was the most offensive term that one could use to any European, but it has almost become sacrosanct.  Britain said that they must get in what they pay out. That has been the real failure of the European Community.  It is time that failure was honestly acknowledged.</P>
    <P>I remember a time in the early days of 1977 when the Foreign Ministers of the small countries regularly met first for breakfast to take common positions to ensure that the big countries could not dominate the Council of Ministers.  Some very important conclusions came from those breakfast meetings because the small countries, by definition, have a much greater European commitment &mdash; the Benelux countries, Denmark later and ourselves &mdash; than those who want to dominate.  Among those particularly are the latest recruits, with ourselves, the British Government.  As expressed by their Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, they do not have a commitment to Europe.</P>
    <P>There are more than 12 million unemployed in Europe and 12 million have been driven off the land of Europe in less than two decades, 15 years.  Still we <Col N="2269" /> intend to keep dismantling the Common Agricultural Policy, without in any way trying to find a new role for it in a world chronically short of food.  That 12 million people were displaced even before Spain and Portugal joined the Community. And we wonder what is happening to Europe.  While the world is starving, here is this Community, which could play such a role, doing nothing.  I do not think that good Europeans are timid, silent or acquiescent, or that they just proclaim adherence to principles and proclamations; they speak with guts in Europe, as we would here.  God knows, this is a real place, this Dáil; we attack each other, we fight each other, we believe what we say and we say it.  Why should we suddenly change our ways when dealing with the European Community?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, particularly, is flattered by the association with the big names of Europe, who are just men and women like the rest of us when one gets to meet them.  They appear together in photographs and on television to be flattered by association with the titles &ldquo;Guiscard and I&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Margaret and I&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Jacques Delors and I&rdquo;.  That is not real any more.  It is about time we forgot the flattery, got down to basics and looked after the people.  They are the real people and they would respect us more if they found that we had guts rather than that we paraded ourselves like peacocks, for what is called in European circles the family photograph with the heads of Government three times a year.  That is a laugh now.  I hope we have more confidence than to have to dine on that kind of achievement.</P>
    <P>Ireland has played a very important role in Europe.  The Europeans respect Ireland's special position because it is even to the advantage of Europe in terms of foreign policy.  An independent foreign policy such as we have has operated to the advantage of Europe in more ways than one.  I can give one or many examples.  The Lomé Convention was negotiated three times since we joined the European Community and each time &mdash; and this was not accidental &mdash; it was <Col N="2270" /> negotiated by an Irish Foreign Minister as President of the Office of the Council of Ministers.  I can testify to the fact in my own time there that the Irish Presidency, coming as it did after the French Presidency, was about the most fortunate thing that could have happened in terms of negotiating with the Lomé countries. The French, having the history and tradition of colonial involvement and domination, just like the British and the Dutch, did not have the goodwill all round.  Some countries have.  Perhaps more notably in some former colonies, it must be said.  Some former British colonies have not, any more than the British would have had with these people, but we had that goodwill.  The convention renegotiated in 1979 was even harder than the launching of the first convention, I do not claim personal credit for that because we had a good team.  That would not have been achieved without an Irish contribution and Europe knows it.  Why? Because we are independent and those countries can relate more readily to us than to the others on foreign policy.  Are we going to apologise now for that?  It is something of which we should be proud and Europe has benefited.  That is why any compromise with our independence and neutrality will be damaging, not only for us but for Europe.  I wish we had the guts and the conviction to state that, instead of trying to imply that it is not for any reason other than to enhance Europe's position.</P>
    <P>One important area must be addressed which is in relation to the institutions in the Community, particularly the Commission. The Commission features in this, but in no sense in a radical way.  If the Commission is given the new powers here, were the Commission as orginally launched in the Treaties, with the dynamism and purpose and European role that were part and parcel of the early Commission in the days going back to M. Spaak and others, people then would say that there was a strong Commission, but it has not been so.  There have been about ten reports in the last seven or eight years on the institutions of the European Community, drawn up at the request of heads of Government generally who want to <Col N="2271" /> give the impression, after each meeting, that they are going to launch something great in Europe.  They drew up the Fidel Report, the Tindemans Report, the Three Wise Men Report, each time with a glare of publicity about new dynamism. After each report, what happened?  The very heads of Government that called for the reports ignored in every detail the conclusions of the reports for which they had called.  The best example I can give is in relation to the Commission itself and its constitution.</P>
    <P>Each and every one of those reports that I have mentioned very clearly and strongly recommended one particular reform amongst others &mdash; that is, that there should be only one member of the Commission from each member state. They made that very clear.  That was not acceptable to the big powers of Eurupe; Britain wanted two, France two, Germany two, Italy two, and now Spain wants two.  Accordingly, there is a Commission of 17 members.  If we were really interested in reform, why not say that there is the most basic reform of all, a Commission of one from each member state, recommended by a consistent number of enlightened Europeans, wise men as they were called?</P>
    <P>For that reason I have reservations about the role being given now to the Commission.  This Commission, which is being given new powers in political co-operation and elsewhere, is a very different baby from the Commission it should be if these reports were adopted and certainly different from what should be there if it were meaningful to Europe.</P>
    <P>I hope my next comment in relation to the Commission will not be misunderstood. A Government must be close to their people and aware of their problems before they can attempt to solve them.  They must be aware of their strength and have an empathy with the people but I cannot think of an institution anywhere which is so divorced from the reality of the experience of the people of Europe than the Commission based in the Berlaymont in Brussels.  Whatever is said here about the salaries in Brussels is <Col N="2272" /> an understatement because it does not take account of the other perquisites including tax breaks and so on.  The Europe which is meant to have idealism and commitment certainly pays levels of salaries and allowances which are enormous and some day a journalist will research this aspect of the Community. Salaries in the European Parliament are enormous compared with our salaries. Who benefits from Europe?  I accept that Parliament but we should ask ourselves if these people on inflated salaries know anything abut the problems of the Mezzogiorno? A flying visit in a helicopter will not do much for idealism and if one is living in splendid isolated luxury &mdash; I use the terms deliberately &mdash; one will not be aware of the impatience, anxieties and worries of people who are unemployed throughout the Community.  Perhaps it is time to regionalise the Commission.</P>
    <P>Some people are naturally attracted to the system and the big salary that goes with it.  However, perhaps we should have an office in the Mezzogiorno on a smaller scale if the Commission is to have a real role in Europe.  If the anxieties and worries of the people are to be appreciated, perhaps representatives of the Commission staff should hold clinics in the west where they would come face to face with the grinding problems of individuals from whom they are totally isolated.</P>
    <P>We should always remember our own language and culture.  I use Irish at the European Commission regularly because it enriches Europe.  I also use it at the European Parliament and translate it myself.  We should always be conscious of the fact that we are trying to enrich Europe because we will not get a Europe for the people unless their culture is taken into account.  We should try to get away from this awful, cold, bureaucratic Europe which has evolved since the seventies.</P>
    <P>Europe should not be inward looking but this Act does not help in that regard. There is a world outside Europe where injustice is even more obvious than in Europe.  The original treaties to which we acceded had a total commitment to that <Col N="2273" /> world and in their role in international relations is perfectly and clearly enshrined in them.  They were, understandably, the expressions of men of idealism.  The original treaties made specific commitments and obligations as part of European development.  They wanted an unselfish Europe which was not inward looking, contemplating its own navel and its budget problems.  They wanted Europe to become stronger but the Act does not say a word about that.  This is sad.  I may have expressed my views at some length but they are shared by many people whom I meet in Europe on political and other levels.  The claptrap should stop.  We must develop a European Community which we can respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy painted a very interesting and attractive picture of the various perquisites which apply in Europe generally and in the European Commission in particular. That, from someone who has spent a considerable time there, is thought-provoking for the rest of us who sit in this humble Parliament.</P>
      <P>I welcome the new-found aggression which he feels should be applied by this country in our dealings with Europe. That same theme was epitomised in the speech last evening by the Leader of the Opposition in which he accused the Government of begging bowl politics. From where did most of the inspiration come for begging bowl politics in relation to Europe?  I have been a Member of this House for the past four years.  It is clear that most of that inspiration came from the other side of the House because, in every crisis there have been calls for derogations for Ireland on one subject or another.  These calls seem to culminate in an attitude that this country is a far flung offshore island of Europe, remote from it, but expecting all the benefits at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a timely debate because many people seem to have forgotten that we voted overwhelmingly for the Treaty of Accession in 1972.  Despite allegations from various sources over the past few weeks, the people knew what they were <Col N="2274" /> doing when they committed us to enter Europe.  Deputy O'Kennedy outlined the thoughts of the founding fathers, people like Adenauer and Schuman and, in latter years, Spinelli, whom we had the opportunity of meeting in this House a couple of years ago.  The people who saw the need to create the European Community saw it from the point of view of Europe being in need of a strong trading community if its survival was to be ensured. They saw that after two major devastating world wars and they also saw it in times of peace between the wars.  They saw it as being absolutely necessary if the people of Europe were to achieve the goal they rightly deserve.  The founding fathers very firmly laid the groundwork. Many of the aims they set 30 years ago and more, were not possible to achieve but ultimately they came about.  That showed the people who drew up the original ideal of the European Economic Community had the best interests of Europeans at heart.</P>
    <P>Next we must ask ourselves if we are committed Europeans.  Having regard to the decision of our people in 1972 I say we must be.  From time to time various people have suggested we have only limited benefits from Europe, that there are many negative aspects.  Let us examine the net benefits to this country over the years.  I am not suggesting for a moment that we should go down the road of the begging bowl or that we should adopt that stance at any time, but if we are committed to Europe and if we accept the benefits that come from Europe, somewhere, sometime, some European is likely to ask us if we are really serious especially if we continue to hedge our bets whenever there is a debate like this or when there is any suggestion of committing ourselves more to the European concept.  As Deputy O'Kennedy must know the Commission have vast powers which were never used to the detriment of this country and will not be.  The general idea of a united Europe must surely be to the benefit of all people.</P>
    <P>As I see it, the Single European Act is a natural progression of the original idea and ideal.  It is important that we commit <Col N="2275" /> ourselves to that ideal because if we do not &mdash; and this should be more clearly spelt out, although I have not heard it mentioned once from the opposite side of the House &mdash; there are stronger economic powers in Europe which have their certain sway and it is up to the other member states to ensure that their interests are not submerged.  Those stronger powers have looked carefully at the commitment of the other states and suggested that if we do not move towards a more united Europe some of those who are more committed to that concept will move and create a two-speed Europe.  That has often been suggested over the past number of years in Europe and in this House.  It is regrettable that the Opposition speakers do not seem to have had regard to these expressions of opinion which have come from Europe.</P>
    <P>I had occasion to visit there on one or two occasions.  It was clear what the Europeans were thinking but it was amazing we did not hear much about that in this House or in the various committees dealing with European legislation.  I believe we should tell the people the whole story which is that it has been found opportune to move steadily towards a more united Europe, economically and politically.  The people who are motivating that move will obviously want to see a commitment from countries such as ourselves, and if we do not move in that direction they might come to the conclusion we are getting cold feet and were not as committed today as we were some years ago.  If that is so, are we prepared to accept all that goes with that statement?  Are we prepared to accept that if we were to fall into a secondary category, or into a slower speed Europe, we would not have access to the benefits we have at present, those much denigrated benefits.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that we recognise the Single European Act for what it is, a natural progression of the original concept, an obvious movement towards a more united Europe.  There is a huge European population with whom it would be much easier to market if there <Col N="2276" /> was a single trading bloc.  If each country was to trade independently, as was the case before the European Community came into being, we would have the shambles which existed for a number of years, the kind of shambles the European Community tried to replace.  If we want to trade as a bloc, we must have the commitment of all States.  This leads me back to the question of whether we are as committed to this concept as we were.</P>
    <P>A couple of issues are raised automatically when we are expected to make a commitment.  First, there is the question of sovereignty.  This subject has been adequately dealt with by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I do not propose to go into this now because I am not a constitutional lawyer, and I have no wish to be, but I regard myself as a reasonable person and reasonable people elect Members to this House. I can see no particular threat to our sovereignty under this Act.  Whenever we are asked to make a commitment to something which is bigger than ourselves, we immediately resort to parochialism and create a feeling that there is some erosion of our sovereignty on the one hand or on our neutrality on the other.</P>
    <P>Neutrality is the second area which arouses great emotion.  When this subject is raised it gives politicians, the media and interested groups great scope to make their views known.  It can be said, and rightly so, that we should and must maintain a neutral stance.  That has been accepted and is generally agreed, but amazingly there have been suggestions that our neutrality is now interfered with by virtue of the Single European Act. That has not been explained to me, and I cannot understand it having regard to the various documents to which we have had access and the various discussions which took place in the joint EC legislative committee, of which I am a member.  I cannot understand how our neutrality is being threatened nor can many people outside the community &mdash; I mean the Irish community.  Over the past 24 hours we have heard a great deal in this House about what the ordinary people are saying but amazingly, what <Col N="2277" /> people are asking is: what does neutrality mean?  In what way can we be neutral in the future?  They are asking how effective a neutral stance will be in the future. There is obviously a very great need for us to recognise the limitations of stances such as that in the future.  It is correct to adopt a stance but we should recognise the limitations involved.</P>
    <P>Hopefully, it will never happen, but should there be a war how long would any country in the western hemisphere remain neutral?  How long and how effective would neutrality be to any European country?  It might mean that certain neutral countries would not be primary targets, but they could be secondary targets if there was a thermo-nuclear war, and they might have an extra 20 minutes at most to take some kind of action.  For that reason I have to say that while I agree with the adopted stance on neutrality, at the same time a number of people are saying that neutrality is not as big an issue as it was.</P>
    <P>The other area that has been mentioned quite a lot is defence and the possibility that, as a result of this Act, we might in some way be drawn into a European defence alignment of one kind or another.  That is not likely to happen. There is nothing in the Act to suggest it. There is no indication from the Government that they will ever try to move in that direction.  I do not think they would get agreement for it.  I am quite sure, and I hope, that the Opposition, having listened to their speeches during the last 24 hours, will think of becoming involved in such an alignment.  I do not think we have anything to fear in that area.  A lot of talk about defence at this time creates great emotion, attracts a great deal of attention and demands a great deal of attention.  There is a threat, whether it be real or theoretical, to our defence and our neutrality as a result of being involved in the Community and as a result of passing this Act.  From discussions which have taken place within the joint EC committee, I cannot see from where the threat comes.</P>
    <P>There has also been quite an amount <Col N="2278" /> of debate on the veto.  It was stated that the majority decisions will eventually supersede the unanimous decisions. There have been areas where this has been the case for quite some time and yet our interests have not suffered.  I accept that in the past number of years &mdash; this is another reason for the introduction of the Single European Act &mdash; the European Community has become sluggish.  It served its purposes quite well since its inception 20 years ago but it is not as incisive as it was.  It has now outlived its usefulness.  Hence there is a need to progress further.  For instance, we are all aware of the difficulties with the Common Agricultural Policy.  We all know the various remedies that have been put forward time and time again to bolster it up.  We know the difficulties and the total inability of the Community to dispose of its surpluses during the last number of years.  It is ridiculous that countless millions of pounds are being spent each year on storage.  Obviously, that cannot be allowed to continue.  It is generally accepted.</P>
    <P>The ironic part is whenever a discussion takes place on that matter, we all immediately revert to making a special case for Ireland, to making a derogation, a stop gap measure, a piecemeal arrangement. The same happens again and again. That is far from what European integration should be.  It is far from achieving the objectives of the European Community. We should address ourselves to that area.  We should find ways and means of making the Community more effective and more efficient.  We appear to have our interests militated against by virtue of our inability to put forward firm innovative proposals which will bring about a change in the structure.  If we can achieve that we will prepare the way for what was originally envisaged by Adenaur, Schuman and others many years ago.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy mentioned the lack of interest in the European elections. That is a valid point and one to which we should all address ourselves.  There has not been a great deal of interest shown in this country in various elections that have taken place.</P>

      <P>The only thing I can say in response to that is that it will be mutual.  In relation to complacency in Europe generally &mdash; it should be a warning to all of us &mdash; when democratic people show a lack of interest in the democratic process it could mean that that process is showing signs of weakness or that they, the people who vote, are showing a lack of judgment.  If one looks back at European history one will readily recognise what happened whenever the democratic processes failed or whenever the public showed scant regard for those democratic processes.  It behoves us all to recognise that if there is complacency when it comes to democratically electing people to represent us in Parliament, be it here or in Europe, that should sound a warning bell to each and every one of us who believes in democracy.  We should take note of that and try to do what we can to ensure that complacency is removed.  We should point out &mdash; we need no illustrations &mdash; what happened when people became too complacent to exercise their franchise when given the opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's attitude to the Single European Act, is very important.  It is something that can be worked out further, something which we, with our contributions, can improve in the time ahead.  It is an instrument through which we can exert sufficient authority and create whatever is required of a nuisance in Europe to ensure that our views are listened to and are taken seriously.  If we do not do that the possibility is that in Europe people will become tired of us. They will recognise us as adopting the piecemeal attitude about which I have already spoken.  If that happens they will lose interest in us and that will be sad for Ireland and for the European Community. I will not refer again to the possible alternative.  Suffice it to say that the adoption of this Act by the Dáil is a recognition by this House of the decision taken by the people of this country in 1972 when they gave their full authority <Col N="2280" /> to us to enter the Community.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion tabled by my party.  The Government <Col N="2282" /> can be accused of a lack of faith in the scheme.  In fact they lack faith in agriculture whether it is in beef, milk, beet or the pig industry.  There has been a lot of evidence of that in the past four years. At EC level the Government failed to fight for a just slice of the cake for the farmers and workers.  As a result of the massive cutbacks by the Government the dole queues have lengthened.  In the last 32 years more than £1,000 million of taxpayers' money has spent on the bovine TB scheme.  It is a national scandal that the Government at a time of high unemployment have cut back on the allocation to agriculture, particularly in connection with the eradication of bovine TB.  I understand the figure for that scheme has been cut by £4 million.  The result is that all the hard work and money spent in the last 30 years has gone out the window. That amounts to national sabotage by the Government who are bent on book-keeping exercises.</P>
      <P>I cannot stress too much how important it is that this scheme should succeed. If it does not achieve its target not alone will the farmers and their families suffer but workers in factories will suffer.  The Government were short-sighted in cutting the allocation for that scheme by £4 million.  We all have heard of the serious outbreaks of bovine TB and brucellosis due to the absence of a proper testing programme.  We do not need the stop-gap measure adopted by the Government.  If that is allowed to continue our dairy herd will suffer and we may not be able to fill the mean quota that was feebly fought for in Brussels.  That would be serious for the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State and his colleagues to have some faith in our most important industry, agriculture. They should stop this penny-pinching. How can we expect aid from Brussels when our Government do not have faith in our farmers?  Farmers should be encouraged to remain on the land and not driven off it.  The Euro-loan introduced to help farmers was a farce.  A one year subsidy on borrowings was not sufficient. Farmers have experienced two of the <Col N="2283" /> worst years in living memory but they got very little help from the Government with the exception of a Mickey Mouse loan scheme for one year.  The Government should have prepared a scheme of low interest loans repayable over a long term.  If the scheme is allowed to go much further down that road of destruction, the taxpayers will have to provide a lot more money to help farmers to recover. It is important that we continue our efforts to eradicate bovine TB and brucellosis.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the amount of money and time that has been put into this scheme, it is difficult to understand how it has not succeeded.  We must be the laughing stock of Europe.  The Minister should ask the senior officials in his Department to introduce a county scheme giving more authority to local officials.  There must be a weak link in the system if it has not been a success after 30 years.  Farmers have played their part and in the past 12 months they have contributed £13 million in disease levies. What have they got in return?  What they got in return for that investment was a drop in their income.  We have heard a lot of waffle in the last four years about farm grants, ACOT cutbacks and so on but the farmers have had to pay levies, increased taxation and land tax.  One would imagine that the industry was prospering. The farming community are prepared to pay their taxes, on accounts, like any other business and I do not see any reason why they should be taxed in a different manner.  They are honest people and always paid their way.  They always served the nation when needed.</P>
    <P>The Government in order to satisfy certain interests have introduced a land tax.  It will cost millions to operate that scheme but there will be little return from it.  That scheme will not be around long when we get our hands on the powers of Government.  We have given a commitment to abolish it when we are returned to power and, judging by recent events, that will not be too long.  We have had a crisis every week in the past six <Col N="2284" /> weeks.  It is sad to think that the Government are operating this scheme on a shoe-string budget although £13 million has been poured into it by the farming community. What other section of society would tolerate a Government that treated them in this manner?  Farmers have had to take a 24 per cent reduction in their income in the past three years.  How can they stay in business?  How can the nation survive?  We have heard too much waffle from the Department, some of whose officials never saw a green field. All we have are long dole queues and 30,000 on the emigrant ship.  What are the farmers to do?  They have had to cope with bad weather and a reduction in milk quotas.  In recent months there has not been a bob to pay for the reactors sent to the factories.  The Government should get out and let the people of Ireland blood test them.  I am sure there will be a big number of reactors on the Government side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy does not get brucellosis after his contribution.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to make a contribution on this important farming topic.</P>
      <P>I understand why the Opposition put down this motion &mdash; to embarrass the Government.  There are rights and wrongs about everything.  I will not say that everything is rosy on one side or the other, but where we have real successes we should accept them, and where we have problems we must identify them and try to solve them.  For the good of agriculture and everybody in the country let us hope we will be able to bring about conditions which will eradicate this dreadful disease of tuberculosis in cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever we spoke about animal disease until quite recently we always said that brucellosis was a far more dreaded disease than TB.  Connected as I was with the cattle business in the marts in the early seventies, I recall that the greatest fright other than sickness in the family that could befall any farmer was to be told that his cattle had brucellosis.  In 1980, we had 9,000 herds locked up with <Col N="2285" /> brucellosis.  It was a frightening statistic, and a wave of emotion engulfed the entire country.  The Department of Agriculture personnel who oversaw the eradication of that disease are the self-same team, under the same type of regulations, who are now trying to wrestle with TB.  For the record, for those 9,000 herds in 1980 which were locked up with brucellosis read 70 herds in 1986.  The Department of Agriculture, the Animal Health Council, the farmers and the others associated with the campaign can be patted on the back because they did so well on brucellosis eradication.</P>
    <P>It is important for our trading partners to know that we have that clean record. A few weeks ago I was in Scotland on a CBS promotion of live heifers from the west and it was very important for me to be able to say that Ireland now has the same status as England, Scotland and Wales &mdash; we were declared free of brucellosis. We cannot be complacent about it &mdash; we must retain that status as far as brucellosis is concerned.</P>
    <P>On TB, this is the same country, the same cattle, the same Department of Agriculture.  When the TB scheme began 30 years ago one animal in six reacted to the disease &mdash; the country was rotten with bovine TB.  It is still bad but only to the degree that one out of 300 cattle was a reactor in November 1986.  In November 1956, 5,280 herds were locked up or restricted, 5,000 herds too many.  In these competitive days we have to stand shoulder to shoulder with the farming nations of the world and it is most important that we have clean tag as far as animal health is concerned.  That is why at every farmers' meeting throughout the country the main topic of conversation is TB and its eradication.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to say that we have spent much time ensuring that the source and spread of bovine TB can be identified so that we can come to grips with it. There are baffled farming families who owned those 5,000 restricted herds who cannot for the life of them understand how TB got into their farms.  We have an <Col N="2286" /> enlightened energetic research committee dealing with issues that arise not only here but throughout the world. Some commentators, farmers and others think we have a very inward looking view of this disease, that we have not learned from experiences of other countries.  That is not so.  We draw on their experience every week.</P>
    <P>The question people in the veterinary profession all over the world are asking is whether it would be better to blood test cattle for tuberculosis.  I am not a vet so I cannot give any direction from a scientific or professional point of view. However, I hope that very shortly we will be able to say conclusively if that would be a better scheme for this country, if we could say we would be able to monitor the results better, show that value was being got for the taxpayers' money and that farmers' animals would be safe from disease.</P>
    <P>There are other small matters which I have not time to deal with this evening. For instance, we should consider the type of disinfectants used up to a few years ago.  I am not certain there were controls on the type of disinfectants used after the dreaded disease appeared.  Everything in the DVOs is now computerised.  People take little notice when they are told that the files in our DVOs are computerised and that this makes a great difference to the operation of the scheme.  We will be in a position in the very near future to identify at the flick of a switch all that should be known not alone about herd-owners but about every animal they own.</P>
    <P>We have to find out how the disease spreads.  We have been told it is a lateral spread.  Some farmers argue with me that the disease has no way of getting in unless it blew in by the last helicopter that flew over.  It seems to me that we should have better fencing.  A controversy has arisen about badgers.  I am speaking personally when I say that I have not the slightest doubt that badgers carry the disease.  In my view, where they are seen to carry the disease, the good offices of everybody should be harnessed to ensure the badgers <Col N="2287" /> are wiped out for the greater good of the community.</P>
    <P>Community awareness is very important. In my townland of Mountbellew everybody blesses themselves when they have clear tests; when it happens that the cattle of one poor devil react to the test they shrug their shoulders and say that he was unlucky but they were very lucky. Nobody is lucky if TB is within an ass's roar of the them.  We have to have community awareness about this because we must regard TB in the same way as we regarded attacks on old people in rural Ireland a few years ago.  It is that serious. At the end of the day it has the same effect of various reasons I do not have to detail.  We have now reached the stage at which there is that community awareness.</P>
    <P>There are a few other exciting things happening I should mention.  Admittedly they are administrative details but they are important and have been long overdue. I have always found it quite difficult to understand why reactor animals could not and would not have been sent directly to the factory the minute, the day or the week they were identified as having TB. We have now shortened the period in that respect enormously.  The period within which farmers will now have a chance of getting their animals to the factory will be ten days.  But a very real administrative problem has arisen there.  It is simply this, that some factories, for one reason or another, just do not want to hear about reactor cattle; they would rather see the devil himself appear than a load of reactor cattle and they pay accordingly.  This means that the salvage value of the animal to the farmer is even more depressed than it should be, in other words, the steamroller is being put on the farmer twice over.  On the one hand he loses the animal and then receives a price much less than the market would require or dictate for the animal in question.</P>
    <P>The system we are operating in County Cork on a pilot basis is something I know a little about because I was involved in the mart in Tuam in the early seventies. At that time I provided a service to the <Col N="2288" /> mart when our lorry, as a free service, collected reactor animals &mdash; at that time it was all a question of brucellosis &mdash; and brought them to the various factories. This is a much better scheme in the sense that the provision is, from a statutory or mandatory point of view, that farmers must use the system.  I am sure that Deputy J. Walsh opposite will maintain a close eye on this.  I think it is the beginning of a national scheme.  First, a job can be done in getting animals to the factory likely to pay most for them, that has a trade for them.  We can be assured that, once the animals are collected exfarm, they go directly to the factory. When one has commodities as lethal as TB cattle in a lorry it is important that they go directly from the farm to the factory.  It is also vital that we know that such vehicles would be thoroughly disinfected after each such visit.  That is a step in the right direction.  I understand that the system will have its little hiccups but it will be to the benefit of farmers generally and they will come to see that themselves.  It will be much better if such animals go directly to the factory involving, hopefully, the co-operatives and anybody else throughout the country. Hopefully this pilot project will spread to all areas, at which stage we can be sure that we have tightened up on that aspect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Headlines in the papers always read: £300 million wasted on TB eradication.  Much of that type of propaganda occurred before my time and I have no doubt it will continue.  A few years ago we tightened the provisions of the system, we changed the nomination of the veterinary surgeon &mdash; all of this was trotted out here last evening &mdash; so <Col N="2289" /> that now we have greater control over the implementation of the system.  We are able more quickly to identify reactor animals, hopefully getting them to the factory more quickly, all of that kind of thing.  With all the talk about cutbacks, I should say that there has been a cutback from the 1985 level of approximately £33 million, that is what it cost that year. To my knowledge that was the highest amount ever paid for eradication of this disease.  Unfortunately there was a cutback, something we in Agriculture certainly did not like.  We would much have preferred to have had the full round of testing during 1986 but, when one checks the figures, one finds that the best possible use was made of the money available at the time.</P>
      <P>There are a few extreme black spots in the country.  There will have to be a continuation of the concerted effort made in the course of this year to eliminate those black spots.  I might mention County Longford in particular, where I attended a few public meetings in the last few years.  It is an area in which the incidents of TB is extremely high.  There has been intensive testing carried on in County Longford &mdash; despite what the Opposition will say about cutbacks &mdash; during 1986.  I am told that we are now beginning to see some levelling off of the incidence of the disease.  In addition I am glad to say that it is hoped that, commencing early in January next, that county will receive the type of consideration it deserves, that there will be a full round of testing carried out there, with a possible second round.  Certainly the first round of testing will commence right across County Longford in the very near future.</P>
      <P>There is then the whole question of an outbreak of the disease, as occurred in Portumna in my own county, in many parts of the midlands, when it is often extremely difficult to ascertain how it began.  One of our biggest problems of all is that of re-infection, an area having been cleared of the disease but which for some reason nobody has yet explained to my satisfaction, becomes reinfected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the depopulation grants <Col N="2290" /> were initiated a few years ago and have been increased is a demonstration of our commitment to the people who have to cope with this dreaded disease.  Every effort will be made in the year 1987 to ensure that we get as near to the type of testing we should all like to see in order to eliminate this dreaded disease from our herds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be supporting the amendment put down by the Minister. There are a few points I should like to make in the overall context of the debate with regard to the TB eradication programme. It is true to say that in the last 30 years, substantial amounts of money have been spent by the State, by the taxpayer, on the elimination of this disease. The figure being thrown around is of the order of £1,000 million in today's money values.  The real figure would be closer to £400 million.  It happens regularly &mdash; not in this Department alone &mdash; that figures are exaggerated.  With regard to this programme it appears as if the farming community received hand-outs approximating to that amount of money. For the first time ever I believe that this year and last there was a real contribution made by the people most affected, the farming community.  Some farmers' livelihoods have been eliminated over those years through the incidence of this dreaded disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is long past the time for the establishment of a management broad to administer this scheme throughout the country.  Farmers now paying in the region of £11 million and £12 million in levies &mdash; that in the years 1985 and 1986 &mdash; should have a say in the operation of this scheme.  They have made a contribution of the great magnitude that I have mentioned and they have no say in the administration of the scheme.  That is done by the Department of Agriculture through the DVOs throughout the country and one is depending on the 196 veterinary practitioners employed by the Department and the 800 private practitioners. Until such time as we make an honest effort to give the people who are most effected and who are giving a substantial <Col N="2291" /> amount of money towards the eradication of this disease we will not have the bottom line result that we would all like to see.</P>
    <P>I had the opportunity of attending a meeting of farmers in my constituency about a month ago and for the first time ever in my years in politics or in attending those meetings I witnessed a willingness among the people who attended that meeting to have this disease eradicated. Members in this House have made the point that the allocation for this year was reduced.  We accept that, and we are not defending it for the sake of defending it. In the budget reductions had to be made in expenditure and this was one of the areas where some of these reductions had to be made.  However, it should be pointed out here that in 1981, 99 per cent of the herd was tested; in 1982, 76 per cent; in 1983, 45 per cent; in 1984, 90 per cent; in 1985, 135 per cent and in 1986 an estimated 58 per cent.  Taking 1985 and 1986 together would indicate that in the region of 90 per cent of the herds were tested in each of the two years.  That is not as bad as some members of the Opposition might think.</P>
    <P>For the sake of £5 million it is incredible that all the people involved will be paid a certain amount of money and at the end of the day the numbers of herd tests are fewer to the extent of 42 per cent in one year.  Everybody is aware of how serious the problem is and how severely affected individual families have been because of this decision which meant losing their herds or their herds being locked up.</P>
    <P>The proper way forward in this is the pilot scheme that the Minister spoke about here this evening.  Cork and Longford have a particularly serious problem in this respect.  The people affected by this and who are contributing towards the eradication of this disease should be involved in the administration of the scheme.  That is not too much to ask for. We have tried all other ways and I believe that this new way will be very successful. Farmers should have 40 per cent of representation, with the Department and the <Col N="2292" /> IVU having the rest of the representation on the board set up to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>We in this House and people outside are aware that all cattle here move about six times in their lifetime.  That is not so in almost any other country in the world. It is very difficult to prevent this disease spreading in such circumstances.  This country is known as the country where thousands of people live from dealing in cattle.  That has not changed over my lifetime of 30 years and I do not think it will change very much in the next 30 years.  Worst affected by this are areas where a large number of cattle dealers make their livelihoods and cattle are moved on a continuous basis.  Now that we are aware of this we should try to get the people concerned to come together to deal with it.  The farming organisations have been omitted from any active part in the administration of the scheme.  They would have a very important input, not alone because they are paying out £12 million or £13 million towards the scheme but because they know ways to improve the situation by, for instance, introducing proper tags which cannot be tampered with.</P>

      <P>Amendment No.24 in my name reads:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo;, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, conscious of the fact that (i) bovine TB eradication has now been unsuccessfully pursued for 32 years, at a cost of over £1,000 million to the taxpayer in today's values, and (ii) that the scheme now employes over 1,300 civil servants, and involves 800 veterinary surgeons, deplores the failure of the scheme to eradicate the disease, and calls for a completely new scheme, incorporating proper management systems at Departmental level, including stringent controls and adequate recording of data on the movement of cattle, and adequate incentives and sanctions to ensure the highest standards of co-operation by all farmers&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment which is in my name and those of my colleagues, draws attention to the fact that this eradication scheme which we have has been pursued now with no success for 32 years.  We are no better off than we were ten years ago and it is doubtful whether we are any better off than we were 32 years ago.  This has been done at a cost of no less than £1,000 million to the taxpayer in today's values.  According to the Committee on Public Expenditure, who investigated this matter thoroughly, the scheme employs more than 1,300 civil servants doing nothing else but pursuing this scheme which is getting nowhere.  In addition, at least on a part time basis, 800 veterinary surgeons in private practice are involved in it.  The committee's report refers to this scheme as now being more accurately described as a TB containment scheme because there is no longer any real desire, from what they can see, to eradicate it because there are too many vested interests at both bureaucratic and professional levels seeking just to contain the disease rather than to eradicate it.  To <Col N="2294" /> continue this appalling waste of money is, as has been described by one of the most distinguished public servants, Dr. T. K. Whitaker, perhaps the greatest scandal in the waste of public money in this country since the establishment of the State.</P>
    <P>It is not a once off thing where millions of pounds are wasted on one project.  It has gone on year after year now for 32 years and, as this committee point out, in some counties and in the present year the incidence of the disease is four times greater than it was a decade ago, and still the money is churned out year after year.</P>

      <P>The Committee on Public Expenditure in their report are appalled that there are over 1,300 people providing support for the scheme and that these costs continue even when, as happened in the past, no testing takes place.  I suppose the idea of that report, as with many others from which I could give umpteen quotations, is to try to brush it under the carpet and hope it will go away, to hope that this nonsensical scheme which is doing nothing to achieve its objective and is back at square one will go on indefinitely because there are too many people doing too well out of it. It is worthwhile contrasting the position with regard to bovine TB eradications here with the position in Northern Ireland where conditions are much the same, where the land is much the same and where success has been achieved although we have nothing but failure here.</P>

    <P>One of the ways in which we can assess our ability as a nation to turn our own affairs is in respect of something like this which is enormously damaging to one of our principal industries and one of our principal ways of life.

      <P>One of the most disturbing aspects of this matter is that the Coalition Government will not admit that the decision not to honour their commitment in <i>Building on Reality</i> to carry out this three year programme, was disastrous. The lengths to which Government speakers go to cover up is appalling.  It is disturbing that all sorts of excuses and distortions are put forward continuing to say that progress has been made, when the reality is that no progress has been made and we are in a worse position now after 31 years of attempting to eradicate this disease than we were ten years ago.</P>
      <P>The farming community who have most to lose were asked to pay a levy in the region of £13 million per annum, for one year.  That, of course, was extended for a further year.  Despite the fact that the farming community paid that money, which should be sufficient to cover a full round of testing, they were abandoned and left with a 60 per cent of a round of testing.  Some of them have suffered financially as a result of this.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of the abandonment of the three year programme was the extremely shabby treatment of 130 young veterinary surgeons who were given categorical assurances they would get three full years work.  The treatment of those young graduates ranks as one of the lowest things that I have come across.  They are now regarded as scabs and undesirable people in their profession and most of them have abandoned any hope of employment in this country.  Those concerned with that aspect of the scheme should be ashamed of themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that some progress has been made under the scheme. Over the last decade in the region of 30,000 reactors have been found each year.  Progress has not been made and there is no point in switching from percentage prevalence to percentage incidence to give an impression that progress has been made.  It has been sugested that <Col N="2296" /> there is ongoing research into disease eradication.  The reality is that there are only a handful of research workers in this area and even at that they are not involved full time in the research programme. The main difficulty is that there has not been continuity of funding for this scheme.  This stop-go policy, picking disputes with some of the people involved from time to time to slow up the scheme, has been absolutely disastrous.  This happened in the seventies in relation to lay technicans whom we do not hear about now, but it was disastrous then.  It happened also in relation to direct nomination of veterinary surgeons and the employment of young vets.  Of course that has been reneged on, the veterinary practices are once again doing what they always did and there is no change.</P>
    <P>In relation to research into disease eradication, it is regrettable that our major agricultural research organisation, An Foras Talúntais are not allowed to do the research in this area.  After 31 years of fiddling around with attempts to eradicate the disease, An Foras Talúntais are still prevented from carrying out this, research.  There is no point in saying we have a more difficult job than other countries. All over Europe people have the same problem, maybe not as acute as we have in some cases, but nevertheless the same problem.  We cannot progress until we appreciate that this disease can be controlled.  Unless we have adequate continuity of finance and adequate research, we will never master the problem. In relation to disease control, we should disinfect mart premises, lorries and so on, this is elementary.  It is a scandal that many of the trucks used to take diseased cattle to and from marts and factories only get the gesture of a cold water hose down.  The reality is that this is a very contagious bug which could be eliminated by the use of disinfectants. The Department's inspectorate should be more insistent on adequate disinfecting of mart premises.  The farming community should have more of an interest than anybody else in insisting that people who regularly visit their farms on cattle business are adequately disinfected <Col N="2297" /> before they are allowed on the premises. Unless those precautions are taken we will continue with this appalling lack of results under this scheme.</P>
    <P>This is a highly contagious disease and unless adequate precautionary measures are taken we will not deal with it.  In relation to eradicating brucellosis and foot and mouth disease, we did not rely on old excuses or slap ourselves on the back and say &ldquo;we have a very difficult job to do&rdquo; without doing it.  We tackled those two diseases in a forthright way.  We did what was required to be done at farm and factory level to ensure that the disease was finally nailed and we got on top of the problem.  In the area of TB there are so many weak links from the farm to the factory and to the marts that I am not surprised we are still grappling with the problem of trying to rid the country of this disease.  When we think that milk and beef exports are valued to the tune of £2 billion it is a great scandal we have not been able to tackle this problem adequately.</P>
    <P>As I said, the most disturbing aspect is that the Government will not openly admit the fact that they capitulated to the Department of Finance when they were looking for savings and cuts.  They told the Department of Finance they could take a few million pounds from the disease eradication programme which could be put back for a few years.  This year the Minister, Deputy Deasy, gave a commitment that if there were savings in any areas of his Department he would allocate those savings to this programme. There has been a saving of £3.5 million under the farm modernisation scheme. This commitment has been reneged on and those who are operating the disease eradication programme are left without money.</P>
    <P>I support the Fianna Fáil motion and I want to say to the Government that they should be ashamed of themselves because of the way they handled this matter and particularly because of the way they handled the number of aspects I dwelt on, especially the position of those unfortunate young veterinary surgeons who <Col N="2298" /> are the casualties of this unsavoury business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the motion before the House which reads,</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann aware of the current lack of progress in the eradication of bovine tubercullosis, condemns the Government's failure to implement the scheme in an effective manner and calls for urgent action to remedy the situation.</P>
      <P>I am absolutely horrified and disgusted at the amendment which has been put down by the Government, which reads:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann notes that, notwithstanding the constraints imposed by the budgetary situation, the Government's programme for the eradication of bovine diseases is achieving satisfactory results.</P>
      <P>For anyone, let alone the members of the Government, to suggest that satisfactory results were being achieved under the TB eradication programme is nothing short of a disgrace and an untruth.  The TB eradication programme has been a disaster and there are two main reasons. One is what was known then as the &ldquo;vets strike&rdquo;.  I believe that it was more of a dispute than a strike.  When Mark Clinton was Minister for Agriculture in the mid-seventies this dispute was prolonged over a two year period by a Coalition Government who allowed TB to self-promote itself without any control whatsoever. The then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Clinton, was prepared to sit back and accept this ongoing situation which was costing this country millions day by day.  Of course, everybody will be aware that there are two sides to every dispute but when we elect a Government we elect them to govern and create situations where the country's greatest asset would not be decimated.  Because of stubborness, carelessness and ignorance that dispute was allowed to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disease eradication programme which had a reasonable success rate up until then had all of its achievements wiped out.  Quite literally, we had to start <Col N="2299" /> from scratch again.  This country lost millions of pounds every day while Europe and our other customers were watching our cattle herd become more infected day by day.  Our disease free herd and our boast of the cleanest food in the world were coming into question.  The dispute of the mid-seventies was an absolute disaster.</P>
    <P>This dispute was followed by a new one between the present Minister and the vets.  The Minister, Deputy Deasy, has had a long record of bad judgment and non-achievement for farmers generally. We should remind him once again that while he has succeeded in widening the gap between the urban and rural populations the position still remains that agriculture is basic to our economy and still employs 500,000 people directly and indirectly.  It is by far and away the biggest industry in this country.  When agriculture is doing well so too is the rest of the country.  When agriculture is down, as is the case at present, so too is our economy and until such time as heed is put on agriculture and a commitment is given to agriculture and until there is a definite policy decision by the Government to support agriculture then and not until then will the country get up off its knees.  The prospect of the Government ever making that decision is pretty remote because as sure as night follows day an election is imminent and as sure as night follows day the farmers will not support ever again a Coalition Government of Fine Gael and Labour.</P>
    <P>Neither will they support Fine Gael whose liberal and trendy leftists do not have an ounce of common sense between them and who concern themselves with the rights and wrongs of hare coursing as a priority over the basis of our economy, which is, agriculture.  It is well known that the Labour Party are anti-farmer in every possible way.  They are the party who look for everything for nothing and who recommend that nobody pay for anything. It is well known that Fine Gael who traditionally were supported by the big farmers have now turned their backs on this sector.  The damage they have <Col N="2300" /> done to agriculture over four years is enormous.  Not alone are they messing about with the TB eradication scheme, they have withdrawn many useful services in the agricultural sector.  The cattle herd remains static at 6.5 million.  Unfortunately, recent trends show a decrease on the graph.</P>
    <P>Ireland has the best and cleanest food in the world.  This probably comes from the fact we are an island country.  Unless we keep proper control we will venture into the unknown.  Once we lose that disease free status we will never recover. The greatest asset, advantage and boost those who are involved in marketing can have when selling our foods is that we are disease free and clean.  The Government have consistently blamed the farmers, the dealers and the vets for the fact we have not succeeded in eradicating TB.  I am saying it is the Government's fault because if the Government cannot govern they should admit it and get out. If the Government are not in control they should do the only honourable thing.  On their own admission they are not in control.</P>
    <P>The famous publication <i>Building on Reality,</i> regarded by most people as &ldquo;Garret in Wonderland&rdquo;, set out a detailed programme on TB eradication.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about that.  Chapter 2.51 of &ldquo;Garret in Wonderland&rdquo; states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final clearance of bovine TB from the national herd remains one of the most urgent problems facing agriculture. It is evident that despite substantial cost to the Exchequer, little progress towards complete eradication has been achieved over the last few years.  Faced with a situation where it is essential to get rid of the disease in order to safeguard our exports of livestock and livestock products, the Government must be satisfied that funds committed to the eradication <Col N="2301" /> programme in future are spent effectively.</P>
    <P>Chapter 7.36 states:</P>
    <P>The Government have also decided to make a fresh onslaught on bovine disease, particularly tuberculosis.  Substantially increased funds will be made available for disease eradication.</P>
    <P>The final paragraph on agriculture announces the intention to establish a central epidemiology unit in the Department of Agriculture to co-ordinate and assist in the anaysis of disease outbreaks, prevention of disease spreads, etc.</P>
    <P>Following the adoption of that now defunct document sufficient moneys were put into the eradication of TB and I must admit, as I have admitted before, that a very successful attempt was made to eradicated TB in 1985.  But this year £5 million was withdrawn from the scheme and as a result 60 per cent of herds have not been tested this year.  Despite repeated requests, my own herd has not been tested.  There are many like me who have disease-free herds and who have co-operated with the Department at all times.  Farmers are themselves concerned about TB eradication and I can say with confidence that about 99.9 per cent of them are anxious to see an end to TB because it will be in their own interests to eliminate such a tremendous loss.  If the untested herds of this year become infected, obviously infection will grow in those herds.  Who then will be responsible for the consequent losses to the herd owners who have at all times acted responsibly?  Because of the penny-pinching attitude of this anti-farmer Government, such farmers may at this stage have severely infected herds.</P>
    <P>Because of the cut of £5 million this year in the TB eradication scheme, only 40 per cent or 45 per cent of herds have been tested.  Four million head of cattle this year will not have been tested.  The scheme was designed to eradicate TB from cattle, not to create or maintain employment.  The 1,300 civil servants and the 800 veterinary surgeons were not affected, but the cattle were forgotten. <Col N="2302" /> This Government of fiscal rectitude have wrecked a good and necessary scheme. When the scheme was so successful last year why should the administration not continue and sustain a programme which was heading in the right direction?  We must conclude that agriculture is a very low priority with the Minister for Agriculture and the Government.  The feeble answer offered to us is that this Government are reducing public spending, yet they can find £7.5 million to buy Agriculture House at a time when money is so scarce.</P>
    <P>The scheme has cost the taxpayers' £1,000 million to date and has operated for 32 years.  Taxpayers who are now very scarce in number are paying levels of taxation which would not be accepted in any other country.  The least they might expect is that their hard earned money should be utilised for productive purposes. The stop-go attitude referred to by my colleague has been a scandal. Undoubtedly taxpayers' money is being squandered.  We are assured that to date this year only 35 per cent of cattle have been tested.  How can any individual or group justify that level of testing in this, our greatest national income earner, the cattle herd?  How could anyone who had any appreciation of farming allow this to happen?  Last year we applauded the efforts being made when 10 million cattle were tested in 10 months.  The complete herd was tested, the reactors were tested and some cattle were retested.  The scheme was actually coming to grips with the problem.  Veterinary surgeons and farmers were becoming confident, but this year all the good work of last year was destroyed.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, said last night that two rounds were carried out in two years.  Deputy Hegarty was not telling the truth and he knows it.  He is one of the few people on the Government benches with any appreciation or knowledge of agriculture, having been a real farmer himself.  The two rounds suggested by him took into account last year's record and added the previous year's activity which stood at about 70 per cent.  The numbers added <Col N="2303" /> up but many of the cattle had been retested.  In fact about 2 million cattle were not tested in 1984.  The Minister should not allow himself to be bullied into a situation with which he does not agree.</P>
    <P>One must question the whole approach to the scheme.  I know of farmers whose herds have consistently failed the TB test, at enormous cost to those farmers and to the State.  The Department should set about discovering why such herds fail continually.  It is well known that TB is transmissible between animal and human, yet we have this haphazard, will-nilly approach.  Why have the Department not considered more seriously the source of the problem?  If the source of the disease is located then surely it can be eliminated.  While we go on ignoring the cause we cannot expect to make satisfactory progress.  We must immediately set up a department within the Department of Agriculture to attack this problem. Was it badgers who caused the problem or was it an infected house or a slurry pit?  We will still be asking those questions next year unless this issue is addressed immediately.  We had the graduates here to do the job but it seems that it is better to export our young, educated people to work elsewhere rather than to keep them at home.  Of the 100,000 people who have emigrated in the last four years, I wonder how many have degrees?  The TB test is 80 per cent accurate but if a full round of every herd is carried out every year and a follow-up of reactors, that other 20 per cent will be reduced and the continuation of an intensive campaign will eventually root out this terrible menace.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has disgraced himself and Irish agriculture in so many ways since he took office, we would all like to see him redeem himself at this late stage by ensuring a proper programme for TB eradication.  His time is very short.</P>

They will co-operate in every way with the Department in that respect.  Irish farmers are sceptical of some decisions made by Departments outside the Department of Agriculture, in the fight against TB.  For instance, it is a well-known fact that farmers who are compelled to depopulate their herds completely find the return which they get for reactors is assessed by the Revenue Commissioners as farm income for tax purposes instead of being classified as money for replacement of stock.  This anomaly should end.  The position should be corrected immediately. Would the Minister for Agriculture have a word with his counterpart in the Department of Finance to see that this money realised from the sale of reactors is not held against the farmers for tax purposes?</P>

      <P>Between all of them they are erecting a tombstone for Minister Deasy every time they get up to talk. They talk about the marvellous financial packages that the Minister brought back from Brussels.  I could best describe them as a set of lucky bags.  Take your dip and you might be lucky and you might not; that is about the size of it.  I thought at the beginning that we would be at one with Deputy Sheehan when he started saying that one of the reasons for the failure of the TB eradication scheme was the lack of research.  If he continued in that vein we would have supported him in full here.  That is one of the basic reasons.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to explain to this House why An Foras Talúntais, which is one of our best research units, was not involved and will not be allowed to be involved in research into this area? Rather do the Government try to fool the farming community by having two part time researchers in a research laboratory in Adamstown.  What do they expect them to do?  Do they not consider that this disease problem is of much significance to the agricultural industry, the farmers and the national economy?  This has baffled everybody.  In relation to that research unit, it is ironic that they are told to sell three of their research farms to try to get money for the Exchequer.  If that is not the greatest indictment of a Fine Gael Minister and a Fine Gael Government in relation to what Deputy Sheehan believes should be carried out in research, what is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme was started 32 years ago. It is not true to say, as the report of the Committee on Public Expenditure says, that no progress has been made.  Very significant progress was made.  The level of disease was something in the region of 17 per cent and it got down to approximately 2.7 per cent in the late seventies. The hard core was left.  What I believe <Col N="2309" /> went wrong then and since is that we got down to the hard core but followed the same system, the same scheme, the same procedures, to try to eliminate that hard core as we did when there was high prevalence. The system as we now have it was good enough then but it is not good enough now.  That is the reality.  We are dealing with a germ that is so strong that it can live for two years in cement and for a lifetime, forever, in timber.  That is the sort of germ we are trying to deal with.  We are carrying on the same system and hoping for results which will never be achieved.  Until proper research is undertaken to determine the source and how the germ spreads, there will not be a cure.</P>
    <P>The Department, the Minister, the veterinary profession and farmers must all take a positive approach in relation to the disease and adequate finance should be forthcoming to see that this is done.  At present, there is a stop-go policy although everybody was behind the Minister for Agriculture when he introduced a new plan to eradicate the disease and to commit the necessary funds to it.  Ten months later, there has been a cutback of £4.5 million.  The great expectations in relation to the scheme were destroyed overnight by the stroke of a pen.  It is very easy to cut funds if you do not think of the repercussions.  The sum of £4.5 million is very small considering that the farmers already contributed £14 million as part of their commitment to try to eradicate the disease.  Obviously the Minister had no confidence in the scheme and in his own ability to get anywhere with it.</P>
    <P>In County Longford there has been a rise of 12.5 per cent in the level of the disease, the highest ever recorded in the history of animal disease.  Yet the Minister said blandly that he recognises that there is a high level of disease but that he will not take special circumstances into consideration.  Apparently he does not care about the livelihood of small farmers in County Longford who are under severe financial pressure as a result of non-recognition by him and the Department of the problems in that area.  Badgers <Col N="2310" /> have been blamed for causing the disease. In the parish of Newtowncashel, 40 per cent of the herds are affected but 16 badgers are snared on the farms with the highest level of disease and not a single one showed any signs of TB.  Perhaps they are a contributory factor but they are certainly not the sole cause of the disease.  I know levels of disease have been found in some badgers but the biggest badger of all is the Department of Agriculture coupled with the Minister who will not recognise what is happening&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In County Longford the incidence of the disease is so high that farmers will be eradicated if something is not done soon.  A special pilot scheme should be introduced in that county to try to curtail the level of the disease but my request for such a scheme fell on deaf ears.  The Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, visited the area many times but he had nothing to offer them.  Busloads of farmers went to Stradone, County Cavan, the other night to take part in the farmers' meeting and they expected the Minister for Agriculture and his top officials to attend; about 400 farmers from Monaghan, Cavan and Longford made the journey only to find that the Minister or his officials had not turned up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>How could we have confidence in the Minister when he is not prepared to attend a specially arranged meeting to discuss the problems?  There is a serious crisis in relation to TB eradication in Longford and a Department veterinary surgeon said on television a few weeks ago that 50 per cent of the herds he had tested were affected.  There is no room for complacency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also serious social problems as a result of the disease.  A small farmer in south county Longford built up his <Col N="2311" /> herd from nothing to 38 milk cows.  He did not bring in even one extra animal, he had double fencing and he was very careful to use disinfectant.  However, even with all these precautions, the disease got into his herd in the last three months.  He was told that there was no money to pay him compensation for the loss of his animals.  He did not even care about the money, he wanted them to take the cattle away.  The Department finally agreed to take the cattle from his farm and, the day after, he went to Los Angeles where he intends to stay.  If the Department intend to compensate him, they can send the cheque to his mother. That certainly is an indictment of the TB eradication scheme.</P>
    <P>I also heard the Minister trying to blame factories because they are not interested in reactor cattle and would not pay the price&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>What factory is interested in small cattle?  They are a nuisance and the Minister knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The big cattle are a nuisance, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The system is not geared to killing cattle which are six months old.  What are farmers to do when their small store cattle have been taken away and they are paid buttons in replacement value?  They cannot even buy cattle and, if they are in the dairying sector, not alone do they lose their cows, including those in calf but their income to ensure survival is also gone.  The Minister is creating very serious social problems all round the country and he is putting financial stress on families who are unable to cope.  I realise that the Minister cannot raise the value of compensation overnight but some areas are much more badly affected than others and special schemes should apply to <Col N="2312" /> them.  The Government have an obligation to ensure that people can maintain their standard of living by giving them adequate compensation.  However, the only response to the disease seems to be to test cattle.  No one in their senses would go along with a scheme for 32 years, day in day out, when there are no improvements.</P>
      <P>Suggestions have been made tonight that the preservation of an empire of 1,300 public servants and 800 veterinary surgeons was more important than the eradication of the disease.  The vested interests of farmers were also mentioned. I am not here to apportion blame but a Minister in his sane senses would not carry on in this fashion.  After all, the incidence of the disease was 2.7 per cent in the late seventies but it has now risen to 12 per cent in my area and in many other areas also.  I repeat what an old farmer said to me &mdash; if the Minister does not know where he is going any road will get him there.  But he is only whistling passing the graveyard.  This man spoke about a Minister who let down agriculture, not alone so far as the bovine tuberculosis is concerned, but in other areas as well.  This is a national scandal. The Minister must recognise that a crisis exists and that the taxpayers' are entitled to value for money.  It is in the interest of the economy generally and the meat industry in particular that the necessary steps should be taken.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us why he will not allow the only decent agricultural institute we have to investigate this problem.  There are many questions to be answered and I am sure many more will remain unanswered until this Government get out and the people get what they want, a Government who care about the farmers and rural Ireland.  The people want a Government who are not dominated by Pale politics, unlike this Government who can always find money for the cities but never for the small farmers who were, are, and always will be, the backbone of our agricultural community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>As the point has been raised I want to deal with it fairly.  This afternoon the Taoiseach said he doubted if there was any area of public policy in respect of which we had witnessed such consistent, ill-informed and misdirected criticism as there has been with respect to political co-operation as it has operated since we joined the Community and as is now provided for in the Single European Act.  That is not an unreasonable statement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to curtail my speech to a reasonable length but I hope that example is followed by Deputy Brady's colleagues on all occasions and that we do not have a repeat of what happened this afternoon.  I will agree to the arrangement I made with the Chair privately, that I will confine my remarks to approximately 20 minutes.  I must point out that it is not my fault that time has been wasted today by inordinately long speeches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach's reference to the degree of confusion and ambiguity that has arisen in this respect is reasonable. However, I submit that the principal reason for that lack of clarity of the issues relates to the fact that there has not been any rational comprehensive debate on this issue or on foreign policy issues in recent months.  The public and interested parties have not been afforded an opportunity of debating these issues in a way that would ensure that there would not have been the kind of confusion it is now <Col N="2319" /> alleged exists.  If we had had a White Paper on the Single European Act there might have been less confusion and ambiguity. We might have been able to deal with the issues more clearly.  I do not blame the plethora of organisations, individuals or trade unions who have expressed their suspicion and cynicism about proposals in the Act.</P>
    <P>Some of the provisions of the Act could leave themselves open to the interpretation that there are issues that need to be clarified.  The Act, obviously, is extremely important for the country but its passage in the House is not facilitated by an absence of comprehensive clear foreign policy having been developed by the House and put in place by the Government.  Our foreign policy appears to amount to crises management instruments implemented on a day to day basis. They are full of contradictions such as the type of conflict that arose in regard to the Government's policy on apartheid. However, time does not permit me to go into that matter in detail.  A White Paper would have been a great help to those who are concerned about this issue and, in particular, about the possible implications of neutrality and defence.  Had that been done the debate might have been a little more to the point.</P>
    <P>Parties in the House cannot have it both ways.  We are a member of the European Community and we opted for that membership.  We have responsibilities in that respect as well as rights.  I have more trust in the Irish people than I have heard ventilated this afternoon, particularly from the Fianna Fáil benches.  I have heard a series of speeches that would lead one to the conclusion that the Irish people have to be protected at all costs from any kind of interface with our European neighbours, that we are liable to economic undermining if we are exposed to the whims of free trade.  That is not the nature of the Irish people.  The Act should not be seen as a threat but as an opportunity.  The potential it offers should be grasped by the House and by the people we purport to represent.  Obviously there are questions to be teased out <Col N="2320" /> and our party, in our support of the Single European Act, have made it clear that we do so on the basis, as mentioned by the Taoiseach this afternoon that there is not any implication about the neutrality of the country.  There is no such innuendo in any part of the Act.  If this was to be a slippery slope our support for the Act would not be in place.</P>
    <P>However, it is too easy to take up schizophrenic opposition attitudes, the type of attitude exemplified by some of the speakers this afternoon.  The Irish Council of the European Movement have, helpfully, supplied us with a series of scripts and data on the issue.  That material has been counteracted by an equal volume of information from the opposing view.  I wonder if Deputy Collins will comment on the literature from the Irish Council for the European Movement because I was intrigued to read its call on all political parties to ratify the Single European Act before the end of the year and, by so doing, to reconfirm to the people of Ireland and to our European partners the willingness of the country to play a full and active role in the development of a strong independent Europe.</P>
    <P>At the bottom of that submission there is a list of the officers of the Irish Council of the European Movement.  I note the President of the Council of the European Movement happens to be the Leader of the Opposition.  If, as I suspect, he is suggesting &mdash; in any case his spokesmen have been suggesting it &mdash; that we should oppose this Act, I would be interested to know how that can be reconciled with what I consider to be a rational, sensible approach by him as President of the Irish Council, urging it to embrace the potential of this Act, to examine every aspect of it for any risks or any price we may have to pay to the Community, instead of taking the negative, obscurantist approach that some of his colleagues gave voice to this afternoon.  I think his voice as President of the Council is much nearer to what he believes than those spokesmen of his party who have spoken this afternoon.</P>
    <P>The Act has potential for us.  There are <Col N="2321" /> political questions that are being addressed. I regret very much an increasing tendency in the House to enter into arrangements between both sides of the House without referring to the general body of their membership or any party or Independent in the House, a tendency to exclude systematically speakers on motions and Bills, particularly on one as important and fundamental as this.  The fact is that the overwhelming majority of TDs will not be able to participate in this very important debate.  That is wrong.  I do not know why it has happened but it is fundamentally wrong that important views and concerns that should be voiced are being ruled not to be entitled to take their logical and appropriate place in the debate.</P>
    <P>I include speakers from all sides of the House.  I hope this will not be part of a pattern that we will be confronted with, because that would be an issue some of us would have to address in whatever way we could.  None of us would tolerate a system through which arrangements are entered into with lists of speakers cobbled together outside the House, systematically excluding people with a genuine concern from making even a 15-minute contribution.  This party would not tolerate that, and I am sure those in the major parties would not.</P>
    <P>We take the view that the people of Ireland face a better future because the potential this Act offers them is a great deal more loaded with advantage for them.  The concerns voiced have been and are being evaluated but I should like to see them teased out in greater detail by the Minister in reply on this Stage and later on Committee Stage.  There are some legitimate concerns.</P>
    <P>One relates to defence.  The concerns expressed on this seemed to me to be largely groundless.  Nevertheless, it is an issue that has been raised publicly and it needs a full and thorough answer. Endeavours have been made to answer it but I am not convinced that the full answer has been given.</P>
    <P>The Act is timely in so far as it maps out the way ahead.  It is an indication of <Col N="2322" /> the Community's achievements to date and underlines the need for us to assert that a revamped and more vigorous approach to regional policy will go hand-in-hand with the passage of the Act.  It should not be the subject of some pious aspirations that within 12 months of its passage there will be unanimous agreement that major steps forward will be forthcoming.  We take the view that the fundamental question of addressing the disadvantaged peripheral areas of the Community should be at the heart of the agenda, not something that is packed down to the bottom.  The Act is not a perfect document any more than the Treaty of Rome, 30 years ago.  Some of its shortcomings may become evident only as time passes.</P>

      <P>The urgency of this issue has manifested itself on a number of fronts, some of which have been dealt with.  For example, there is the decision-making process of the Community which, ever since the crisis in the Council of Ministers in the mid-sixties which led to the French &ldquo;empty chair&rdquo; policy and which was only resolved by the introduction of the veto, increasingly has revealed its inadequacies.  It is a nonsensical way of doing business.  There is nothing wrong in moving towards a more flexible approach to taking decisions at European level.  We are represented at every level in that process and we have enough self-confidence in ourselves and in our representatives to ensure that our <Col N="2323" /> voice will be clearly heard in that process. The vast majority of benefits, economically and socially, have been to our advantage since we became members of the EC and there is no reason to believe that will not continue.  It follows logically that if the decision-making process within those forums are made more expenditious and more efficient the advantage to us will be all the greater for it.</P>
      <P>The insistence in the Council of taking decisions by unanimity, even though the treaty provided for qualified majority voting, has meant that important decisions were continually long-fingered by the Council; others were watered down to the point of being meaningless; and all-night sessions of the Council frequently ended in wrangles and pointless arguments.  Customs duties were eliminated between member states, but a vast array of non-tariff barriers remain to frustrate traders and undermine European industry by depriving it of a single market on which to base its international competitivity.</P>
      <P>It is of fundamental concern to Ireland to be part of a major market, as a nation to a large extent depending on attracting investment and with huge potential, a nation that is still importing £750 million worth of food per annum, that exports £2 billion worth of agricultural produce every year, largely unprocessed.  This has major potential for investment by organisations, enterprises and corporations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Customs posts still exist at internal frontiers because of different tax rates. Goods legitimately manufactured and marketed in one country often may not be allowed on sale in another because of different technical standards.  A single transit document to be used by haulage contractors was agreed only recently. Just to underline the nonsense of it, until now a lorry driver passing through the Community needed up to 70 different pieces of paper.  There is still a plethora of paperwork, but the recent agreement will go some way to get rid of it.  A report commissioned by the European Parliament in 1980 put the cost of that approach to business at 2 per cent of <Col N="2324" /> GDP, or £8 billion a year, an incredible waste of money in needless bureaucracy. The interests of all of us dictate that we should move rapidly towards ridding ourselves of these needless economic barriers, to help our consumers, our trade, our balance of payments and Irish entrepreneurs to be able to compete in the European market.</P>
    <P>The Community is running out of money.  Although agreement was reached at the European Council meeting in Fontainebleau in 1984 to increase from 1 per cent to 1.4 per cent the contribution of VAT receipts to the Community's budget, this amount, exacerbated by a fall in customs duties on imports from third countries, is not even sufficient to cover next year's budget requirements.  We have an ailing economic programme and that is not facilitated by the kind of haphazard, lackadaisical, almost inept, approach to revolutionising our attitudes to trade relations within the Community.  The failure of the Council to agree to the Commission's request for a supplementary budget to meet this year's shortfall means that the deficit will have to be carried over not just into 1987 but in all probability into 1988.</P>
    <P>I honestly believe it is not too difficult to establish a link between the reluctance on the part of the wealthier member states to agree to greater financial resources for the budget and their perception of a diminishing return for them in a Community rapidly losing its inner dynamics, loaded with the kind of tired, cliché jargon that filled this Chamber this afternoon, jargon based on the belief that the Irish people do not have the mettle to make it among their European counterparts.  Such jargon is based on a reactionary, backward-looking view that our people are not equal Europeans.  We reject that view.  We believe it is a sad indication, a sad symbol, of failed politics, locked in the past, afraid to believe in ourselves, afraid to go out into the market places of Europe and sell our goods, not just equal to but better than the next.  The Irish people can do that.  It <Col N="2325" /> is in our interests to create an environment in which our people can make that investment and develop that potential to its maximum.</P>
    <P>As we know, the Common Agricultural Policy, at least since the beginning of this decade, has been in a state of manifest crisis with over-production, mounting food surpluses, virtually unsaleable stocks and aimless production that has naturally aroused the ire of taxpayers. As the Common Agricultural Policy's share of the total budget has increased, seemingly inexorably, Finance Ministers have become increasingly reluctant to yield up the money to pay for it.  Reform in that context also is unavoidable and is being increasingly demanded by taxpayers who will refuse to foot the bill in the future.</P>
    <P>There are other areas where progress has been slow because of the failure of the Council to act on perfectly reasonable Commission proposals.  These areas alone would be sufficient not only to bring the Community to a standstill but to threaten its very existence.  It is time for us to repledge ourselves to the ideal of being European, to embody in that idealism all of the best that is Irish, not shutting our minds to the reality of the world that exists around us, not locking ourselves away in an insular, geographic sense as an island but psychologically an an island also.  That is wrong for all of us, wrong for future generations, for our young people coming out of school and colleges and wrong for this House to adopt as a viewpoint.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act emanating as it does, in the context of a background of no White Paper on foreign policy, carrying the ambiguities it does, nevertheless is a genuine attempt to come to terms with these realities.  Like most Community documents it represents a compromise between the interests and priorities of the different member states. No doubt, in years to come, it will warrant updating, review of reform in some way or another.  For the moment it represents the highest common denominator <Col N="2326" /> to which the member states were prepared, collectively, to permit themselves, and we are one of those member states.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper on the Completion of the Internal Market &mdash; the Commission hope to achieve completion by 1992, though its targets to date would not exactly imbue one with confidence that that could be achieved &mdash; 300 major decisions are listed, decisions unable to be taken because of an outdated attitude to decision-making.  Surely it is in our interests to assist in the efficiency of that process?  The original Treaty provided for those decisions to be taken by majority vote or by unanimity.  We know what happened in that respect.  The Act attempts to overcome these problems by designating certain areas, where unanimity was required, henceforth to be subject only to qualified majority voting. Those are areas in which it is in our interests to have fast, efficient but nevertheless considered decisions.  It is not that we are simply throwing away our right to be part of the process and accepting what others dictate for us.  To imply that is to misrepresent the facts.</P>
    <P>This arrangement represents a satisfactory outcome for Ireland.  It is in our interests to have an internal market in goods and services speeded up by the application of majority voting.  At the same time the retention of unanimity in the fiscal field will be an important safeguard for a country whose Exchequer's reliance on indirect taxation is sharply out of line with the Community average.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the increased usage of majority voting need hold no fears for this country.  Indeed, since we joined the Community in 1973, we have threatened to use the veto far less often than most of our partners.  That is one of the reason we are a respected member of that group and that our voice is listened to.  It is my view that we have little to fear from the opening up of the internal market, and a lot of benefit.  Anybody engaged in industry or commercial activity today should attend to the market opportunities Europe presents and should, over a period of time, make appropriate changes in their processes of production, <Col N="2327" /> in their marketing and management attitudes, not in the context of being afraid of what might befall them but in terms of opening up the huge market that Europe represents, and the huge employment opportunities it offers to a country whose self-will and morale is being denuded by the incredible unemployment problem we are expected to bear.</P>
    <P>Although there were widespread fears echoed by some Members of this House when we joined the EC that Irish industry would be crushed by competition from Germany and other powerful member states the reality has been different.  Irish industry has expanded three times more rapidly than the Community average, albeit from a lower base.  Our economic problems are not predominently of European-making; they are of our own making.  We know what is wrong, we should have the courage to face up to it and not pretend that it is foreign competition or international trade, of which we represent half of 1 per cent, that causes us these difficulties.</P>
    <P>There are major potential opportunities for us under the provisions of this Act.  I had hoped to develop some of these points at greater length.  I do not want to continue too long because I know there are other Members wishing to contribute. However, it is important to say that the way in which the Single European Act is implemented is at least as important as what it contains.  In my view that is how it should be judged.  It offers opportunities.  I would hope an imaginative approach to exercising and developing that Act would be put in place and exploited by our representatives in that context and that the new Act would fare better than did the Treaty in terms of the way in which many members shied away from exercising its full potential.  The Single European Act should offer us a potential springboard for a qualitative leap forward in building a united Europe. The unity, from our vantage point, can be one in which our mutual role is not just something we take out of the closet when it suits us but rather an opportunity for showing the world that we have a particular view about the way the world <Col N="2328" /> should be, small as we are.  That is a view which says that Ireland should not just be neutral but should be a sufficiently large light in the world in which there are so many conflicts, and should offer people opportunities to see us as a potential vehicle for helping in international conflicts, for developing further our much respected United Nations role.  Incidentally, in that context, this Parliament and country had no problems underlining our commitment to security in the context of the United Nations.  It means no more in this Act than it did then.  We have obligations to think in those terms too and we cannot shy away from them.</P>
    <P>In the context of developing a policy toward neutrality it seems to me that we should develop a healthy, positive, active approach to this philosophy of ours, which is not a question of expediency &mdash; as some Government speakers have been hinting &mdash; but rather a question of principle for our people.  It has potential for us and, small as we are, we should develop that potential.  Ireland, with its lush grassland, its natural marketing edge on Europe and with a green, clean environment, can become a major innovator in European markets.  Ireland can become a major focal point for a neutral, respected stand in international affairs. In short this Act affords us an opportunity to develop on those fronts.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, we endorse the Act based on the assumptions that nobody is trying to sell us a pig in a poke, that we are being told the truth, all of the truth.  We must accept that this constitutes a major opportunity for the country and I believe it should be seen as such.  It would help us on a number of fronts.  It is an opportunity we should grasp along the lines I have suggested earlier.</P>
    <P>I share the regret of perhaps many others that I do not have more time to develop some other points I had wished to make but I am grateful to have had the opportunity of addressing some remarks to this subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Single European Act which is before the House today represents a small step forward by the Community. It was negotiated by the <Col N="2329" /> Governments of the member states in response to what they realised were major shortcomings in the operation of the Community.  The Single European Act does not fully satisfy the needs of the individual member states in relation to the future of the Community but it meets our concerns in several important aspects and does not represent a threat to Irish interests.</P>
      <P>It is important to say that we are not at this stage debating Irish membership of the European Community.  We are debating amendments to the Treaties and the additional formal elements of European political co-operation.  The Labour Party stated their position on the EC and their reservations but in 1972 the Irish people spoke very decisively and the Labour Party fully accepted the people's decision and determined to work effectively inside the Community.  There have been both many advantages and many disappointments from membership of the Community over the past 13 years.  Other problems which have arisen, including two major recessions and two oil crises, have compounded difficulties which we have experienced.  In Ireland, the Labour Party, and I think, all political parties, have set out to play a full part in European affairs, while at the same time seeking to secure vital Irish interests.  We have developed close links with European socialist parties and this has been very important in communicating and publicising matters of vital importance to Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party in 1984 co-operated in the preparation of the manifesto of the confederation of Socialist parties in the EC.  This document which was passed by all the parties dealt with the issue of Irish neutrality, and made it clear that; the Community has no competence in military matters; matters of a military nature involving the other member states are to be dealt with in NATO and not within Community structures; Irish neutrality must be fully respected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the approach to the Single European Act, the protection of Ireland's neutrality is, of course, a major concern to us.  We are not prepared to compromise on this <Col N="2330" /> issue.  We see no conflict, however, between a neutral position and membership of the European Community. Ireland, a country with a distinctive perspective on international issues, has been able to contribute fully and effectively to the process of European political co-operation.</P>
    <P>Our neutral position outside military alliances is not changed by the Single European Act.  The Act takes account of Ireland's position.  In the first instance, it is provided that the scope of security discussions in EPC will remain limited to the political and economic aspects of security.  The European Community has always had a legitimate interest and role to play in solving the major issues of international peace and security, notably the conflicts in southern Africa and the Middle East, as well as the promotion of peace and security in Europe through participation in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). It is provided, too, that nothing in the Act shall impede those of our partners who wish to co-operate more closely on military and defence questions from doing so in NATO and the Western European Union.  They do so already in these bodies and will no doubt continue to do so.  That is their business.  However, military issues are excluded from the scope of EPC.  This has always been the situation since we joined the EC.  The Single European Act sets that position out in black and white.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act is not a sinister plot to undermine our independence and neutrality by stealth, as has been said by some speakers.  There is no truth in the assertations that by ratifying the Act the Irish Government will no longer be able to pursue an independent foreign policy.  Apart from the account which the Single European Act takes of our neutral position, it also formalises the long-standing principle on which European political co-operation decision-taking has been based &mdash; the principle of consensus.  No decision can be taken by the Twelve in EPC unless all partners agree.  This principle has a two-fold benefit.  It means that no decision will be imposed on Ireland.  It <Col N="2331" /> also means that the process of achieving consensus must take account of our concerns. Thus, our particular viewpoint on foreign policy issues will have a part to play in the formulation of a European consensus.</P>
    <P>I refer the House to the positive motion in the name of the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the neutrality question.  I am glad to be able to reaffirm our commitment to Irish neutrality and to be able to state categorically to the Dáil that Ireland's ability to maintain a position of neutrality outside military alliances is in no sense affected by the terms of the Act.</P>
    <P>Claims have been made that the Single European Act represents an erosion of our sovereignty.  We should recall that when the people of Ireland decided in 1972 that Ireland should join the Community it was in the clear knowledge that membership represented a sharing of sovereignty. The people decided that membership presented opportunities which made a sharing of sovereignty in certain respects worthwhile.  The Single European Act does not change the position with regard to our sovereignty, which was accepted in 1972.  What the Act does is to give the Community a better defined role and an enhanced means of action in a number of areas.</P>
    <P>There is one further point that I would like to make, speaking as Leader of the Labour Party on the subject of neutrality which has been much in the news in recent weeks.  In the Labour Party's view, Irish neutrality should be enshrined in a constitutional amendment.  This should be seen not just in the context of the debate taking place here at present and the Single European Act but represents a fundamental statement of Ireland's role internationally.  A full public debate on this matter would be essential.  Perhaps an all-party committee of both Houses would be an appropriate forum for detailed consideration, and the appropriate wording and its consequences would no doubt, have to be evaluated carefully by lawyers and others.  That idea is worth pursuing and should at a later stage be put on the floor of this House. <Col N="2332" /> The Labour Party will be looking for progress in that area.</P>
    <P>The chapter on regional development, which is designed to bring about what is described as &ldquo;economic and social cohesion&rdquo; in the Community, is in the Single European Act partly at Ireland's insistence. To date Ireland has benefited very considerably from the Community's structural policies.  Between 1973 and 1985 we obtained £1,315 million from the regional, social and agriculture guidance funds.  These transfers have had real effects on the ground which are of practical benefit to our people.  AnCO are heavily dependent on the Social Fund for the financing of their operations &mdash; operations which are vital if we are to train our young people and our unemployed for jobs.  The Regional Fund has made a substantial contribution to infrastructural and industrial development here in the last number of years.</P>
    <P>In our approach to the Single European Act negotiations, the Government were very conscious, however, that &mdash; despite the Community's efforts &mdash; the gap between the more prosperous central regions and the periphery had not narrowed appreciably since 1973 and that a new commitment in this regard was, therefore, necessary.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act contains a commitment to the reduction of economic and social disparities in the Community which is much more explicit and detailed than the reference in the preamble of the original treaty.  Moreover, because it is to be incorporated in the body of the treaty it provides a much firmer basis for pressing for Community action in this regard.  From now on, all Community policies will have to take account of this dimension.  Thus, not only is the regional policy as such to be strengthened, but a regional dimension is to be built into all other Community policies.</P>
    <P>This is one of the major achievements of the Single European Act from our point of view.  It will provide the Government with a clear basis for insisting on Ireland's specific interests, as a less developed region, in future negotiations. <Col N="2333" /> We will not, of course, be relying on transfers from the Community Budget for our economic development; but where these transfers are necessary to achieve the aim of reducing regional disparities, an aim is now formally enshrined in the Treaties, and we will have every justification in pressing for them and a much sounder basis for demanding an adequate response from our Community partners.</P>
    <P>However, this is one area where we will have to fight hard as the Act does not make any explicit reference to providing major additional financial measures for the Regional and other funds.  The onus will be on the Government of the day to fight hard as we have had to do since we took up our membership of the European Community.</P>
    <P>Disadvantaged regional areas such as Ireland must be tackled in a broad and comprehensive manner.  We must press for a series of major actions on this point if the Act is ratified; these will involve</P>
    <P>&mdash;an increase in the &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; of the Community by increased contributions from the member states.</P>
    <P>&mdash;a major and planned reallocation of financial resources towards the peripheral and less prosperous regions of the Community including Ireland.</P>
    <P>The internal market is defined &mdash; Article 8 (a) &mdash; as comprising &ldquo;an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty&rdquo;.  The aim is to establish it progressively over a period expiring on 31 December 1992, but this time target does not have any legal status.  The Commission is empowered to take into account &ldquo;the extent of the effort that certain economies showing differences in development will have to sustain&rdquo; and may propose appropriate provisions including temporary derogations during the period of establishment.</P>
    <P>Economic recovery in Ireland will require a strong growth in exports.  Full and fair access to EC markets is essential. <Col N="2334" /> Ireland is one of the most &ldquo;open&rdquo; economies in the world.  We require similar treatment elsewhere, and it is in our interest that artificial and bureaucratic obstacles are eliminated as soon as possible. Ireland exports 66 per cent of its output of its manufacturing industry &mdash; 80 per cent of that to the EC.  According to a report commissioned by the European Parliament &mdash; the Albert and Ball report &mdash; technical, fiscal and bureaucratic barriers to trade are estimated to cost European business £8 billion a year or 2 per cent of Community GDP.  New and high technology industry is essential for Ireland's future and this needs full access to the largest possible markets.</P>
    <P>Where the bringing about of a single unified market might create problems for Ireland, the Single European Act contains protection for our interests.  The provision that in the completion of the internal market the cohesion dimension must be taken into account is obviously very important in this regard, as is the provision that the Commission should take account of the different levels of development among the member states in making its proposals.  Where we anticipate problems with particular measures we will be able to rely on the Single European Act to ensure that these problems are overcome.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed about the effect of tax harmonisation on the Government's capacity to raise revenue. It has been alleged that the Single European Act will reduce our capacity to raise the revenue needed for our development programmes and to fund social welfare payments to the weaker groups in our society.  As has already been explained, on many occasions the Single European Act provides that unanimity will continue to be required to take decisions on tax harmonisation.  Obviously before giving its consent to harmonisation measures the Government will ensure that such measures do not affect our capacity to maintain social welfare policies or damage our interest in any other way. Fears about the effect of the Single European <Col N="2335" /> Act in the fiscal harmonisation area should therefore be allayed.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act is designed to facilitate completion of the internal market largely by making increased provision for majority voting in the Council of Ministers in the internal market area. This increased provision for majority voting has been singled out for criticism by those who wish us to reject the Single European Act.  Such criticism not only ignores the safeguards built into the Single European Act but assumes that somehow we will always be isolated in the Council with only three out of seventy-six votes on every issue.  This has not been our experience over the years in the many areas where majority voting is already provided for in the Council.  There will always be an alliance of interests on major issues between groups of member states and we have been able to protect our interests fully through the normal negotiating process.  Fears of Ireland being regularly outvoted are unjustified.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, we continue to recognise that in certain exceptional cases it may be necessary to defend our essential interests by invoking the &ldquo;veto&rdquo;.  The right to invoke it will continue to exist as a last resort where genuine vital national interests are involved.  The Single European Act does not affect the veto in any way.  Indeed it was not even discussed at the Conference which negotiated the Single European Act.  Contrary to what has been claimed by critics, the option of exercising the veto remains firmly in place.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, there is no realistic prospect of renegotiation, pending ratification by Ireland.  Special provisions were inserted to accommodate Ireland's major concerns before the Act was signed.  To raise the issue of renegotiation now is to invite the others to go ahead without Ireland.  If the Act is not ratified by Ireland, the most likely outcome would be that the other states will go ahead. Ireland's relationship with the Community would then have to be redefined. Where that would lead is itself uncertain. The responsiveness of the rest of the member states and Community institutions <Col N="2336" /> to Irish problems would be likely to be greatly lessened.</P>
    <P>The Government approached the negotiation of the Single European Act with clear objectives.  In general, we were determined that the Community should make progress in overcoming the problems which have beset it for many years. The Single European Act, which represents a pragmatic advance rather than a major leap forward in the process of European integration, offers a realistic opportunity to make such progress.  More particularly we were determined, while ensuring the full protection of Ireland's interests, that the Community should be equipped to overcome the economic malaise which has beset it for many years and to translate its enormous potential into economic growth, technological development and ultimately employment for our people.</P>
    <P>The development of the Irish economy, the rapid transformation of Ireland's position as one of the less developed regions in the Community and, in the final analysis, the protection and creation of Irish jobs is a prime objective not only of the Government's domestic policies but also of its approach to Europe.  The Community has enormous potential to contribute to Ireland's economic development and thereby to create the conditions necessary for the improvement in the living and working conditions of Irish workers.  The Community has already made a very significant contribution and demonstrated its potential in that regard since 1973.  The Single European Act equips the Community better to overcome the obstacles which have prevented it from attaining its fundamental objectives.  In so doing, it provides this country with important opportunities which we must not only welcome but also exploit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to say that I regret very much indeed that this debate has been most unsatisfactory from the point of view that there are many Members who would like to have contributed but who did not get an opportunity to do so.  The amount of time <Col N="2337" /> provided for this debate, though generous, has shown itself not to be sufficient. I say that with regret.  There were quite a number of Deputies who wanted to contribute and it is unfair to them.  There was no attempt whatsoever on my part to keep Deputy Keating from having his say.  I had no interest in interfering with him in any way nor, indeed, had the Tánaiste.  Deputy Keating was facilitated in every way possible.</P>
      <P>If any Member of this House or the Irish community believe that the passing of the Single European Act will allow the European Commission to overcome their well known problems of stagnation they are in for a very rude awakening because that will not happen.  I say that with regret.  On every occasion that we had a debate on the European Economic Community in this House I said that the major problems were not being tackled.  I urged then and always urge that until such time as we have an economic community the political aspects, which were highlighted in the debate, should be left until another day.</P>
      <P>The Single European Act represents a step of considerable importance.  It contains some positive elements; there is no doubt about that; but there are also elements which could create difficulties for us.  We have said and we must continue to say that we do not believe the Government have adequately safeguarded Ireland's position.  The Government have adopted in public a naive and uncritical approach to European economic developments and are not prepared to recognise the difficulties for Ireland which the Commission recognise.  The Taoiseach has set out the positive opportunities the single internal market creates for us but he barely referred to the reverse side of the coin and there is a reverse side to the coin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have also given false assurances in relation to neutrality which do not stand up to critical examination and which have already been refuted by things which have happened even before the Act was ratified.  In the view of the great majority of the people in this country <Col N="2338" /> the Government did an exceptionally poor negotiating job.  The House will remember that there was a debate on the Dooge report.  There was a useful report produced by the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities which identified where our interests were likely to be affected by the developments similar to those incorporated in the Single European Act but the Government did not take adequate account of the points made in that report or in the debates.</P>
    <P>There is little reflection or understanding shown in either the speech of the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Taoiseach's speech of the problems experienced by peripheral economies. The Government are inclined to knock any concern expressed as a begging bowl mentality, a phrase which has been much used during the course of this debate, or as defensiveness, which is not merely insulting but foolish in the extreme.  The Taoiseach this afternoon regretted the passing of the buoyant and aggressive spirit with which we entered the Community. I would like to remind him and his party that that was at the end of 16 years of the most successful Government this country had ever experienced.  If the Taoiseach and his collegues were to look at the mess that they have made of the Irish economy over the past four years they would not express surprise at the passing of a buoyant and aggressive spirit.</P>
    <P>If members of the Government were to be believed, Ireland is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the EC.  I want to say that I do not in fact believe that that is the case.  Such thinking only takes account of visible transfers and no account of invisible losses.  Does the Minister honestly believe that the German Federal Republic is the biggest net loser from Community membership?  Is it not rather the case that the German economy has prospered from Community membership more than any other?  Does that not show the superficiality of the Government's approach, that they take the visible transfers as the criteria of how great a beneficiary Ireland is of Community membership?  One could argue that the <Col N="2339" /> Regional Fund is modest enough compensation for the fact that industries in larger countries are able to wipe out jobs in firms in Ireland as a result of free access to our markets.</P>
    <P>I am not disputing the benefits of EC membership for our farmers and workers but we have to insist that there is another side to the coin which is by no means one of all benefit to us.  If the Government would only agree with us publicly that that is the case &mdash; if they are in any doubt let them consult with their officials in the Departments of Finance, Agriculture, Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism &mdash; we will have the basis of a common approach.  One of our vital interests relate to taxation and industrial policy.  It is vital that we should be able to afford to maintain our investment incentives to industry.  The harmonisation of indirect taxation by depriving us of massive revenue could very well jeopardise our position. The Taoiseach claims that we have made it clear that harmonisation would be impractical in the foreseeable future but, unfortunately, the Single European Act contains a legal commitment in principle agreed to by us to harmonise indirect taxation.  That is why this party argue that it is essential to ensure the position as set out in Protocol 30 is safeguarded.</P>
    <P>Our view in this party is shared by the all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, the majority of whose members are supporters of the Government parties.  At a recent meeting of that committee it was unamously accepted that a declaration appended to the instrument of ratification is something our partners would have to take cognisance of whereas the motion proposed by the Government parties would be largely ineffective.  In fairness to the Tánaiste, it was really only for domestic consumption.  That is not good enough. We want to ensure that it is brought to the attention of our partners.  The Government have sought to maintain that the Single European Act gives additional protection to our neutrality. <Col N="2340" /> The attempted issuing of a statement on NATO's position on arms negotiations and Mrs. Thatcher's speech to the European Parliament as President of the Community calling for closer ties between the EC and NATO surely must show that disregard for Ireland's position will be even greater when the Single European Act is passed.</P>
    <P>Some Governments will try to blur the distinction between the European Economic Community and NATO.  If defence matters are excluded, as the Government claim, do they intend to protest to the British Prime Minister about her speech to the European Parliament?  I would sincerely hope that those who are in this House tonight representing the Minister in a political or advisory capacity would bring that question to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs so that the might answer it when he replies to this debate.  If defence matters are excluded, as we are led to believe, do the Government intend to protest to the British Prime Minister about her speech in the European Parliament?</P>
    <P>The joint committee also endorsed the position of the Fianna Fáil Party in wanting to see a clear declaration of neutrality attached to our ratification.  I very much regret that the Labour Party have refused to support our declaration of neutrality. It seems they have fallen down once again on their principles and are prepared to sacrifice the possibility of safeguarding our neutrality in defence of Coalition with their Fine Gael partners.</P>
    <P>We have very great concern and reservations in the area of economies and neutrality.  On the economic front, it is all too evident that ours is a very weak economy.  We can do something about that and I would like to think that we as a party will in the very near future be in a position to so something about it. Geographically we are on the periphery of Europe.  There is nothing we can do about that except to make sure that the difficulties created by this fact are recognised by our European partners.  The completion of the internal market, the reorganisation or, to put it more honestly, the dismantling of the CAP, the <Col N="2341" /> giving of more power to the Commission under the Single European Act, the harmonisation of taxes and the possible consequences and changes in the method of voting &mdash; all these will undoubtedly combine to the detriment of our well-being. These are the reasons for our amendment, which is based on what has already been accepted in Protocol 30.  It is necessary to restate Protocol 30 on Ireland, annexed to the Act, concerning the conditions of accession and the adjustments to the treaties of 22 January 1972:</P>
    <P>The High Contracting Parties,</P>
    <P>desiring to settle certain special problems of concern to Ireland, and</P>
    <P>having agreed the following provisions,</P>
    <P>recall that the fundamental objectives of the European Economic Community include the steady improvement of the living standards and working conditions of the peoples of the Member States and the harmonious development of their economies by reducing the differences existing between the various regions and the backwardness of the less-favoured regions;</P>
    <P>take note of that the Irish Government has embarked upon the implementation of a policy of industrialization and economic development designed to align the standards of living in Ireland with those of the other European nations and to eliminate underemployment while progressively evening out regional differences in levels of development;</P>
    <P>recognize it to be in their common interest that the objectives of this policy be so attained;</P>
    <P>agree to recommend to this end that the Community institutions implement all the means and procedures laid down by the EEC Treaty, particularly by making adequate use of the Community <Col N="2342" /> resources intended for the realization of the Community's above-mentioned objectives;</P>
    <P>recognize in particular that, in application of Articles 92 and 93 of the EEC Treaty, it will be necessary to take into account the objectives of economic expansion and the raising of the standard of living of the population.</P>
    <P>There is quite a lot of food for thought in Protocol 30 which was laid down during our accession in January 1972.  Nobody in this House could be convinced that the objectives laid down there are not more urgent now than ever before.  The situation has not improved.  We acknowledge that there were enormous benefits to this country, most of which were carefully used for the development of agriculture, infrastructure and modern industry.  Nevertheless it must be admitted that there is a negative side.  Our agricultural incomes are now between 10 or 15 per cent below the 1973 level and about 100,000 people have left the land since 1973.  Our industrial employment is badly hit.  When we joined the Community there were 60,000 people on the dole.  I am not blaming the EC for the fact that today we have 240,000 people unemployed nor am I adding to that figure the 100,000 young people who have left the country in the past three or four years.  I am saying that the EC benefits have not done much to curb that trend.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties for us which are well known in this House but surely it would be in our national interest if Protocol 30 could be restated for the benefit of our partners in the EC?  This Protocol, which they accepted in 1972, is more important now than ever because the situation has deteriorated considerably since then.</P>
    <P>On the question of the completion of the internal market, there is doubt that the new target will be achieved.  This doubt was cast recently by the President of the Commission.  There is a fear of possible difficulties here and in other countries on the periphery.  Ours is a weak economy and we will suffer to some degree.  There is no real protection for us <Col N="2343" /> in the Single European Act to cushion us against the full thrust of the more prosperous nations.</P>
    <P>Somebody told me yesterday that it is cheaper to buy a box of Irish-made biscuits in Northern Ireland than it is here. Biscuits are exported from here to Northern Ireland and can be bought there for about half the price.  If we operate such crazy systems, many people are in for a rude awakening.</P>
    <P>We are not satisfied with the way the Government are approaching the agricultural scene.  If Deputy Ned O'Keeffe had the opportunity to speak he would spell out very clearly the difficulties facing the agricultural community.  The Government made no effort during the negotiations on the Single European Act to protect the farming industry.  The latest reports coming from Brussels indicate that decisions will be taken which will have a strongly detrimental effect on Irish farming.  Our Government did nothing to protect these interests, as other countries protected theirs on similar occasions.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that our very genuine concerns are brought before our partners in Europe. That is why we recommend our amendment to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Energy mentioned earlier that during the course of negotiations the Government were very conscious that, despite the Community's efforts, the gap between the most prosperous of the central regions and those of the periphery had not narrowed appreciably since 1973 and that a new commitment in this regard was therefore required.  I cannot disagree with that.  Of course, the gap has not narrowed in any significant way; in fact, the gap has widened.  Of course, a new commitment is required. Is not the weakness of the whole Single European Act that there is no commitment whatsoever to provide the finance to close that gap?  There is simple, idle talk but no real commitment.  Unless the heads of State and Government at their weekend conferences decide to <Col N="2344" /> increase considerably the finances of the European Community we will be only playing about with the whole matter.  We are just passing another Act, certainly not for the purposes of building up an economic Community as we want it to be, but perhaps that is not the real reason. Perhaps it is the political side that may be more important to the European partners. Having regard to statements of recent date by the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, one can legitimately say that could well be the view of others also. Unless the money is provided to meet the commitment, you are not going anywhere at all.  We want to see the gap narrowed.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy suggests that Ireland must press for a series of major actions on the increase in own resources if we are to tackle the disadvantaged regional areas in a broader, more comprehensive manner.  Is it not a little late in the day, after four years for the Deputy Prime Minister of an Irish Government to say that Ireland must press for an increase in own resources?  Would we not all be happier if he could say they have succeeded in convincing our European partners that they have to increase own resources of the Community by increased contributions from the member states?  Is that not what we would all like to hear?  Basically the message from the Minister for Energy is that the situation after four years and many meetings with heads of Government and of State is that we do not have enough money to meet our financial commitments.  There is little point in suggesting that a major plan for the allocation of financial resources towards the peripheral and less prosperous regions of the Community, including Ireland, is something that will happen overnight.  Until such time as we provide the wherewithal to do it, we are not going to do it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy talks of the Single European Act as perhaps causing problems for Ireland, but he says it contains protection for our interests.  He is making a reasonable effort to try to deal with the realities of the situation.  We have not had spelt out in the detail we <Col N="2345" /> would like by the Government in their White Paper what these real problems could very well be.  It is far too vague and not good enough, recognising that there is a likelihood that problems will arise for us.  We must take the necessary protective steps at this stage.  We must put down the marker once again more firmly by restating Protocol 30 in full for the benefit of our colleague members there.</P>
    <P>I have on occasion differed with Minister Barry on the question of harmonisation of taxes.  We recognise that unanimity is required on this issue and it is as well for us that it is.  If it were not, we would be destroyed financially overnight.  Our whole economy would be turned head over heels overnight.  The fact of the matter remains that in accepting the Single European Act's commitment to the harmonisation of taxes during the course of negotiating the Single European Act, we have accepted the principle of the harmonisation of taxes.  We have accepted in principle that it will take place.  How long can we block the other 11 members if they want to go ahead, even if we have the veto?  Is it not going to happen sooner than later? Otherwise why would the others insist that it be part of the Single European Act?  Unanimity is required, but once the principle is established the Minister will find that the stand he will take on behalf of this country will be chipped at and he will be isolated to such an extent that he will not be able to defend his position. That is another reason why it is necessary for the Minister, not for the sake of the parliamentarians of this House but for those in the European Parliament, to state the full contents of Protocol 30.</P>
    <P>On the question of the change in the method of voting, criticism has been made by the Minister for Energy and other members of the Government that those of us who criticise that the increased provision for majority voting do so because they want to reject the Single European Act.  I do not wish to do so, I know that I cannot.  I never said that.  However, I reserve the right to criticise the contents of that Act which was negotiated by this Government.  That <Col N="2346" /> right I must have and it cannot be taken from any Member of this House.  This Government failed on a number of fronts during the course of the negotiations to get us the protection we need under the Single European Act.  I accept the argument made about majority voting, that we will not just be three out of 76 on the weighted voting system.  As it is, we will be one out of 12 which is fairly good when compared with three out of 76.  I accept that when the weighted voting system comes into operation we will have help from others with whom we will have a good deal in common.</P>
    <P>I again suggest very strongly that we must try to see, particularly with regard to the Mediterranean countries, what special interests we have in common with them in an effort to try to help us at times when we need that help.  The weighted voting system may not be as advantageous for us as we are being led to believe by the Government.  I heard criticisms earlier from Deputy Keating of the Progressive Democrats to the effect that one should stop the spectacle of members of Governments haggling through the night.  There are Members of this House who have sat through all-night meetings on prices and such.  I have done so and I am sure Minister Barry and others have also.  If a decision is to be made I do not care how long it takes.  If I am to be given an opportunity of pushing my case for my country.  I do not care how long it takes. I would not like to see my case swept aside.  I am not convinced we can accept without some fear this weighted voting system.</P>
    <P>I recognise the problems of the Commission and the difficulties in arriving at decisions.  Originally there were six members, subsequently increased to ten and now to 12 member states.  I can understand that the family is getting bigger and bigger and that it creates a major problem.  However, I see the need for speedier decsion-making and I am concerned that this weighted voting system will not be everything we are told it will be.</P>
    <P>I object to the assertion by the Minister for Energy and other members of the <Col N="2347" /> Government that only those who want to reject the Single European Act criticise its contents.  That is nonsense and it is very naive of the Minister or anybody else to suggest such a thing.  We must criticise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I understood from various comings and goings that I would have been given time this evening to talk on this very important matter.  I listened to each speech since Deputy Pádraig Flynn contributed. When Deputy Michael Keating was called I did not understand what was happening, but we had an intervention from the Tánaiste telling the Chair, I do not know why, that Deputy Keating could have more than the 20 minutes which had been agreed with the Chair.

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to make the case for the acceptance of the amendment tabled by our party, which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;Ireland considers that the completion of the internal market must have full regard to the terms of Protocol 30, agreed at the time of accession, which recognises that there are certain special problems of concern to Ireland, and that there is a Community interest in the attainment of the aims of Ireland's policy of industrialisation and economic development designed to align the standards of living in Ireland with those of the other European nations and to eliminate underemployment <Col N="2352" /> while progressively evening out regional differences in levels of development.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Ireland states that the provisions of Title III do not affect Ireland's long established policy of military neutrality and that co-operation of positions on the political and economic aspects of security does not include the military aspects of security or procurement for such purposes and does not affect Ireland's capacity to act or refrain from acting in any way which might affect Ireland's international status of military neutrality.</P>
    <P>On this part of the amendment I wish to remind the Minister that we are a sovereign and independent nation.  We are a young nation which puts great value on its neutrality.  We take pride in the fact that we are not aligned to any power bloc or to any military alliance.  I do not believe anybody in this House would dispute the fact that this is the wish of the majority of our people.  That is what they want.  All I am asking the Government to do is to acknowledge that that is the position and to underline it.  There is no dispute in this House on that issue, but we have to ensure by accepting the amendment tabled on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, that the position is as we believe it to be and that it will be fully made known to our partners in Europe. It is important that we do that.  I can see no valid reason for not doing it.  The Danes did it.  Our Minister for Foreign Affairs said we would be introducing an unacceptable element of conditionality into Ireland's ratification of the Single European Act.  I do not accept that.  Not alone do I not accept it, but the Danes do not accept it.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to state the position of the Irish people with regard to our neutrality.  We do not belong to any military alliance; nor do we belong to a political bloc.  The Minister should let our partners know that.  If the Danes felt it worth their while to do it by way of placing an amendment to their motion of ratification then why cannot we do it? The Minister fails to see that even his <Col N="2353" /> own party members who have a majority on the Oireachtas all-party committee dealing with EC legislation recommended it.  It was accepted unanimously by them.  Why can the Minister not do that if he proposes not to accept our amendment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for calling me on time.  At one stage, 20 minutes ago, I thought I would not be called at all as there was a nice row in progress.  This has been a very necessary and a very welcome debate from our point of view.  A very clear majority in this House agree that the Single European Act should be ratified.  Most Members believe that there is a European Community.  I listened to a very interesting contribution from Deputy Wilson last night in that regard.  He stated that the drive of the European Community of the early seventies has been lost.</P>
      <P>One of the purposes of the Single European Act is to restore the motivation to Europe.  I was astounded when I heard some of the speeches from the other side of the House in the last 36 hours in this regard.  It is very much in line with what some speakers said about the necessity to revive the spirit of Europe, I very much welcome the debate.  I am sorry there are not more debates on Europe in this House.  It is necessary that we all tease out the benefits, implications and the dangers of the future courses of Europe. There was never any question that this Act would not come into the House for debate.  In order to ratify it, it would have to be debated by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is completely in keeping with the manner in which the Government have kept the House fully informed in recent years of the events which led to the convening of the intergovernmental conference and to the negotiations in the conference that resulted in the Single European Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The charge of Deputy Haughey that the Government tried to stifle the debate and tried to have this House agree the procedures to ratification mechanically is <Col N="2354" /> just rubbish, as he very well knows.  The whining from Deputies opposite even though they did not all use the same words, that we were trying to stifle the debate is clearly untrue.  Since the signing of the Milan conference 18 months ago, which clearly signalled what would happen on a Single European Act in the intergovernmental conference, in the report of the Luxembourg conference, in the Estimates debate earlier this year and in the report of the Hague conference there has been virtually no mention by any member of the Opposition of the Single European Act.  To show the concern of the Opposition, including the members of The Workers' Party, in all that time four parliamentary questions were put down on the matter.  The level of concern does not seem to be very great if in 18 months all the Opposition parties, The Workers' Party, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, could think of was four parliamentary questions.</P>

      <P>I am glad that eventually they showed some interest in Europe.  I say that with great regret as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned because of the role they played, with our party, in 1972 in encouraging the people to give a massive endorsement to joining Europe.  I regret to say that I get the flavour from their contributions in the last year or so that they are now more inclined to take us out of Europe than to keep us in Europe and help us to build it.  I hope I am wrong about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of important concerns have been voiced and questions raised during this debate, particularly in relation to the constitutional implications of ratifying the Single European Act and our position <Col N="2355" /> on neutrality.  I intend to deal with these matters in my remarks but before doing so I will deal with some of the assertions of the Leader of the Opposition in his speech yesterday.  Not surprisingly, he accused the Government of not looking after our national interests within the European Community and of permitting these interests to be, as he said, submerged. He went on to accuse the Government of downgrading our Community membership to &ldquo;the lowest possible begging bowl level&rdquo;.  This latter charge is obviously a reference to the fact that the Government have, very rightly, drawn attention in the debate on the Single European Act to the benefits which Ireland derives from membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>The Government, again according to Deputy Haughey, have singularly failed to protect Irish interests in the Community. We continue to be proportionately the largest beneficiary of all member states as a result of the continued sustained and vigilant efforts by the Government to protect and promote our interests within the Community.  Deputy Haughey again criticised us for this.  He stated that on the one hand we are supposed to have submerged our interest in the Community and on the other hand we are supposed to be going with the begging bowl.  He cannot have it both ways.  The Leader of the Opposition stated that there are many things in the Single European Act that are not to Ireland's benefit or that will be disadvantageous to us.  He said that the Single European Act weakens our position and contains inherent dangers.  He took an extremely negative attitude to the provisions of the Act.  He went out of his way to quote foreign authorities who are on record as downgrading the importance of potential effects of the Single European Act.  Does he agree with those authorities and, if so, why does he say that the Act will be disadvantageous to Ireland?  If he does not agree with the authorities, then why is he quoting them? We should look at this Act to see what benefits it has for us and if it is suitable <Col N="2356" /> to our needs.  We should not listen to what people outside the country say about it.</P>
    <P>There were a number of inconsistencies scattered throughout the speech of the Opposition Leader yesterday. He attacked the Government for drawing the conclusion, which I think is inescapable, that if we were to prevent the coming into operation of the Single European Act it would have a long term and potentially damaging effect on our position, standing and influence in the European Community.  Can anybody really deny that?  He stated that if we failed to sign this Act it will have a long term and potentially damaging effect on our position or standing on neutrality. This was a major consideration for the other less developed member states in their approach to the negotiations for and the ratification of the Single European Act.  The Leader of the Opposition attacked the Government on this point. In the very next breath he stated that the alternative of our not ratifying the Act is one which &ldquo;would have the most serious implications for us&rdquo;.  If we sign it, it is very serious and if we do not sign it, it is very serious.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>He will have to make up his mind on this.  I want to give Deputy Collins the precise reasons why, on legal advice, I am not accepting the amendment put down by Fianna Fáil.  The Leader of the Opposition and all the main speakers from his party have, in the course of the debate, laboured the idea of a declaration.  I want to put formally on the record of the House the legal advice from the Attorney General to the Government on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the House accepts the amendment to the second motion as proposed it would mean that the Dáil would approve of the Single European Act subject to the annexing by the Government to the State's Instrument of Ratification of the Single European Act of two declarations therein referred to, one concerning Protocol <Col N="2357" /> 30 of the 1972 Act of Accession and the other concerning Ireland's policy of neutrality.</P>
    <P>In that regard the Attorney General says the following comments arise:</P>
    <P>(a)  The amending Motion would seem to involve qualifying the Dáil's approval of the Single European Act. That approval is necessary for the purposes of Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution. It is not clear whether such a qualified approval would satisfy the provisions of that Article.  As far as can be ascertained there has been no previous case in which an approval by the Dáil of an international agreement for the purposes of Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution has been subject to a qualification.</P>
    <P>(b)  It is also considered that the annexing of the declarations proposed in the amending Motion to Ireland's Instrument of Ratification would savour of a reservation to our ratification of the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>(c)  While it is true that the modern law and practice in regard to international treaties does as a general rule allow reservations to be made by a state when ratifying an international treaty, this is subject to a number of important qualifications.  The particular qualification which would be relevant in this case is that stated in Article 20 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which Deputy Haughey quoted yesterday] which we would accept as stating the existing position in general international law [and I quote]:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;when it appears from the limited number of the negotiating States and the object and purpose of a Treaty that the application of the Treaty in its entirely between all the parties is an essential condition of the consent of each one to be bound by the Treaty, a reservation requires acceptance by all the parties&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(d)  If we ratify or purport to ratify the Single European Act in a way <Col N="2358" /> which involves, or appears to involve, a reservation, this is liable to raise questions concerning the validity of such ratification unless the reservations are accepted by all the other member states.</P>
    <P>(e)  The Declarations contained in the Final Act which was signed by all member states when the Single European Act was concluded, if and in so far as any of them might be thought to involve or suggest a reservation, have all been accepted by the member states by virtue of their signatures of the Final Act.  The Final Act is now closed: it cannot be reopened.</P>
    <P>(f)  It is not known whether the Declarations proposed in the amending Motion, if annexed to our Instrument of Ratification, would be accepted or not by the other member states.  If they were not, there would be a risk of a state of legal confusion concerning the status of our Instrument of Ratification. A similar situation might exist concerning the sufficiency of the Dáil's approval of the Single European Act for the purposes of Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>If the Opposition's view were accepted by the House it appears from the advice of the highest legal authority available to the Government that we might be in breach of our own Constitution and we certainly would be in danger of creating legal confusion as to whether we had or had not signed the Act which speaker after speaker on the other side have said is a necessity for the Government on behalf of the country. For that reason I cannot accept the amendment proposed by the Opposition. However, what I can do if the House passes the motion in my name, which is separate from the motion allowing us to enact the Single European Act, is to submit that alongside our ratification which is not annexing it to it but submitting it side by side with it.  I will be voting against the Opposition's amendment, if they move it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There is an important constitutional point that I should like to put on the record of the House.  I understand that amendments have been tabled for Committee Stage tomorrow and that will give me an opportunity to deal with other points raised.  Constitutional questions are important and I am anxious to get them firmly, clearly and unambiguously on the record.</P>
      <P>The question of the constitutionality of the Single European Act has been raised by a number of Deputies.  I have already said in my opening speech that the Government are satisfied that amendments of the European Community Treaties contained in the Single European Act do not require an amendment to the Constitution.  However, in response, in particular to the request for clarification from Deputy John Kelly and, indeed from Deputy Haughey, I will now deal with this issue in as much detail as I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State, by virtue of the Third Amendment to the Constitution, has authority to agree to amendments of the treaties which remain within the scope, both as regards subject matter and as regards the nature and functions of the Community institutions, of the treaties as they were when we joined the Communities in 1973.  When ratified pursuant to this authority compliance with these amending treaties becomes necessitated <Col N="2360" /> by the obligations of membership of the Communities.</P>
    <P>The Government consider that this view of the Third Amendment is the only one which duly recognises and accepts that the State is a member of the Communities, and that this allows for limited amendments from time to time of the treaties establishing these Communities without the necessity on each occasion for a further referendum.  This view does not open up a possibility of unlimited treaty amendments going beyond what was envisaged by the treaties as they stood in 1973.  In this regard it is important to remember that the Third Amendment consists of two sentences: the first sentence provides that the State may become a member of the Communities. This provision did not lapse when we joined the Communities.  It has a continuing legal and constitutional significance no less than the second sentence which refers to matters necessitated by the obligations of membership.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act contains amendments of the treaties which are admittedly very important.  However they remain within the limits to which I have already referred.  In particular I mention first that, qualified majority voting is already the usual rule under the existing treaties.  It applies for instance in the agricultural sphere.  The extension of that rule to areas for which unanimity is now required, particularly in the sphere of the internal market, is subject to safeguards, particularly those now contained in Article 36 of the EEC treaty, for the vital interests of member states.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the European Parliament gains no direct legislative power and the implementing powers of the Commission are not being extended beyond those already provided for in the treaties.  All that is involved is to provide a more regular and systematic basis for doing what is already provided for and the Council, whenever it sees fit, may decide not to confer such powers on the Commission.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the new court will be a tribunal inferior to and attached to the present Court of Justice.  The only reason it is not being made part of the Court of Justice <Col N="2361" /> itself is that there will be appeals on questions of law from the new court to the Court of Justice.  Contrary to what Deputy Kelly suggests, the reference in Article 4 of the Single European Act to &ldquo;certain classes of action or proceedings brought by natural or legal persons&rdquo; does not open up the possibility that jurisdiction in actions or proceedings currently reserved to the national courts could be taken from them and transferred to the new tribunal.  The purpose of the new court is not to make inroads into the current jurisdiction of national courts but to improve the efficiency with which the function of judicial review and control is at present exercised by the Court of Justice under the Treaties.  Moreover, it should be noted that the new court and its jurisdiction can only be established by the unanimous agreement of all member states.  Finally, on this point of constitutionality I would like to turn to Deputy Haughey's claim about the question of fundamental rights and a possible link between the Single European Act and the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act does not authorise the Court of Justice of the European Communities to interpret or apply the European Convention on Human Rights, notwithstanding the reference in the Preamble to the Single European Act to that Convention.  This follows from Articles 31 and 32 of the Single European Act.  Article 31 provides that the powers of the Court of Justice of the European Communities under the European Community Treaties shall apply, pursuant to the provisions of the Single European Act, only to the provisions of Title II which contains the amendments of the European Communitie Treaties and to Article 32 of the Single European Act.  Article 32 provides that subject to Article 3 (1), of Title II and to Article 31 to which I have just referred, all of which concern the European Community Treaties and nothing else, nothing in the Single European Act shall affect the Treaties establishing the European Communities or any subsequent Treaties and Acts modifying or <Col N="2362" /> supplementing them.  These two provisions taken together have the following effects:</P>
    <P>The jurisdiction of the Court of Justice remains confined to the European Community Treaties.</P>
    <P>The statements in the Preamble including that on the European Convention on Human Rights do not affect the European Community Treaty, and accordingly the contents of that Convention are not, by virtue of the Preamble, in any way imported into those Treaties.</P>
    <P>Finally, because of the effects of Articles 31 and 32, the Single European Act cannot be interpreted as conferring any jurisdiction relating to the Human Rights Convention on the Court of Justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can see it in the Official Report in the morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last point I wish to deal with is the one made on neutrality.  Deputy Haughey implied that the Government had accepted the security provisions of the Dooge report and the Franco-German draft treaty which was tabled at the Milan European Council of June 1985.  This is quite simply not true. Senator Dooge entered a reservation on the security and defence clauses of the <Col N="2363" /> Dooge Report.  As regards the Franco-German draft, the Taoiseach quite specifically stated at the Milan European Council and to the Dáil after that summit that only those provisions of that text which maintained the distinctions between the European Community and the Atlantic Alliance were acceptable to Ireland.  What has happened since Milan is that, building on this distinction, the Government have ensured that the provisions dealing with security were elaborated in the Single European Act in such a way as to be totally in line with our neutral position outside military alliances, as I explained in my statement of yesterday.</P>
    <P>The Deputy, in quoting from the Single European Act, attempted to argue that the use of the word &ldquo;security&rdquo; poses a challenge to our neutrality, but he did not quote that sentence of Article 30.6 which explicitly limits co-ordination to political and economic aspects of security. This point has been made here constantly in the last 12 months.  Moreover, the allergy to the word &ldquo;security&rdquo; seems to me to rest on a confused hair-splitting. As I have stated before, &ldquo;security&rdquo; is a very broad concept.  Indeed, security lies at the very heart of the international system embodied in the United Nations, a fact which is recognised in the Preamble to the Single European Act which refers to the commitment of all states to the maintenance of international peace and security as set out in Article 1 of the UN Charter.  The security of Europe is essential to international peace and security as a whole.  We already participate actively in the promotion of European security through the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) &mdash; which began in Helsinki in 1975.  Nobody has suggested that we should not participate in the UN's or the CSCE's efforts to ensure the security of the world system as a whole or that of Europe.  I fail to see why we should be nervous or embarrassed about asserting our interest in the security, in broad terms, of the Twelve.  The process continued in Belgrade in 1978, attended by Deputy O'Kennedy, in Madrid in 1983 <Col N="2364" /> and it arose again in Vienna where I spoke recently.</P>
    <P>In my speech yesterday I explained fully the implications of the reference to technological and industrial aspects of security.  Contrary to what a number of Deputies have said, including Deputy Haughey, this clause poses no challenge to our neutrality since co-operation within the Community in these matters will be confined to political and economic aspects of security.  I suggest it is the duty of every Irish Government to maintain the technological and industrial conditions necessary for Ireland's security in the economic and political senses.</P>
    <P>I did not agree with everything that was in Deputy Kelly's statement of yesterday but, like him, I am astounded at the fact that those who have objections to elements of the Single European Act feel the need to bombard us with the potted views of various foreign sources: an English historian, the British Foreign Office, a German political scientist, an ex-judge of the European Court.  These sources have been quoted, within this House and outside, as authorities on how we should approach the Single European Act.  They view the Single European Act, assuming they have read it, from the perspective of their interests.  Why should the assumption be made that our interests coincide with those?  Surely we are mature enough as a country to make up our own minds on the Single European Act, on the basis of a clear assessment of our interests and our priorities.</P>
    <P>Moreover, if such sources are to be quoted, they should be quoted in context. Yesterday Deputy Haughey asserted that as a result of the Single European Act we may be forced into Community decisions against our will and that our freedom of action on foreign policy matters will be eroded.  I have stated that this is not so: our undertakings go no further than to endeavour to achieve &mdash; that is all we are doing.  I am ashamed to say &mdash; common positions and common actions on the basis of consensus.  Everybody must agree before a statement can be issued. If any one country decides that an action should not be taken, a position adopted or a statement issued to ensure that the <Col N="2365" /> Community does not act, that is not enough because all decisions must be taken by consensus.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey yesterday stated that &ldquo;the European Community is essentially an economic one&rdquo;.  I do not believe that. Because of the stagnation that has been part of the development of Europe, particularly since the oil crises of 1973 and 1979, there has been a danger that we would slip into a certain mould, and now this Act displays on behalf of all member states, but particularly the Ten who were members when this process was initiated, a realisation that something had to be done before Europe fell asunder again and became only a common market or an economic unit.  I think the Single European Act is that something.  It may not work, it is a very small step, but it is significant in as much as it shows the 320 million of the peoples of Europe, and indeed the people of the world, that the ideal for which the European Community was founded is not dead.</P>

    <P>&mdash;Ireland states that the provisions of Title III do not affect Ireland's long established policy of military neutrality and that co-ordination of positions on the political and economic aspects of security does not include the military aspects of security or procurement of such purposes and does not affect Ireland's capacity to act or refrain from acting in any ay which might affect Ireland's international status of military neutrality.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EC Transport Council is currently considering measures to introduce greater flexibility in the areas of fares, market access and capacity with a view to increasing competition in air transport, as part of an agreement for the period 1987 to 1990.  This is regarded as an initial step towards achieving the completion of the internal market in air transport by 1992.</P>
      <P>I am dissatisfied with the market access proposals before the Council and have found it necessary to table additional proposals designed to create opportunities for Irish carriers to extend existing routes or open new routes.  The first, providing for a combination of points, proposes that airlines be permitted to operate to two foreign points on the one service without exercising traffic rights between the foreign points.  The second and more significant proposal envisages the exercise by airlines of fifth freedom rights within the Community, that is the right to carry traffic between two other member states.  These proposals are still the subject of discussion at Council of Ministers level.</P>
      <P>On air fares, some progress has been made in developing a more flexible scheme for air fares approval.  Under this scheme, airlines would be permitted to seek approval for their fares proposals from Governments without any obligation to agree them in advance with their competitors; they would also qualify for automatic approval for promotional fares which comply with certain specified conditions provided the levels come within certain predetermined bands or zones.  In so far as these proposals are directed towards stimulating greater competition between airlines, I welcome them as being beneficial for users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An agreement is being developed which would represent a departure from the 50/50 capacity sharing scheme which certain States have previously imposed. <Col N="2144" /> Under the proposed agreement the airlines of one State would be automatically permitted to provide initially up to 55 per cent of total capacity on air services between that State and a second State. This would apply for two years, after which the 55 per cent could be expanded to 60 per cent subject to certain safeguards. My approach at the Council of Ministers is that the question of capacity should be left to the commercial judgment of the airlines concerned. Unfortunately, quite a number of member states have a much more restrictive approach and I am endeavouring to ensure that Community agreement on the capacity issue will represent a genuine increase in competition and will not enable States to effect cutbacks in airline capacity on existing routes.</P>
    <P>The foregoing issues are expected to be discussed at a meeting of the Council of Ministers which is to be held on 15/16 December 1986.</P>

The motion &ldquo;that Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Treaty on Extradition between Ireland and the United States of America signed in Washington on 13 July 1983&rdquo; was agreed by the Dáil on 25 November 1986. A new Government order applying the relevant provisions of the Extradition <Col N="2147" /> Act, 1965, to the United States is now necessary.</P>
    <P>Under the same Act, and on the basis that reciprocal facilities will be afforded by Australia for the surrender of persons wanted for prosecution or punishment in Ireland, the Government made an order applying the relevant provisions of the Act to Australia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the IDA which has accorded County Wexford priority status in its promotional efforts since January 1985, that it is intensively promoting the county both for large overseas projects and small industry.  In particular, the IDA have intensified their efforts in the region through the establishment of the South East Small Industries Board and by the appointment of additional staff with specific responsibility for the development of small industry.  In addition, the IDA are actively promoting a number of factory units and a total of 182 acres of land throughout the county for suitable industrial projects.</P>
      <P>The results of this activity can be seen from the preliminary statistics of the IDA's annual employment survey which indicate that manufacturing employment in County Wexford increased by 300 since November 1985 to a current level of 5,000 (including seasonal jobs).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2148" /> Specific examples of this activity are the three major projects for which grant assistance was approved in 1986, namely the new projects, Snap Tite and American Fence and the expansion by Sola ADC Lenses which are expected to create 280 jobs between them at full production.</P>
    <P>In addition, to date this year 18 small industry projects in the county have been approved grant assistance by the IDA. These projects are expected to create 160 new jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the unemployment situation in Enniscorthy and I am assured by the IDA that they are actively promoting the town for suitable new industrial projects. In this regard a company called Wenaas, which commenced production in Enniscorthy in July of this year, already employs over 40 people, and is expected to employ a further 20 people as the project gets into full production.  I understand also that ten small industry projects in the Enniscorthy area were approved grant assistance by IDA this year and that these projects are expected to provide approximately 40 new jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of advance factory space, I am informed by the IDA that they have no plans to construct an advance factory at Enniscorthy at the present time.  However, should the need arise they would be prepared to construct <Col N="2149" /> a factory to meet the specific requirements of an individual project.</P>
    <P>26.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> As the Deputy is aware, the question of designation generally was the subject of a National Economic and Social Council study which was initiated by my predecessor. The study was concerned with a review of the criteria for designation.</P>
      <P>Subsequently the Economic and Social Research Institute were asked to produce a detailed review of the implications of the recommendations of the NESC report on designation.  This ESRI report has been completed and is being examined in my Department.  Until this examination is completed, it would be inappropriate for me to designate any further areas in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the maintenance, including surface dressing, of non-national main roads and county roads in their administrative area rests with Donegal County Council.  In the case of non-national main roads, expenditure on maintenance by the local authority from its own resources may be supplemented by the annual block grant for roads paid by my Department.  The manner in which the block grant is spent, including the extent to which it is applied to maintenance of these roads, is largely a matter for the local authority.  A block grant of £1.04 million was notified to Donegal County Council in 1986.  This represents an increase of 10 per cent relative to 1985.</P>
      <P>As regards maintenance of county roads, it has never been the practice to make State grants available for this purpose. Expenditure under this heading continues to be financed by the local authorities from their own resources. However, because of my concern about the county road network, I announced a new scheme of grants in July 1986 for strengthening of county roads.  I allocated a total of £5 million to local authorities for that purpose in the current year.  £373,000 out of the total of £5 million was allocated to Donegal County Council.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to say what road grants will be allocated to individual local authorities in 1987 pending determination of the overall provision for road grants in the context of the 1987 budget.</P>

      <P>I have studied the interim report of the Kilkenny Health Project published in November, which sets out the results of <Col N="2174" /> a baseline study on the health of the population in Kilkenny, and the programme of future activity for the project. The project is due to run for a further three years and based on the conclusions drawn on the success of particular measures in combating coronary heart disease the question of a national programme will be considered.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, there are already a number of national initiatives being taken which are related to coronary heart disease. Examples include the various anti-smoking measures and the activities of the Irish Heart Foundation.</P>
      <P>Heart disease is one of a number of contemporary health problems in which a policy of active health promotion could have a significant impact.  Such a policy could only succeed, however, on the basis of a community wide commitment to the protection of health and measures to promote positive health.</P>
      <P>This is one of a number of fundamental issues in health policy which should be opened up to public debate with the intention of arriving at some new consensus on the broad direction and content of future policy in relation to health.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to introduce legislation to provide for formal statutory registration for professional groups working in the health services which are not at present subject to statutory controls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that a proposal for legislation of this kind has been under consideration in my Department for some time.  Over the last year, I have had a review carried out to determine <Col N="2177" /> whether the protection of the public health could be guaranteed by introducing the proposed legislative measures. The conclusion was that the measure could not, for a variety of reasons, guarantee the achievement of its prime objective; the protection of the public from unqualified practitioners.  Moreover, having considered alternative measures, I am satisfied that the controls which the professions wish to bring about, especially in the areas of their education and training, can be introduced without legislative backing.  I therefore decided not to proceed with the drafting of legislation which would entail an unjustifiable investment of time and manpower.</P>
    <P>I met with the <i>ad-hoc</i> committee which represents all the relevant professions on 8 December and advised them of the change of policy.  I assured the committee by my continuing concern and involvement with the professions and advised them that officials of my Department will be available to afford them advice and assistance in establishing appropriate non-statutory mechanisms to enable them to overcome any difficulties relating to their professional identities and practice. To this end, I have already arranged for discussions at official level with those professional groups which have immediate problems.  I would envisage adopting a similar approach with the remaining groups, as the need arises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 17 November 1986 men and women claiming benefit, assistance or pension under the Social Welfare Acts are treated equally.  Up to 15 November 1986 a married man claiming a social welfare payment automatically got an increase of benefit for his wife and children living with him but a married woman could only get an increase of benefit for her husband and children in very restricted circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 17 November 1986 the definition of dependancy has been changed to make it the same for men and women thus removing the discrimination which had heretofore existed against married women.  A spouse will be regarded as a dependant of the other spouse only where he or she is being wholly or mainly maintained by that person and spouse entitled to social welfare payment in their own <Col N="2179" /> right or with earnings in excess of £50 a week will not be regarded as dependants.</P>
    <P>The persons concerned were both in receipt of disability benefit at the personal rate of £41.10.  The husband was also in receipt of an increase of £26.60 in respect of an adult dependant.</P>
    <P>Since 17 November 1986 his wife is no longer regarded as an adult dependant and consequently he is not entitled to an increase in respect of her.  A temporary payment of £20 a week will issue to him to compensate for the loss of his adult dependant allowance.  This payment will continue to issue for the duration of the claim or for 52 weeks whichever is the lesser period.  His weekly rate of payment is £61.10.</P>
    <P>His wife will continue to receive payment at the maximum personal rate of £41.10.  This rate was increased by £4.80 a week under the first phase of equality of treatment introduced last May.</P>

      <P>Arising from the EC directive on equal treatment for men and women in social welfare matters the conditions under which a person can be regarded <Col N="2180" /> as an adult dependant for social welfare purposes have been changed.</P>
      <P>Under the new arrangements an increase in pension in respect of an adult dependant is now payable to men and women on an equal basis.  The spouse of the claimant is not regarded as an adult dependant if he or she is in receipt of an independent income of more than £50 per week gross or is in receipt of social welfare benefit or assistance payment in his or her own right.</P>
      <P>The spouse of the person concerned is in receipt of disability benefit in her own right at £41.10 per week and the increase in her husband's pension in respect of her therefore ceased with effect from 21 November 1986.  This rate of disability benefit was increased by almost £5 a week under the first phase of equal treatment earlier this year.</P>

      <P>Unemployed persons residing in the Shankill area are registered at either Dún Laoghaire or Bray employment exchanges depending on their address. They are required to attend at the appropriate exchange once weekly to sign the unemployed register and collect payment there.  As the distance involved is approximately 3-4 miles the arrangements are not considered onerous and are in fact designed to keep any travelling expenses of claimants to a minimum.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances the establishment of a local office or signing centre in Shankill to cater for unemployed persons residing there is not considered warranted.</P>

The purposes of this scheme include development of non-surplus products such as sheep, protein crops and vegetables; farming activities which, although non-land-using, can supplement income and provide employment for farm families; diversification into &ldquo;minority&rdquo; activities such as horses &mdash; hunters and ponies &mdash; or deer farming.

      <P>Temporary releases allowed under section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960 include full temporary release which effectively means that the offender need not, provided he abides by the conditions of his release, return to prison and renewable temporary release which obliges the offender to return to prison on a specified date when a further period of temporary release may be allowed.  Releases also take place for very short periods, sometimes only a matter of hours, as might be the case if the release was authorised to enable the offender to be present on a family occasion and I assume that the question is not intended to relate to such periods of release.  In any event, ascertaining the precise figures for them would take up a substantial amount of staff time.</P>
      <P>During 1985, 628 offenders were allowed full temporary release.  A further 1,267 offenders were granted renewable temporary release.  The probation and welfare service supervised 517 of these offenders.  A total of 968 offenders in Mountjoy were allowed full temporary release or renewable temporary release. Of these 202 were supervised by the probation and welfare service.</P>
      <P>The following are details of offenders released on full temporary release and on renewable temporary release during 1986 to date on a month-by-month basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if in view of the success of <Col N="2197" /> AnCO in relation to running training workshops in Enniscorthy, he will ask AnCO to extend the present workshop at Templeshannon quay for a further period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>Normal policy in relation to permanent community training workshops is to provide them only in towns whose population is more than 9,000.  For towns like Enniscorthy with populations of less than 9,000, AnCO provide interventions such as temporary community training workshops.</P>
      <P>The temporary workshop in Enniscorthy was initially approved in 1985.  Its duration has already been extended twice because of the number of young people in the area who were entitled to training under the social guarantee for youth, primarily early school-leavers with no qualifications.</P>
      <P>An overall review of the provision of community training workshops has been undertaken by AnCO and the Youth Employment Agency.  The aim of the review is to ensure an equitable distribution of such training places having regard to both the level of finance available and the demand for such places from unemployed unqualified school leavers. While a final decision has not yet been taken, the limitations on funding and the needs of other parts of County Wexford and south-east region for such intervention will naturally influence the decision on the future of the workshop in Enniscorthy.</P>
