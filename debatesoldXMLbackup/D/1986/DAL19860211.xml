      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mrs. Owen</b> asked the Taoiseach when it is proposed to initiate the measures needed to establish the Anglo-Irish Interparliamentary Body, as envisaged in Article 12 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement 1985; if he will outline the procedures which will be followed in setting up this body; if he can give details of the scope and functions of this body; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At our meeting on 6 November 1981, the Prime Minister and I agreed to endorse the recommendation of the Anglo-Irish Studies Report, initiated at the December 1980 meeting between my predecessor, Deputy Haughey, and the Prime Minister that it would be for the Parliaments concerned to consider at an appropriate time whether there should be an Anglo-Irish body at parliamentary level to consider how the parliamentary links between the two countries might most appropriately be developed as the natural and desirable complement to the establishment of the inter-governmental council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2042" /> As envisaged in the joint report, the parliamentary body would be constituted through an Anglo-Irish parliamentary committee as a natural development of the existing rather loosely structured, Anglo-Irish parliamentary group. Members of the committee could be drawn, not only from Dáil Éireann and the House of Commons but also from other representative bodies including the European Parliament, the House of Lords and Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>In the joint studies the Irish official representatives saw the body as providing a forum for the participation of representatives from Northern Ireland in proportion to the size of the different parts of the community there.</P>
    <P>The Irish side saw the ambit and purposes of the body as corresponding to those of the inter-governmental council. Its functions would be essentially consultative, advisory and review in nature. It could discuss the activities of the council and review the work of ancillary bodies, on the basis, but not exclusively so of an annual report from the inter-governmental council</P>
    <P>It was to these considerations that Article 12 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, 1985, referred when it stated that the two Governments agree that they would give support as appropriate to such an inter-parliamentary body if it were to be established.</P>
    <P>Following discussions with the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, I now wish formally to indicate in the House the Government's readiness to support arrangements of the type suggested in the joint report and to encourage measures, with the British authorities, leading to the establishment of a body, along the lines and with the functions indicated in the joint report.  I would suggest that so far as the Dáil and Seanad are concerned discussions should proceed through the normal channels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach give any indication of how soon this whole process will begin and when can we see some progress on it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Following consultations I have had with the Leader of the Opposition, and in the knowledge that there is considerable interest in the idea of proceeding along these lines in the British Parliament, I hope that action will be taken to establish this body relatively rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach envisage that when this body has been set up it would have power to call Ministers from both the British and the Irish Governments to address that body and to answer questions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not envisaged in the joint studies.  There could be difficulties about an international body having such powers.  The question of whether Ministers would attend on occasions would be a matter for the Ministers themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply the Taoiseach stated that consideration may be given to Members of the European Parliament and the House of Lords.  I take it that is not envisaged at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was quoting from the joint studies prepared following the 1980 meeting between the then Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister in which these possibilities were set out.  After the November 1981 meeting between the Prime Minister and myself a communique stated that membership could be drawn from the Oireachtas, from the British Houses of Parliament, the European Parliament and an Assembly in Northern Ireland, should one be established. The position at the moment is that the two Parliaments, Westminster and Dublin, are the two bodies from which it seems to me likely that the membership of the body would be drawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach confirm whether there is a proposal to establish a committee of the British House of Commons to examine the implications of this parliamentary tier?  Can he say whether such a sub-committee have <Col N="2044" /> been established, whether they have reported and whether it is possible that a similar type of examination would be undertaken here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a motion in the name of a Private Member, described as an &ldquo;Early Day Motion&rdquo;, which has not been debated or discussed so far.  It is not clear whether the terms of such a motion is the manner in which the British House of Commons would proceed.  It is not clear whether the matter would be dealt with through the usual channels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that this parliamentary tier will be established by the Members of the Parliaments concerned and not by the Governments.  The Taoiseach spoke of a review of ancillary bodies.  What exactly did he mean in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about an inter-parliamentary body which could only be established by the Parliaments. The parties who are members of the Governments of the two countries indicated in the recent Anglo-Irish Agreement that there would be support for such a move in the Parliaments.  I am satisfied that in both Parliaments there is support for this proposal.  Both Parliaments, therefore, are likely to wish to proceed through their own channels, with the support of the two Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned ancillary bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a reference back to where it was said that the body could discuss the activities of the council and review the work of ancillary bodies which were not then specified.  I take it that amongst the bodies whose work will be reviewed is the work of the inter-governmental conference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government intend to undertake any investigations into reports that <Col N="2045" /> the Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Eddie Collins, involved himself directly in negotiations about the possible takeover of a firm in which he is a shareholder by another firm in the meat industry, at a time while holding office and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the reports to which the Deputy refers concern an article published in a recent edition of an Irish periodical.</P>
      <P>At the outset I would like to confirm that the underlying principle in relation to business interests of members of the Government and Ministers of State is that no Minister or Minister of State may engage in any activities that could reasonably be regarded as interfering, or being incompatible, with the full and proper discharge of the duties of office.  All Ministers and Ministers of State are aware of and fully subscribe to that principle.</P>
      <P>When appointed Minister of State in 1982, Deputy Collins resigned all of his company directorships as well as resigning from the local authorities and subsidiary bodies of which he was then a member.  In so doing he disassociated himself from the day-to-day operations of the companies in which he and his family have a financial involvement.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that there was no impropriety on the part of Deputy Collins, in checking, as a major shareholder in a family holding company, the implications of the possible sale of his family's holdings in these companies.  This did not impinge on his responsibilities as Minister of State at the Departments of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, or Energy and no conflict of interest issue arose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is correct in that my question arises from an article in the <i>New Hibernia</i>.  Did the Minister meet representatives of the Halal Company and were these meetings to discuss the terms of a takeover of his family firm?  Was the Minister negotiating <Col N="2046" /> on those occasions or simply checking on an already agreed package?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the Minister had meetings with Halal in his capacity as a major shareholder to examine the implications of any offers for the company.  That seems to be an entirely appropriate course of action and is not incompatible with the normal procedure under which Ministers or Ministers of State resign from the directorships and disassociate themselves from the day-to-day running of companies. The question of the sale of a company is a major issue in which as a shareholder such a person would be legitimately concerned and it would be appropriate to hold meetings to establish to his own satisfaction the likely consequences for him and his family of any proposed action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied that there was not a gross error of judgment involved in this instance in that it is clearly indicated by the people whom the Minister met that the Minister, Deputy Collins, was negotiating with them regarding the purchase of his family's company?  Will the Taoiseach accept that it would have been much more appropriate, given the Minister's position in Government which involves him in a Department which grant-aids industry and so forth, for him to engage a negotiator on his behalf, so as not to be directly involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The article to which the Deputy referred does not conform to the statement he has just made.  What is said in the article is that the negotiators were Mr. Denis Fortune, chief executive of Collins Brothers, and Mr. Jack Khalid of Halal with the future of the Collins Brothers's subsidiary company, and bacon and lamb company, Leinster Limited Resources, included in the discussions. Subsequently the Minister had discussions to satisfy humself as to the implications for the shareholders but the article states that negotiations were carried on between those two people, the <Col N="2047" /> negotiator in the company in which the Minister has shares, being the chief executive of that company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been represented to me that one of the two people involved in these meetings, Mr. Rafique and Mr. Jackie Khalid, has a clear recollection of the Minister indicating that he wanted to make a lot of money fast and suggested that his company and Halal would work together to maximise profits and effectively operate a cartel.</P>

        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> Information of the type requested by the Deputy is not available.  In the absence of comprehensive documentary or other administrative procedures relating to the movements of persons into and out of the State, there is no way of determining the actual number of inward and outward migrants in any period or the destination of those emigrating.  The only reliable <Col N="2050" /> estimates of migration flows are those for net migration (i.e. the difference between the inward and outward flows) between successive censuses of population. The estimates for these periods are obtained by relating the intercensal population changes to data for births and deaths in the same period.  The preliminary results of the 1986 census of population, to be taken in April, will be available next autumn.  It will then be possible to obtain a firm estimate of net migration for the 1981-86 intercensal period.</P>

      <P>That is cold comfort for the several hundred people who will leave the country this week.  Does the Taoiseach agree that he has a vested interest in not wanting to inform himself of the real level of emigration at present and over the past three years because it has provided him with the most significant escape hatch from the ever-increasing rise in the unemployment register?</P>

      <P>Would the Deputy resume his seat for the moment? I have considered this matter at some length because this is the third occasion on which the Deputy sought to approach the question in this way.  As is clear from the text, the question is purely a statistical one and relates to the Central Statistics Office and not to policy as drafted.  The Minister of State, Deputy Seán Barrett, is responsible for questions relating to the Central Statistics Office; he has dealt with the question and is apparently prepared to answer further supplementaries.  I understand that the responsibility for the Central Statistics Office falls on the Minister consequent on a statutory order made.</P>

        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> I should like to reply to the supplementary. The provisional mid-April 1985 population estimate is 3.552 million which is 109,000 above the 1981 census figure of 3.443 million.  The natural increase in the population during the same period was 141,000.  Thus, in the four years from April 1981 to April 1985, it is estimated that 32,000 people emigrated which is an average of 8,000 per year.  They are the only relevant facts.</P>

In view of the fact that to date he has chosen to ignore the statistics, would he now set up a monitoring service at the eight major air and seaports used by young people leaving the country so that we can get accurate, up-to-date information on the numbers leaving, why they are leaving, where they are coming from and their <Col N="2053" /> educational standards, so that the Taoiseach can inform himself of the true level of emigration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 18 together.  I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority, who are statutorily responsible for the implementation of industrial policy in this general area, that they will support community-led initiatives in the provision of enterprise centres, but only where there is a planned and co-ordinated approach from the local community. In this context a working agreement has been concluded between the IDA and the Youth Employment Agency whereby the agency will take the lead role in community initiatives, and manufacturing or international service proposals arising from these initiatives will be referred to the IDA.</P>
      <P>I understand that the IDA have no plans at present to provide an enterprise centre in either Ballybrack or Sallynoggin. Moreover the IDA have not examined buildings in the Sallynoggin area with a view to ascertaining their suitability or availability as an enterprise centre. I would point out, however, that since mid-1985 a seperate team within IDA's small industry division have been given special responsibility for the fostering of small industry in south Dublin which includes both of the areas referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The special team within the IDA's small industries division will give their full attention to the south Dublin area, and will liaise, where necessary, with the Youth Employment Agency.  In 1985 the IDA approved a total of 28 small industrial projects for the Dublin South area and they have developed a major new business park on a 70 acre site at Leopardstown.  Further, a leading US softwear manufacturer, Microsoft, have moved into the Sandyford Industrial Estate.  Another US firm, Emerald City Productions, hope to employ 50 people in the production of animated programmes at Harbour Place, Dún Laoghaire.  On Sallynoggin Road itself, Martincabs (International) Limited were approved, with IDA assistance, to manufacture cabs for forklift trucks. The company called Trio-tech (International) have set up an electronic components test centre in Deansgrange, and Ericcson have established a new software development and training operation in Glasthule involving a £1.3 million investment. I think that is a fair commitment to the south Dublin region.</P>

Is the Minister aware that there are many young people unemployed in the Ballybrack and Sallynoggin areas?  What action does he intend taking to reduce the unemployment level there?

    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the IDA's policy of regionalisation, the Midlands Small Industries Board were established in June 1985.  The regionalisation programme is now fully operational and the responsibility for negotiation and approval of small industrial projects in the Roscommon area has now been developed to the midlands <Col N="2061" /> region itself.  It is expected that this development will make a positive contribution to the job creation effort in 1986 by ensuring a closer working relationship with local parties interested in industrial development in the area.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any widespread abuses of the nature referred to by the Deputy.  I should add, however, that if evidence of such abuses can be substantiated it is essentially a matter for the insurance companies concerned to take appropriate measures to deal with the situation.  While I would naturally be concerned about any factor which might contribute to an increase in insurance premium rates, my information is that insurance companies only pay what is considered fair and reasonable in the circumstances following an examination of the claim.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that all insurance companies do not send out assessors in respect of having a value under £1,000?  Does he not have knowledge from the insurance companies that there are many abuses where household claims are concerned?  Some of these complaints have been communicated to me and I shall let the Minister have them in due course.  I understand this represents only the tip of the iceberg.  Surely the Minister should have some information from his negotiations with the insurance companies when they come to him for substantial increases in premiums.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department contacted the Irish Insurance Association regarding the allegation of abuses and the association indicate that they are not aware of the widespread abuses suggested by the Deputy.  It is up to the industry to manage itself.  The various firms within the insurance industry should manage their own claims methods.  It is in their own interests to send assessors where they feel a claim is not justified.  The Department cannot be blamed if there is an abuse since the companies have a responsibility to their own shareholders to manage their affairs.  I have no function in respect of the amount to be paid out on any particular claims, nor have I power to interfere in any dispute arising out of these claims.  It is really a matter for the insurance companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be a matter of concern to the Minister.  We are talking about exorbitant increases in premiums, due to a large extent to abuses.  Householders are being bribed to claim substantial costs for small jobs.  I have information about one job for which the materials cost £50, while it took only five hours to carry it out.  The insurance company paid £900 and the householder was bribed not to say anything.  This is happening on a wide scale.  Surely the Minister must be concerned.  The insurance companies are not paying these extra costs since they are being passed on to the unfortunate consumers.  In the final analysis householders have to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very happy to receive whatever information the Deputy has.  Of course I am concerned at the increase in underwriting losses under the classification of fire and other damage to property, which includes household insurance.  The underwriting loss in this class grew from £10.7 million in 1983 to £12.5 million in 1984.  Certainly householders are paying a very high premium and they are entitled to a good service from the insurance companies.  I have been advised by the Irish Insurance Association, who were contacted by my insurance division, that they are not aware of the situation as described by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret to say that the Minister is not being advised correctly. The insurance companies, on being contacted about this matter, have said that they cannot do much about it because it would not pay them to send assessors for jobs costing less than £1,000.  They are aware of the abuses and accept them because they pass on the increases to the householders.  That is not good enough. It is the Minister's responsibility to take action.  What action does he propose to take in the light of this question and in the light of the information I am passing to him?</P>

It is up to the companies to manage their affairs properly in their own interests and the interests of their shareholders. The information given to me by the Irish Insurance Association indicates that the abuses referred to by the Deputy do not take place.  However, I should be happy to receive his information.</P>

      <P>The standard requirements for authorisation are based to a large extent on criteria specified in those directives, which provide for a common approach by the different member states to the taking-up and carrying on of the business of insurance.

      <P>I am very disappointed with the Minister's reply.  Is the Minister aware that insurance companies in recent times have been failing to live up to their responsibilities?  They are refusing to take employer liability insurance, public liability insurance and even refusing to insure motor cyclists.  There is only one company prepared to insure motor cyclists. Surely the Minister is aware that there are grave losses because of the failure of the insurance companies to live up to <Col N="2070" /> their responsibilities.  At the same time, their sister companies are amassing huge profits in the life assurance business.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider his position and call in the insurance companies. Is he considering the possibility of allowing continental European companies into the Irish insurance market in view of the failure of the companies already here to live up to their responsibilities.?</P>

      <P>Generally, I am bound by the procedures set down in the EC First Non-Life and Life Directives in regard to the authorisation of insurance undertakings, so I have no plans for a fundamental review of procedures in this area.  The Deputy will be aware that an Insurance Bill is in the course of preparation which will give me greater supervisory functions.  I am aware that in certain liability areas different firms have difficulties in getting insurance.  In relation to motor insurance, we have a declined cases committee and in the case of other liability insurance we have an informal agreement in the insurance industry. However, as a Minister I cannot force any company to take on a risk, and I have stated this quite clearly in the House. I have stated clearly here also that my primary responsibility as a supervisory authority for insurance is to see whether companies meet their statutory solvency and reserving requirements.  That remains my position.</P>
      <P>In relation to the opening up of the country to foreign insurers, this matter is being considered under the Non-Life Services Directive which is in draft from and is under consideration in Europe at the moment.  It is also bound up with a major law case.  Therefore, the question of freedom of services of insurance may be taking on a higher profile in the not too distant future.  Until then I will administer the law as it is before me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he is aware that the value of Irish exports has been offset by the outflow of expatriated funds by manufacturing exporters with the result that our increased exports have added little to extra employment or national income; and the steps he proposes taking to get a better return in national economic terms from our exports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism the detailed Government initiative being taken as a matter of policy to insure that <Col N="2072" /> the Irish workforce benefits to the fullest extent of the value of our exports, in particular (a) transfer pricing, (b) areas of operation, (c) manner in which it operates and (d) initiative to attain the maximum benefits possible for jobs and living standards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 34 together since they are both concerned with the need to maximise the return, in national economic and employment terms, arising from the increase in the level of manufactured exports.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the level of repatriated profits by subsidiaries of overseas manufacturing firms operating in Ireland and of the high level of export activity engaged in by those companies.  As regards repatriations, I should stress that these are not only profits in the conventional sense but include dividends, royalties, interest payments and remuneration of the costs of research and development and marketing incurred elsewhere.  The level of repatriated profit must be viewed in the context of the total benefits to the Irish economy of such firms.  A recently published IDA survey showed that in 1983 approximately 80,000 people were directly employed by about 800 overseas firms and their purchases of Irish materials and services were in excess of £2,000 million.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Industrial Policy outlined the policies which are being pursued to maximise the benefits to the Irish economy of overseas firms establishing here.  These policies include:</P>
      <P>(a)  the national linkage programme which is designed to increase local purchases of materials and services by overseas firms; and</P>
      <P>(b)  the intensification by the State industrial promotion agencies of their efforts to encourage overseas firms to reinvest more of their profits in Ireland.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that the possible terms for issue of tax free securities to foreign owned companies in accordance with the <Col N="2073" /> enabling provisions in the Finance Act, 1985, have been under investigation by the Minister for Finance in consultation with the interests concerned and I understand that the Minister's decision in this matter will be available very shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that he has not got it because it was central to the question.  Will he agree that perhaps the expatriated funds of multinationals last year might be as high as £1 billion?  Would he accept that that is a reasonable figure?</P>

      <P>I cannot give a precise figure.  I am not trying to avoid replying. I simply have not the figure in my file.  I know the figure seemed high for the first half of 1985.  That was in response to a question put down by Deputy O'Kennedy to the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>It was incorporated in the question when I referred to manufacturing exporters.  It is a straight question.  It would appear from the figures the Minister of State has given that in excess of £1 billion is going out of this country each year from profits made in this country.  I am suggesting and asking the Minister of State to confirm that substantial moneys are also being placed offshore by Irish owned companies to the detriment of the national income of this country.  Is the Minister of State aware of it?  What does he propose to do to plug that hole?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer the latter part of the question and I am sure it would be more relevant to the Minister for Finance.  In relation to the question of repatriation of profits by subsidiaries of overseas manufacturing firms operating in Ireland, I have stressed in the reply that these are not only profits in the conventional sense.  They include dividends, royalties, interest payments and remuneration of the cost of research and development and marketing incurred elsewhere.  We must realise that we are a developing economy.  We depend on a substantial amount of investment, also investment that will reflect investment already taken abroad in research and development and in the development of new techniques.  Is the Deputy suggesting that because there is a repatriation and a payment for these services we should not be pursuing the policy of attracting international companies to Ireland?  If he is, I must disagree with him fundamentally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to my question, Question No. 34, would the Minister of State not agree that when one reads the ESRI report which indicates that we had an increase of 10.25 per cent of value in manufacturing industry and an increase of 6 per cent in volume in 1985, it is clear that the full effect of this is not being shown considering the manner in which unemployment has increased?  I wish to reiterate the question.  What are the Government proposing to do about that? Are they prepared to allow it to continue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure about an element of the Deputy's question, but I can say that we have been successful in attracting major overseas industry to the country which is giving employment to about 80,000 of our workforce. Our high technology industries are, of necessity, not particularly labour intensive but they are vital to the development of the industrial infrastructure of this country.  Indeed, the increases in exports in recent years and the effect on the balance of payments have been nothing short of dramatic and I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that that is the case.  The number of new industries established in his own city of Cork in recent years has been substantial, and these are new industries involved in the high technology area.</P>

    <P>32.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and steps he has taken to improve the monitoring and supervision of insurers operating in the general insurance market; and if he is satisfied that these insurers are making adequate provision to cover all their liabilities and if they are in a position to offer reasonably priced insurance cover to all sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in reply to a similar question from the Deputy on 13 June 1985, the function of supervision is a continually developing and changing process to match developments and changes in insurance practice, both locally and internationally, and in line with the development of better monitoring techniques.</P>
      <P>On that occasion, I instanced several changes in monitoring procedures implemented over the previous ten years and further plans in the pipeline.  It is not necessary to repeat those here.  Since then, however, some further developments have taken place.  For example, I have obtained sanction for the appointment of two actuaries and their recruitment is being pursued with my colleague, the Minister for the Public Service. Meanwhile, of course, independent actuarial expertise is engaged as required.  A programme for the computerisation of the supervisory function has also been advanced and this new facility is due to be installed during this year.  Administrative staff numbers have increased with five additional officers having been assigned to this function since last June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of the supervisory procedures <Col N="2077" /> used by the Department in non-life insurance has just been completed by consultants. This review has endorsed the methods used to date and has recommended a number of detailed developments of these procedures which will be implemented in conjunction with the new computer system.</P>
    <P>Additionally, the Government recently approved the heads of a Bill which is intended to add to and reinforce the Minister's supervisory functions in relation to insurance undertakings in the State.  I am also, of course, concerned that the primary responsibilities of directors and managers of insurance companies and the duties of auditors should be properly exercised and the proposed Bill will also address this.</P>
    <P>There are 41 non-life companies authorised to conduct general &mdash; or non-life &mdash; insurance business in Ireland.  All companies are required to make returns in the statutory form to my Department and these are rigorously examined with a view to assessing the financial position of the insurers, including the adequacy of reserves for liabilities.  Any questions arising out of these examinations are pursued by the Department with the companies concerned with a view to ensuring their soundness.  I am satisfied that this process is being conducted satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>In relation to the price of insurance cover, while I recognise that there have been some difficulties both with regard to the cost and availability of certain types of insurance, I am satisfied that, in general, the premium rates charged are necessary for the continued carrying on of business by insurers on a viable basis. It should be remembered that increases in the level of premiums charged reflect the significant underwriting losses being incurred by insurers as a result of the high level and cost of claims.  I am hopeful that measures currently being taken, including the enactment of the recently published Bill to modify the right of access to decision by jury on the extent of damages in personal injury cases will help to curb the cost of claims.  Of course, improved safety precautions in the workplace, safer driving, greater security in <Col N="2078" /> the home, etc., are also important factors to be looked at if the cost of claims is to be contained.</P>

      <P>James Dillon's father, John Dillon, in the company of Parnell and his colleagues started the process which ended the dominance of landowners in the Irish social, economic and physical life, a social revolution achieved within a lifespan of a generation.  But James Dillon was not content to coast along in Irish political life on the accumulated goodwill which his father and his grandfather, Mr. Blake Dillon, had engendered.  He was <i>par excellence</i> his own man.  While still in his teens he began his career as a platform speaker during the general election of 1918, one of the major turning points in modern Irish history. He was in a minority then.  He pursued the minority course in 1927, when he put his talents at the disposal of the short-lived National League Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He entered the Dáil in 1932 and will always be central to any serious discussion on parliamentary life in this country in the four decades from the thirties to the sixties.  During this period he became Deputy Leader of the Fine Gael Party, resigning from this post and from the party on a point of principle, Irish neutrality, during the Second World War &mdash; an action that won him the respect even of those who most strongly disagreed with him on this issue.  He never lost the regard of his colleagues in Fine Gael and became the Leader of the Party in 1959, a few <Col N="2181" /> short years after he had rejoined it.  Some will recall James Dillon principally for his oratory.  That is to admire his style to the detriment of its substantive content.  His periods of office as Minister for Agriculture can be seen, with the benefit of objective hindsight, as having been characterised by energy, imagination and achievement.  For that and for his undeviating integrity, we are all in his debt.  I wish to express to his family my personal sympathy and that of the party which he once led, as well as that of the Government.</P>

      <P>An Cheann Comhairle, I wish to join in this tribute by Dáil Éireann to the late James Dillon, of whose death we have all learned with the deepest regret.</P>
      <P>James Dillon was an outstanding parliamentarian whose whole life was devoted to the service of his country and her people.  He regarded politics not as a profession but as a vocation and was never in any doubt that it was through politics and Parliament that the welfare of the people could best be pursued and that to do so with all one's ability was a noble and an honourable calling.  He had a scrupulous respect for protocol and an unfailing courtesy.</P>
      <P>For 37 years James Dillon was a Member of this House, some six years of which he served as a Government Minister and the remainder on the Opposition benches.  The Official Reports of the House record the detailed knowledge of parliamentary procedures, the skill, the expertise, the sharpness of wit and the devastating turn of phrase which he possessed to such a unique degree.  But they cannot recapture the colour and the flavour of his magnificent oratory as it flowed over these benches, the beauty of words used with effortless precision and the spontaneous humour which were such a personal pleasure to experience.  In the political debates in the House from the early thirties to the sixties he was a formidable force, enlivening the dullest debates and heightening still further the drama of the great occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dedication and commitment of <Col N="2182" /> James Dillon to an Irish Parliament was total.  He was dedicated to the concept of the authority of the Dáil deriving directly from the people and the duty of those elected to it to give expression to the voice of the people they represented. This he demonstrated in a powerful way when he voted for the election of Éamon de Valera as head of the first Fianna Fáil Government because he felt that was the wish of the people.  In keeping with a long family tradition spanning close on a century and a half, James Dillon's first concern throughout his public life was the welfare of his beloved farming community. While his declared policies towards that end were often the subject of controversy, the sincerity and depth of the conviction which motivated him in regard to them, and indeed to all other aspects of public policy, were recognised and respected.</P>
    <P>Éamon de Valera and James Dillon were totally opposed to each other on many issues, yet both held each other in the highest respect.  When James Dillon retired from Irish public life some 17 years ago Dáil Éireann lost one of its most prominent, colourful and interesting Members.  Through his death our country has lost an Irishman of dedication, sincerity and integrity.  I wish, on behalf of my colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party, and myself, to join in this expression of most sincere sympathy with the widow and family of the late James Dillon.  Ar dhéis Dé go raibh sé.</P>

      <P>I should like to be associated, on behalf of the Labour Party, with the words spoken in tribute to James Dillon.  James Dillon served his country well as a superb parliamentarian, as an innovative and successful Minister for Agriculture in two Governments and as leader of his party, the Fine Gael Party. While he will be remembered as a superb orator, with the power to move an audience and keep it spellbound, he had many other personal qualities which endeared him to all of those he worked with.  On a personal level I should like to tell the House that my father has described James Dillon to me as a man of unfailing <Col N="2183" /> courtesy and kindness whose contribution to public life was immense.</P>
      <P>He deserves also to be remembered for another of his qualities.  He was a democrat in the truest sense of the word. He believed totally in the supremacy of the will of the people and there were a number of occasions when he carried out that will even when it must have been personally painful to him.  I should like to extend the condolences of my party to his family and to express the hope that the spirit of democracy which he characterised will always prevail in this House. We could pay him no greater tribute.</P>

Nonetheless, his contributions were extremely important and compelling ones.  He was a man who stood for a particular tradition which to a large extent has now come to an end, but he brought great honour to that tradition and great honour to this House.  It is a matter of great sadness that he has now passed away.  I should like to be associated with the expression of sympathy to his widow and family.</P>

The revised Book of Estimates in its final form will be published, but I cannot give the Deputy a date for it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust that I am not the cause of the speedy exodus from the House of the vast majority of Members. On the last occasion I was speaking about the problem of taxation and about the cost of the public service.  When we embark on a discussion of this kind it is easy to give the impression that those of us who normally raise this question as being one of our most serious national problems are in some way against public servants, that in some way we regard the services they provide as being inferior or that we regard them as being to some extent a liability on the State.  I wish to make it clear that I regard with equal importance the person who processes applications for agricultural or other grants or who opens the door in any of the Departments and the person who milks the cow or manufactures a computer or who works in any sector in our industrial or commercial life.  I do not subscribe to the view that one sector creates the wealth while the other spends or wastes it.</P>
      <P>It would be difficult to determine how each individual should be remunerated and I have no intention of entering into the argument as to whether people are being paid enough or whether they are being paid too much.  All I know is that employees, whether in the State or in the private sector, should be paid as much as their employer can afford to pay them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem about the public service in the first place is that it is very difficult for us to measure its performance against the performance of other groups.  There <Col N="2189" /> is a monopoly in regard to most of the services supplied by the public service. There are no other groups providing the same services.  Consequently it is very difficult to judge whether public servants are competitive.  For that reason there is an obligation on this House to monitor carefully the job that is being done and to ensure that in no instance are two people employed to do a job that could be done by one.  Down through the years carelessness has crept in, with the result that in many instances two or more people are doing jobs that could be done by one.  The additional money is being taken from the taxpayer and as a result jobs in the private sector are being lost.</P>
    <P>Our public sector has become very big. The agricultural lobby, for instance, has been considered always to be very strong in Ireland.  That was because of the numbers involved, but there are now twice as many public servants as there are farmers. We may not have realised yet how powerful is the political impact of the lobby these public servants can muster. Probably the most powerful ever known in the State.  I have noticed in recent years that this lobby works in many different ways.  In addition to having a well-organised public relations procedure working for them and to having well-staffed associations and unions, people in the public sector are in a unique position to influence the public.</P>
    <P>I have heard of dozens of cases of applicants for grants or some other services being told by State employees that the application could not be dealt with because of Government cutbacks, though there might be no Government cutbacks in the Department concerned. I reject that kind of approach on the part of civil servants.  I suggest that they have no right to tell people who are refused some service or grant, though the disentitlement may be only marginal, that they should approach their local TDs because nothing further could be done in the Department because of Government cutbacks. That is the means by which the message is being put across that the Government are cruel and heartless, are cutting back on services of every kind and <Col N="2190" /> thereby making it extremely difficult for public servants to render to people services to which they are entitled.  It is not the business of public servants to advise people to approach their local politicians and pressure them about matters affecting the workings of different Departments, but I have experience of this happening in the case of a large number of Departments.</P>
    <P>On the general question of wages for public servants, as I said at the outset I have never made the case that any individual is paid too much; I would argue that when the Government came to office they should have realised that every penny paid to State employees must be taken from the taxpayer.  The annual Bill in that regard is now of the order of £3,000 million.  The creation of jobs in the public sector must mean a loss to the same extent of jobs in the private sector. At this point I must part company with Deputy O'Malley, who made a very fine first half kind of speech.  However, he did not go on to pursue the conclusions of his argument.  He did not tell us in what areas the difficult decisions had to be taken or where the reductions in public expenditure had to be made.  The very least a Government must do at present is to say to everyone &mdash; Deputies, civil servants, teachers, and everyone else in the public sector &mdash; that more money is being paid out than can be afforded and that the argument should not be about the level of pay increases the Government should offer but by how much we need to reduce the pay of all of us in the public sector by way of solving the problem of the huge public sector pay bill.</P>
    <P>In Holland, a country three times as wealthy as we are, when their unemployment figures reach 15 per cent they decide, with complete agreement from the trade unions, public services and workers, that they would reduce wages in order to resolve the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>If anybody thinks that unemployment can be resolved without asking those who have work to make sacrifices, he is going in the wrong direction and making a grave mistake, because it cannot be done <Col N="2191" /> without making sacrifices.  As the first step, long ago we should have frozen wages and salaries and the level of Government spending.</P>
    <P>This Government have become unpopular with one sector because they are seen as the cruel, heartless monetarist organisation who have cut everything to the bare bones, but the recipients of State services have become convinced that it is the cruelty and heartlessness of the Government that make it difficult for them.  Those who observe the figures and look at them carefully know well that the Government that make it difficult for them.  Those who observe the figures and look at them carefully know well that the Government have not done anything of the sort, that they have not been cruel or heartless.  If anything, the Government have erred on the soft side and continued to make concessions, payments and services that they could not afford.</P>
    <P>If the Government were to concede the wishes of the taxpayers to reduce taxation, and the wishes of the Opposition for reduced borrowing and taxation, the only solution would be to reduce the cost of the services the State provides. I do not believe that there are various Departments &mdash; Education, Health, Social Welfare &mdash; who have not learned to take some short cuts, to produce greater efficiency, that they cannot improve the quality of the services unless the money be provided by the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>In industry increased productivity is being achieved by fewer people.  I do not see why that cannot be done in the public service as well.  The idea that we will solve unemployment by social employment schemes, earlier retirement, career breaks, is not on.  They all look attractive but they are the soft option that is easy to sell politically, but the solution to our problems is greater productivity.  That will not be achieved with the levels of taxation we have, with the interest rates now prevalent, with the level of national borrowing here.  All of these things reflect on the competitiveness of industry.  We will not solve our problems by the brainchildren of individuals who think up all sorts of social schemes that for the moment will provide sedatives for those who sign on for the dole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2192" /> Naturally I am very interested in agriculture. It is experiencing many problems. It has become popular &mdash; I am a member of a farmers organisation and have been working in agriculture most of my life &mdash; for politicians representing agricultural interests and farmers' representatives to demand that the State do this, that and the other for the industry. That demands the spending of vast amounts of money.  Those who represent agricultural interests generally argue for deregulation of the economy and withdrawal by the State, but they refuse to acknowledge that one of the most regulated industries is that of agriculture. Most of the regulations were introduced with the agreement of farmers and many of them at the demand of farmers.  Personally, I tend to believe that if we had had fewer regulations over the years, here and in the EC, we would now have a healthier agricultural industry which would have been given an opportunity to increase production with lower costs. Then there would be a more competitive position and there would be a greater share for us of the European market, which is really all the market we have.</P>
    <P>One of the big problems about agriculture in Europe is that we have too many people involved, first of all, and we have too much land.  Therefore, we do not have the opportunities to export our surpluses of food because the production costs in the EC and the price of food are such that it is not possible to sell on the world market unless we dump it, as is being done with our surpluses at present. By &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; I mean selling in other countries at lower prices than the prices of food on our own markets.</P>
    <P>There are 12 million people employed in agriculture in the EC and we cannot separate the Irish agricultural industry from the rest of the EC.  In the US, two million people can meet all the needs of an economy that is almost as big as the EC, and they can provide surpluses for export.  An efficient agriculture in Europe could employ between two million and three million people.  That means we have to make up our minds, through social schemes or whatever, whether we <Col N="2193" /> should keep the extra nine million people on the land of Europe or push up the price of food beyond what it would be if we had a competitive agriculture, which we do not have.</P>
    <P>The European agricultural industry would be competitive if we could sell our products on the world market in competition with other producers.  We cannot, and there is no point in saying there is a place for European agriculture to supply the needs of the rest of the world.  At the prices we produce food, the hungry people of the world cannot but it.  We are asking the taxpayers to buy it and pass it for nothing or at very low prices to the people who need it.  That is only a short term solution.  The long term solution is that those people elsewhere would produce their own food.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is an extremely difficult problem in agriculture throughout Europe and we must appreciate that it has to be changed.  However, the British Government and the British farmer get together and chant &ldquo;no&rdquo; in response to every proposal for change from the European Commission.  We cannot hide from the fact that change is coming.  We must realise that it is inevitable and we should be in there trying to design a new CAP.</P>
    <P>In spite of all the aid we have got from the EC in the past 13 years, our agricultural production has increased in volume by only 16 per cent and there has been a net drop of 3 per cent in the income our farmers have enjoyed in that period.  That failure has been brought about because of weaknesses in our own economy which have created some of the problems in the agri-business in the constituency I represent in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>There we have had two spectacular cases of difficulty in the agricultural sector.  From an employment point of view, the biggest is the Bailieboro Cooperative who have their difficulties now. Those in the past few years who asked if there was any point in making an effort in agriculture, particularly in regard to market research, have seen an organisation like Bailieboro and tended to have a revival of confidence.  In that instance <Col N="2194" /> there was some point and there was hope for us if we carried the example, made the investment, took the risks and provided opportunities for employment and increased production.  Of course, like all agri-business, Bailieboro has been walking a tightrope, ground down by production costs, high transport costs, high levels of taxation and high interest rates, to a large extent the result of Government overspending and over borrowing. Things were made difficult for organisations like Bailieboro.  It is traditional for the financial institutions to look for sacrificial lambs, instead of blaming the root causes of the problem.</P>
    <P>I admire the management in Bailieboro Co-op and I have absolute confidence that the people who brought it this far are capable of resolving the problem if they get their finances restructured.  I want to see the management, who had the initiative, courage and foresight to do what they have done there, continue with that job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Never before has there been such a level of confrontation between a Government and every section of the community as that which exists today.  That has been borne out in every debate and public pronouncement by every Minister over the past few months. Never before were the Government in such poor standing.  The indications are that the Government have lost their mandate. This budget is an example of the depths of mismanagement to which the Government have sunk.  One glaring example epitomises that more than anything else.  It is the first time in the history of the State that the tax code does not have a reference to children.  The children of taxpayers will not be cherished equally, although the Government have a duty under the Constitution to deal equally with all our children.  They have failed in their obligation under the Constitution. Everybody is saying that this is an anti-family budget, and whitewashing will not convince anybody otherwise.  The tactic of the Government is to confuse and bamboozle the electorate with figures.  The public have been treated to <Col N="2195" /> repeated pronouncements of good news about our economic prospects.  We had these every month until Christmas last year and they have now been followed by threats of dire consequences if we do not wear the fiscal hairshirt with resignation.</P>
      <P>Economists, even independent ones, cautiously suggested in the recent past that a selective reflationary budget was essential if the engine of economic growth was to be restarted.  Their advice has not been taken by the Government and the terrible twins of economic stagnation and entrenched monetarism continue merrily on their way to the destruction of our living standards and an unparalleled level of misery for every sector.  The political and economic policies of this Government can be loosely termed bingo politics.  They are blowing all the numbers about &mdash; inflation figures, interest rates, deficits, and borrowing &mdash; and they are picking out a selection to try to arrange their prize, that of an electoral success which is daily slipping away, so that now nobody believes that the Government have a mandate to continue governing this country.</P>
      <P>The Government have lost their social conscience, unfortunately, although a section of the Government comprises a socialist party called the Labour Party. We saw that last week when one of those Labour Ministers was responsible for the closure of so many health institutions, the very institutions that protect the health standards and services available to the weaker sections.  The Government are not defending the rights and living standards of the old, the weak and the infirm and they are reneging on the constitutional demands on a Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has attracted an enormous amount of public odium with his unhappy budget followed by the actions of his colleagues, the insensitive duo, Ministers Hussey and Desmond, who together have so infuriated and incensed the public with their closure speeches that Government credibility is now only a memory.  The hidden extras in this budget will long be talked about <Col N="2196" /> because of the level of hardship they are bringing to the people.  The social welfare increases of 4 per cent, which will not be applied until mid-July, will not enable those who live on social welfare benefits to maintain their living standards.  Inflation this year will be in excess of 4½ per cent.  This has been admitted by the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach in their contributions over the past few weeks in this House.  We know that the likelihood is that it will be in excess of 5 per cent, so there will be a drop in the living standards of those whom the Government should be seeking to protect in hard times.</P>
    <P>The food subsidies will be removed. There will be an increase in VAT of 2 per cent on the 23 per cent rate.  Transport cost increases have been announced in the recent past.  Those paying mortgages will have to pay more.  The new retention tax will bite very severely into the small resources of small savers; and there are new road tax increases, motoring costs and so on.  All that has been offered as a substitute for rising costs is the child benefit scheme which will amount to 10p per day per child.  That is poor consolation for the many families who are on that side of the poverty line.  The Government have a dismal record in protecting the weaker sections and we must level the charge of incompetence at them on this occasion.  The politics and policies of the Department of Finance have obviously superimposed themselves on a divided Cabinet, and this is regrettable.  We have Exchequer-driven initiatives that have no human face.  In a depressed period of our history surely a Government with a socialist element should have made every effort to protect the weaker sections.</P>
    <P>This budget has no vision for any section.  There is a lack of direction in it. There is no purpose in it, except to keep the Government in office for a short time until they are eventually forced before the electorate.  There is no doubt that this budget will have a very big impact on the middle income group, who have to pay for everything and who received nothing by way of compensation from this <Col N="2197" /> budget.  Since 1982 the Coalition Government have displayed no fiscal management or skill in dealing with the economics of the country and with our most persistent problem, unemployment. Investment has fallen, living standards continue to decline and one in five of our workforce are now without jobs. The objectives of the Coalition in their Programme for Government, and reiterated in <i>Building on Reality,</i> have been jettisoned.  They promised to halt and reverse the rise in unemployment and correct the imbalances in the national finances.  They have failed on both counts.  They have sown their economic seeds on stony ground and reaped the inevitable harvest &mdash; nothing.  Worse, they have added to the national misery and they will make our recovery all the more difficult when more realistic policies are eventually applied on the return of Fianna Fáil to Government.</P>
    <P>The Coalition track record on job creation is a dismal and sad reflection of Government policy.  In 1979, one in 14 of the workforce was jobless and the total number out of work was 87,400.  Now, at the start of this year, one in five of the workforce is unemployed and we have virtually 250,000 on the dole.  Those unemployed at present exceed the manufacturing industrial workforce by 60,000 persons and it is only when you contemplate the depth of despair that exists in those figures that you realise what a bad job of management of the economy the Government have made.  It was always understood that the manufacturing industrial workforce would be in excess of those on the dole, but now we have the reverse position and it is getting worse daily.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to the labour market has been ambivalent.  They have not provided incentives for investment. They have continued to reduce the public capital programme and sought to distort the unemployment figures by directing the unemployed into part time jobs and dubious training schemes.  With the labour force growing at the rate of 100,000 people over the last six years and the reduced demand for labour due to <Col N="2198" /> the robotic revolution, it is clear that new initiatives in taxation, pricing and product development are necessary to reduce the national imbalances.</P>
    <P>World trade has been growing since 1983 and our export volume growth has increased by 65 per cent since 1979, but this has not been reflected in industries' demand for workers.  We have reduced inflation and increased demand for certain Irish goods in an improving world business environment and still our people are without work.  I shudder to think of the national catastrophe that would follow another world recession, which could happen at any time.  The budget does not seek to take advantage of the more favourable international business climate because it fails to recognise the one ingredient more than any other needed to turn the economy around, that is, investment, public investment for the productive sector and productive infrastructure and the right investment and incentives for private investment.</P>
    <P>We have an appalling statistic in so far as our unemployment figures are concerned. There are over 240,000 on the dole and 30,000, most of them young people, parked in part time jobs and time wasting schemes and agencies.  I do not use the word &ldquo;parked&rdquo; in a derogatory way but that is the new terminology in EC circles when they talk about unemployed people who are on short term jobs.  They refer to them as being &ldquo;parked&rdquo; somewhere awaiting jobs to be provided by the Government.  What a nasty way of referring to young, well educated and dedicated people who want to work, but who are not given the opportunity to do so.  The opportunities are not being created by the budget either.</P>
    <P>We have the highest unemployment rate in the EC and the Government have no credibility when they talk about what the budget might do.  It is only a follow on of the last three budgets introduced by the Minister, Deputy Dukes, and the result will be the same, greater and higher numbers unemployed and increased levels of emigration.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach during Question Time today said that <Col N="2199" /> he had no relevant figures dealing with emigration but he knows that every village in the country has suffered over the past 12 months.  There is no mention in the budget of biotechnology or any new horizons that might be sought by the national agencies to bring about job creation. There is no recognition of the role of science and technology when all the commentators agree that it is in that area that the best prospects for job creation exist.  The Government seem to be mesmerised by the complexity of technology instead of recognising its possibilities and following it with innovation and investment.</P>
    <P>In 1984, 700 award winning science and technology graduates emigrated or are still unemployed here.  No new measures were announced in the budget to stop the brain drain.  Irish industry has not been motivated to recruit science and technology graduates to the level of our competitors. Similarly, we have not increased the number of our export marketing executives abroad even though each one could be responsible for creating at least ten new jobs at home.  These statistics have been critically analysed and proven correct. There is no news of what is to be done to identify new products or markets for our exporters.  There is nothing to monitor the changing attitudes and tastes of people with whom we are doing business. There has been no recruitment, and no embargo can justify the non-recruitment of extra marketing executives.</P>
    <P>As well as recruiting them we should also have an enlightened tax allowance policy for executives who travel abroad in bona fide selling campaigns for more than three months of the year.  These are the kind of incentives which would have encouraged agencies to take on board more marketing executives so that we could develop new markets for our exporters. If so much emphasis is placed on our development in the high technological area, then it must justify greater support to industry to recruit science and technology graduates.  The future of our indigenous research and development <Col N="2200" /> programmes depends on bright innovators and they are there in large numbers if only the Government would recognise the possibilities and utilise their strength and educational prowess.</P>
    <P>In job creation, as with export executives, the multiplier, also applies and if we were to have a positive policy in recruiting science and technology graduates there is no doubt that new products would be developed, new markets could be sought for them and jobs would be created.  Not a single paragraph in the Minister's budget speech indicated that he had anything new to offer to the people in so far as the creation of jobs is concerned.</P>
    <P>The improvement of the new maximum grant of £3,600 for the first year's salary in a small industry for one of these graduates has been an essential.  Science and technology graduates are recruited in the market place and in the young scientists and technologists employment programmes, but an increase in the allowances payable to them should be considered and should be applied to all industry, large and small.  Money will have to be provided in some new science and technology initiatives.  Government neglect in these areas shows their lack of understanding of the real needs of industry so far as technology and marketing are concerned.</P>
    <P>Interest rates play a critical role for manufacturing firms and this budget will inevitably lead to increased rates.  Most manufacturing industries are over-borrowed and the increases will lead to further closures, layoffs, redundancies and unemployment.  The Minister's comment that there is a marked decline in the level of notified redundancies is incredible and shows an alarming level of naivete on the Minister's part.  Is he not aware that his fiscal policies have so weakened the industrial base that we have the continuing haemorrhage of closures and liquidations, and they have so debilitated the whole industrial fabric of the country that there is virtually nothing left to close? The answer to the question on today's Order Paper about the number of liquidations and closures for the past few years <Col N="2201" /> would have been enlightening, but, on average, close to 1,000 businesses per year have closed in the past three years. Nothing has been done in this budget to redress that position.</P>
    <P>A disturbing statistic is that there are 70,000, or 40 per cent, more people unemployed than there are industrial workers in manufacturing employment. The balance is completely lopsided, and until something is done to stimulate investment and to create worthwhile jobs the crippling tax burden will continue. Despite the unanimous approval of all economists, politicians and commentators that something had to be done to remove the taxation bias against personal and institutional investment, the Government chose to ignore the advice and relentlessly pursued their failed fiscal policies of three former budgets.  Commentators and media people should put the Government on notice that fiscal rectitude as a policy has failed and is no longer appropriate to the needs of this economy.  If practice makes perfect, then this Government are well practised in wrong decisions and they are a perfect example of stubborn, tunnel vision so far as the economy is concerned.</P>
    <P>The overwhelming weight of evidence available suggests that investment in industry needs to be doubled to meet the demands of employment in the economy. Yet that investment level fell 15 per cent below the level of five years ago and the Government have declared a further reduction in their public capital programme for 1986.  The indication is that the Government have deliberately chosen to starve the IDA of grant investment and there can be no hope of an expansion in manufacturing industry this year.</P>
    <P>There has been no worthwhile effort to reduce cost of money, which is 12 per cent higher than the rate of inflation today, and to transfer investment to manufacturing industry and away from the risk-free Government gilts.  The change in capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 35 per cent from April is still out of line with our European competitors and unfortunately there are no proposals <Col N="2202" /> for change in the taxation of development land or of short term gains.  The business taxation proposal to increase payments on account of corporation tax and income tax to 90 per cent of ultimate liability is a typical hidden thorn of this budget and it effectively reduces the volume of investment allowances from manufacturing firms.</P>
    <P>Under the new arrangements for section 84 loans, banks will be required to pay a duty of 12 per cent on all interest received.  This, no doubt, will be passed back to the borrower who will find that the section 84 interest charge will be increased by 13.6 per cent of base rate. At present a borrower at 10 per cent now faces an increased interest rate of 11.3 per cent.  Nothing has been done to encourage individuals or institutions to invest in new industrial initiatives and risk taking.  It is still not an attractive alternative to the £1 billion investment annually in Government gilts.  Until such time as the level of investment in Government gilts is chanelled to investment in manufacturing industry, we will not have the level of job creation necessary to meet the demands of the labour force.</P>
    <P>The revenue shortfall in 1985 must be a serious source of concern to the Government.  At £123 million short of the budget, it meant a shortfall of about 2.3 per cent.  The expected buoyancy which was talked about in the 1985 budget did not materialise and the principal reason for the shortfall must be the slower economic growth rate than had been expected.  Inflation was also a contributing factor and the weakening dollar added to the price fall in international commodities, particularly oil prices.</P>
    <P>There has been a slow-down in exports in the electronics sector and, for a number of years, there has been a slow-down in agricultural exports, particularly in 1985 due to the poor harvest, but the Minister did nothing by way of compensation nor did he suggest any measures to redress this downturn.  The range of indirect taxation increases, together with the increased VAT rate will lead to price rises in every sector and must inevitably <Col N="2203" /> have a serious effect on revenue targets for this year.</P>
    <P>The selective tax cuts, VAT and excise rates recommended by Fianna Fáil and tried by the Government in a minor way in 1985, have been highly successful in increasing demand, particularly of electrical goods, and had begun to stop the money drain to the Six Counties retail market place.  The move also had a positive effect on our balance of payments and stabilised job losses in the manufacture and distribution of electrical goods. Home sales in electrical goods rose by up to 50 per cent last year and whiskey sales by about 15 per cent.  The U-turn on this policy announced by the Minister for Finance has to be deplored.  Again we are driving thousands of shoppers north of the Border to swell the coffers of retailers, publicans and petrol retail outlets there.  We all know that economic desolation exists for retailers many miles south of the Border and it was to be hoped that the lessons learned in 1985 might have been added to, but unfortunately the Minister has chosen to subtract from that effort which will certainly lead to further deprivation of business along Border counties.</P>
    <P>Despite the increase in the volume of manufacturing output and exports, there has been a fall in living standards, in consumer demand and employment.  The volume of manufacturing output has increased by 29 per cent in the past five years and the volume of exports has increased by 48 per cent in the same period.  Our productivity per head of population has increased by 58 per cent in the past five years, but still our living standards have decreased each year during that period.  Real earnings have fallen by 2 per cent in that time.  Consumer demand has fallen by up to 8 per cent while unemployment has increased by 124 per cent.  Surely those figures indicate to any independent observer that the policies of this Government to deal with the economy have failed.  Why at this late stage will the Government not make the <Col N="2204" /> necessary policy changes in order to stimulate investment and provide jobs that are so necessary for the economy?</P>
    <P>Export strength has not resulted in improved living standards or increased job opportunities.  There are many reasons that contribute to this regrettable state of affairs such as the repatriation of profits by multinationals.  Today the Minister of State indicated that more than likely they would be in the region of £1.2 billion for last year.  Interest payments on foreign debt are included also but a major contributory factor is the level of taxation both in the personal and the corporate sector.  Whatever Government propaganda may try to convey, the fact is that in 1986 PAYE earners will pay on extra £200 million in tax and taxpayers generally will pay an extra £536 million on all accounts.</P>
    <P>Section 84 loans have been hit in the budget and stock relief has gone except for farmers.  There are reduced capital allowances for grant-aided machinery and payments on account are increased by 90 per cent.  These are some of the items that have not been highlighted in the media but the fall-out will have a major impact on production and business and, consequently, on employment levels during the year.</P>
    <P>The lesson and the practice of repatriation of profits by multinationals has not been lost on some of our bigger indigenous concerns.  Some major Irish companies are placing their profits offshore and nothing has been done to plug this hole.  I have no objection whatever to multinationals making money; that is the reason they came here in the first instance.  I would encourage them to make as much profit as possible but it is too much that Irish companies should lodge their profits offshore where they are of no benefit to the national income or to employment.  The infamous black hole has passed the £1 billion mark.  In order to get some national income and to create jobs from these company profits it is imperative that the leak be plugged. Now is the time for the Government to say to the multinationals and to the Irish companies who persist in removing their <Col N="2205" /> profits from the economy that some portion must be made available for specialised purposes in the economy, particularly in the preparation and formation of a research and development programme here.  Reinvestment of profits by multinationals and major Irish companies must be encouraged so far as it concerns the development of other structures in research and development. Investment of consumer savings in manufacturing industry must be made a profitable alternative.  Risk-taking has not been encouraged by this budget and consequently business stagnation will continue and jobs will continue to be scarce.  We must seek ways of attracting money away from the risk-free gilts so that it can be utilised to provide investment for manufacturing industry.  Until we recognise that fact we will not be able to create jobs.</P>
    <P>The budget has increased tax on manufacturing industry by about £24 million due to changes in tax arrangements for investment in plant and machinery and the special duty on section 84 loans.  This will increase interest rates for firms who use such loans.  Industrial production is in decline and so far as this budget is concerned there has been no move to halt that decline.  That must be regretted.  This was a magnificent opportunity for the Government to utilise the resources and investment available if only the proper investment climate and environment existed.</P>
    <P>The budget will increase inflation.  This year possibly we will have an inflation rate of 5 per cent at a time when our main trading partners expect to have an inflation rate of less than 3 per cent.  That will happen if oil prices continue to fall. If the price of crude oil stays at about $20 per barrel, inflation could be at least 1½ per cent below the price expected internationally. If that happens countries such as Germany, which is one of our principal export markets, will have an inflation rate of about 2 per cent and the other EC countries will be less than 3 per cent. Therefore, we will still be adrift by about 2 per cent as compared with the inflation rate of our competitors.  We must aim of <Col N="2206" /> an inflation rate that is in line with our trading partners.  The savings as a result of the drop in oil prices and the strengthening of the Irish pound should be used to reduce inflation, unfortunately, there is no indication from the Government that that will happen.  There have been indications to the contrary, that increased revenue will be drawn from the drop in the price of crude oil and that that further money will be sucked into the Exchequer when it should be passed on to industry and to the public.</P>
    <P>Personal taxation here is still punitive when compared with our neighbours and our competitors.  Our effective tax rate is 10 per cent higher than that prevailing in the United Kingdom before social insurance deductions are made and we are more than 20 per cent out of line with the United States where the effective tax rate is only about 12 per cent.  For example, the top tax rate of 58 per cent is reached here by a married couple on a joint income of about £30,000 whereas in the United Kingdom the same couple could earn £80,000 before reaching the top marginal rate of 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>The changes announced in the tax bands and in the personal allowances are negligible.  Child allowances are terminated and the compensation offered in the child benefit scheme will be clawed back in additional income tax from taxpayers with marginal tax rates over 35 per cent.  The increased age allowances and age exemptions do little more than compensate for the withdrawal of exemptions in respect of deposit interest. As a result, the elderly who have modest savings cannot anticipate any great reduction in their tax bills.  A mean and sneaky attack on the savings of the old and the very young is the hidden monster of this budget.</P>
    <P>This can be illustrated by one or two examples.  The child who has a few hundred pounds on deposit which might have been saved from Communion money or birthday money will be denied the right to the full amount of interest that deposit would earn for him.  A man should earn £12 on £200 invested for a <Col N="2207" /> year but more than £3.40 is now to be withdrawn to help swell the coffers of the Exchequer.  It is unfair to tax the small savings of children.  Let us consider the case of an old age pensioner whose tax free allowance in normal circumstances might be in excess of £6,000 with age exemptions added.  The old age pension for himself and his wife comes to less than £100.  One would have thought that he would have been entitled to the exemption set out in the tax tables but any deposit interest he has will be taxed at the 35 per cent rate as well.  That is inequitable.  The Minister should consider announcing at an early date that deposits from old age pensioners and children will not be subject to the new retention tax.</P>
    <P>High-tech industries benefit from the fact that they are exempt from VAT at the point of entry because they export 75 per cent of their output.  I have always believed that to be a very good idea. The high threshold of 75 per cent for exemption requires a small indigenous Irish firm to have developed an export market three times the size of their domestic market in order to qualify.  That figure is unrealistic.  This export percentage level should have been reduced in accordance with the proposed EC VAT directive.  This was an ideal opportunity for the Minister to bring us into line with what will have to become a fact of life anyway.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made another savage attack on the cost of motoring.  The forecourt tax share on the gallon of petrol has risen from 45 per cent in 1980 to more than 60 per cent this year.  We pay the highest level of tax on the gallon of petrol in the EC, except Italy.  Before the budget the price of a premium gallon of petrol was £2.91 at the petrol pump and the tax content of that price was £1.75. It can no longer be said that a car is a luxury.  In most cases it is a family necessity but the rates of excise duty charged on petrol are driving motorists off the roads or driving unscrupulous people to drive untaxed and uninsured cars.  This will have a very serious effect not just on <Col N="2208" /> the family budget but on transport costs for industry and particularly on our tourist industry.  There is once again a price differential of about £1 between a gallon of petrol here and in the United Kingdom. It is difficult for marketing agencies in the tourist industry to sell Ireland as a location for holidays.  We have increased costs for motoring, increased costs for beer and increased VAT on all specialised products.  It is making it very difficult to promote this country as a tourist destination. The Minister made some effort to improve the position in the tourist industry last year and I compliment him on reducing VAT on meals to 10 per cent, something for which we have been asking for many years.  He has spoiled it all by putting these additional taxes on petrol and the cost of motoring generally.</P>
    <P>The restriction of motor-running expenses and of writing down allowances continues to be confined to a ceiling of £3,500.  This is totally unrealistic. Regrettably, there was no relaxation in the rules relating to the use of company cars this year.  Any business seeking to increase its sales requires mobility of staff and promotional activities.  The use of 1976 valuations is discriminatory against business.  Most car valuations and expenses need to be realigned and at least kept in line with inflation.  Capital allowances for motor vehicles must bear some realistic relationship to market values and bona fide business expenses should be allowed.  This is a small item but it shows the anti-business attitude of this Government.  They could not find it in their hearts to do something positive for the small businessman trying to improve his sales.</P>
    <P>Regarding the tourist industry, we are being lulled into a false sense of security by Government statements about growth patterns in the industry.  All the problems of the industry have been well identified <i>ad nauseam</i> and it is time for real action. The reduction in VAT on meals in welcome but the other cost increases will make it very difficult for us to maintain our market share this year.  We particularly wanted to attract back the motoring tourist from the United Kingdom <Col N="2209" /> because this type of tourism was an enormous source of revenue some years ago. There was hope that we were succeeding in our marketing strategies in that area. However, the new cost of petrol and the increases in beer and spirits will deal a further body blow to the efforts of Bord Fáilte in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why the Government do not recognise that the tourist industry is a major earner of foreign exchange.  Internationally traded tourism should be treated in the same way as manufacturing industry and should qualify for marketing support and investment incentives such as funds from the Designated Fund which manufacturing exporters are entitled to.  Until such time as the tourist industry is recognised for what it is &mdash; an export industry &mdash; it will not reach its full potential.</P>
    <P>The Government continue to blame today's failures on decisions taken by previous administrations.  That has become an unacceptable excuse to the general public for continuing Government inactivity in dealing with the economy.  The Coalition were elected on a policy of financial rectitude but this policy has turned sour.  Government projections were falsly based in their own documents and laced with woolly economic presumptions which have all gone wrong. The deficit, the national debt, borrowing abroad are all out if line with the state of projections in <i>Building on Reality</i>.  By their own yardstick the Government should concede defeat.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined to show the public sector borrowing requirement in a favourable light.  They are prepared to do it or bust.  That is what this economic document, the budget, was all about, to try to show it in a good light when all the projections and presumptions suggested by the Government on coming to office and reiterated in their financial documents have come to nought.  The Coalition made their case in 1982.  They were elected on their ambitions and they must now accept the level of their failures because we are going to advertise those failures.  Failure of this kind should be exposed, particularly <Col N="2210" /> when it has accounted for the highest level of unemployment since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>Uncritical political media have operated in so far as the national debt and deficit budgeting are concerned.  That is the way it is now, but it was not always that way.  Fianna Fáil were pilloried and ballyragged as profligate during their administration but strangely, now that the Coalition have thrown financial rectitude to the winds, the same criticism somehow does not apply.  Commentators outside the House who are not in print are asking why the media are not following this Government in as relentless a way as they followed the Fianna Fáil administration.</P>
    <P>The Government figures are worse on every front.  It is time that they were at least put on the record here.  Borrowing as a national strategy was the brainchild in the 1973-77 Coalition whose chief economic adviser was Deputy Garret FitzGerald at that time.  He it was who first urged foreign loans to be used to finance current spending.  On any fair-minded economic analysis the economy was in good shape when the Coalition took over in 1973.  Foreign debt at that time stood at £126 million and the deficit that year when Fianna Fáil left office was £5 million or the equivalent of 0.3 per cent of GNP.  In 1977 after the Coalition had been in Government from 1973 the national debt was £1,040 million and the deficit was £201 million or 4.4 per cent of GNP.  In 1985 we had a national debt in excess of £20 billion and a deficit at the end of 1985 of £1,284 million or 8.2 per cent of GNP.  In the first oil crisis after the Yom Kippur war and the quadrupled oil prices that followed the Western balance of payments went completely astray with increased inflation, no growth and unemployment rising.  The Coalition at that time did not respond and their 1974 national pay agreement gave rises of up to 17.5 per cent which exacerbated the situation much more than people have generally recognised.  Year after year the Coalition Ministers for Finance, when Fianna Fáil were putting down markers <Col N="2211" /> for them, made it respectable and virtuous to stimulate the economy by budget deficiting, and the Taoiseach, then the leading Government Minister, castigated Fianna Fáil in this House for not supporting his Government's creative use of foreign borrowing.  At that time he talked of planning for larger deficits.  Even when the deficit was soaring, unemployment rising and the national debt at unprecedented levels, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, now Taoiseach and at that time Minister, still talked of expansionary budgets.  In February 1985 he said and I quote him: &ldquo;If anything we underdid it&rdquo; and that is on the record here.  How the gamekeeper of the seventies has forgotten his poaching days.</P>
    <P>We had Coalition Government in 1975 also.  The 1975 figures, while they might be history now, make interesting reading. Inflation at that time was 24.5 per cent. Borrowing was 16 per cent of GNP.  The growth rate was 0.5 per cent and the deficit stood at £259 million or 6.9 per cent of GNP.  Deputy Garret FitzGerald's most famous 1977 mouthful was: &ldquo;We undertook our budget deficit strategy in the face of enormous pressure from Fianna Fáil and many others totally opposed to the concept of a budget deficit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The worst year for borrowing since 1975 was 1981, again when Deputy FitzGerald was in office, now as Taoiseach. Again it reached the 16 per cent level. The Coalition with their chief architect set the course for financial decay and he must now answer the charge of the financial recklessness of the seventies. That is admitted even by his present Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes who admits that all the trouble started at that time when Deputy Garret FitzGerlad was a Minister in a Fine Gael led Government, and supported and willingly thrust upon this country budget deficiting as an economic strategy.  The current Coalition policies, while preaching rectitude, have failed to correct their earlier misdeeds.</P>
    <P>The Coalition have held office for two-thirds of the last 12 years and their fiscal policies have dominated economic policy <Col N="2212" /> over all that period.  Their deficit this year is 8.2 per cent of GNP, the highest ever; still they tell us that their public capital programme is being savaged once again and has been reduced by one-third in the past three years.  It is the lowest level of investment in the public capital sector in ten years, and it is supposed to create the productive assets that this country needs so badly.  State investment has not been given the pivotal role that was suggested for it in <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987.</i> The Coalition have been adding £2 billion per annum to our national debt.</P>
    <P>There has been a perceptible switch by the Coalition to borrowing from domestic banks which has dried up private liquidity and the ability of the private sector to invest.  The politics of perception and deception are leading to a national depression, and that has taken over this country.  The economic media should expose the Coalition for their original sin, mismanagement of our economy.</P>
    <P>The building industry has again been hammered in the budget.  One could be forgiven for thinking that the Coalition in some way have some old score to settle with the building industry and with the builders.  The Government continue to refuse to recognise the possibilities of the construction industry in dealing with the acute unemployment problem.  The budget introduced no incentive to encourage increased construction activity. The fallout of the 10 per cent VAT on construction introduced in the 1985 budget continues to depress the industry and is a major contributory factor to the 15 per cent decline in new housing starts in 1985.  It is a disgrace that the public capital programme has been reduced by a further £25 million this year.</P>
    <P>Let me finish by referring to the retention tax.  The abolition of disclosures requirement on bank deposits will start a flow out from the building societies to the banks and this will lead to a shortage of house mortgages and to further difficulties for building this year.  The retention tax has caused a real difficulty in many areas, particularly for the insurance area. Nobody knows yet what exactly the Minister has in mind by the 15 per cent <Col N="2213" /> retention tax he intends to withdraw from the investment profits made by the life assurance companies.  I tell him now that it is causing great concern in economic circles as to what precisely he means.  If my information is correct that retention tax cannot be properly or legally applied to the life assurance concerns.  I am asking the Minister to make an early announcement that he will withdraw that element of this very foolish budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to almost all the contributions of the previous speakers on the budget with passing interest and a little cynicism.  It is amazing how much one can afford to spend when in Opposition but when on this side of the House that does not carry forward.  That comment refers to any Government but, in particular, under a Fianna Fáil régime, I can remember listening to their contributions a number of times when I was in Opposition.</P>
      <P>Their whole contribution to this debate can reasonably be summed up by the opening remarks of the speaker who said the Government had lost their mandate. The Deputy opposite sat on this side of the House in 1982 when his Government did not receive a mandate and he was prepared to serve on it.  The arguments brought forward followed that vein.</P>
      <P>In preparing this budget anybody would agree that the Government had an unenviable task considering the conflicting demands and constraints that had to be reconciled.  We were faced with an unsustainably large current budget deficit, due mainly to revenue shortfalls and at the same time there were two overriding imperatives that demanded action, namely, unemployment and the PAYE tax burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy that the final package of measures which we put together &mdash; and that is the original meaning of the word &ldquo;budget&rdquo;&mdash; would have been very hard to better in all the circumstances.  While, naturally enough, everybody will not agree with everything in it &mdash; we know that by now &mdash; I think it can be shown to contain a good mix of imagination, <Col N="2214" /> courage, balance, compassion and realism. The radical widening of the tax base and consequent lightening of the burden on PAYE workers was courageous and imaginative.  The modest reductions in the expenditure borrowing requirement and the current budget deficit which we are aiming for showed the right balance for present circumstances.  The quality of compassion is illustrated by our determination to see that the living standards of people on welfare are protected. The provisions being made for increases in public service pay demonstrate a sense of realism.</P>
    <P>True to form, regrettably, the main Opposition party have condemned the budget from all angles.  Believe it or not, they want to cut the current budget deficit, to cut borrowing, to reduce taxes and to increase spending.  But they refuse to be specific in case they would offend some interest group or other, although they can sometimes be specific enough when calling for increased spending for some particular sector.  How therefore can their criticisms contain any credibility? How can they expect them to be taken seriously?</P>
    <P>We hear many glib demands for large cuts in public expenditure.  However, there are a number of harsh realities which put these demands in perspective. Well over one-quarter of all current spending goes to service existing debt and not far off one-half of the remainder goes on public sector pay.  Again, some 45 per cent of the non-capital supply services is devoted to the health and welfare areas which, of course, also include a substantial pay element.  While we have a responsibility to ensure that the health and welfare services are delivered as cost effectively as possible, it would be wholly unacceptable to me and to the Labour Party to have them subjected to the severe cutbacks implied by the demands for expenditure reductions to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>To me the most important features of this budget are: the shifting of the tax burden from the PAYE sector by a much needed broadening of the tax base; the double boost to employment, by reducing <Col N="2215" /> tax rates selectively on certain labour intensive services and by providing the funding for the special package of measures to stimulate building activity announced last October; protecting the living standards of those who depend on welfare; and the tough anti-tax evasion measures so that tax dodging no longer pays.</P>
    <P>The Government have acknowledged that the position of PAYE workers had become intolerable.  Some degree of equality was called for in the relative tax treatment of income from the PAYE sector and of other forms of income.  The budget has done much to achieve this by lightening the PAYE burden to the extent of £121 million and by introducing the retention tax on interest earnings. These changes in the tax area bring a much needed degree of equity to our whole taxation system and enhance the incentive to work.  Much more remains to be done, of course, in this area.</P>
    <P>Another factor foremost in our minds in framing this budget was, of course, the unemployment problem.  There are substantial concessions to selected labour intensive services such as tourism and everyday services such as laundry, hairdressing, etc.  These, together with the substantial package of employment creation measures announced last October, should provide a very worthwhile stimulus to employment during 1986.  Already many of the innovations introduced by this Government in the employment area over the past couple of years are giving good results.  Two of these have been of particular significance: the enterprise allowance scheme has enabled nearly 10,000 unemployed persons to start their own businesses in its first two years of operation and the social employment scheme had almost 5,500 participants by the end of 1985.  The 1986 Estimates make provision for a major increase in funding for this scheme.</P>
    <P>I am also happy that the Government have continued their good record in looking after people depending on social welfare benefits.  The increases announced in the budget will provide for increases <Col N="2216" /> from July next and they will maintain the real value of the payments for a further year.  The Government's concern for the long term unemployed is demonstrated in the extra increases for these categories. The 25 per cent increase in the present children's allowance will also favour the less well off.  With reduced inflation as a result of Government policies, the increases will maintain, if not slightly improve, standards.  Each of the increases given in this Government's earlier budgets has exceeded the following year's increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I will now go on to deal in more detail with the budget as it affects my areas of responsibility as Minister for the Environment.  I have been allocated very substantial sums of money &mdash; both current and capital &mdash; to continue our progress in the provision of essential infrastructure and services in housing, roads, sanitary services and other areas. The total sums at my disposal &mdash; £564 million current and £640 million capital &mdash; will enable us to achieve our objectives in all these areas in 1986.  My capital allocation is well over one-third of the total PCP.  Straightaway, I want to refute absolutely the allegation by some Deputies and others outside the House that this budget puts a further squeeze on local authority finances.  In fact, I will be able to show that in the overall the position of local authorities in preparing their 1986 estimates will be slightly improved as a result of the budget.</P>
    <P>This year brings two very important changes in the financing of local authorities. First, the farm tax will come into force for certain farmers and should begin yielding some revenue to the local authorities and, secondly, the onerous supplementary welfare levy is being removed from local authorities.</P>
    <P>The national plan contained a decision by the Government to introduce the farm tax in 1986.  Last year I piloted the necessary legislation through the House.  The Farm Tax Office has been set up and the first stage of the classification of land is now well under way.  Revenue should begin to accrue to local authorities from November next.  As with any new tax like <Col N="2217" /> this, it is difficult to predict precisely what the early flow of revenue will be.  The Government's best estimate at this stage is that £6 million should accrue to local authorities before the end of 1986 and local authorities will be permitted to take this anticipated revenue into account in framing their estimates for this year. When fully operational, the farm tax should, at present tax rates, yield about £70 million for local authorities.  The farming community is a heavy user of local authority services &mdash; in particular the 46,000 miles of county roads &mdash; and I believe that a contribution from that community to the cost of local services is entirely justified.</P>
    <P>Since I took over as Minister, local authorities have consistently complained to me about the requirement on them to contribute to the cost of services provided by other public bodies.  I am pleased to say that from the beginning of this year local authorities no longer have to contribute to the cost of the supplementary welfare allowances administered by the health boards.  This was the most onerous of the statutory demands and it bore disproportionately heavily on some local authorities.  The removal of the demand and the consequential adjustment of the rates support grants for 1986 has removed these anomalies and results in a more equitable distribution of the grants.</P>
    <P>This budget contained a proposal to remove a rigidity in local authority finances that makes little sense in today's economic conditions.  Hitherto local authorities were required to lodge receipts from the sale of houses, mostly annuities, in a capital account of which not more than 40 per cent could be used for revenue purposes such as housing maintenance.  The remaining 60 per cent must be used for approved capital purposes &mdash; almost entirely SDA loans. However, this restriction means that in some instances these funds remain unused and balances have accumulated either because they exceed an authority's SDA funding requirements or because some urban authorities do not advance SDA loans.  In order to reduce the dependence of local authorities on the <Col N="2218" /> rates support grant and to give them more flexibility in using spare funds to best effect, it has been decided to allow local authorities to divert some £16 million of such funds to general revenue expenditure this year.  I would stress that this will not in any way interfere with the advancing of housing loans since the funds in question are surplus to requirements for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The total rates support grants provision, £281 million included in the abridged Estimate for my Department published last December has, accordingly, been adjusted downwards by £6 million in respect of the farm tax and by £16 million in respect of the unused housing receipts.  Contrary to comments from some Deputies and others these adjustments will not, in the overall, reduce the financial resources available to local authorities in formulating their 1986 estimates.  They are really no more than technical financial adjustments and should not therefore lead to any cuts in employment or in services.</P>
    <P>A third adjustment to the rates support grants was also made in the budget in recognition of the extra costs to local authorities of the package of pay proposals negotiated by the Minister for the Public Service with the local authority unions.  This gives the local authorities an additional £5 million.  The net effect of this threefold adjustment is to reduce the nominal rates support grants total by £17 million to £264 million.  After allowing for all the factors already mentioned and comparing like with like the 1986 level is equivalent to an increase of 6¼ per cent over 1985.  This keeps local authorities well ahead of inflation and is fully in line with the rates support grants allocations implicit in the national plan.</P>
    <P>Turning to the construction industry, present indications are that 1986 will see an end to the decline in the industry. Looking back over 1985 during which output in the industry is estimated to have declined by about 5 per cent over the previous year, it is clear that the key element contributing to the fall off in output was, as in recent years, the continuing decline in private investment. <Col N="2219" /> Against this background the Government have maintained public investment in the industry at the highest sustainable levels.  The Government's concern in this area is evidenced by the level of public investment in the construction industry, which now accounts for over 70 per cent of the industry's total output.  The Government are also concerned to create both the general economic conditions and the appropriate incentives which will lead to increased levels of private investment in construction.</P>
    <P>One such incentive is the greatly enhanced scheme of house improvement grants which will provide significant work and job opportunities for the building industry in 1986 and for which a sum of £24 million is provided in the budget.  To assess the employment potential of the new scheme one has to remember that each £1 spent on grants generates at least £2 more in private investment.  Therefore, an expenditure of £24 million should generate work to the value of £72 million and possibly more.  The Government are also seeking to ensure that the taxpayers' money which provides these grants is channelled into the legitimate building sector to give spin-off benefits in terms of increased employment and not diverted into black economy operations.  As stated in the Minister for Finance's budget speech, a similar condition will now be introduced in relation to the new house grant and mortgage subsidy whereby contractors employed must satisfy the Department that their tax and social insurance affairs are in order before payment can be made.</P>
    <P>As further assistance to the industry in terms of worthwhile building work, grants were also provided for the improvement of facilities at hotels which by extending the tourist season will also boost employment in that sector.  A sum of £5 million has been set aside to finance a programme of improved community, leisure facilities and amenities.  In addition generous tax and employment incentives are being provided to assist with the revitalisation of certain inner city areas.</P>
    <P>My Department's 1986 Estimate will <Col N="2220" /> provide for a grant to An Foras Forbartha in respect of secretarial and research services for the Construction Industry Development Council which the Government have decided to set up and which will, I expect, get off the ground within a few months.</P>
    <P>I should like to return for a moment to the range of financial and other incentives being introduced to promote the rehabilitation of inner city areas in Dublin, Cork and Limerick by encouraging redeveloped programmes.  These incentives are intended to attract development into areas which have generally been perceived as unfavourable for investment purposes and which would probably remain in a run-down and derelict state if left to the normal operation of the property market.  Legislation is at present being prepared in my Department which will provide for the designation of these areas, and the establishment of a new statutory authority to secure the redevelopment of one of these areas, the 27 acre Custom House Docks site in Dublin.  I am hopeful that the redevelopment of this massive site will do much to enhance the environment and employment prospects of the whole surrounding area and will serve as a catalyst to stimulate redevelopment along the docks and in the north inner city generally.  The legislation will also provide for the granting of rates remissions on development on this site and in the other designated areas.  In addition, a range of taxation incentives to promote development and reconstruction in the designated areas will be provided for in the Finance Bill.  The precise areas in Dublin, Cork and Limerick to be designated will be decided and announced by Government as soon as possible following the completion of consultations which are taking place with the local authorities involved.</P>
    <P>The initial response to the announcement of this policy initiative has been very favourable.  Positive interest in the operation of the schemes and involvement in them has been expressed by a large number of private sector agencies at home and abroad.  I am confident that the incentives on offer will signal a halt <Col N="2221" /> to the long decline in the physical fabric of our major urban centres and will bring about a major change of attitude towards inner city living and investment in inner city redevelopment.</P>
    <P>The main aim of the Government's housing policy is to ensure that, so far as the resources of the economy permit, every household in the State has suitable accommodation at a price or rent they can afford.  The policies adopted to achieve this aim can never be entirely rigid or immutable.  We must be ready to change the emphasis of these policies to respond to the needs of the changing housing situation and to the dictates of economic circumstances.  Two important developments, involving changes in the emphasis of housing policy, have taken place in the past year or so.</P>
    <P>One of these is the new importance we are attaching to the conservation and improvement of the existing housing stock borne out by the huge increase in the funds being made available for house improvement grants this year.  The other development of importance is the very large increase in the number of existing local authority houses becoming available for re-letting as a consequence of the £5,000 grant incentive for tenants to give up their tenancies and purchase houses for themselves.  This has resulted in a very significant reduction in waiting lists and has taken pressure off the new building programme.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the new emphasis on the conservation and improvement of the existing housing stock.  This is being given effect in respect of private housing by the new scheme of house improvement grants and in respect of public housing by the programme of remedial works to local authority houses. To take the new grant scheme first, Deputies will be aware of the widespread interest it has evoked among householders. Some 30,000 applications have already been received in the couple of months since the scheme was announced. An unprecedented sum of £24 million is being made available for house improvement grants in the 1986 Estimate for my Department.  I have taken a number of <Col N="2222" /> steps in the Department to cope with this quantum leap in the number of grant applications which involves strengthening both the indoor and outdoor staffs. So as to expedite inspections some retired inspectors were recruited due to their familiarity with the particular work and, in addition, an incentive bonus scheme was introduced for permanent inspectors. A number of additional staff were assigned to the processing of applications and the working of overtime by the indoor staff has been necessary also.  In order to further improve the position arrangements are at present being made to recruit a number of temporary inspectors and strengthen further the administrative staff.</P>
    <P>I notice that, according to newspaper reports, Deputy Flynn who has left the House has referred to the new grants scheme as a &ldquo;con job&rdquo;.  While I do not think that many of the 30,000 householders who have already applied for these grants will be too worried by this typically wild and inaccurate statement from the Deputy.  I think I should take this opportunity of correcting any false impression he may have given about the scheme.  However, I suppose his chagrin at the success of this scheme is understandable, especially since he is a Deputy whose party abolished all house improvement grants in the not too distant past.</P>
    <P>As has been the case always, the inspector's task is to assess the application having regard to the standards and conditions laid down as he is technically qualified to do.  I want to deny emphatically the suggestion that inspectors were instructed to be inflexible. Indeed, on the contrary, when the scheme was introduced I specifically enjoined inspectors to be reasonable in their approach.  I would like to inform Deputy Flynn also that, contrary to his assertion, grant payments under the scheme have in fact commenced.</P>
    <P>I have outlined already the special measures taken or proposed to deal with the huge volume of applications and furthe comment on Deputy Flynn's utterance on this aspect is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2223" /> Following the success of a pilot project in a 132 house scheme at Kindlestown Park, Greystones, I have earmarked a sum of £5 million for expenditure under the remedial works scheme for local authority houses which will get under way this year.  Under the scheme, capital &mdash; subsidisable at a rate of up to 80 per cent &mdash; is made available to enable local authorities to carry out essential structural repairs to low cost houses built in the late sixties and early seventies and to pre-1940 houses suffering from serious structural deterioration.  Because of the extent of the problem and, in the light of the high number of proposals which have been received since the scheme was introduced, the remedial programme will have to be phased over a number of years.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, due to the different types of construction and the complexity of the problems from this legacy of low cost housing it will be necessary in the majority of cases to undertake pilot projects to ascertain the best way of remedying the defects.  Apart from the Kindlestown scheme, I have given approval in principle to a further ten pilot proposals to date.  I hope to give approval to the undertaking of pilot projects in a number of other areas shortly when they have been evaluated by my technical staff.</P>
    <P>A high level of local authority housing completions has been maintained in recent years and improved cost control procedures have been developed also. Last year, local authorities completed more than 6,400 new houses.  Apart from 1984, when there were 7,002 completions, this was the highest number of completions since 1976.  A further 4,000 houses approximately would have become available from existing local authority stock for re-letting in 1985 so that for the second year in succession, the Government's target of housing 9,000 households was comfortably met.  I am satisfied that this target will again be exceeded for the current year.</P>
    <P>The excellent value for money now being achieved is attributable both to the keen competition at present among builders for local authority housing contracts <Col N="2224" /> and to the strict enforcement of my Department's new cost control procedures. This is entirely consistent with the Government's objectives for improved effectiveness in public expenditure.</P>
    <P>A significant feature of the housing programme in the past two years has been the shortening of the waiting lists for local authority accommodation.  The situation in the Dublin Corporation area illustrates very clearly the remarkable progress that has been made.  In the past two years the total number of approved applicants has fallen by more than one-third, from 6,714 in November, 1983 to 4,484 in November, 1985.  Indications are that when the next approved list is completed by the corporation there will be a further substantial drop in the number.  However, that is not the complete story as many of the applicants could be housed already by the corporation if they did not choose to wait for accommodation in a specific area.  The present supply of houses and flats has enabled the corporation to offer accommodation to many two person families and a substantial number of younger single people have been housed also.</P>
    <P>While end-1985 figures for the country as a whole are not yet available to me it is clear that very significant progress in reducing the overall demand for local authority housing has been made.  This progress is attributable to the high level of the building programme and to the success of the £5,000 grant scheme available to tenants and tenant purchasers to provide private houses as well as the availability of an adequate pool of mortgage finance which has made house ownership available to low income families.</P>
    <P>This fall in demand warrants careful evaluation of the local authority house building programme.  In the regard, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1985 which is at present before this House provides an improved basis for the assessment of housing needs.  The 1986 public capital programme provision for the local authority housing programme in 1986 shows clearly that I am not complacent nor are the Government, about the need for providing accommodation for people <Col N="2225" /> who are unable to provide it from their own resources.  In this connection, I am particularly aware of the special needs of disadvantaged groups such as the homeless and travellers.  Indeed, the Housing Bill is designed to ensure that such groups will be afforded due priority in the formulation of local authority housing programmes and the allocation of dwellings.</P>
    <P>I have just mentioned the £5,000 grant to tenants and tenant purchasers as being a major factor in easing the pressure on the local authority housing programme. A total of 1,950 grants at a cost of £9.75 million were paid last year, its first year of operation.  There were about 4,700 applications of which almost 3,500 were approved.  Allowing for the time lapse between vacating the local authority dwelling and actual payments of the grant, it is estimated that some 2,300 dwellings became available for re-letting in 1985 as a result of the operation of the scheme.  The capital provision for the scheme in 1986 is £11.75 million which will allow the payment of 2,350 grants.</P>
    <P>In addition to its effects on the housing lists the scheme has provided a welcome boost for new house building.  It is estiamted that over 44 per cent of the tenants who handed back their local authority dwelling bought new houses in the private sector.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that expenditure on this scheme represents very good value for money when one considers the capital and current costs of providing a new local authority house.  It also brings home ownership within the reach of many tenants who aspire to this form of tenure.</P>
    <P>The continuance of a satisfactory flow of mortgage finance from private and public sources is of critical importance to the housing programme, to house purchasers and to the construction industry.  In this regard I am very pleased to say that during 1985 a total of about £600 million in mortgage finance was provided by all lending agencies and I expect that a similar amount will be available this year.</P>
    <P>The provision in the 1986 public capital programme for the payment of SDA and HFA house purchase and other loans is <Col N="2226" /> £169 million, which will finance the purchase of approximately 9,700 homes.  The continued high level of funding from these schemes is evidence of both my own and the Government's commitment to maintaining a sufficient level of mortgage finance from public sources to enable those on lower incomes to reach the desirable goal of owning their own homes. Both schemes are, of course, complemented by the £5,000 house purchase grant scheme for tenants and tenant-purchasers of local authority houses, the £2,000 new house grant and £3,000 mortgage subsidy available from my Department for first time purchasers.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputies are aware of the very worth while work being carried out by the Task Force on Special Housing Aid for the Elderly.  To date more than 5,000 elderly persons have had their living conditions improved.  As evidence of my continued commitment to the task force and in recognition of its progress and indeed value in alleviating substandard living conditions of many elderly persons, I have allocated an additional £500,000 to the scheme giving an overall provision of £1½ million in 1986.</P>
    <P>Before commenting on the prospects for 1986 in the roads area, I would like to remind the House briefly of the advances made during 1985.  Last year was a particularly good one for road development with the publication of the new road plan and the provision of a substantial increase in State road grants.  Progress during 1985 on the programme of major improvement projects set out in the new road plan was very satisfactory.  Of the 54 schemes listed to be commenced and or to be completed up to the end of 1987, 28 are already in progress, compulsory purchase orders have been confirmed for six projects and public inquiries have been held for another 15 projects.</P>
    <P>Turning to 1986, State road grants totalling £160 million will be made available to local authorities for road improvement and maintenance.  This represents an increase of 4 per cent on the 1985 provision.  However, it has to be remembered that in 1985 there was a substantial increase in State funding for <Col N="2227" /> roadworks which was 14.5 per cent greater in real terms than the 1984 provision. A comparison over a longer time frame helps to make the point even more forcibly.  The 1986 provision is 25 per cent greater in real terms than the level of road grants in 1982.</P>
    <P>A large part of the State grant for road improvement will be spent by local authorities on the programme of major road projects outlined in the new road plan.  These projects consist mainly of bypasses of towns on national roads, new bridges, relief roads and ring roads. Subject in some cases to the outcome of statutory procedures relating to the acquisition of property, major schemes scheduled to commence in 1986 include the Navan road in Dublin, Newbridge By-Pass in Kildare, Glanmire By-Pass in Cork, Shankill/Bray By-Pass in Dublin and Wicklow, Bunratty By-Pass in Clare, Killarney By-Pass in Kerry, Glenmore By-Pass (Phase 1) in Kilkenny, Dublin Ring Road (Western Section) and Blackrock By-Pass in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Because of the need to preserve past investment in our roads and because of its high employment content, I have this year paid special attention to road maintenance &mdash; the grant for which has been increased to £29.7 million which is 8 per cent up on last year.</P>
    <P>The 1986 road grants, which have been recently allocated to local authorities, include a sum of £20 million by way of &ldquo;block grants&rdquo; to supplement expenditure from their own resources on the improvement, maintenance and management of non-national main roads and urban roads, on improvement works on county roads and on the implementation of traffic management measures.  This &ldquo;block grant&rdquo; allocation will be 21 per cent higher than in 1985.</P>
    <P>In addition to the heavy public investment in the road building programme the Government are also anxious to attract investment from the private sector in order to accelerate progress.  In February 1985 I published details of potential toll road projects and invited a response from private sector interests.  Following Government approval in principal to the <Col N="2228" /> tolling of the Galway Road-Navan Road section of the Dublin Ring Road, Dublin County Council approved a toll scheme for the project.  This toll scheme will shortly be the subject of a public inquiry along with the motorway scheme for the project which the council submitted in December.  The possibility of private sector investment in the Newbridge By-Pass is being discussed at present with a group representing banking and building interests.  We are also prepared to consider toll proposals which involve funding on a joint public-private basis where projected traffic volumes are insufficient to justify a fully privately financed scheme.</P>
    <P>Apart from the more obvious benefits of a well developed roads infrastructure to the commercial and economic life of the country, the road improvements undertaken in recent years have contributed in no small measure to the improvement of road safety.  In 1978, 628 people were killed on our roads.  By 1985 the number had fallen to 416, a reduction of 34 per cent on that for 1978.  Total annual road fatalities are now lower than at any time since the present system of road accident reporting was introduced in 1968, when there were only 500,000 vehicles compared with over 900,000 today.  Other factors contributing to the reduction in road deaths include various legislative measures, particularly the stricter drunken driving laws, stiffer penalties provided for under the Road Taffic (Amendment) Act, 1984, and Garda traffic law enforcements, which in 1984 resulted in an increase of 17 per cent in the number of prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The activities of the National Road Safety Association have also made a significant contribution.  The year 1986 has been designated European Road Safety Year by the European Community.  The NRSA's programme for 1986 will highlight aspects of the themes selected by the EC Transport Council as appropriate to the year &mdash; alcohol, seat belts, speed, child safety and safety of two-wheeled vehicles.  I am glad to be able to include a special sum of £50,000 for the EC <Col N="2229" /> programme in this year's grant to the association.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, it was necessary to increase motor taxation in the budget. New simplified rates applying to private motor cars, which are broadly in line with inflation, will become operative from 1 March.  Taxation rates will now be based on cubic capacity instead of horse power which has been the basis for many years.  Against this, the Minister for Finance also proposes to phase out the duty on motor vehicle parts &mdash; a reduced rate of 10 per cent will apply from this month.  Also the Minister will abolish the duty on tyres and tubes which will reduce the retail price by about 4 per cent.  It will also be of some comfort to motorists to know they are getting better value for their money due to the expanded road building programme.</P>
    <P>Motorists in the Dublin area will be glad to know that Dublin Corporation, in association with my Department, recently opened a branch motor tax office at Nutgrove Shopping Centre, Rathfarnham, to improve the level of service to the motorist.</P>
    <P>Over recent years there has been a considerable increase in capital spending on sanitary services schemes with a corresponding expansion in the level of activity on schemes in progress.  Considerable progress has, therefore, been made over these three years in bringing some of the high cost schemes to completion stage.  Last March the Greater Dublin drainage scheme which cost in excess of £50 million was commissioned. The 1986 provision of £77 million will meet existing commitments and maintain progress on the remaining high priority schemes.</P>
    <P>I am particularly anxious that we continue to maintain the good progress we have made in constructing schemes that abate pollution.  It is noteworthy that, of the locations identified by the Water Pollution Advisory Council as areas which merit remedial works, 12 schemes have been completed at a cost of £14.4 million; work is in progress on five other schemes totalling £11.4 million and ten <Col N="2230" /> other schemes estimated to cost £18.2 million are at various stages of planning.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say I have been able to increase the provision for the Environment Awareness Bureau which I set up last year, from £100,000 in 1985 to £125,000 in 1986.  As a result in 1986 the bureau will be able to strengthen their campaign to promote environmental improvement and education.  As the impact of their promotional activities becomes more apparent, a more caring public attitude to the environment will be fostered.  The bureau have been successful in attracting some private sector sponsorship and I hope this will increase in the future.</P>
    <P>My Department's 1986 Estimate contains a provision of £5 million in respect of the new programme of improved community and leisure facilities and other general amenities.  This money is being made available in recognition of the need to provide the recreational and community facilities required &mdash; and increasingly being sought by resident's associations and other voluntary groups &mdash; particularly in urban areas.  The selection of projects to be funded under this scheme is now at an advanced stage and I will be making an announcement shortly.</P>
    <P>For a number of years my Department have paid a grant to the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals for consultancy work in relation to the problem of stray dogs and cats.  On behalf of the Department the society have actively encouraged local authorities to provide animal shelters and other arrangements for the reception of unwanted pets and to avail of the 50 per cent contribution towards costs which I make available.  The society's efforts are reflected in the number of shelters now available and the proposals which are well advanced for others.</P>
    <P>The society's work is not confined to this area.  Their inspectors and voluntary personnel throughout the country are also making an important contribution to animal welfare generally.  These efforts on behalf of the community should be acknowledged.  The special grant of £25,000 to the society announced in the <Col N="2231" /> budget is well deserved and will assist the society in maintaining their wide range of services.</P>
    <P>I am making a special grant this year to the Irish Architectural Archive to assist them in their work as a repository for architectural archival material and in recognition of their contribution towards greater appreciation of our architectural heritage.  The IAA are a voluntary body established to gather records &mdash; mainly photographic &mdash; of Irish buildings.  Since their incorporation in 1976 they have established the nucleus of a national collection of architectural documentation relating to buildings of architectural interests in Ireland, both north and south. The collection is open to the public and is of particular value to architects, architectural historians, geographers, historians, planners, archaeological societies, teachers and the media generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance announced in his budget speech that the Government are making a special grant to the Limerick Civic Trust.  The organisation is a charitable trust in existence for two to three years.  It is mainly engaged in restoration work on derelict sites and buildings.  It is funded by way of convenants from local business and grants from the corporation towards specific projects. Among the work carried out by the trust is the restoration of a site beside St. Mary's Cathedral, including the building of a boundary wall to match the stone work.  The trust is currently engaged in restoring an old potato market.</P>
    <P>This budget will make an important contribution to the economic recovery that is so necessary for the future employment and well being of our large young population.  It is a good budget &mdash; good for employment, good for PAYE earners, good for people on social welfare and good for the economy as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Flynn were here he would have some comments to make about the Minister's reply regarding new house grants.  Deputy Flynn would welcome any increase in the grant, but the point he made was that he wanted to know how many people were approved <Col N="2232" /> for the full rate of grant.  It is going abroad that some of the grant inspectors are deciding that certain works only can be approved for the grant at the full rate.  A further point made by Deputy Flynn was that the temporary inspectors would be employed on a fixed rate for the first couple of months and then on a rate of £7 per house for each application disposed of.  What does &ldquo;disposed of&rdquo; mean?  Perhaps the inspectors would refuse as many as possible.  I know the Minister has encouraged these inspectors to take a broad view of the work to be done, but that was the point being made by Deputy Flynn.</P>
      <P>The budget is one of the most overrated political events of the whole year. The tax changes announced particularly in the last three budgets represent only a tiny proportion of any changes in Government finances.  The current total expenditure this year will be of the order of £8,000 million.  Even 10 per cent added here and there makes very little difference since 1 per cent represents £80 million. We are merely tinkering with finances because the major decisions have been made long before the Minister comes to the House.  They have been made by the Government or forced on them because of economic circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pay for the public sector this year will be in the order of £2,600 million and interest on servicing the national debt will be about £2,100 million, a total of £4,700 million out of a total expenditure of £8,000 million.  Therefore, 50 per cent to 60 per cent of budget expenditure is already planned before the Minister for Finance in any Government can turn his attention to other matters.  The budget is a non-event.  It is not realistic to regard the budget as the major economic speech of the year.  It is irrelevant for the Minister for Finance to announce that he is giving a grant of £50,000 to Bord na gCon or some other organisation because it would not represent one-thousandth of total Government expenditure &mdash; it is only window dressing.  I know that the temptation is to bring in some good news <Col N="2233" /> on budget day, but that sort of announcement makes a laugh of budgetary procedure.</P>
    <P>There was no strategy in this or previous budgets introduced by the Government. Perhaps that has been the case for many years &mdash; perhaps we are just moving the deckchairs on the <i>Titanic.</i> The Government do not seem to have any plans, good, bad or indifferent in regard to the economy.  If the budget were pursuing a monetarist, Keynesian or any other theory of economic policy, it could be judged in that light; but, unfortunately, there does not seem to be any policy.  There must be a budget every year to enact the tax laws, but it would be more honest for the Minister to come into the House and say that everything will be the same as last year and then to sit down or to leave the House.  The Government should admit that they have lost direction in regard to the economy.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to judge the Government on their own strategy and to analyse it.  However, it is hard to know what their plan is because it has been changed so often.  When they came into office they promised to set the finances of the country in order and to solve the unemployment problem.  They were ambitious targets, and in a free enterprise economy it would be very difficult to solve these two problems simultaneously.  However, the Government must be judged on their own words.  They promised to create jobs and to wipe out the current budget deficit by the end of 1987.  When those aspirations fell by the wayside they produced <i>Building on Reality</i>.  The first objective of the plan was to increase employment, but at present 240,000 people are out of work.  The second objective of the plan was to halt the rise in taxation, direct and indirect, but that also failed.  Regarding public finance objectives, the plan stated that the current budget deficit as a proportion of national output would be reduced from 7½ per cent to 5 per cent of GNP.  Exchequer borrowing was to be reduced from 12¾ to 9¾ per cent of GNP. Public sector borrowing, which included borrowing by State enterprise, was to be reduced from 17 per cent to 11¼ per cent <Col N="2234" /> of GNP by the end of 1987.  This was the plan of the Government who were going to eliminate all these problems on being elected, but of course they had to be more realistic in regard to their targets. We are now into 1986 and they have not lived up to the objectives set for 1985.</P>
    <P>It would have been legitimate political objective for any party coming into power in 1982 to have said that there were two major problems to be dealt with in regard to running the country &mdash; unemployment and the public finances. They should have tackled one to the exclusion of the other, even though that might not have suited everybody.  When one had been satisfactorily solved they could then have turned their attention to the other.  If the Government had said they would tackle the public finances and try to put them in order and allow unemployment to rise, as the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, has done, that would be a legitimate objective.  On the other hand, the Government could have said they would tackle employment, reflate the economy, borrow more and to hell with the public finances, get more people working, which would create more taxation, and then we would get the public finances in order.  That, too, would be a legitimate objective.</P>
    <P>But what have we done in the last three years?  In my opinion we have ended up with the worst of all worlds.  Officially we have 240,000 people unemployed, another 70,000 people in AnCO training and youth employment schemes and many others doing temporary work.  In 1984 it was estimated that at least 30,000 people emigrated and in 1985 at least another 30,000 emigrated.  In the last two years, therefore, 60,000 people have emigrated. That means that the real level of unemployment is around 370,000.  Even the 240,000 people officially unemployed represent 18 per cent of the work force, the highest in the EC.  While our competitors have been solving these problems, we have been going in the other direction.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the public finances.  As someone who has attracted a small amount of infamy in the last five years because of my approach to the public <Col N="2235" /> finances, I would like to put a few points on record.  In this State people find it very easy to label others.  People do not always listen to what one has to say, but they get an impression of what they think one has said and then stick a label on one.  That is helped by the media, because it means they do not have to think either.  I have been pilloried in certain quarters and used by the Government parties during the election campaign as someone who criticised Fianna Fáil policies in the area of public finances.  Through skilful media manipulation everybody in the country thinks that the public finances are in dire straits because of Fianna Fáil when in office &mdash; and they think Charlie McCreevey has been saying this for years.</P>
    <P>There was a small current budget deficit in 1972 but we had what can be called a real current budget deficit since 1973.  Between 1973 and 1986 Fianna Fáil were in Government for four years eight months; the Coalition have been in power for almost nine years.  This proves that this problem was not created solely by Fianna Fáil.  The people in Government for two-thirds of this 13-year period have been the Fine Gael and Labour Parties. In 1982 the impression was given that the problem of the current budget deficit would never have developed if we had had responsible Government down the years, and that Fianna Fáil created this problem.  I want to show that this was not so.  As someone who on occasion has been identified in the media as a man who has been critical of a Fianna Fáil leader, I want, in the interests of fair play, to put on record that of the four years eight months of Fianna Fáil rule only two years were under the leadership of Deputy Charles Haughey.  These matters need to be put in perspective.</P>
    <P>One of the amazing things about Irish people is that they like things made easy. They like to be told who are the good lads and who are the bad lads.  They do not like to have to analyse the problem. As most Deputies will acknowledge, people's perception of things is probably more important than reality.  People <Col N="2236" /> think it is more important to shout about what needs to be done rather than doing anything about it.  Similarly, if a person gets a reputation for doing something, he will be blamed whatever happens, and nobody will examine the facts.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the current budget deficit.  An American President once said that he would prefer a one-handed economist &mdash; for obvious reasons: every economist says &ldquo;On the one hand, it could be done like this and, on the other ...&rdquo;. When running a country there is nothing wrong in trying to experiment; but, if it does not work, that experiment can be cancelled.  The purpose of our current budget deficit was to overcome the crisis which followed the hike in the oil prices, but there is also an old theory about why there should be a current budget deficit. A current budget deficit means you pay out more in current expenditure than you take in in taxation.  This means you help galvanise demand which should create more jobs.  Like every idea followed by a Government, this policy was tried out and continued; but everybody forgot the original purpose.  It can be shown that the current budget deficit does not create jobs in the Irish economy.  It does create jobs in Japan, Hong Kong, Germany and everywhere else; but not in Ireland, because Ireland has a very open economy and the propensity to import is very high. This policy did not work economically, yet it was continued.</P>
    <P>We are not prepared to pay for the level of services we enjoy.  In my view the level of services we provide are very desirable because we need good health services, good education and different types of infrastructure, but the cost of this level of services is too great for the level of production we enjoy.  Let us take a simple analogy.  There might be a poor person with eight or nine children who would like to have a washing machine; but, while that machine would be very desirable, if she cannot afford to pay for it she cannot buy it.  Yet we are saying the level of services we need is too high, but we do not acknowledge that the cost is too high.  In the past 12 or 13 years we have been engaged in a national <Col N="2237" /> programme of self-delusion.  We have fooled ourselves that we were as well off as America or Germany and could enjoy the same standard of living.  It is Irish society who have fooled themselves.  It is not the politicians because they have just responded to the needs of the people.  It is time we realised what has been happening in the past 13 years.</P>
    <P>The net effect of this self-delusion has been that, at the end of 1985, the public finances were in a worse state in absolute and percentage terms than at any other time in our history.  At one time it was broadcast throughout the country that the then Fianna Fáil Government were the most reckless Government of all time but now, after all the hardship we have endured, the situation is worse than it was in 1982.  Tricking around with the figures will not prove otherwise.</P>
    <P>More than all income tax collected is needed to service the national debt.  Total borrowing is of the order of £20 billion while in 1982 the figure was £1,200 million. In the same three years the current deficit budget has come to over £3,400 million and total borrowing has come to nearly £5,700 million.  In that period total direct foreign borrowing has amounted to £2,250 million.  This is after all the talk in the past three years that these matters would be rectified.</P>
    <P>If there were justification for having a current budget deficit and public borrowing to revitalise the economy and to create employment in capital works, now would be the time that a Government should embark on that course.  Now would be the time to reduce taxation and to take measures with regard to borrowing in order to reflate the economy in a time of recession.  However, we cannot do that now because we have used the seed corn and we are up to our ears in debt.  We have ended up with the worst of all possible worlds.  We have about 350,000 people unemployed &mdash; I am counting those on the official list and elsewhere &mdash; and we have an enormous public borrowing figure.</P>
    <P>Confidence in the country has been eroded in all walks of life.  It has permeated the consciousness of business <Col N="2238" /> people, farmers, farm workers, factory owners and employees.  Nowadays worry about the economy has replaced the weather as a topic of conversation.  Even reasonably successful business people are worried and many say they are sorry they did not emigrate years ago.  People are convinced that things are desperate and that they will get worse.  They are shellshocked. It is my view that people would not be surprised if an announcer came on the radio tomorrow morning and announced that someone had thrown a big rope around the country, had towed it to the South Pacific and sold it.  Confidence has been eroded even in the case of reasonably successful business people.</P>
    <P>We should have a kind of national reawakening programme.  We must believe in ourselves.  We must believe we can do something about the situation.  There is an old saying that there is nothing to fear but fear itself.  It is the job of political leaders, and particularly of the Taoiseach and the Government, to give the necessary lead.  We have many assets.  We have a large well educated young workforce and we have many other advantages not possessed by other countries.  I must admit that, in trying to identify weaknesses in the public finances and other related matters, perhaps I have contributed to that loss of confidence.  There is no point in telling people things are bad. They are well aware of that, but they want to know what the Government will do about it.  It is the job of great statesmen and political leaders to give the necessary encouragement.  It is what the job of Government should be about.  In the past leaders were able to instil confidence in the people to overcome national crises.  That is what Ireland needs today but this Government have not helped in the matter.  They have told us things could not be worse.</P>
    <P>It does not matter what the opinion polls state.  Last year I put a question to the Minister for the Environment suggesting that opinion polls should be banned, particularly in the period between the calling of a general election and the election date.  If I were ever in the position of running affairs I would tell <Col N="2239" /> Ministers that the first time one of them came to me quoting the findings of opinion polls it would automatically be grounds for dismissal.  If a Government make up their minds regarding a course of action they should get on with the job.  At this stage no matter what the Government do the people have lost confidence in them.  The greatest service they could give would be to resign and give somebody else a chance to try to do something. When confidence is lost in a Government it is impossible to recover.</P>
    <P>We are deluding ourselves when we talk about industrial and economic growth.  Figures have been trotted out about the volume of exports last year but quite often we talk of myths.  I am not the only one who thinks in this way.  I shall quote from an article by Dr. Antoin Murphy in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 5 January 1986:</P>
    <P>The statistics suggest a Japanese level of industrial performance, yet the economy is in a depressed state.  The reason for this is that a large input into these statistics comes from the activities of multi-national companies in areas such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals and computers.  These companies are using Ireland as a tax avoidance base.</P>
    <P>They carry out their research and development programmes outside the country and use Ireland simply for low grade processing and assembly operations. They minimise the price of imported inputs and maximise the prices of exports, thereby creating the impression that there is a massive amount of value-added created in this country by super productive Irish workers. The reality is that most of the value added has been created by corporate accountants, rather than Irish workers, anxious to maximise the benefits of the low tax rates on manufactured exports from Ireland.</P>
    <P>Anybody involved in the accountancy knows that to be absolutely true.  It is a myth that there is an industrial boom involving exports etc.  At the end of the <Col N="2240" /> accounting year for any of these multinationals, before the auditors come in, the accountants are at a wonderful level of production for night and day, pushing through all kinds of debits and credits and fictitional entries in order to maximise the profits or do certain other things.  These extraordinary profits and exports really do not amount to anything.  Some economists have been amazed that the economy is enjoying a boom yet employment is stagnant.  It is quite easy to understand it in the terms I have outlined.  These profits and growths are a myth created by accountants who maximise the tax advantages.  This is the kind of &ldquo;boom&rdquo; we are living through.  It is not a boom at all.  The real economy is not growing. That fact must be got home.  This so-called boom will be short-lived because we have not done anything about creating a real industrial base.  We have natural resources but they are in the field of agriculture and mariculture.  These are the areas where the State agencies should be devoting their energies in order to maximise output.</P>
    <P>We have had factories in my constituency which were supposed to produce cameras.  Cameras can be produced as easily on the Rock of Gibraltar as in County Kildare.  There is no special reason why cameras or Black and Decker equipment should be made in Ireland. These multinationals do not come to Ireland for love of the country or love of the people.  They come for strategic reasons at a particular time, perhaps for tax avoidance reasons.  We have created a fictitious industrial base while we have allowed indigenous industry to go by the way.  We have not maximised our own resources.  We have not done anything in the area of added value in the food industry.  This is where the real potential is.  Small Irish businesses employing five to ten people are the ones which will stick and create jobs.  If a fellow starts a little business in Fermoy and has to mortgage his house and employ two people, he will not run away when things go bad but will have to stick at it.  That is the kind of <Col N="2241" /> business we have to be creating, particularly in the area of agriculture and mariculture. We need businesses with an indigenous base, run by Irish people, not multinationals.  I would not discourage multinationals from coming here but I am glad that the IDA have recognised that the whole emphasis of growth should not be on the multinationals.</P>
    <P>Anybody wanting to create employment here is faced by high tax rates, layers of bureaucracy and the attitudes of the banks and their lending policy.  I have come to the conclusion that the banks might as well close up and put all the money in Government securities etc. Effectively that is what they have been doing.  Some years ago they shed crocodile tears because they were forced by the Central Bank to keep a certain percentage in Government gilts.  They are required to keep something in the order of 13 per cent or 15 per cent in Government bills and so on, but in 1985 figures show that the reserves ratio of the associated banks was at 34 per cent in Government securities.</P>
    <P>It is easier to lend money to the Government and be sure of the return than to lend to Joe Soap starting up his industry.  Joe Soap will be operating in such a competitive environment and will have to pay such taxes that he will hardly be able to make his business pay.  The banks have been taking the easy option. they are not lending for productive purposes. I question the wisdom of what the banks are really at.  They are private institutions to maximise profits for their shareholders but that could not be <i>ad idem</i> with Government policy.  No matter what grants the Government may introduce to stimulate growth here and there, most people have to go to the banks or to lending institutions to get the money to start up business.  Interest rates have increased by 5 per cent since 1 January and part of the reason is the high level of Government borrowing.  The Government have a voracious appetite to take up all funds to finance the current budget deficit.  This has the effect as well of keeping up bank interest rates.  We must look <Col N="2242" /> at the <i>raison d'etre</i> of the banking institutions. We have to create institutions which give farmers or business people the wherewithal to go about business.</P>
    <P>I am something of a climatologist with regard to economics.  The free enterprise system is the one that works best.  It creates maximum levels of output so that people at all levels in society can have a reasonable standard of living.  Perhaps I am wrong; perhaps the way to do it is to have total State involvement.  I am totally convinced that we get the worst of all possible worlds with a mixum gatherum approach of neither one nor the other. We are supposed to be a private enterprise economy.</P>
    <P>If the Government have such a percentage of gross national output taken up in debt, taxation etc., that makes some of the Communist countries look like free enterprise havens.  We are nominally a free enterprise country, but in fact we are not and we have gone the other way and I outlined the reason for that earlier.  We must do something about it, and the role of Government is to allow free enterprise to work as well as possible but with a caring social system and within our means.  That is the way Irish people would prefer to have the State and successive Governments have tried to achieve it, but we have got the thing on its head and we must redress it.  Instead of the Government talking about redistributing wealth and taxation the job here is to create wealth.  I will not be vulgar; 50 per cent of nothing is still nothing.  There is another way of saying it and it adds up to the same thing.  You must create wealth before you start to redistribute it. Government is about getting people into the frame of mind that they are going to achieve that, they are going to work harder for a reasonable reward and the Government are there to regulate things so that no section of society suffers.  That is the way it should be.  We should create wealth, not fight about how to give it away.  There is nothing in this budget or in the programme <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> about how to create more wealth and put more people in employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2243" />
      <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> basically is a cash flow forecast.  It is not a plan of any kind.  In the fifties and sixties we had programmes for economic expansion and the creation of this wealth.  This document is about how we are going to spend it, not about how we are going to create it.  It can be likened in accountancy terms to a cash flow programme.  There are advantages in having cash flow forecasts as a key to targets etc., but the cash flow of any business is irrelevant unless the firm produces the goods, sales, etc.  The sales and wealth must be created before the cash flow forecast is produced.  If you are not producing wealth then spending targets are irrelevant.  Therefore that document is not an economic plan: it is a document with a few vague aspirations which are totally out of date, a few lines here and there, about this that and the other and with no economic plan.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about some of the budgetary measures in the Minister's statement.  I have read all kinds of budget speeches down through the years and farming used at least get a mention in the context of increasing production etc.  The only mention in this Budget Statement regarding farming is a few lines about the land tax telling us what we all knew a year and a half ago, that despite all the hullaballoo it will not be operational in 1986.  That was no mystery to anyone who knew anything about it a year and a half ago.  The president of the IFA and anyone who knew anything about it said that it would not be operated in 1986 anyway.  Without going into a long speech, I must declare an interest before I say more in that I happen to be in the accounting profession, and I would like the Minister to tell us what is to happen regarding farm taxation in 1986-87.  Since 1983-84 all farmers are supposedly in the tax net but at that time only farmers with £40 valuation or over were concerned.  Since that budget all farmers are to be in the tax net but only a small percentage of them have been assessed because of a strike in the Revenue Commissioners.  Yet all the time we hear of farmers not paying their <Col N="2244" /> tax.  What will happen in 1986-87?  Are those people now to be brought into the tax net or just left out there?  Furthermore, I believe that the income tax collected from farmers in the tax year 1986-87 will be less than last year.  Farmers pay tax on the basis of the previous year, so they will be paying on their profits for 1985.  Since 1985 was such a poor year for a large number of farmers, particularly the grain producers, the tax yield in 1986-87 will be quite small.</P>
    <P>Regarding the tax amnesty, I ask the Minister when he brings in the Finance Bill to make it a real tax amnesty.  We have tried previously to give the idea of an amnesty which really was not an amnesty at all.  I ask the Minister to give a real tax amnesty allowing people to pay, say, 40 per cent of undisclosed income, bring it back, put it into the system and deal with it in that way.  The amnesty in 1976 did not work.  It brought in just a few people.  The amnesty in the sixties was similar and if the proposed amnesty is the same then it will not work either.</P>
    <P>Regarding retention tax, old people particularly who would have no tax liability under the present system will now have to suffer tax at 35 per cent which they will not get back.  There are positive aspects to the retention tax proposals in the Budget Statement, but it should be possible to bring in some amendment to the Finance Bill to allow people to claim back tax, particularly people who would not be liable in the first place.  A number of charities within the State have put large amounts of money on deposit in order to utilise it to the best advantage of their society and they will be hit by this.  I ask the Minister to try to devise some amendment which will solve that problem.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that retention tax will result in the collection of a great deal of money from banks and other institutions. It is not a tax on the banks at all. It is income tax on the savers.  It is an illusion.  It will take income tax from people who are receiving interest on deposits and it is bringing back income tax that will be collected in future years because of the way the income tax system <Col N="2245" /> works.  Therefore, it is bringing income tax that would be collected in 1987-88 back into 1986 and it will have a distorting effect on future budget calculations.  It has positive aspects.  Many people will go along with it particularly in regard to nondisclosure. However, some amendment should be introduced so that people who would not have a tax liability and now have to pay this 35 per cent may be relieved of this.</P>
    <P>The tax on life assurance policies represents another myth that has been created presumably to give the impression that we are taking tax from the big institutions, life assurance companies, banks etc.  This is a tax on people who save in those companies.  It will not come out of the profits of life assurance companies; it will come out of the dividend or return that they pay to people with policies.  Be they bonds or ordinary life saver policies, it will come out of the return made to them.  Therefore, we are fooling ourselves or trying to create the impression that we are tackling the big institutions.  We are not tackling any institutions.  This is more income tax out of the pockets of the individual saver or depositor with the banks.  That myth must be exploded.</P>
    <P>Regarding the tax allowances in this budget, the Minister would have been nearly as honest to give no tax allowances at all rather than the miserable ones he has given here.  Let me point out that a married man with a family, with the abolition of the tax free child allowance, will have a smaller allowance now when he goes to work.  This will be made up in the children's allowance which will be paid to the wife, but the net effect to a person having one child is that one makes £1 in a whole year.  That is absolutely ridiculous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to rescind their decision to close St. Dympna's Hospital, Carlow, Castlerea Mental Hospital, Roscrea District Hospital, Killarney Isolation Hospital and St. Patrick's Infant Hospital, Blackrock, Dublin and not to proceed with the proposed closure of Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, Dublin, and the Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, Cork, until full consultation has been held with the appropriate health boards on all aspects of these closures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have tabled this motion because of our concern at the lack of sensitivity on the part of the Government in bringing about the closure of these hospitals in the current year of 1986.  We in Fianna Fáil believe that there is need for economies in the health services and it is fair to say that our members on the health boards have been very responsible in the manner in which they have behaved over the past three years.  Despite a shortage in allocations from the Government, the health boards, including our members, have acted responsibly in dealing with the health services as best they could with the reduced allocations.  It should not have been necessary for a Government to <Col N="2247" /> make such a decision as this over the heads of the health boards.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Government must be a matter of concern to everybody who is interested in the care of patients.  In fairness to the Minister, he has gone out front and tried to defend the indefensible, although he made it very cleat to us in the House on 30 January last that it was a Government decision.  In that statement the Minister said that the hospitals due for closure included the list of eight hospitals referred to.  That would suggest that there are other hospitals due for closure and that he named only eight on that occasion.  I ask the Minister, if there are other hospitals due to close, what hospitals are they and has he consulted with the authorities responsible for their day-to-day administration?</P>
    <P>The decision to close down the two psychiatric hospitals was a most extraordinary one.  In effect, in less than six months the Minister would be throwing out into the community 600 patients from St. Dympna's in Carlow and St. Patrick's in Castlerea, or transferring them to other psychiatric hospitals in the area. He must know it is impossible in a period of six months to prepare these patients for this change.  Many of them have been in these hospitals for 20 to 25 years.  Many of the other hospitals are very old and would not be able to accommodate extra patients.  While the population in these hospitals has reduced over the past 20 years, this decision to transfer patients would cause overcrowding.  For many of the patients the hospitals threatened with closure are their homes.  These patients have become institutionalised and it would be entirely wrong to send them to other hospitals without any preparation. Equally, it would be wrong to send them out into the community.  What alternative arrangements has the Minister made, or what arrangements does he hope to make in the community before the end of June when he intends to close these two hospitals?</P>
    <P>This night week in reply to the debate on the Adjournment in relation to <Col N="2248" /> Castlerea hospital the Minister of State had this to say:</P>
    <P>The Minister announced his decision last Thursday so that action could be taken to implement this decision in a controlled way.  He has provided funding for the hospital for at least six months to enable alternative arrangements be made.</P>
    <P>From that statement it is obvious that the Minister intends these two hospitals to close down by the end of June.  With regard to the phrase &ldquo;in a controlled way&rdquo; the announcement of the decision has caused panic throughout the health services.  What alternative arrangements have been or can be made in such a short time?  Each of the health boards studied the document <i>The Psychiatric Services &mdash; Planning for the Future</i>.  I understand most submitted recommendations to the Minister.  None recommended that any psychiatric hospital should be closed immediately.  Indeed, in relation to Castlerea hospital, the Minister and the Minister of State told us that the unit for mentally handicapped would be opening in Swinford, but that will take only 30 patients from Castlerea, leaving over 200 still in need of placement.</P>
    <P>Before any patients can be discharged, there is a need to build up the community services, the day care facilities and have hospitals and acute units in general hospitals available.  There is need for more nurses and community psychiatric nursing. Above all, there is a need for rehabilitation and preparation of the patients. This is all about patient care which must be the priority of all of us in this House. I should like to ask the Minister to explain what the position will be in regard to staff at the end of the six months.</P>
    <P>We all support the recommendations in the document, <i>Psychiatric Services: Planning for the Future</i> but I deplore members of the Government using that report to justify their actions because nowhere is it stated in it that any hospital should be closed down immediately or within the next six months as the Government intend doing.  The Minister, and the Minister of State, said the report suggests <Col N="2249" /> that the programme should be implemented immediately.  It is recommended in the report that the programme should go on for ten to 15 years in five year phases.  The Government have decided to start at the back page and to justify their actions on the basis of the report is grossly unfair.  The report states:</P>
    <P>... there will still be small group who despite active treatment and rehabilitation, will need long-term in-patient care.</P>
    <P>We all accept that statement and it will not be possible to give all the people who will be coming out of hospital the necessary rehabilitation.  The report also states:</P>
    <P>Well developed community services are a prerequisite to achieving a decline in the hospital population.</P>
    <P>The report went on to state:</P>
    <P>We can learn from mistakes made in other countries.  It has been argued that patients were discharged too soon, inadequately prepared, had nothing to do during the day and became inactive and isolated... adequate support services and day care facilities were not available.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the position in Italy and the US.  In Italy they introduced a law not to allow any further patients into psychiatric hospitals, particularly new patients.  Many patients were let out among the community without proper facilities for them.  Those patients lived rough and as dropouts without any service for them.  The report also states:</P>
    <P>We recognise it will not be possible to rehabilitate all patients for independent living in the community.  We consider that patients who cannot be rehabilitated to this extent should be allowed to spend their remaining years in the hospital where they now live.</P>
    <P>Despite that statement the Minister, and the Minister of State, said that they were acting in accordance with the report.  The Government are in total conflict with it. Worse still they have used the names of <Col N="2250" /> eminent people to back up their actions. They used the name of the CEO of the South Eastern Health Board.  Mr. Peter McQuillan, and I can guarantee the House that that official supports what is in the report and not what the Minister said on television or radio.</P>

      <P>I will not name names but I deplore the fact that the names of some of the people who helped to compile this excellent report are being used to justify something that is not in the report.</P>
      <P>The report also states:</P>
      <P>Each health board should draw up an outline plan for the psychiatric service. This should include targets and objectives to be reached in ten to 15 years time, perhaps in five year phases. Nothing could be clearer than that, but some people are prepared to use that report to justify actions that are totally in conflict with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This valuable report, which we should <Col N="2251" /> all support, has been brought into disrepute by the Minister, and the Minister of State.  Their statements in regard to it must be damaging to the long term prospects for the future development of the psychiatric services.  Those statements have cast doubt on the credibility of the report.  It was unfortunate that RTE allowed the Minister time on his own on <i>Today Tonight</i> and on John Bowman's programme, <i>Day by Day</i> without having somebody opposite him to put the alternative view.  Had such a person been present the integrity of the report would have been defended.</P>
    <P>How much thought went into the needs and care of patients when the decision was made to axe the district hospital in Roscrea?  If we are committed to the transfer of resources from hospital care to community care, as all parties say they are, surely it is an integral part of community care to keep a small district hospital in a town like Roscrea that does not have any other facilities.  Such a hospital could be used for elderly patients, people who are living alone and suffer a coronary or develop pneumonia.  If we have a facility we should keep it so that such people can be treated by their own family doctor. That would be more economic than sending such patients to Limerick hospital which would cost four times as much.  It is important to keep patients within their own environment.  That must be a priority with all of us.  How much thought went into the decision in regard to Killarney Hospital?</P>
    <P>With regard to St. Patrick's Hospital, Temple Hill, the first notice officials got of the decision to close that was on the morning the Minister made the announcement in the House.  That voluntary hospital gave an excellent service for many years.  While the bed capacity there has decreased, there have been 45 infants at the hospital for some weeks in 1986. That hospital is also a training school for nursery nurses.  The present course is 18 months short of completion so I wonder whether the Minister has made any arrangements for the people concerned to continue their training.  When the <Col N="2252" /> children Bill is enacted it will be necessary to have more nursery nurses.  Has any thought been given to where these extra nurses will be trained?</P>
    <P>I question whether the Minister and the Government have the power to close a voluntary hospital.  They can withdraw funds from such a hospital but the matter of closure is questionable.  If the announcement of the closures is any indication of what we may expect when the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill is going through the House some of the Minister's colleagues on the backbenches may not support that measure because it is designed to empower him to close anything without reference to anyone.  That Bill should have a stormy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall confine my contribution to the proposed closure of Killarney Isolation Hospital.  This hospital which was built in 1939 has 44 beds of which 32 are occupied at present.  It is very difficult to understand the thinking behind this proposal.  There would be more patients in this hospital were it not for the concern and co-operation on the part of the medical and nursing staff and the officials of the Southern Health Board in the matter of cutbacks in the health services.  Another important element in this context is that the cost of maintaining a patient at Killarney Isolation Hospital is only £33 per day whereas the corresponding figure is £120 in the Tralee Regional Hospital.  Therefore, the cost of maintaining the 32 patients in Killarney Isolation Hospital amounts to £385,000 per annum.  A 100 per cent occupancy of the hospital would involve a cost of less than £500,000 so we can hardly be expected to understand the reasoning for the proposed closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The medical, nursing and non nursing staff at the hospital are second to none. This is a well run hospital.  It is considered to be one of the best in Kerry.  Patients from all over the country are admitted to the hospital.  We must have regard also to the fact that there is no hospital in Killorglin and that in respect of Killarney we are talking of a catchment area of <Col N="2253" /> about 60,000 people in terms of consideration of hospital beds.  Killarney Isolation Hospital is fundamental to the whole operation of the health services in Kerry. There is also the consideration that the hospital is <i>de facto</i> a geriatric hospital.  In the years since its establishment as an isolation hospital it has become slowly a hospital catering mainly for geriatrics as well as for people who require monitoring because of certain illnesses.</P>
    <P>Nearby is St. Columbanus's Home, an institution for the elderly and for which there is a waiting list of 150 people.  This figure is made up of 80 men and 70 women and of those cases 49 are certified as being in need of being admitted urgently to a geriatric hospital.  Despite these circumstances the Minister proposes to close the isolation hospital which is an adjunct to the district hospital and St. Columbanus's Home.</P>
    <P>It appears that the Minister failed to use his influence to have the Southern Health Board agree to close the top ward in St. Columbanus's Home, an operation that would have reduced the bed capacity there by 48.  It would appear that his viciousness is being brought to bear on the health board and on the people of the whole south Kerry area by way of insisting that the isolation hospital be closed.  This is a disgraceful step.  The proposal should never have been mooted.  We must bear in mind also that if this hospital is closed there will be pressure on the district hospitals throughout the county because the isolation hospital caters for the county as a whole. These are the hospitals at Cahirciveen, Dingle and Listowel.  Did the Minister take this factor into account when making his decision?</P>
    <P>On Friday last the Kerry Health Committee passed a unanimous decision that the Killarney Isolation Hospital should be maintained.  This health committee are broadly based and comprise eminent doctors and shrewd business people and also prominent members of Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna Fáil.  It is difficult to understand why the Minister is going against the wishes of that local committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2254" /> Whether the decision has been taken by the Minister or by the Government, it is very bad and the Minister is not remotely apologetic about it.  On 30 January, as reported at column 1258 of the Official Report, he said:</P>
    <P>I hope that my party will not drift in that direction.  We have not drifted and we have no apology to offer for this approach.</P>
    <P>That represents a ruthless and uncaring attitude on the part of the Minister.  It is something that the people in south Kerry will not forget for a long time.</P>
    <P>As reported at column 1334 of the Official Report for the same day, the Minister said that:</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that the first stage will involve the closure, scaling down or phasing out in 1986 of certain facilities which are demonstrably superfluous in the context of a rational, cost effective and integrated hospital system.</P>
    <P>He included Killarney Isolation Hospital in the list of proposed closures.  While I would not consider the continuance of a hospital in terms of the job content, we must bear in mind that there are 24 jobs at stake at the hospital and that the cost to the IDA of creating that number of jobs would be in the region of £500,000 at a minimum.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to understand, too, why the Minister of State who is in charge of tourism was not informed by the Government about the decision to close Killarney Isolation Hospital.  The Minister of State lives within a few hundred yards of that hospital.  It appears to the people of south Kerry that the Minister is inconsiderate, uncaring and has no regard for the weak and less well off sections of the community in Kerry. There are some doubts as to whether the decision is a Government one, but if it was, the Minister's influence within the Cabinet must be minimal.  I appeal to him to change his decision and to get agreement from the Government to keep open Killarney Isolation Hospital.  In this way the Minister will be ending the utter <Col N="2255" /> chaos and consternation that surround this question now.</P>

      <P>I speak in support of the Fianna Fáil motion calling on the Government to rescind the decision announced by the Minister for Health regarding the closure of hospitals, with special emphasis on St. Patrick's Psychiatric Hospital, Castlerea, which is in my constituency.  The announcement by the Minister on 30 January 1986 during the budget debate was a cold, callous and uncaring act against the most vulnerable people in our society.  I refer to 250 patients in the case of Castlerea who are without a vote or a voice and, in many cases, without a relation in the world.  It is my responsibility and that of my party to speak on behalf of those people, to call on the Minister and the Government to reverse this heartless decision by the hatchetman of this Coalition Government. The announcement was made without prior consultation with the health board or the staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to him in future as the Minister but it does not change my position as far as he is concerned.  The closure announcement was made without prior consultation.  It was conveyed to the <Col N="2256" /> majority of patients and staff by RTE radio and television.  Panic and anxiety were immediately apparent among the patients, and naturally the staff.  In his statement, the Minister conveyed the impression that resources are being provided to assist in the development of services which have a high priority, and in the Western Health Board area the Minister said funds are being provided to open a new complex for the mentally handicapped at Swinford, Country Mayo.</P>
      <P>No such provision is being made, and the reallocation of £1.9 million from St. Patrick's Hospital to Swinford will not provide community psychiatric services for the 250 patients and 700 out-patients in County Roscommon.  Where will the 1,521 people who attended out-patients clinics in 1984 be catered for in County Roscommon?  In that county, hostels have not been provided to cater for patients: only six places in Loughglynn, with day centres in Roscommon, Boyle, Ballaghaderren and Strokestown, are to be available and no provision has been made for the 106 patients of over 65 years of age and the 55 patients in the Castlerea hospital who are between 30 and 65 years of age.</P>
      <P>I appeal for support from all sides of the House and I call on the Taoiseach, in the light of the seriousness of the situation and the callous manner in which this announcement was made, immediately to remove Deputy Desmond from the post of Minister for Health.  The Minister relied totally for support for his statement on <i>Planning for the Future</i> in regard to psychiatric services.  I suggest that the Minister read chapter 3.2 of that document, where he will find the following:</P>
      <P>The general policy of the development of community care to replace an exclusive programme of hospital care was acknowledged in a World Health Organisation (W.H.O.) report entitled &ldquo;Changing Patterns of Mental Health Care&rdquo; where the following recommendation was made:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The running down of existing mental hospitals should be phased so as to overlap with the building up <Col N="2257" /> of community-based services.  In no case should the chronically ill or handicapped person be discharged from hospital until or unless adequate supporting services are provided in the community.</P>
    <P>No such provision has been made for the patients in the Castlerea hospital, and no provision has been made in any other institution in County Roscommon.  The welfare homes are over-crowded.  On checking at the Sacred Heart Home in Roscommon today I found they have no room for additional patients.  No provision has been made for the development of community services which the Minister said will be provided.  The Minister's estimate in this respect should be given to the House because it will take years of detailed planning and development of services in County Roscommon to cater for the 250 patients and 700 out-patients of this hospital.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the decision by the Government was ill-considered, because there cannot be a continuation of the psychiatric services in County Roscommon which would cater for a population of 54,000 people.  I call on the Minister to reverse this decision as quickly as possible. He now has an opportunity to enter into meaningful discussions with the health board and all concerned.  The Minister has created great difficulty for the staff in Castlerea, many of whom have been there for many years, many of them living in Castlerea.  The Minister obviously has no concern for their welfare or their future.  He has no concern for the development of the Castlerea hinterland. I will not refer to the economic situation there, but the closure has serious economic implications for the town and the entire county.</P>
    <P>I will relate my remarks to the action committee in Castlerea, to the community council there and to Roscommon County Council, the local health committee, the Western Health Board and everyone who will be seriously affected by the closure.  The 250 jobs in the hospital are not taken up totally with nursing. There are 164 nurses, three psychiatrists, <Col N="2258" /> three junior psychiatrists and eight people employed as administrators, domestics and tradesmen serving this very important institution.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to retain this hospital in Castlerea as a centre of psychiatric services in County Roscommon to provide all the facilities necessary for people who will require such services. Those patients cannot be moved from the institution.  What the Minister will be performing in this case will be a form of official euthanasia, because the patients there will die if they are moved from the security of the hospital.  That is a serious and grave decision for the Minister to make, or for the Government.  It would not surprise me if that will be the least of the Minister's concerns, the least of his cares.  It will be heart-rending&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am expressing deep concern that people are being sent out of this hospital without prior notice, without a proper programme of pre-education. They will suffer.  I know this to be true. In 1948 when this hospital was used as a TB sanitorium, the position was known and was stated by a nurse who spoke of the heart-rending scenes.  He said that he wished never to see such heart-rending scenes again.  Many who left at that stage never returned to St. Patrick's Hospital in Castlerea.  That is how serious this issue is and why we have to highlight it in the House and why I appeal to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Reports were submitted to the Department, one from the Western Health Board on 26 January 1986 which was not sanctioned by the Western Health Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes that following the announcements of the Government decision in Dáil Éireann on 29th and 30th January last, the Minister for Health has commenced the process of consultation with the authorities of St. Dympna's <Col N="2260" /> Hospital, Carlow, St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea, the District Hospital, Roscrea, the Isolation Hospital, Killarney, Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, Dublin, the Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, Cork, and St. Patrick's Infant Hospital, Blackrock, to give effect to the policy decisions relating to these hospitals and further notes the assurances given by the Minister that the best interests of the patients and the rights of the staff in these hospitals will be fully taken account of in the implementation of these essential measures to develop and improve the delivery of the health services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wish to report major progress in the development of our hospital services. Since 1983 I have approved capital schemes amounting to over £200 million. These include new general hospitals or major new extensions to general hospitals at Cavan, Castlebar, Mullingar, Galway Regional Maternity, Portiuncula, Ballinasloe and Tralee; and in Dublin at St. James's and The Mater Hospital.</P>
    <P>In addition significant developments have been completed or approved at Ennis, Croom, Tullamore, Cork Regional &mdash; cardiac unit, Victoria/South Infirmary Hospitals, Cork, Limerick Regional &mdash; dialysis unit, Barringtons and St. John's Hospitals, Limerick, Ardkeen and Kilkenny; and in Dublin at St. Michael's Dún Laoghaire, Rotunda, Cappagh, Harcourt Street Children's Hospital, and The Meath.</P>
    <P>At geriatric hospital level major new schemes have been completed or commenced at Carlow, Dundalk, Ballymote, Longford and The Royal Hospital, Donnybrook.</P>
    <P>While significant improvement and upgrading schemes have been completed or are in progress at St. Mary's, Mullingar, Listowel and Raheen; and in Dublin at: Brú Caoimhín, St. Mary's and Leopardstown Park.</P>
    <P>On the psychiatric services side the following units have been or are being built St. Luke's Hospital, Clonmel and acute psychiatric units at Beaumont and <Col N="2261" /> Tralee: and a new psychiatric day hospital at Elm Park, Dublin.</P>
    <P>In addition, by the end of 1986 I will have spent £10 million on improvement schemes in district psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>In the mental handicap area we now have new centres at Cheeverstown, County Dublin, Swinford, County Mayo and Belcamp, County Dublin.</P>
    <P>Improved residential facilities and expanded community services have been provided in Drumcar, County Louth, Cootehill, Limerick, Galway, Cork, Waterford, and Dublin city and county.</P>
    <P>In addition many minor improvement schemes are being undertaken in mental handicap centres throughout the country.</P>
    <P>On the physically handicapped side there are major schemes at various stages at St. Mary's School for the Deaf, Cabra, National Blind Centre, Rathmines, Central Remedial Clinic, Barrett Cheshire Home, Cheshire Home, Monkstown, St. Joseph's School for the Deaf, Cabra, St. Mary's School for the Blind, Merrion, Open Door Day Activity Centre for Physically Handicapped at Bray, Crisis Intervention Centre for Multiple Sclerosis Society at Longford, Residential Facilities-Resource Centre for Physically Handicapped at Sligo and St. Laurence's Cheshire Home, Glanmire.</P>
    <P>In addition to this long list of developments through the period of office when I devoted myself unceasingly to this work, we have now coming on stream major developments at Wexford, Ardkeen, Drogheda, Sligo, Naas, Nenagh, Galway, Limerick and Navan; and in Dublin at St. Vincent's, Blanchardstown, St. Colmcille's, Tallaght, Temple Street and Cappagh.</P>
    <P>This list gives the lie to spurious political and vested interest propaganda that the health services are being run down. This year the health budget is £1,276 million current and £58 million capital and 58,000 employees.  Of this budget some £200 million will be spent on our psychiatric services.  In my period of office over £220 million has been allocated to the health capital programme on my recommendation.  I have no apology whatsoever to make to any Deputy from <Col N="2262" /> any constituency for this outstanding allocation of social resource expenditure to our health services in times of grave recession and Exchequer constraints.</P>
    <P>I have no apology to make to this House when, in the best interests of patients and hospital re-organisation, I have closed down hospitals such as Mercers and St. Ultan's Hospitals in Dublin.  Likewise, I have closed Trim maternity and Longford county hospitals with the co-operation of the North-Eastern and Midland Health Boards respectively.</P>
    <P>These closures are part of the overall overdue rationalisation of the hospital services in Dublin, Cork city and in many other areas of the country such as the Midlands, which have proved a model of co-operation in their long awaited development of effective hospital services. Indeed, the rationalisation of hospital services which I now propose provides another example of how the freeing of resources would permit of a necessary development.  I refer to the proposed geriatric assessment unit at Ardkeen hospital and the CAT scanner at the Regional Hospital Galway largely overlooked in much of the criticism of my proposed rationalisation.</P>
    <P>I come now to the closures in the hospital area and I will deal with the psychiatric hospitals later.  They are Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, Dublin, St. Patrick's Infant Hospital, Blackrock, Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, Cork, Killarney Isolation Hospital and Roscrea District Hospital.</P>
    <P>May I first deal with the closure of the above five hospitals?  Sir Patrick Dun's was originally earmarked for closure on completion of Phase 1c of St. James's Hospital in 1989 and services have run down recently with an average occupancy rate of only two-thirds of the hospital's capacity in 1984.  The major medical specialty at present being provided at the hospital, i.e. gastroenterology, can be incorporated into St. James's immediately, and it is not expected that the closure of the other specialties will create any major problems for the other acute hospitals in south Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2263" /> St. Patrick's Infant Hospital in my constituency functions as a home for the infants of unmarried mothers until they are either adopted or their mothers decide to keep them.  The number of children for adoption has declined considerably and many unmarried mothers retain their children.  Of the 90 beds in St. Patrick's only 40 are in use.  Given the low occupancy rate for this hospital and the fact that these children can be placed with foster parents or in Eastern Health Board facilities, this hospital is being closed.</P>
    <P>The services now being provided by the Cork Eye and Ear Hospital are being transferred to the Cork Regional Hospital and to the Victoria-South Infirmary Hospitals.  This in line with our policy that specialist services should, where possible, be located on a general hospital campus.  The re-organisation will be to the benefit of everybody in Cork.  I have met no Deputy or member of the Cork Voluntary Hospitals Board who is opposed to this decision.</P>
    <P>Killarney Isolation Hospital has 44 beds but in recent years the use of these beds for isolation purposes has been declining.  This hospital is, in fact, the last GP staffed isolation hospital in this country.  It has a low occupancy and has been increasingly used for geriatric purposes. I have no doubt but that the closure of this hospital for isolation purposes is the correct decision particularly in view of the fact that isolation beds are provided at the new Tralee General Hospital. If there are any problems in that regard it should be remembered that 110 beds are to be opened in the hospital in Tralee.</P>
    <P>Roscrea District Hospital is a very old hospital and in an extremely poor state of repair.  In view of this and aware that there is an adequate number of long stay beds in north Tipperary the decision to close is justified.</P>
    <P>With regard to psychiatric hospitals, there is no major problem and the Deputies should calm down.  I have given my reason for closing some units and I am sure that Deputy O'Hanlon shares my <Col N="2264" /> concern in that regard.  An expert group was appointed by my predecessor, Deputy Eileen Desmond, in 1981 with the task of, among other things, drawing up planning guidelines for the future development of the psychiatric services. This group included four experienced officers of the Department of Health, including the Department's inspector of mental hospitals as well as a clinical director in child psychiatry, a professor of psychiatry, a chief psychiatrist, two other consultant psychiatrists, a chief nursing officer and the chief executive officer of a health board.  The main thrust of their conclusions, published in December 1984 was that &ldquo;the psychiatric needs of a community should be met by a comprehensive and integrated service made up of a number of treatment components and largely located in the community&rdquo;.  The group also stated that &ldquo;in particular, there must be a decided shift in the pattern of care from an institutional to a community setting with close links between psychiatry and other community services&rdquo;.  Finally, the group called for the implementation of this programme in all parts of the country without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not to close hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am implementing this policy.  I would stress that I am doing so not only as a matter of adamant personal conviction but also as part of a collective Government decision.</P>
      <P>It is in this framework that the closure of St. Dympna's Hospital in Carlow and St. Patrick's Hospital in Castlerea must be considered.  In relation to St. Dympna's I would point out that the chief executive officer of the South-Eastern Health Board was a member of the group which drew up this report.  This hospital, which was established to provide services in the Carlow and south Kildare catchment area, is one of five psychiatric hospitals in the South-Eastern Health Board area.  It has the largest numbers of psychiatric hospitals in any single health board area.  In addition, there are associated acute psychiatric units in Ardkeen and in Clonmel general hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2265" /> The Carlow hospital is a 19th century building and has not been a pioneer in the development of psychiatric services in recent years.  In fact, the patient population which has dropped from 398 in 1965 to 318 in 1975, increased to 392 in 1982 and now stands at about 340 in-patients. There have been some adverse reports at health board level and adverse publicity for its services in recent years. The hospital has become overcrowded as liberal admission and slow discharge policies were the norm.  The level of facilities for patient comfort are bleak and the rehabilitation of patients not adequate.</P>
    <P>In this situation it is necessary to take some action.  I am certain that the closure of the hospital will lead to a better treatment model and lifestyle for most of the 340 patients accommodated there and will, moreover, permit of the provision of better services to those patients from the catchment area of the hospital who will require psychiatric services in the future.</P>
    <P>The closure of this hospital will also facilitate the opening of the geriatric assessment unit at Ardkeen Hospital, Waterford, a much needed facility in the South-Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    <P>As evidence of my commitment to provide proper facilities when and where they are medically justifiable, I am providing over £4 million in capital funds for a new purpose-built 100 bed geriatric unit in Carlow to replace the existing substandard accommodation in the Sacred Heart Hospital in Carlow.  This accommodation is now being constructed.</P>
    <P>In St. Dympna's as of September 1985 there were four medical staff, 133 nursing and allied, four paramedical, 37 catering and housekeeping, 18 maintenance, 11 clerical-administrative and six other grades, total of 213 staff plus 33 locums. The 1985 budget was £3.7 million of which £2.8 million was pay.  The staff of St. Dympna's Hospital will, as far as possible, be redeployed to positions in Carlow and its environs in which they will be providing a service which is more relevant to the needs of psychiatric patients and to their specialised skills.  These <Col N="2266" /> persons, while providing a better psychiatric service, will continue to generate employment and income in the area.  As I said, I give employment on behalf of the State to 58,000 people throughout the health services and their interests are always fully taken into account whenever any necessary policy changes are being made.</P>
    <P>I must, however, be primarily concerned for the welfare of the patients. The prospect of change frightens many people but especially those whose livelihood revolves around the hospital.  The type of care most appropriate to patient needs has now been set out in the report and it is my job to ensure that these services are made available even where local interests find this new service very difficult to adjust to after all these years.</P>
    <P>However, change there must be &mdash; it is long overdue &mdash; and discussions commenced last week between senior officers of my Department and officers of the Eastern and South-Eastern Health Boards to make adequate arrangements for the closure.  Last December the in-patients of the hospital were assessed by a consultant psychiatrist employed by the health board in order to decide their suitability for placement in community or other services.  That initial assessment showed that, of a total of 344 patients in the hospital at that time 70 had potential for rehabilitation to the community and 88 were mentally handicapped.  These two categories alone account for nearly half the patients in the hospital and gave an indication of the potential there is now for transferring patients to the community or for placing them in more suitable accommodation.</P>
    <P>The kinds of alternative services which will be considered on a joint basis by my Department and the health board are: development of day care facilities in the community; provision of residences for persons who, after a period of preparation, are capable of living reasonably normal lives in the community; provision of supervised hostels for persons who need more regular attention; transfer of mentally handicapped persons to the mental handicap service.  I am utterly <Col N="2267" /> opposed to such persons spending the rest of their days in any psychiatric hospital. They should never have been admitted in the first instance and now that we have an alternative framework no more will be admitted.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board will in future be involved in making arrangement for psychiatric services for the Kildare area and I am not alone in coming to this conclusion.  The two reports were adopted by the South-Eastern Health Board.  One report stated that the Kilkenny unit will be planned to provide access to it by the Carlow catchment area and disengagement of the South-Eastern Health Board from provision of psychiatric services in County Kildare.  It went on to say that the inclusion of County Carlow in the Carlow-Kilkenny community catchment area was feasible.  County Kildare and County Tipperary (North Riding) are not included in this plan.  The report said that new purpose-built 50 bed psychiatric units would be required in Kilkenny to serve Carlow-Kilkenny and in Wexford to serve County Wexford. That is the plan and there is nothing unique about it.  Once the pressure comes they run like scalded cats away from it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board will in future be involved in making arrangements for psychiatric services for the Kildare area.  An acute psychiatric unit is included in the planned developments at Naas General Hospital.  It is now my intention, in so far as it does not conflict with the overall planning, that the psychiatric unit will be provided without delay as the first stage of the hospital development. The capital money required to enable this to be done will be available <Col N="2268" /> forthwith.  This will mean that in future no person from the Kildare catchment area &mdash; 74,000 of the total of 114,000 for the hospital, mostly Kildare &mdash; will be admitted into a psychiatric hospital unless he or she has been first fully assessed in this acute unit.</P>
    <P>This leaves the question of acute in-patients psychiatric services for County Carlow.  This county, which has a population of less than 40,000, would be adequately served by an acute psychiatric unit of about 20 beds.  I would propose that such a unit will be located in Carlow linked, as is proposed by the health board and endorsed in the working party report, to the acute psychiatric facility in Kilkenny. While I would be prepared to assist the South-Eastern Health Board with capital money to enable these various developments to take place, I also consider that the health board should release some at least of the capital money which is now at their disposal to the benefit of the service which they are providing, and I am sure Deputy Ormonde knows what I am talking about.</P>
    <P>St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea, was built in 1943, with separate male and female blocks, and was used until the late forties-early fifties as a TB sanatorium. The patient population has dropped steadily over the years from 414 in 1965 to 336 in 1975, down to 251 patients by the end of 1984, and 226 now in 1986.  In St. Patricks as of March 1985 there were eight medical, 162 nursing and allied, five paramedical, 51 catering and housekeeping, 24 maintenance, nine clerical and administrative, and nine other grades &mdash; a total of 268 staff plus five locums.  The 1985 budget was £4 million of which £3.3 million was pay.  The building itself is not suitable for good psychiatric care. Seventy-five per cent of the patients have been in the hospital for five years or more.</P>
    <P>In common with other hospitals, the entire in-patient population of Castlerea hospital was recently assessed in order to determine their future needs in line with the &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; recommendations. This assessment will form <Col N="2269" /> the basis for discussions between officers of my Department and those of the Western Health Board in order to determine the appropriate placement of the 226 patients involved, together with the future admission facilities to be made available for Roscommon, and the other facilities needed.  Thirty three of the patients are mentally handicapped and 73 are assessed as suitable for supervised and unsupervised hostels in St. Patricks.  I am aware that there are a number of in-patients who are in the hospital for social reasons rather than for psychiatric treatment.</P>
    <P>The types of services to be provided in local towns throughout Roscommon will include day centre and day hospital places; supervised and unsupervised hostels or domestic residences for patients who have no homes of their own for both psychiatric cases and mentally handicapped persons; and geriatric care, as 47 per cent of these patients are now over 65 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The closure of Castlerea hospital will also facilitate the opening of the new Mental Handicap Centre at Swinford which will have 190 residential places, and which was completed almost a year ago at a capital cost of £12 million.  In addition to the 33 mentally handicapped persons at Castlerea, there are about 220 mentally handicapped persons also between Castlebar and Ballinasloe psychiatric hospitals.  A psychiatric hospital is not a fitting environment in which to care for the mentally handicapped.  After years of shame, I hope the House will at least accept that statement.</P>
      <P>It is imperative that we bring on stream the centre at Swinford.  This will allow the transfer of some of the patients to a centre specifically designed and staffed for their care.  It will correspondingly reduce the psychiatric hospital patient numbers further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would emphatically point out to Deputies that my Department have <Col N="2270" /> received from the Western Health Board a draft report for the Roscommon catchment area concerning the future delivery of the psychiatric services in this area in accordance with the recommendations of &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This draft report in accepting the need for a much reduced hospital at Castlerea, proposed the provision of an acute psychiatric unit for Roscommon County Hospital.  I would very much like to pursue this proposal with this health board.  It is fully in accordance with my policy and that of the expert group, that nobody &mdash; I repeat nobody &mdash; should in future be admitted into a psychiatric hospital as a long stay patient without first being fully assessed in such a unit and that short term treatment be provided if necessary and prior to any long term admission being considered. Senior officers of my Department will examine this proposal in detail with the professional staff of the Western Health Board in the immediate future.  In fact, a meeting took place today between officers of my Department and the chief executive officer of the board and I look forward to a report of this meeting.</P>

      <P>As examples of the progress we can make I will mention certain hospitals such as St. Davnet's in Monaghan, St. Conal's in Letterkenny, St. Senan's in Enniscorthy and St. Bredan's and St. Loman's in Dublin.  I do not propose to let the recommendations of the recent report suffer the same fate of long delay.</P>
      <P>There are still 11,000 in-patients in our 22 health board psychiatric hospitals and there are 6,600 staff whose skills are vital and are appreciated but are not fully utilised. We must break the mould of long-stay residential and custodial treatment. Patients and staff must move out into the community.  Mental illness is part of all our lives and we must all share our lives with those who need our help.  I challenge this House to join with me in this historic effort to transform these services.  It will be a sad day in Irish public life&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said it would be a sad day in Irish life if the health boards concerned refused their co-operation. The fact is that in all of his actions he has not invited the co-operation of anyone.  He has behaved in a way that demonstrates to all, particularly the patients, their families and the doctors and nurses looking after them, that the only thing to be considered is his view. The Minister has taken the view that in his passing role as Minister for Health &mdash; and it is becoming more passing each day &mdash; what he decides is right for the patients, the nurses, doctors and all concerned.</P>
      <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be aware of the impact of this decision on the Roscrea District Hospital.  I will tell the House how the patients and staff of that hospital became aware of the impact of this decision on them.  The first indication they got was an announcement in a news bulletin on the day after the budget of what had been dramatically indicated here by this Minister.  Without any consultation with anyone, he decided to close the hospital.  There was no prior consultation or concern for the patients or staff. The sad day the Minister spoke about has arrived.  This Minister has a notion that he should teach the nation standards to which we must all adhere.  The reality is that he is the person who must learn the lessons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened in relation to the hospital in Roscrea is an example of many misstatements by the Minister to support his position.  He said the hospital was old and that is accurate.  He also commented that there is an adequate number of beds for geriatrics in the region but that is totally inaccurate.  I challenge him to present any facts on which he can base <Col N="2274" /> that remark.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle can bear out what I say from his own personal experience.  Even in the County Hospital in Nenagh or in the Hospital of the Assumption in Roscrea there is always pressure to find places.  When there is no room in the County Hospital in Nenagh &mdash; the beds are in the corridors, to the shame of the Minister &mdash; they are relieved to have accommodation in the geriatric unit in Roscrea.  Any Minister who can say there is adequate accommodation for such patients in the region is ignoring the reality.  In his statement the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I am aware that there is an adequate number of long-stay beds in North Tipperary. The decision to close is justified.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to state what survey has been carried out of geriatric needs in the region.  Is there even a consultant geriatrician?  The answer to both questions is that there has been no survey and there is no consultant geriatrician.  Yet this Minister has the gall to state that there is an adequate number of long-stay beds in North Tipperary and that the decision to close is justified.</P>
    <P>From listening to people who are much better informed than the Minister in his passing experience in this office, we can learn some points.  First, in a local community centre, as in the case of Roscrea, there is the sense of security for people in their own environment.  There can be many visits and contact with friends and relations.  That means so much to patients, the youngest of whom is 69 years. This has been demonstrated to be good medicine and good, effective and caring treatment.</P>
    <P>This Minister has the gall to talk about his outstanding allocation of social expenditure. The public will not so regard it. Even in economic terms, hospitals such as Roscrea are cheaper from the point of view of the State than having to move people to another part of the region to hospitals that will need extra accommodation.</P>
    <P>The community concerned should have <Col N="2275" /> been consulted through their representatives on the health board and the social agencies active in Roscrea.  In him omniscience the Minister has decided that the end will come in June but would it not have been more reasonable to consult with the various interests to see what can be done to ensure that there are places for patients after June?  What kind of autocratic dictatorship is it to say that the hospital will close and that we will find places afterwards?  The approach of the Minister has been quite offensive.  He walked into the House on the day after the budget and made the announcement and he has aggravated the felony tonight in the attitude he has adopted.</P>
    <P>The health boards, the community organisations and the nursing and medical personnel are anxious and ready to consult but they need time.  They cannot be told they have exactly two months to make up their minds.  The very least the Minister should have granted was adequate consultation.  On behalf of the people of the region I demand of the Minister that he rescind the decision. Then he should engage in consultations. If he does that, he will find that people are ready to consult with all and sundry, including this Minister for as long as he is there, with a view to providing even better facilities for our old people.  Is he suggesting that he has adequate advice and information in a region where he has refused to allow the appointment of a consultant geriatrician to the Mid-Western Health Board?</P>
    <P>What kind of arrogance is it that allows a Minister to come in here and say there is adequate accommodation when those of us who live in the area know that the opposite is true?  If the Minister visited either the Hospital of the Assumption in Thurles, or the corridors of Nenagh County Hospital, or the hospital here concerned, he would see that there is no such thing for these people.  Perhaps the next time before he announces his diktat he will ensure that he will get a more favourable response from the people. The anger I have expressed this evening is only a small measure of the anger I <Col N="2276" /> witnessed in Roscrea in response to the Minister's decision and the manner in which it was announced.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will have the humanity and humility to recognise that there is more to being a Minister than just pontificating, particularly for a Minister for Health.  It is time he started to engage in real consultation.  I am asking him for that reason to rescind this decision.  We are ready to consult, even during his short period of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>We are here tonight to discuss the high-handed action of the Minister in his budget speech when he announced his intention to close eight hospitals without any consultation with the health boards concerned and without any consideration for either patients or staff.  The suddenness and insensitivity of the announcement amounted in the words of one hospital administrator to a &ldquo;shocking performance&rdquo;.  Imagine psychiatric patients finding out about the closure on radio and television.  Does the Minister have any idea what effect this must have had on these patients, many of whom have been in hospital for many years and regard the hospitals as their homes?  How callous and unfeeling of any Minister to subject such patients to such treatment.  The sledge-hammer mentality of this Minister is once again evident and he appears to invite confrontation and agitation with all his decisions.  All this is rather strange when one considers his own performance in Opposition when he opposed virtually every suggestion for cost-saving exercises by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Woods.</P>
      <P>Lest the Minister should get carried away with his own self-importance and his belief that he is all powerful, let me bring him back to reality and the Health Act, 1970.  We all know that he would like to change this Act and he has already promised to amend the legislation.  Until this Act is amended the law of the land is as I will outline.  Section 38 (3) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A health board may and, if directed by the Minister, shall discontinue the <Col N="2277" /> provision and maintenance of any premises provided and maintained by it under subsection (1).</P>
    <P>Section 38 (5) states:</P>
    <P>The Minister shall not give a direction under subsection (3) in relation to the discontinuance of the provision and maintenance of a hospital, sanitorium or home save after having caused a local inquiry to be held into the desirability of the discontinuance.</P>
    <P>The Minister is once again in breach of the law of the land and feels in his arrogance that he is above the law.  Until he changes the Act he is bound by it in the same way as everybody else.  Judging by the reactions of some of the Government backbenchers, I do not think it will be so easy to change that law.  Can the Minister see Deputy Liam Naughten supporting a change in the law that would close St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea?  Can he see Deputy Begley supporting an amendment which would lead to the closure of the Killarney Isolation Hospital?  I do not think so.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister intend to do to these patients?  Where does he intend the patients to go in the meantime?  While he mouthed pious platitudes about transferring the emphasis to the community, he reduced the overall budget to the various health boards.  The South Eastern Health Board will face a shortfall of £6 million this year since deficits from 1984 and 1985 will be the first charge in 1986.  As a result there will have to be a cut in the community care budget.  To suggest that the community can cope with these additional patients is utter rubbish.</P>
    <P>Any responsible politician will agree that there must be rationalisation of the health services and that the emphasis must be changed from hospital-based to community-based services.  I recently went on the record on this matter on radio.  This cannot be achieved overnight. The change of emphasis would require a massive injection of capital over a prolonged period.  Community-based facilities are at present totally inadequate.  The community and the hospital services will <Col N="2278" /> have to run parallel but the Minister is not prepared to provide the capital or spend the time to do that.</P>
    <P>The Minister claims his decision was based on the document <i>Psychiatric Services: Planning for the Future</i> but he appears to have read only the last page. The document contains 191 pages and a lot of good sense, but the plan was meant to be implemented over a long period, not overnight.  Let us look at some of the relevant sections in the document.  It is stated in section (7) on page 15 that there will be a small group who, despite active treatment and rehabilitation will still need long-term in-patient care.  It is stated on the following page that well developed community services are a prerequisite to achieving a decline in the hospital population.  It is recognised on page 46 that it will not be possible to rehabilitate all patients for independent living in the community but it is considered that patients who cannot be rehabilitated to this extent should be allowed to spend their remaining years in the hospital where they now live.  These are the things the document says.  It does not recommend that anything be closed down in six months.  The final statement in the document is that each health board should draw up an outline plan for the psychiatric services.  This should include targets and objectives to be reached in ten to 15 years' time, perhaps in five-year phases.  This is a far cry from six months.</P>
    <P>The Minister's treatment of Mr. Peter McQuillan, CEO of the South Eastern Health Board, on the <i>Today Tonight</i> programme last Wednesday was nothing short of despicable.  For any Minister to condemn or to castigate one of his own officials without giving him an opportunity to reply is nothing short of scandalous. Mr. McQuillan has given both his time and expertise for the benefit of the underprivileged and his reward was a castigation by the Minister on our national television station.  I suspect that these officials will be slow to assist the Minister and others in similar projects if this is the treatment they can expect.</P>
    <P>The Minister states in his amendment that he has commenced the process of <Col N="2279" /> consultation with the authorities of the various health boards.  Surely it is a case of closing the door after the horse has bolted.  Let us consider the situation in St. Dympna's, Carlow.  The net allocation to the South Eastern Health Board for 1986 announced following the budget was a figure of £85.55 million.  The net expenditure on St. Dympna's in 1985 was £3.47 million.  I would point out that St. Dympna's is the most economically run psychiatric hospital in the country.  In the 1986 allocation the Minister has withheld £1.835 million, being half of the allocation for St. Dympna's because the Minister intends to close it in June 1986.  Does that not make a mockery of the Minister's amendment in regard to consultation? All the consultation under the sun cannot change the fact that the Minister intends to close this hospital in June.  I see Deputy Kieran Crotty opposite.  Let him and his colleague, Deputy Dowling, support the amendment tomorrow night.</P>
    <P>There are 343 patients in Carlow, of whom 105 are open ward psychiatric patients who could be accommodated in the community if we had the necessary facilities. We cannot possibly have such facilities when we are faced with a shortfall of £6 million this year.  There are 38 mentally handicapped patients and we will all concede that they should never be in a psychiatric hospital but until we get the facilities we have nowhere else to put them.  Of the remaining patients, 73 are secure ward psychiatric patients who cannot be let out into the community because they would be a danger either to themselves or to the community.  What is to become of these?  There are 84 psychogeriatric patients who at this stage of their lives regard St. Dympna's as their home. What is to become of them on 1 July 1986, in six months' time?</P>
    <P>Let us look at the facts in relation to St. Dympna's.  As I have said, it is the most cost effective of all the psychiatric hospitals in the country.  The nursepatient ratio is the lowest in the country. In spite of the Minister's allegations on the radio recently, the staff at St. <Col N="2280" /> Dympna's have worked a comprehensive, integrated service since 1968.  They pioneered community nursing over the past 25 years and their hospital has been thoroughly integrated into the community life in Carlow.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wilson has sought and has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment of the House the question of Bailieboro Co-operative Society and the financial institutions and grant institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for providing me with this opportunity to raise this very important matter of the financing of Bailieboro Co-operative Society. Also I want to register my complaint that, despite the terms that I used when requesting this Adjournment Debate, that I wanted to make a request to the financial institutions, private and of the State, the Minister for Finance is not here, nor is the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  The Minister of State has been sent in.  I submit to you, Sir, that this is too important a matter for the economy of a large part of the country to be treated in that fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very savage blow to the area which I and many others in this House represent.  Bailieboro Co-operative Society headquarters are located in the county of Tom Finlay, a pioneering cooperator, and where Horace Plunkett and George Russell pioneered the work of the co-operative society.  For that reason it is an even more severe blow than it would be in other circumstances. What is wrong at the moment is that there is a cash flow crisis and all that area, which includes my county, part of County Monaghan, part of County Meath, County Louth, part of County Kildare, part of County Dublin and the whole of County Cavan east of a line from Cootehill to Granard, is affected by this <Col N="2281" /> crisis.  This co-operative society is a multifaceted one where the basic dairy industry is carrying on and where an engineering facility which has been profitable has been exporting to as far away as the Middle East.  It is the place that pioneered Emmets Cream which has been a profitable and very successful venture in the agri-business.  It is the place where Bailie Foods and Feta cheese were developed.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, there have been hiccups in that area, where the liquid milk industry was expanded and from which Owens Dairies come into Dublin.  There are retail sales in various towns in the area at several locations.  There was a project for mushrooms and their development with input into the small farming community.  In all there are about 5,000 members of this co-operative society and the basic strength of the co-operative has been the dairying industry.  The Bailieboro group employment directly is 650 people plus.  As well as that, the House will know that hundreds of people depend upon its activities and enterprise for a livelihood.  I leave it to the economists to calculate exactly the spin-off effect all these industries have in that area.  The suppliers are basic and important.  The spin-off is important and, of course, the whole board of the organisation are now very worried and perturbed.</P>
    <P>The enterprise is roughly in the £90 million per annum category and it has been raised to that by vision, commitment and hard work.  For that reason a special obligation lies on the Minister for Finance and on Fóir Teoranta to see to it that this organisation is kept viable and working.</P>
    <P>This Adjournment Debate is on a non-county and non-party basis.  We have Deputy O'Hanlon and Deputy Leonard here form my constituency.  Deputy Hilliard has asked me to express his concern. Deputy John Farrelly who is a member of the co-operative has also asked me to express his concern to the House.  I have mentioned Cavan, Meath, Louth, Westmeath, Kildare and Dublin, all areas involved in this.  The chief executive of that enterprise is a man called Mr. <Col N="2282" /> O'Brien.  He is a man of vision and drive and is highly responsible.  There is nothing gimmicky about him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be as well to leave names out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The chief executive of the Bailieboro group is a man of vision, enterprise and drive, with the basic philosophy which the original members of the co-operative movement had.  There have been criticisms of that movement to the effect that they lost the initial philosophy and drive, but in him was incorporated that basic drive to serve the community and to serve it well.</P>
      <P>I should like to call attention to the basic soundness of this society.  They have about 5,000 members altogether, I gather.  Those 5,000 members at £500 each could put up £2.5 million to help the co-operative over this hump, and the financial institutions should bear that in mind.  Some of the members would not be able to afford £1,000 but some would be able to afford more.  If you had £1,000 on average you would have £5 million available there to the society for their development, and that has not been kept in mind by the people who have been sitting in judgment on the operations of the co-operative over the past few days. I take this opportunity to call on the members of the co-operative to stand firm, coherent and united.  There is nothing they cannot do if they remain united and committed to the objective of preservation. They owe that not merely to themselves but to the whole community, which is a trans-county, trans-party community, as I have stated.  The potential is tremendous and the vision must not be allowed to go.  Nothing can put the co-operative down; nothing can put them out, if they remain united and committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many times in this House I and many other members, particularly from this side of the House but also from every side, have commented on the economic problems that arise from the fact that we have a man made boundary which nobody wanted quite near us.  That puts <Col N="2283" /> an extra strain on our economy.  For that reason we are more vulnerable when institutions such as the Bailieboro Co-operative Society are in danger.  This should also be borne in mind by the Minister for Finance and by Fóir Teoranta when they are considering what they will do to get Bailieboro Co-operative Society over what is only a temporary difficulty, I submit, and any sane person examining the situation would have to agree.  That being so, Fóir Teoranta should pay special attention to the context in which these occurrences have taken place.  Not merely have this society developed the trouble, but they have impacted on another important company owned by hard-working people.  Because their activities have become temporarily intermeshed, that company have been put into liquidation.  I am painting that picture to indicate to the House the seriousness of the problem.</P>
    <P>The chief executive of Bailieboro Co-operative Society has tendered his resignation saying, and I quote: &ldquo;Financial institutions had lost confidence in its management.&rdquo; If this is so, there is something wrong with the financial institutions not with the chief executive.  I want fearlessly to put that on the record of this house.  It raises the whole question of the attitude of financial institutions to entrepreneurs whose whole commitment is to development. It looks as if this word &ldquo;development&rdquo; has become a dirty word in the minds and philosophy of the economists at present.  It is a sad state of affairs if we have reached that point.  Development is what is needed in a country which has the youngest population in Europe and that is almost a cliché now in this House, in the writings of our economic and social research people and of all who are commenting on the present population structure. If we do not provide development and encourage those who are providing it, we are failing in our duty as elected representatives and the Government are failing in their duty as the ruling organ of the country.</P>
    <P>I am not making a party political speech here; I am making a <i>cri de coeur</i><Col N="2284" /> for the Bailieboro Co-operative Society and for proper consideration of its claims to be maintained and sustained fully as it is at present by Fóir Teoranta and by our financial institutions.  I put it to the House that if, as reported, a consortium of businessmen can see their way to do what the financial institutions refuse to do, then that is scandalous in the face of rising unemployment and rising emigration. The efforts and vision of the Bailieboro Co-operative Society led by their chief executive deserve recognition and support from this House.</P>
    <P>At one time in our economic history, Frank Aiken made a suggestion which was condemned at the time for its radicalism. The suggestion was simply that the banks and financial institutions should be forced to make available money for development at a fixed and low rate of interest.  That sounds as radical today as it did at that time, but the financial institutions and banks should keep this particularly in mind &mdash; they have a scared obligation to the community from which they mainly make their profits.  They should not be in a position to sit in judgment on important groups such as the Bailieboro Co-operative who carry with them the hopes and livelihoods of so many of our citizens.</P>
    <P>I want to give the House the brief of Fóir Teoranta and again I stress my disappointment that the Minister for Finance did not come into the House to give his views on this very important matter. The main function of Fóir Teoranta is to provide assistance for industrial concerns which may be in danger of having to close down or suspend activities because of inability to raise necessary capital from commercial sources.  The commercial sources have their obligations &mdash; I am saying that out bluntly.  They have their obligations to those who are their customers and from whom they make their money.  Every second house has been paying them bridging finance at exorbitant rates.  They have been making very substantial profits and when they made management blunders they came back to this House for support.  They have an <Col N="2285" /> obligation to the taxpayer and to the community to see to it that worthwhile ventures are not let go to the wall.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta have an obligation to come in where necessary capital cannot be raised from commercial sources.  They say that such concerns, however, must be basically sound and capable, if necessary with reorganisation, of becoming profitable. My brief to this House is that the concerns about which we are talking are basically sound.  They are very solidly based on the co-operative movement. There may be some need for reorganisation, but I do not think there is radical need for this.  The philosophy of development is simply embedded in that co-operative society and consequently I am calling on the Minister for Finance to make a statement tonight that Fóir Teoranta will not allow any damage to be done to the Bailieboro Co-operative Society.  As I wish to give some of my time to Deputy O'Hanlon I shall conclude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to support everything that my colleague, Deputy Wilson, has said.  This threat to Bailieboro Co-operative Society is of major concern.  It involves three Departments of State, not just the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and the Department of Finance, but the Department of Agriculture, also.  We in this House in the national interest, must, support the co-operative movement because of what it has done in the development of rural Ireland, for the small farmers who are the suppliers to the co-operatives, and for the industries associated with them.  Bailieboro Co-operative have had major development in recent years, something of which we in our area, A Cheann Comhairle, can be justly proud.  They have gone into Emmet Liqueurs and found a large successful market in the United States.  They have become involved in light engineering, in the equestrian centre and many other diversifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A matter of great concern to me is the speed with which Fóir Teoranta react when there is a crisis.  I ask if at times Fóir Teoranta and the financial institutions <Col N="2286" /> play off against each other.  I am not referring in this to Bailieboro Co-operative Society because I do not know enough about what is happening there.  I am concerned that this play off against each other might cause delay to the detriment of the particular industry they are trying to assist and I ask the Minister to look into this.  The financial institutions must see if they have any social conscience at all or if they are purely motivated by high profits.  I draw attention to the speed with which banks draw in their money in situations in which a business is strictly very sound but may have temporary cash flow problems.  That matter has to be looked at at some stage because not alone is Bailieboro Co-operative in difficulty but another major concern in our constituency had a liquidator appointed last week.  It is my belief that the speed with which the banks moved in that instance is something that should concern us.  As Deputy Wilson said, that firm, through hard work and endeavour, built up an extensive business throughout the midland and northern counties.  That firm has found itself in difficulty because of a cash flow problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the three Departments involved to get together to discuss this issue and ensure that Bailieboro Co-operative continues for the benefit of the workers, the farmers and the people in the community it serves.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister of State for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I should like to be associated with the remarks of my colleagues on the Opposition benches.  I understand that I am the only Member who is a shareholder of Bailieboro Co-operative.  I appeal to the Minister of State to tell the Minister for Finance and Fóir Teoranta that by tomorrow there must be a decision.  We cannot allow this to continue much longer because it will destroy the commitment <Col N="2287" /> of the milk suppliers and the creditors.  I do not think it should take two-and-a-half weeks for an investigation and a further two-and-a-half weeks before a final decision is reached.  If a decision is not made soon there will not be a co-operative. That is the stark reality facing us and it is the message we are anxious to pass on to the Minister of State.  The farmers in the area have stood by the co-operative over the years and I have no doubt that their commitment in the future will ensure its survival in future years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Members for their constructive contributions and I share their concern for the future of Bailieboro Co-op.  I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by Bailieboro Co-op and I have been monitoring developments closely.  As the difficulties of the co-op appear to be of a financial nature not requiring grant assistance the Industrial Development Authority are not directly involved in trying to assist the co-op to overcome its difficulties. I am aware that the co-op has made an approach to Fóir Teoranta for financial assistance and I should like to give the House an outline of developments in this regard over the last couple of weeks.</P>
      <P>On 27 January Fóir Teoranta received an urgent request from the Bailieboro Co-op group for financial assistance.  An immediate decision, at the insistence of the group's bankers, was required.  The board of Fóir Teoranta on 29 January decided to provide interim funds to meet the immediate pressing needs of the group.  The amount was approved and subsequently paid.  I mention that because I am anxious to stress that there was no delay on the part of Fóir Teoranta in coming to the immediate assistance of the group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer not to. The board took the interim measure to <Col N="2288" /> facilitate a fuller assessment of the group's longer term prospects so that an early decision could be reached on their overall financial needs.  On assessing the financial position in greater detail Fóir Teoranta's assessment revealed a substantially higher deficit than they previously believed to be the case.  Due to incomplete information it was not possible to determine the full extent of the financial needs of the group in order to enable it to continue in operation.</P>
      <P>On the basis of this information the board of Fóir Teoranta met on 7 February and decided that a more in-depth assessment was needed before funds could be given to the group and this decision was conveyed accordingly.  I must point out that Fóir Teoranta have a statutory responsibility when providing funds to any company or co-op.  The criterion, which is well known to Members of the House, is that the company or the co-op concerned must show that it has a viable future.  The Irish Co-operative Organisation Society subsequently became involved in negotiations in the matter.  The outcome of these was a proposal which was put to Fóir Teoranta and the company's bankers.  I am pleased to note that over the weekend, under the aegis of the ICOS, a very high powered group of experienced advisers got together and it is my belief that they will assist the co-op in no small way.</P>
      <P>Negotiations with Fóir Teoranta and the banks are continuing.  Further meetings have been arranged for tomorrow morning.  Deputy Wilson stressed the role of Fóir Teoranta but I must point out that in relation to the co-op's banking position there are ten banks involved in financing the group.</P>

With the goodwill of all involved a satisfactory outcome can emerge. There is a need for goodwill on all sides. In relation to the proposals being put to Fóir Teoranta and the banks I should add that basically they are of a three-fold nature, the strengthening of the co-op's management structure, a rationalisation of its operations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wonder if that comment is in order.  The third measure is <Col N="2290" /> that there should be a financial package designed to put the group's finances on a solid basis.  Those three important items will be addressed by Fóir Teoranta and the banks involved.  It is hoped that the proposals will result in securing the future of the co-op and in doing so will secure the future for the benefit of the shareholders, the milk suppliers and protect the future employment of the workforce of 650 in the group.  I should like to reiterate what was said by Deputies Wilson, O'Hanlon and Farrelly, that there is a need for calm.  I am optimistic that a favourable outcome can be negotiated.  I was interested to hear Deputy Wilson mention that a consortium of businessmen were involved.  There may be a commitment needed all round, including a commitment by the shareholders.  I am hopeful that tomorrow's meeting will result in a solution to the group's difficult problems.  Fóir Teoranta will, as they have in many cases, play a responsible part.  I hope the banks will realise that they too have a responsibility.  I am hopeful that tomorrow's meeting will reach a conclusion that will be to the benefit of the co-op.</P>

      <P>ESPRIT contracts are negotiated by prospective participants directly with the EC.  The National Board for Science and Technology promote and co-ordinate Irish involvement in ESPRIT and assist organisations to develop their proposals. Two agencies which are supported by my Department, the National Microelectronics Research Centre in University College, Cork, and the National Software Centre in Dublin, are involved in ESPRIT projects.  To date the Microelectronics Research Centre have received £200,000 from the ESPRIT fund for their research and development work in the general area of microelectronics.  The Software Centre have received a total of £61,000 in respect of software development. Apart from these two agencies some 16 Irish organisations comprising commercial firms, universities and research centres are involved in ESPRIT projects approved by the EC Commission during 1985.  These projects are expected to yield approximately £5 million to the Irish participants.  This amount is equivalent to 2½ per cent of total ESPRIT funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <Col N="2081" /> Given that the Dáil had no tradition in such an expanded system of committees, the system is functioning in a satisfactory manner.  As the system matures, it will become a more integral part of the functioning of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary to bring together the chairpersons of the committees to review the terms of reference.  Amendments have been made to the terms of reference of various committees either as a result of requests from individual committees for a change or as a result of proposals coming from me through Government. An example of the latter was the addition to the terms of reference of the Joint Committee on Legislation asking for a review of the manner in which delegated legislation is processed and monitored by the Oireachtas.  Every change in the terms of reference of a committee must, of course, be approved by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The number of committees which can function effectively in the Oireachtas is determined, in the main, by the number of Oireachtas members.  The Government indicated in <i>Building on Reality</i> that a committee on socio-economic affairs would be established to examine the longer term implications of social and economic policies.  The detailed terms of reference for this committee will have to be considered by Government following which the matter will be brought before the House.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the resources of the Oireachtas in terms of membership, administrative facilities, etc. would support further extensions of the committee system until such time as some of the existing committees complete their work. The Deputy will be aware that the Joint Committees on Marriage Breakdown and on Building Land reported in mid-1985 but that a committee on the Irish language was established at the end of 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Informal arrangements exist whereby the chairpersons of Oireachtas committees meet at the beginning of each year to discuss and agree the allocation between committees of the consultancy and advertising funds provided in the Estimates. <Col N="2082" /> I will be consulting the chairpersons in relation to allocations for 1986.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the Government have agreed that the work of individual committees, as evidenced by their reports, should be given greater prominence. Accordingly, I have put proposals before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which will involve the Dáil sitting for a period each week outside what are now normal hours specifically to debate committee reports and other reports laid before the Dáil.  Until such proposals are considered by the committee, it would not be appropriate for me to give further details of them.</P>

      <P>The action group set up by the IDA, to deal with Castlebar after the announcement of the closure of Travenol, are actively promoting the town for suitable industrial projects.  The IDA are engaged in discussions with a number of parties who expressed interest in the Travenol plant and indeed Travenol themselves are actively promoting the facility among US corporations.

      <P>The IDA have recently reached agreement with Travenol involving the transfer of 170,000 sq.ft. of the Travenol factory to the IDA and the retention of 124,000 sq. ft. by the company.  This agreement will enable the IDA to promote the factory on a clear and defined basis to new investors.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (a)  when he intends to implement a promise made by his Minister <Col N="2093" /> of State to the Consumers' Association of Ireland in 1984 to bring in new consumer credit regulations by January 1985; (b)  if he will confirm that indeed these regulations may be implemented under a section of the Consumer Information Act; and (c)  if he appreciates the urgency involved now due to recent well-publicised cases of people failing to make repayments and the consequences involved for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>An order has been drafted under the Consumer Information Act, 1978, which will require any advertisements or notices that make reference to the cost of credit to show the true cost of that credit by means of an annual percentage rate of charge (APR).  The APR is the total cost of the credit expressed as an annual percentage of the amount of the credit granted.  It standardises the method of calculating the cost, frequency of payments made, plus the interest and other charges payable.</P>
      <P>It was not possible to complete the work involved in making the order by January 1985 as had been envisaged in 1984.  A draft directive on consumer credit, including provisions on the annual percentage rate of charge, has been under discussion in Brussels for a number of years.  We had hoped for earlier adoption of this directive which would have cleared the way for the introduction of wide-ranging legislation on consumer credit.  Because of this continuing delay we decided to go ahead with the making of our own order on the annual percentage rate of charge so that the consumer will be better informed of the true cost of credit.  It was necessary in drafting the order to take account of the discussions at EC level.</P>
      <P>The order is intended to do three things:</P>
      <P>&nbsp;(i)It will require any advertisements that make reference to the cost of credit to show the true cost of that credit by means of an annual percentage rate of charge (APR),</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2094" /> (ii)any notices/leaflets relating to loans or credit sales which are displayed at a place where a cash loan can be obtained or a credit purchase made will have to show the true cost of credit using an APR,</P>
    <P>(iii)&nbsp;it will set out legally binding definitions relating, in the main, to consumer credit.</P>
    <P>Consultation of interested parties, which is obligatory under the Consumer Information Act, has taken place and a notice of intention to make the order was published, as required by the Act, in the press on 30 January.  The draft order is now being finalised for presentation to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is expected that the order will be laid before both Houses for positive approval before the end of the present session.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that the order can be made under the Consumer Information Act, 1978; sections 11 and 12 of that Act enable me to do this.  While licensed banks are at present excluded from the provisions of the Consumer Information Act I am satisfied that they will offer the same information to the consumer as will be required of other institutions.  I fully appreciate the urgency and the importance of providing consumers with information on the true cost of credit which will enable them to make an informed choice between the various credit offers.</P>

      <P>I am happy that the UK continues to be Ireland's most important and valuable export market and that our exports to that market are constantly growing both in value and volume terms.  I am disturbed, however, that our share of the UK market has been on a downward trend since 1980.  This trend, to some degree, is accounted for by the diversification of <Col N="2096" /> our exports into other markets &mdash; especially to the European Community &mdash; which are becoming more attractive.  To the extent that it reflects problems in the areas of marketing, product design and development, product promotion, cost competitiveness and, most particularly, quality, it is a cause for worry.  With a view to reversing this trend I directed CTT some months ago to reassess and intensify their promotion strategy for the UK.</P>
      <P>An intensive promotional campaign by CTT is now in train, additional to their normal activities, and this is aimed specifically at increasing the quality, image and level of penetration of Irish products on the UK market.  I also did a promotion visit to London last September during which I spoke to senior executives of leading UK retail stores which stock Irish goods.</P>

The Deputy will, of course, be aware that the Joint Committee on Small Businesses is examining the question of the development of the small business sector of the economy.  That examination is employment related.  However, the problem of unemployment permeates all areas of the economy and is caused by a wide variety of social and economic phenomena and I feel that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Socio-Economic Affairs to be established in accordance <Col N="2098" /> with paragraph 3.89 of the national plan <i>Building on Reality</i> will have a function in this area.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances and having regard to the fact that the function of an Oireachtas committee is to report on the areas coming within their terms of reference to the Oireachtas itself, I do not consider that the establishment of an Oireachtas committee to channel information and ideas on job creation to the IDA and proposed NDC would be appropriate.</P>

      <P>The decision to reduce the funding for the <i>Lough Beltra</i> in 1986 has to be viewed in the context of the current general financial situation.

      <P>I am, of course, aware of the wide sweeping recommendations in the OECD report prepared in 1975 on marine science policy for Ireland.  Furthermore, I fully recognise the vital importance of marine research to this country.  Indeed I recently established a marine science and technology task force who are currently considering the appropriate structures for the development of marine science and technology in this country and their application to national development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding speed limits, proposals relating to speed limits may arise later this year at EC level in the context of road safety, exhaust emissions and energy considerations as a result of action being pursued by the Transport, Environmental and Energy Councils of the EC. It must be pointed out, however, that present maximum speed limits in most other EC member states are higher, and in some cases considerably higher, than the limits currently applicable in this country.  I have no proposals to introduce lower speed limits.  I should like to point out that the present general speed limit of 55 mph represents a reduction on a former limit of 60 mph which applied up to 1979.  In that year the limit was reduced to 55 mph as part of an energy conservation package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding traffic lights, the provision and operation of traffic lights is a matter for individual road authorities.  Road authorities are, however, given every encouragement to provide traffic light synchronisation systems where appropriate. A substantial measure of traffic light synchronisation has already been provided by Dublin Corporation in the central Dublin area with computer-linked signals in a system knows as urban traffic control (UTC).  The cost of UTC has, since 1982, been financed fully by State grants paid by the Department of Communications. Outside the area covered by the UTC system, the scope for synchronisation is limited, having regard to factors such as the type and volume of traffic and the frequency of junctions. However, partial synchronisation of traffic lights has been provided by the relevant road authorities on major routes leading into and out of major centres. These include sections of the Naas, Lucan, Bray and Blessington roads in the Dublin area, the approach to Cork city from the Dublin road and the Bandon <Col N="2108" /> and Douglas roads.  As regards building codes, part &lsquo;H&rsquo; of the proposed building regulations provides for thermal insulation standards for domestic buildings for energy saving purposes.</P>

      <P>I am not so aware.  As the new scheme did not come into operation until 1 December 1985 (18 November 1985 in the case of widow/door replacement) delays of the order suggested could not have arisen.  I have taken a number of measures to increase the Department's <Col N="2110" /> capacity to carry out inspections including the re-engagement of a number of retired inspectors familiar with the work, the introduction of a bonus scheme for the existing inspectorate and the recruitment, now in progress through the National Manpower Service, of additional temporary inspectors.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the inspectors are carrying out their duties satisfactorily and that a reasonable approach is being adopted by them.  The explanatory memorandum HA 2 issued for the guidance of applicants clearly specifies that grants are given for replacement of windows which in the opinion of the Department have deteriorated to the extent that there is no option but to replace them.  Accordingly it does not follow that maximum grants would be payable in all cases.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>The domestic rate relief grant is allocated in compliance with the terms of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978, as amended by the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983, which provides for a grant to local authorities of an amount not exceeding the aggregate of domestic rate relief allowances made by the authorities under the Act.  It is not possible to say what the level of rate poundages, and therefore grant levels, might have been had the 1978 Act not been amended.</P>
      <P>The domestic rate relief grant to all authorities in the years 1984 and 1985 was £164.7 million and £169 million respectively. The comparable figure for 1986, adjusted to take account of the removal from local authorities of responsibility for the supplementary welfare allowance demand and the more active use of internal local resources is estimated at £181.5 million and this includes a grant allocation of £144.7 million.  The equivalent figures for Ballina UDC are £420,669 and £440,948 for 1984 and 1985 and an estimated total for 1986 of £485,400 which includes a grant allocation of £241,400.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the undercharge which arose in this case for the years 1978-79 to 1984-85 was attributable to a combination of circumstances.  The main factors were the taking into account for PAYE purposes of estimated amounts of investment income which, it is regretted, subsequently proved to be substantially understated, the failure of the taxpayer to disclose on some of his returns of income full details of his investment income and the payment to the taxpayer by his employer of certain fees without deduction of tax which were properly within the ambit of PAYE.  The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that the Collector-General is prepared to accord the concession of payment of the <Col N="2125" /> arrears of tax by instalments over a period of five years.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in addition to her employment earnings, the taxpayer is in receipt of a social welfare pension.  Both sources of income are chargeable to income tax.  In accordance with standard practice the aggregate tax-free allowances under PAYE are reduced to take account of the social welfare pension which is paid gross, the tax attributable to it being recovered under PAYE from the other income by means of the restricted tax-free allowances.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the information available to the inspector of taxes the restriction in respect of the social welfare pension for the current year, 1985-86, is understated.  However, the inspector does not propose to amend the 1985-86 tax-free allowances at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised <Col N="2126" /> me that the underpayment of tax for 1984-85 arose mainly because a certificate of tax-free allowances containing the tax-free allowances appropriate to deduction of tax in accordance with table S was issued to the taxpayer for that year.  On review, those allowances were found to have been excessive.  Liability arising on credit union dividends received by the taxpayer and his wife also contributed to the underpayment.  As a general rule credit union dividends are assessable to tax on a preceding year basis.  The inspector of taxes has dividend certificates which show that the taxpayer's wife received dividends of £76 and £64, respectively, in the years ended 5 April 1983 and 5 April 1984.</P>

      <P>While most new unemployment assistance claims in County Galway are normally dealt with in two to three months, it is accepted that in some cases delays of four months or more can occur.</P>
      <P>These delays stem largely from the continuing rise in numbers claiming unemployment assistance combined with the need for individual investigation of cases by a social welfare officer.  In addition many of the unemployment assistance applications made in the county are from smallholders and these cases are generally more difficult to investigate and take more time to process than the general run of unemployment assistance applications because of the necessity to obtain detailed information on the income and expenditure of holdings.  The social welfare officer staffing position in County Galway is at present under review with the objective of reducing delays in the investigation of claims.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The value of the &ldquo;grain&rdquo; vouchers is determined by the market, having regard <Col N="2169" /> to the prevailing market price for grain and the price at which cheap intervention grain can be purchased with vouchers.  In general terms, the value of the discount on one tonne of intervention grain is the difference between 75 per cent of the intervention price and the market price of grain, adjusted by the costs incurred by merchants in buying grain from intervention.</P>
      <P>The intervention grain available for the scheme consists of 36,000 tonnes of high quality feed wheat and 89,000 tonnes of feed barley.  As the grain is allocated on a first-come first-served basis it was to be expected that initial demand would be for wheat and, accordingly, that the value of &ldquo;grain&rdquo; vouchers would be higher at the outset.  During the first two weeks after issue the vouchers were valued at between £20 and £26 per tonne but following the allocation of feed wheat there was a slight drop in the value.  However, I understand that the situation has since steadied and that the vouchers are currently being valued by merchants at £20 per tonne.</P>
      <P>The value given to farmers for the vouchers is being continuously monitored by my Department having regard to market prices, with a view to ensuring that there is no profiteering.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind the Deputy that intervention grain is only a small element of the feed voucher scheme and that the greater part of support is by way of the &ldquo;cash&rdquo; voucher.  Other forms of assistance such as the winter fodder scheme and accelerated payment of headage grants have also been provided by my Department to enable farmers to secure adequate winter fodder for their livestock.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> It would require a disproportionate expenditure of public time and money to compile the information sought <Col N="2173" /> in regard to the number of cases dealt with by the five solicitors mentioned in the question during the tax year ended 5 April 1985 or the number of adjournments in those cases for which each solicitor was paid a fee.</P>
      <P>In regard to (3), the fees paid to solicitors under the criminal legal aid scheme in District Court cases are for attendance by the solicitor and are payable if the solicitor appears, whether the case is heard or is adjourned.  On 6th April 1984 the fee, exclusive of VAT, for the first day of appearance by a solicitor in a District Court case was £39.43 &mdash; and for each subsequent appearance, £17.53. These fees were increased to £42.58 and £18.93, respectively, with effect from 1 September 1984.</P>
      <P>Defending solicitors fees in criminal legal aid cases in the higher courts are related to the fees which the Director of Public Prosecution considers appropriate to be paid to prosecuting counsel in the particular case in question.  Adjournments are rare.  In regard to (4) all fees under the criminal legal aid scheme are for the defence.</P>

There is also under consideration an application from the school authorities for a more favourable grant rate.  I am asking that the outstanding matters be dealt with as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>My Department has been negotiating with the authorities of Kilcornan national school, County Limerick, in relation to a grant towards the cost of extending the school in order to make provision overall for four classrooms and a general purposes area.  The school authorities have requested that provision be made for an additional classroom.  The enrolment trends are being reviewed at present and a decision in the matter will be conveyed to the school authorities as soon as possible with a view to the completion of the architectural planning of the project.  I am not in a position at this stage to say when the project may commence.</P>

      <P>From inquiries made by my Department I understand that the person concerned was made redundant in January 1986.  I am informed that he was not satisfied with the lump sum payment as calculated by his employer and that he refused to accept a cheque from his employer or to sign the redundancy certificate.</P>
      <P>I now understand that the employer has prepared an amendment redundancy certificate and an increased payment taking account of overtime earnings and that these may be collected if the person concerned calls on his employer and signs the receipt portion of the certificate.  If, however, the employee still fails to agree the amended calculation with his employer, it will be open to him to appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for a determination of his entitlement.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to assist this project under the terms of the capital grant scheme operated by my Department as grant aid is available only towards the costs of work <Col N="2180" /> executed by building contract after submission of a grant application.</P>
      <P>In this particular case, the contract element of the work was completed prior to grant application.  The balance of the work which was carried out under AnCO's Community Youth Training Programme and by voluntary labour is ineligible for assistance under the scheme.  The applicant group was informed of the decision on 31 May 1985.</P>
