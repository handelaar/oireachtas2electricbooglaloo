    <P>
      <Col N="2337" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister for Justice is not in the House to hear this part of the contribution to the debate.  I say this because what I intended saying would have been very relevant to the Minister's presence.  I intended appealing to the new Minister to use his good offices in improving the relationship between his Department and the Garda and also between himself and the Prison Officers Association.  Without going into the implication, political or otherwise, of my plea, I put it to the Minister that it is very much in the national interest that in both instances relations are improved. Both the Garda and the prison officers carry out an exacting, dangerous and demanding job on behalf of the people. We cannot afford the waste of time and energy that is resulting from the <i>impasse</i> between the Minister's office and these two vital areas of law enforcement. Because of this new portfolio, the Minister has an excellent opportunity of taking the initiative in this area.  I am confident that there is a wish on the part of the prison Garda and on the part of the prison officers also to have this undesirable <i>impasse</i> brought to an end.  This cold war has gone on for far too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that legislating in a vacuum and in the absence of dialogue and discussion as well as of goodwill, particularly in this sensitive area, can lead only to a weakening and a deterioration in an area of public administration which more than ever needs to be strengthened.  We in Fianna Fáil do not regard this area in any way as one for political point scoring.  The Minister can be assured of our assistance in bringing forward legislation which strengthens the law in this area following the full implementation of the Criminal Justice Act and which will also protect fully the public interest and the rights of the Garda.  We must strike the right balance between protecting the public <Col N="2338" /> interest and the rights of individual gardaí who operate on our behalf.</P>
    <P>The publication of this Bill, taken in conjunction with the Criminal Justice Act, has generated a considerable amount of interest and has resulted in a number of submissions from the representatives of the Garda associations and other interested bodies.  This is a welcome development but it was to be expected.  We on this side have given serious thought and consideration to the views that have been expressed to us in relation to this area.  To the extent that the public do not have the same organised facility for the expression of views as we have, it is important that in this House we exercise our judgment and our interpretation of the public interest in this very important area.  I trust that the end product will be an Act which will provide sufficient power for our Garda to enable them to perform their duty freely and unrestricted while at the same time containing adequate safeguards for our citizens.</P>
    <P>It should be restated that for the first time since the foundation of the State we have on the Statute Book an Act which empowers the Garda to arrest any citizen on suspicion and to detain him for questioning for up to 20 hours.  That is a significant departure from the legislation under which the Garda had to operate up to now.  Because of the serious level of crime, we gave the Minister our full support for that far-reaching provision.  We gave that support because we considered it necessary, particularly in view of the serious deterioration in law and order in recent years, the challenges facing the Garda force and the individual members of that force who place even their lives at risk in enforcing the laws which have been enacted in this House on behalf of the people.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the provision of the Criminal Justice Act will be administered by the Garda force in a caring and professional manner.  Nonetheless, we felt at the time &mdash; and it is still our view &mdash; that in the light of these new provisions the rights of the citizens need to be protected in legislation.  We regret that the <Col N="2339" /> much needed provisions of the Criminal Justice Act have been delayed unnecessarily for a period of over two years pending publication of this Bill.  If we in this House are as concerned as we say we are about the need to control violence and escalating crime, if there was the urgency for bringing into the House the Criminal Justice Bill, which certainly was the case at the time, it does not make any sense that the provisions of that Bill have not yet been implemented.</P>
    <P>They were debated at length in this House over many months and contributed to in a significant way by Members from this side of the House, particularly our spokesman, Deputy Woods, and resulted in the tabling and acceptance by the Minister of amendments which totally altered the structure of the Bill as it was originally circulated.  One of those amendments made provisions for the Bill which we are debating today.  It was accepted at that time that there was an urgency and public demand &mdash; and even a demand from within the Garda force &mdash; that the new provisions of the Criminal Justice Act be implemented without delay.  Yet we find over two years later that we are debating one of the provisions accepted on amendment on Committee Stage from speakers on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>It is also a matter of growing concern that the Minister has not brought before the House a Bill which is also necessary for the full implementation of the Criminal Justice Act.  That Bill is for the protection of persons in custody.  We are no nearer now, two years after the introduction of the Criminal Justice Bill, to its full implementation.  I do not want to make a political comment, but it is an established fact that the life span of this Government must of necessity be running out.  They are into their fourth year and, even if they go the full term of five years, it is difficult to see how they will be able to implement every aspect of the Criminal Justice Act unless the two remaining requirements of that Act are treated with some degree of urgency.</P>
    <P>We are anxious to dispose of this Bill <Col N="2340" /> as quickly as possible and are anxious to assist the Minister in any way we can in that regard.  I must ask him, through his Minister of State, when it is intended to bring before the House the additional legislation for the protection of those in custody.  Until such time as these two provisions are debated, agreed on and eventually incorporated into legislation, the gardaí will not have the advantages which we told them they would have following the acceptance of the Criminal Justice Bill and the Criminal Justice Act which followed it.  This is a serious situation. I do not want to repeat myself, but we all realise now that the position is very serious with regard to the steady deterioration in law and order.  I shall make a few general comments on that topic later.</P>
    <P>It is a shame that in their fourth year in office the Government have failed to introduce the supporting legislation needed for the full implementation of the Criminal Justice Act.  This has led to frustration and uncertainty in the Garda force.  In debating the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill we are dealing with only part of the overall problem now facing our Garda force.  It is true to say that individual members of the force operating on our behalf do not know exactly where they stand and what new regulations will govern their behaviour as individual members of the Garda Síochána. The sooner we legislate finally and put on the Statute Book the exact requirements of this House with regard to Garda performance, the sooner we shall have a estabilised Garda force and the restoration of harmony within that force, and the faster we shall get the fullest implementation of the law.</P>
    <P>It is not right or fair that so much of the thinking and time of our gardaí must be taken in wondering what we in this House will do in relation to this Bill and ever promised legislation and where they will stand when it is implemented.  There is, indeed an urgency about legislating in this area and I hope that immediately after the passing of this provision the Minister will bring before the House the <Col N="2341" /> remaining provision for the protection of people in custody.</P>
    <P>The new Minister comes into this office with a certain advantage.  There is always the danger when a Minister has been in office for a considerable period of time, as his predecessor was, that one can become entrenched in one's views and become a prisoner of one's actions.  A change of portfolio provides an opportunity for a new approach.  I am a little disappointed that the Minister for Justice, Deputy Dukes, is not in the House today to hear what I say.  I know that the Minister of State deputising for him will convey my views to him and we want to reassure the Minister that we are as concerned as he is about the need to tighten up and introduce this new legislation. I am sure he knows that the gardaí are equally anxious.  The new Minister is a placid gentleman and should be in a position to reintroduce the dialogue necessary to create the goodwill which is essential in this very sensitive area. Legislating in a vacuum without the backing, support, understanding and goodwill of those for whom we are legislating could not work successfully.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to initiate immediately a programme of action for the upgrading and improving of the performance and working conditions of the Garda Síochána, to bring the entire Garda force into line with the improvements and upgrading of the forces which have taken place in other countries.  At present our Garda, apart from having to deal with localised crime, are faced with the ever more serious challenge of international crime.  Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that the force are kept fully updated in terms of training and the most modern techniques which are available to police forces around the world.</P>
    <P>Discipline within the force is no substitute for management.  If we are serious about the organisation and management of the force, the first step must be the establishment of a Garda Authority.  A lot has been said and written and many views have been expressed in this House in relation to the overall structure of the <Col N="2342" /> Garda and there are conflicting views in relation to the establishment of a Garda Authority.  The establishment of such an authority would put the Garda on a new level and give them the independence they desire and which would assist them. When the Minister is replying I should like him to comment on this matter and to tell us if he is thinking of establishing an independent Garda Authority and if it is his intention to bring in legislation in this regard in the near future.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that we deal with legislation in such a fragmented way in this House. In my contributions on the Bill dealing with the reorganisation of the courts I made the point that there is far too much fragmentation of the various Acts with which people must comply.  In the area covering the performance of the Garda Síochána I hope the Minister will lose no time in bringing provisions before the House which will, once and for all, consolidate the legislation under which the Garda operate and clarify the role of the force in the future, the need for an independent Garda Authority and all the other matters relating to this aspect of the performance of the force.</P>
    <P>We must legislate for the protection of the public while, at the same time, protecting the rights and working conditions of members of the Garda Síochána. It is a difficult task, but it can be resolved to the satisfaction of both by reasoned and fair debate.  I interpret the mood of the public at present in relation to the Bill as wanting and expecting us to give all the powers to the Garda which they need to enable them to perform their duties in a free and unrestricted way while at the same time &mdash; this is where it becomes difficult for us as legislators &mdash; endeavouring to protect the public interest arising from the strengthening of the legislation and the increased powers which we are giving to the Garda in the Criminal Justice Act.  In the very disturbing social and economic climate at present this is not an unreasonable expectation on the part of the public.  All that the Garda ask is that in performing that difficult task that they should be given the same degree of protection and <Col N="2343" /> privilege as other sections of the community and, as one garda put it to me, the same rights and protection which the criminals are given under legislation also enacted in this House.  That is a fair, reasoned and understandable request.</P>
    <P>The Garda should feel safe and confident in the knowledge that this House will legislate fairly on their behalf.  The House and the Garda generally will accept that the full implementation of all aspects of the Criminal Justice Act will provide the force with substantially increased powers.  I indicated earlier what these powers were, but I am sure Deputies will accept that the provision for arrest and detention without being charged for up to 20 hours is a far reaching one and was not conceded lightly in the House.  Because it is far reaching, the House will accept &mdash; and I know the Garda will accept &mdash; the need to protect the public interest and also the need to protect those arrested and detained.</P>
    <P>It is also worthy of note that the Minister's predecessor, who was critical and slow to accept the principle of an independent tribunal, has gone overboard in terms of the sanctions which he proposes in the Bill as circulated.  In the debate on the Criminal Justice Act, Members on this side of the House, particularly our spokesman, Deputy Woods, spent many tedious hours trying to convince the Minister that, following the far reaching provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, there was a need in the public interest and that of the Garda Síochána for the setting up and establishment of an independent complaints tribunal.  The public would be happy in the knowledge that there was a procedure on the Statute Book through which they could make their views known in relation to behaviour which was not in accordance with the normal accepted standards of Garda performance.</P>
    <P>Members of the Garda Síochána would be equally happy to know that there was provision for a fair and independent examination of allegations which might be made against individual gardaí.  That is why, despite the very lengthy, tedious <Col N="2344" /> arguments put forward on this side of the House, the Minister at that time was reluctant to accept the need for the principle of an independent tribunal.  Yet, for whatever reason, by the time he got around to circulating this Bill, he had made provision for sanctions which far exceeded anything put forward by Members who spoke during the debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister's action in this area fully vindicates the judgment and the foresight of Fianna Fáil on the need for the establishment of such a tribunal.  It is obvious that, following the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill and the reasoned arguments put forward in the House, the Minister decided that such a tribunal was essential.  What surprises all of us is that, despite his initial resistance during the debate, he has now circulated in this Bill provisions which are extreme and are viewed as being so by individual gardaí. I regret to say that this change by the Minister in relation to the Bill circulated and the establishment of a complaints tribunal reflect an over-reaction on the part of the Minister to a series of unforgiveable events within the Garda Síochána which have been condemned not only in this House but also within the force itself.</P>
    <P>I do not have to spell out for the House the series of rather tragic events which took place within a very short period of time within the Garda.  These actions were immediately condemned as being unacceptable by the representatives of the various Garda associations and by the Commissioner.  It is sometimes forgotten that before this Bill came before the House there were in operation very strict disciplinary procedures within the Garda for dealing with any kind of misbehaviour by individual members of the force.  It is sad and tragic for the force that these events took place because they have tended unfairly to mar and tarnish the image of the force in the public mind.  All these matters have been dealt with within the existing disciplinary procedures in the Garda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to a series of events which took place within a short period of time and tended to mar the image and the public perception of the Garda force.  When one examines the performance of the Garda Síochána over a long period, the number of incidents is extremely small, bearing in mind the changes which the force have had to face and the provocation on the ground in relation to individual garda performance. I know that the public at the end of the day will recognise as they have always done the credibility of the Garda Síochána and accord them the respect they are due.</P>
      <P>The overall performance of the Department of Justice in recent years has been one of reaction.  They have been reacting to events after they have occurred rather than anticipating their occurrence and taking timely action.  The evidence of this approach to management has been reflected over the past three years in the succession of crises within the prison system.  I know the Chair will tell me that this is not relevant to the Bill but I make this passing reference to give an example of the point I am making. Crisis has existed, although not to the same extent, within the Garda Síochána also.  The new Minister should resume friendly dialogue and discussion with the representatives of the Garda associations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discipline is no substitute for management. What changes have taken place within the Garda Síochána following the Shercock case, the Kerry babies case, the tragic incidents at Ballinamore and the Bunratty incident?  I will not refer further to those cases because of the advice the Chair has given, but I should like to know what action has been taken within the <Col N="2346" /> Department of Justice and the overall management of the Garda Síochána to ensure that there will be no recurrence of these incidents.  It is true that members of the force have been disciplined but I put it to the Minister that a succession of events similar to those I have mentioned requires something more than discipline. That is why I made the comment that discipline is no substitute for management. If we are serious about the importance of the role of the gardaí and the challenges facing the force in the future we will have to give urgent attention and consideration to the management structure of the force.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that all the young people at present joining the Garda Síochána have the dedication &mdash; perhaps vocation is a better word &mdash; which service in the force requires.  That is not their fault.  In the current extremely difficult economic climate young people are often compelled through necessity to take up employment which would not be their natural choice, if a choice were available in the first instance.  I stress the need to upgrade and extend the period of training for Garda recruits.  I spoke at length on this matter in the past and I believe the present course in Templemore is not sufficient to equip a new police officer with the training and knowledge needed to cope with the society in which we live. It is nothing short of expecting Garda trainers and lectures to have magical powers if they are to be expected to turn raw recruits into effective police officers in six months.</P>
    <P>We have been giving much lip service, myself included, perhaps, to the need to up-grade and improve Garda training facilities for recruits.  I do not know of any other job in which there is greater need for proper training than that of a garda on whom the public good depends so much.  A period of six months would be inadequate in any other worker training scheme.  I ask the Minister, therefore, to treat this as a matter of urgency because even the most dedicated young recruit will not succeed as a policeman if he is not given a sound basic foundation through his training.  I do not have to <Col N="2347" /> spell out the other jobs in all of which much longer periods of training are required.</P>
    <P>Since coming to office the Minister will be aware of the well founded reservations of members of the Garda in relation to certain sections of the Bill, and I hope he will resolve these matters through early consultation.  There has been much concern in the force about these sections.  I will refrain from making political comment, but I must point out that there are very strong views in regard to section 7(9).  The late introduction of these provisions has created unnecessary conflict within the Garda.  It is worthy of note that the Irish Council for Civil Liberties have been in conflict with the Garda on the matter of the retention of the right to silence, and the Minister must clarify his attitude in this respect and let us and the Garda know what are his views.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned with the important proposals for the informal resolution of complaints and I suggest that unless the Minister agrees to modify that section by allowing some informal complaints to be dealt with and investigated at local or regional or, as it is known, at superintendent level, the entire system will break down and become ineffective.  I am afraid the Minister is proposing to set up a totally unnecessary layer of bureaucracy which will continue to grow and to be self-defeating.  He is proposing to transfer to Commissioner level an activity which up to now has been dealt with locally by a superintendent.</P>
    <P>I do not know why this provision is felt necessary.  The whole system will become clogged up and bogged down by the vast number of complaints that will have to be forwarded to headquarters and dealt with there on a national level.  As the sensible man he is, I am sure the Minister will see the justification for our argument that this should not become a matter of controversy between the Minister and members of the Garda, or between him and us.  It is only logical that certain complaints should be investigated at county or regional level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2348" /> Another point I should like the Minister to give some thought to is that all complaints, justified or otherwise, will end up in the files of individual gardaí.  I suggest this would not only be unfair but morally wrong.  Files live on much longer than we will and it is important for members of the force that there will not be anything in their files that will in any way affect their promotion opportunities unless the complaints were justified and proven to be justified.</P>
    <P>The ordinary rank and file in the Garda fear that every complaint, vexatious or otherwise, made against individual gardaí will filter through the system and find a resting place in the files of individual gardaí.  My hope is that if complaints are to be dealt with initially at local level, the screening process that would ensue would ease the fears I have been expressing.  On Committee Stage I hope the Minister will amend the Bill so as to modify the method of dealing with complaints.  The importance of this legislation requires that this be done, and even if it takes time and lengthy debate to deal with it, in the end we will get a product which will be acceptable generally and, above all, operable.</P>
    <P>Another point is failure to deal effectively with vexatious complaints against gardaí.  I agree that all vexatious complaints must continue to be examined.  I am concerned that the establishment of such a formal method of dealing initially with complaints will lead to an increase in the number of complaints lodged.  As a result of this legislation and the publicity surrounding it people with a vested interest in lodging complaints against individual members of the Garda Síochána will lodge unfair complaints on an increasing scale.  The Minister should give serious thought as to how to deal with the increasing number of vexatious complaints which are likely to arise and which will contribute substantially to the burden of work to be undertaken under the structure we are setting up here.  Such complaints should initially be examined at district superintendent level as to credibility and following the assessment of the superintendent complaints could then be <Col N="2349" /> forwarded to a higher plane for further adjudication.</P>
    <P>If this legislation is enacted as it stands, without modification of this section all our good intentions in relation to the Bill will be nullified.  The more dedicated and efficient a garda officer is the more he will become a victim of such activity. There is a much greater risk of an efficient garda having complaints lodged against him.  It was suggested to me that if this Bill is implemented as circulated it will be a deterrent to some gardaí in the performance of their duties.  Surely that is a retrograde step not intended by the House or the Minister?  Despite the legislation I am sure the Garda force will continue to operate credibly in the performance of their duties in accordance with legislation provided by this House. On the other hand, it would be a great pity if, through thoughtless acts on our part, for instance in relation to vexatious complaints, an individual garda was restricted in the performance of his duties.</P>
    <P>Law and order generally are related to overall economic conditions.  The breakdown in law and order at present is a symptom of society rebelling against the lack of opportunity in this country today. The high level of unemployment is a major contributory factor to the breakdown of law and order.  If our economic policies are geared towards unemployment we must substitute social policies for job creation policies.  If both job creation policies and social policies are missing we must resort to the least desirable solution, the enforcement of law and order by the Garda Síochána.  We have failed effectively to implement an economic development programme which will create employment and which will eliminate social injustices.  In the absence of this programme we are having to provide more money to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to enforce law and order.  That is an unsatisfactory trend.  It would be better to tackle the root causes so that we would not have to demand increased security at more cost to the State.  Because of our failures <Col N="2350" /> we are being forced to provide scarce resources to maintain law and order.</P>
    <P>Another by-product of the breakdown in law and order is the spread of crime from the urban to the rural areas and crimes are so numerous and so serious nowadays that people can no longer get ordinary insurance cover to protect their homes.  That indicates the serious deterioration in law and order which this Bill is trying to redress by providing additional powers for the Garda Síochána. Because the breakdown in law and order has now spread from the urban areas to the rural areas we have all experienced sad examples of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making a passing reference because in this Bill we are trying to provide additional powers for the Garda Síochána to deal with the overall breakdown in law and order.  I was giving as an example, by way of a passing reference, of the spread of crime from the urban areas to the traditionally safer havens of the rural community.  I urge the Minister of State to convey to the Minister the need to resume the old style community policing we knew down the years.  There is a great need for the closest possible co-operation between the individual garda operating on the ground and the local community.  There is a need also for identification between the Garda and the community.  The community watch, which is part of what we are talking about today, was a very welcome development and is operating very effectively in a number of areas.  Great credit is due to the individual members of the Garda who <Col N="2351" /> are co-operating with the local communities. I urge the communities, organised or otherwise, to recognise that there is a vast amount of goodwill on the part of the Garda to assist them in this very vital and important area.  I urge more voluntary leaders and community organisers to become more actively involved in the establishment of the community watch.</P>
      <P>Although it has been in existence to a limited extent, there is a greater need for closer co-operation between representatives of the Garda and our post primary schools.  The practice of allowing high ranking Garda officers or individual members to talk to leaving certificate students or lower classes about the operation of the Garda Síochána and their views on the co-operation which is needed between young people, the community and the force would be an advantage and I would like to see that development continued.  I want to pay tribute to many individual members of the Garda Síochána who, in their local areas, are playing a role far beyond the call of duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your judgment. Again I appeal to the Minister to examine the three headings I have outlined in my contribution.  There is a need to resume negotiations and dialogue with the Garda <Col N="2352" /> in order to get an acceptance of the measures contained in this Bill.  I hope the House will give this Bill the same careful thought and consideration as was given to the Criminal Justice Act.  From my experience that was one of the finest debates in this House with very genuine and serious comments made by the Minister and ourselves.  I hope this Bill will enjoy the same non-political dialogue and discussion and will produce legislation which can be operated by the Garda and accepted by our citizens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the sentiments expressed by Deputy Hyland but I am sorry to say that his wish will not be granted because this is a limited debate which will be finished in three and three quarter hours.  We spent more than one year debating the Criminal Justice Act and 47 Members, which I thought a very small number, contributed to it.  In this debate I doubt if we will have more than six Members contributing and yet this legislation will bring into force provisions in the Criminal Justice Act.  That is a limitation of democracy.  I was very sad to see that both sides of the House&mdash; Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and Labour&mdash; agreed to limit this debate to three and three quarter hours.  We represent the people and we will not have an in-depth discussion of this Bill.  This is a tragedy and is sad for democracy.  I also regret that Deputy Hyland's contribution was not balanced.  He seemed to dwell on one group and went so far as to say &mdash; I am sure he did not mean it &mdash; that this Bill will give additional powers to the Garda. I think that was a slip of the tongue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>He seemed to base his case on the rural experience of the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An essential function of this Bill is that it should help to redress the balance&mdash; which was the buzz word we used in the Criminal Justice Act&mdash;between the rights of the individual and the powers given to the police to carry out their duties.  The Criminal Justice Act contains many <Col N="2353" /> repressive measures and it was to be hoped that this Bill would compensate for those measures.  It is always difficult to draw the line between giving the police the necessary powers to carry out their duties and still retain essential civil rights and liberties.  However, because it is difficult it does not mean that we should shirk our responsibility in maintaining the essential balance.  The balance between police powers and the rights of the individual is as much a part of democracy as freedom of speech.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister is not present and that some of the officials have left, but I hope they will pay very careful attention to what is being said and that it is not regarded as a foregone conclusion that this Bill, as initiated, will become law.  Many suggestions will be made and I hope they will be listened to very carefully.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a duty to maintain law and order but he also has a duty to ensure that the citizens of the State can go about their lawful pursuits without interference from oppressive authorities. The laws when implemented must not only protect society but must also protect the rights and civil liberties of individual members.  It is widely acknowledged that the law must establish acceptable limits of behaviour of the individual towards the State, but it must also be acknowledged that the law must establish the acceptable limits of behaviour of the State, and therefore its agents, towards the individual.</P>
    <P>In the Criminal Justice Act we have very restrictive measures which define the acceptable limits of behaviour of the individual towards the State.  But this Bill is not as efficient in defining acceptable limits of behaviour of the Garda towards the individual nor does it provide the individual with an efficient, independent complaints system which will ensure that the rights of the individual and of the Garda are safeguarded.  I hope we will produce a Bill better than any legislation obtaining elsewhere in the world and taking into account the complaints procedures obtaining in other countries.  We <Col N="2354" /> can do so if we do not rely on our neighbours to guide us.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the former Minister departed from his promise of establishing a totally independent complaints tribunal, which is what most people want.  I will endeavour to make the case that it is what the Garda want. It is what will be in their best interest because it should be remembered they are citizens also.  Indeed, this is in the best interests of police forces worldwide. We are constantly reminded by right wing elements that if the law is not enforced at all, then all individual freedom will be swallowed up in the ensuing chaos. However, if the law is enforced too harshly, without regard to individual rights, or if those who are charged with its enforcement use their powers in an improper manner, then individual freedom and respect for the law will be consumed in the process.  It was Martin Luther King who once said, &ldquo;Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To put these matters in perspective and to maintain balance I should emphasise that the majority of the members of the Garda Síochána carry out their duties in a fair and proper manner.  But, like any body of individuals numbering 11,000 or 12,000, the force contains some people willing to cut corners, ignore established safeguards, people who may have resorted to violence on occasions or ignored the rights of the individual.  It is because such people exist that we must make every possible effort to safeguard the rights of individuals, providing them with an efficient, independent and fair system of complaining.  We no longer want to hear stories about how an individual, say, fell off a stool, slipped down a stairs or walked into a door.  Apart from doing the individual at the receiving end no good, that sort of thing is of no benefit to our system of justice nor to the good name of the Garda Síochána.  I accept fully that most of the members of the force do not go around manhandling suspects in order to obtain confessions. Therefore it is in the interests of the ordinary, decent, hard working members of the force that people who do wish to <Col N="2355" /> cut corners or to obtain confessions by the use of strong arm tactics are clearly identified and punished.</P>
    <P>There have been some cases of suspects wrongly and deliberately accusing a garda of ill-treatment.  Therefore it is necessary to provide safeguards for the Garda to protect them from such false allegations.  In this Bill we should provide the mechanism through which all legitimate complaints can be dealt with in a fair manner, so that policemen going about their lawful duties in a lawful manner will be protected from such false allegations.  The Mr. Justice Barra Ó Briain report provides an appropriate explanation of this in paragraph 10 where it is said:</P>
    <P>The protection of Gardaí from false allegations of ill-treatment is a highly desirable thing.  We gave thought to the possibility of curtailing the &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; which attaches to allegations made in the Courts.  However, we came to the conclusion that protection of persons in Garda custody and protection of Gardaí from false allegations are two sides of the same coin.  The general view of those whom we heard, and our own conclusion, was that the more difficult it is made for police to illtreat persons in their custody, the more difficult it will be successfully to fabricate charges of ill-treatment against the Gardaí.</P>
    <P>That point might be more clearly illustrated if we draw on that celebrated detective and mentor of former Ministers, the great Sherlock Holmes: if we eliminate all the possibilities for making false allegations of ill-treatment in custody then the ones that remain must be true.</P>
    <P>In order to keep matters in perspective and bring ourselves up-to-date it is necessary to refer to former indiscretions, the present state of the law and the present complaints system.  In February 1977 <i>The Irish Times</i> published a series of articles giving detailed accounts of the ill-treatment of suspects in custody by a squad of detectives commonly referred to as &ldquo;the <Col N="2356" /> heavy gang&rdquo;.  It was pointed out that the safeguards for people in custody had been ignored and abused by this group of interrogators known as the heavy gang since the introduction of the Emergency Powers Act in October 1976.  That group of interrogators used physical abuse and psychological torture in order to obtain confessions.  Psychological torture involved such techniques as keeping suspects in a room with the blinds drawn, the lights on day and night so that they lost track of time, inducing an atmosphere of fear by loud banging, shouts, threats and, sometimes screams from outside the room.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 21 October 1984 gave a series of examples of different cases which I will not go into in any detail.  I mention them merely to highlight such happenings.  That paper mentioned the Kerry Babies Tribunal, the case of Michael Ward, of Christy Lynch, Thomas O'Connor, Amanda McShane and others.  As a result of those actions Amnesty International sent a team of investigators to Ireland in 1977. They examined a total of 28 cases, seven of which related to persons arrested in connection with a particular case.  They issued a report contending that consistency in the nature of allegations by persons arrested at different times in different parts of the country &mdash; in the opinion of Amnesty International &mdash; must lend weight to their validity, as also did the fact that in the preceding 18 months and longer the same officers had been mentioned as being involved in the maltreatment of suspects in reports made at different times in different parts of the country.  There was grave concern on the part of the general public at the activities of this group of gardaí, lest they might represent a growing trend within the force.  People were concerned that the practice of ill-treating suspects in custody was growing because there was no independent system for investigating allegations. The present leader of the Bar Council, Mr. MacEntee, said that in relation to the Garda themselves there was a general feeling within the force that it did not have adequate machinery for getting <Col N="2357" /> rid of members who may be errant and also the belief that the entire force was being left holding the can for people who could not be got rid of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>They are comments of Mr. McEntee as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 14 February 1977.  This is what happens when there is a group of gardaí willing to abuse and ignore individual rights.  Initially an unfortunate individual suffers at the hands of such gardaí, but, ultimately, the force itself suffers as its credibility is damaged and the general public become alienated from them.  It is important to make that point in case members of the force start accusing people like me of being anti-Garda when we are not.  It is in the interests of the great majority of the people in the force to whom Deputy Hyland referred and for their and everyone's greater good.  Even those individuals who would abuse it would see the error of their ways if they had all of that experience not only of what is happening in Ireland but also internationally.  It is very easy to pull together the experience of the western world in the police forces and get the best system from it.</P>
      <P>An editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> in February 1977 observed that it was not right that persons who make serious complaints against any member of the Garda should have to depend on the gardaí and on them alone to investigate these complaints. However much the Minister and the Garda spokesman may proclaim the impartiality of such investigations, the simple fact is that, if there is any possible way out of it, dog will not eat dog.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No, sorry.  Mr McEntee was only one line, one sentence.  That is another sentence from a different article. I am not quoting anyone from outside. This is what we would expect, that a garda would be very reluctant to identify a colleague as a wrongdoer.  This is what we have found in the past.  The editorial that I have just referred to was entitled <i>Quis custodiet</i>?  Who will oversee the guards?  The full phrase being <i>Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?</i>&mdash; who will oversee the overseers?  The answer the Minister for Justice has proposed in this Bill is that they will once again oversee themselves. This has not worked in the past.  It had not the confidence of the people.  It still has not the confidence of the people and it will not have the confidence of the people in future.  It has not got it here, and I will show later that nowhere in the world has this form of investigation the confidence of the people.  It usually results in no blame being attributed to anybody, yet personnel are transferred a few weeks later.</P>
      <P>A recent example of this occurred in the Kerry babies case.  Initially we had the terrible situation where a whole family confessed in great detail to a crime they could not have committed.  Then, following widespread public disquiet, we had the awful spectacle of the tribunal.  However, although the tribunal report exonerated the gardaí involved in the case from allegations of misconduct, the publishing of the report was followed by the transfer of gardaí involved in the case. This is the way such cases are treated, and it does no good for the administration of justice or for those charged with administering the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2359" /> In the report the Minister issued on this case, which was published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 24 October, he referred to these transfers and said: &ldquo;As I have said the gardaí have been vindicated on the major issue.&rdquo;  He said that there were very clearly serious deficiencies in the investigation and that those deficiencies manifested themselves not only in things done or not done, as the case may be, but in attitudes of members at various points, and that the Commissioner informed him that in the interests of the force he considered it right and necessary to transfer these people from their posts. He emphasised again that this was not a disciplinary decision and he added: &ldquo;transfers are made by the Commissioner and not by me.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This does not add up.  We are talking about the good name of the Garda and the individual members of the Garda as well as the people.  A report on that in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 24 October mentioned the names of the different people who were transferred, Detective Superintendent John Courtney, Detective Sergeant Gerry O'Carroll, Detective Sergeant Skelly and Sergeant P. J. Brown as well as Detective Garda John Harrington.  This report says that the transfers followed consultations between Mr. Wren and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Noonan, who had been considering the report which criticised some Garda procedures and practices in the case and was strongly critical of one of the detectives.</P>
    <P>I am not interested here in trying to lay blame on individuals.  The point I am making is that it says that it is thought that the Commissioner would transfer them in the interests of the service.  These people suffered because automatically they lost their detective allowance etc.  If it is in the interests of the service and if the system is wrong &mdash; we are saying that it is wrong and that the necessity of bringing in this Bill proves it is wrong &mdash; and if these people &mdash; professional gardaí who have been carrying out their duties over the last ten years as trained and instructed and operating the system as they are instructed to operate it &mdash; are exonerated <Col N="2360" /> by a judge of the High Court and then transferred in the interests of the force, it seems that they are then being made scapegoats for the system and that they are becoming the fall guys for this case, whereas we want to change the system of investigation.  That should be corrected. We should change the system and we should not take individual members and make them the fall guys for the failures of the system.</P>
    <P>We know that internal investigations by gardaí very often do not work, and that was such an example.  The original internal Garda investigation to resolve the conflicts in the Kerry babies case failed completely, and that is the point I was making.  We must have a system whereby individual members of the Garda cannot be vindictive and cannot take it out on any individual member of the public, or decide to abuse his powers even to the extent of committing perjury in court.  That is what happened in the case against me.  I have personal experience of disquiet and certainly there is disquiet amongst the public at that attitude.</P>
    <P>We must look carefully at the measures contained in this Bill because these are the safeguards that are being put forward to protect our citizens against any abuse of powers contained in the Criminal Justice Act.  We all recognise that law and order are essential to the continuance of civilised life in society.  However, we must not make the mistake of thinking that law and order can simply be imposed from above in a democratic State.  They must arise from the grass roots of our society and be protected by the wise use of authority and the impartial, independent and, of course, incorrupt administration of justice, which is another area we must examine on another day, particularly the political appointments of judges to the benches which have taken place since this State was founded and is a continuing scandal.</P>
    <P>If we do not recognise this and make every effort to protect the civil liberties of our citizens while still protecting our democracy by giving certain powers to the Garda and to our courts, then we will <Col N="2361" /> change from a democratic State into a totalitarian State.  We will end up living in a State where those charged with the task of protecting us from fear will be evoking fear in us and the civil liberties of all our citizens will be seriously curtailed.</P>
    <P>Before going on to point out the obvious shortcomings in the procedures proposed by the Minister it is worth while to examine the present system.  At present investigations of complaints are carried out by a senior officer of the Garda Síochána.  Where a complaint merely refers to a breach of discipline the matter will be dealt with by the Garda Commissioner, but if a breach, of criminal law is found then the matter will be handed over to the DDP.  Mr. Justice Barra ÓBriain said about existing procedure:</P>
    <P>Criticisms of the present system made to us suggested that it was slow, that it tended to deter most complainants, and that it was manifestly unfair in that it depended on investigation carried out by members of the force who might be less than willing to find fault in the behaviour of a colleague.</P>
    <P>Those sentiments will be re-echoed by review bodies around the world in regard to complaints investigated by the police themselves.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 37 of the Ó Briain report makes reference to how inefficient it is having policemen investigating themselves. It states:</P>
    <P>We understand that there is a general complaint that where accusations are made against individual members of police forces there is a tendency on the part of policemen not to co-operate wholeheartedly in the subsequent investigation of the complaint.  The &ldquo;wall of silence&rdquo; which meets the investigating officers may well make any proper inquiry abortive.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to The Police Act, 1984, A Critical Guide published by the Greater London Council Police Committee, Discussion Paper No. 3 which states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2362" /> The Government has persistently ignored demands for a genuinely independent system for the investigation of complaints against police.  The GLC, along with a wide range of other bodies, has advocated this &mdash; even the Police Federation favours such a system.  But the Government has, once again, opted for what it describes as an &ldquo;independent element&rdquo; to the investigation of complaints which provides concessions of little value to public concern about the system.</P>
    <P>I should like now to give some statistics, something Deputy Hyland was interested in.  He referred to the thousands of complaints that would be made in the future. In order to help clarify his point I shall give the following information.</P>
    <P>In 1983 there were 16,231 complaints filed against police officers. Only 10 per cent led to the disciplining of or &ldquo;advice&rdquo; being given to an officer and out of 34 charges which the old Police Complaints Board recommended should be brought, just six officers were found guilty.  This may go some way to explaining why the British Crime Survey showed that less than one in ten people aggrieved by police conduct bothered to make a complaint.</P>
    <P>The GLC has identified four factors responsible for the lack of public confidence in the &ldquo;old&rdquo; complaints system:</P>
    <P>(1)  The police investigate themselves;</P>
    <P>(2)  The Police Complaints Board was too remote and failed to exercise its, albeit limited, powers adequately;</P>
    <P>(3)  The Director of Public Prosecutions may be too cautious in recommending the prosecution of police officers; and</P>
    <P>(4)  Investigations are not conducted thoroughly enough and are not pursued as vigorously as they would be if the offence had been committed by a civilian.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2363" /> There is a lot more evidence to show why the system of the police investigating themselves does not work.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Papers 1974 (House of Commons and Command), Appendix 11, in a memorandum from Mr. K.V. Russell, a senior lecturer at the Leicester College of Education, also referred to this system and spoke about the Royal Commission set on the Police and its objectives.  He said it was to consider...</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the means of ensuring that complaints by the public against the police are effectively dealt with.&rdquo;  These provide a legal framework for the processing of complaints which conforms to the Royal Commission recommendation that arrangements should be devised: &ldquo;which are acceptable both to the police and the public as fair and just, not favouring either at the expense of the other, and not weakening the morale of the police and their resolve to fight crime&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, although theoretically legally adequate, there are three specific deficiencies in the procedure which have caused dissatisfaction. Firstly, the internal nature of the whole process, and the absence of any form of independent (non-police) examination; secondly, the lack of formal provision for conciliation between the parties involved; and thirdly, the use of only two categories for the disposal of complaints.</P>
    <P>He then went into a detailed examination of them and continued:</P>
    <P>From the stand point of the public it appears that investigating officers construct an account which protects the police officer from blame.  In some cases there is evidence to support that this is the role some investigating officers adopt.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to make the point that internationally there is a lot of unhappiness with this system when it is not independent. It appears that we have thrown in the towel once more by taking up the <Col N="2364" /> British system, picking pieces out of it and not taking on an independent complaints tribunal as if we were not able to do it ourselves.  If we have confidence in the Garda and do not have this huge number of cases why should we not do it?  In Britain the population is up to 60 million and about 16,000 complaints were made.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to see that in attempting to provide us with the long awaited independent complaints procedure the Minister did not provide us with a truly independent procedure.  I suppose the Minister is acknowledging the serious criticism of the way in which the present system operates at least to the extent that he is proposing a new procedure.  The Bill should have given us the opportunity of bringing the police and the public closer together by providing an efficient and fair procedure that will discipline those members of the force who are willing to disregard the rights of individuals.  By not doing that, a wedge will be driven between the Garda and the public because the Garda have been provided with significant extra powers in the Criminal Justice Act which will be triggered by the introduction of this legislation, but the public have no significant extra safeguards in the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress that nobody should feel complacent about ensuring that the public will have confidence in the complaints procedure.  It is vital that they should have confidence in the procedure because if that procedure does not enjoy the confidence of the public it will not be utilised, as I have proved.  Such a system for processing complaints is useless because it is just perceived as a way of glossing over any irregularities that may have occurred.  It is worth mentioning that we are bringing in a complaints procedure that is desirable and one of the main reasons is so that we can bring in what many people call unnecessary and very repressive measures in the Criminal Justice Act.  For the last six months I have noticed in newspaper reports that beyond a shadow of a doubt there has been a dramatic increase in solving crime.  There <Col N="2365" /> has been a dramatic fall off in all categories of crime.  The Minister, the commissioner and others have been quoting a fall off of 10 per cent and so on and telling us how great we have done.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some of the claims of the Minister.  He claims a calm in mid-1985, that the drug problem is solved &mdash; the Concerned Parents helped &mdash; and that attacks on the old people were solved.  The Minister claims that the problem of stealing cars has been solved, that gang warfare is under control and that drug barons are behind bars.  He claims that the increase in the number of Garda patrols has reduced crime significantly and that the neighbourhood watch system is working properly.  He claims, too, that there is a new recruit procedure in operation and a new promotional procedure also.  He claims that there are new management structures for the force and new forensic facilities.  If everything is under control, why do we need these extra provisions which will have the effect of alienating the population?  These are oppressive and Dickensian measures that are being foisted on us by the Department of Justice and are supported by some paranoiac members of the Garda despite the fact that the force have our goodwill and total confidence.</P>
    <P>In different parts of the world there are different complaints procedures in existence.  The tendency in Australia in this regard is to use the Ombudsmen.  A widening of the powers of the Federal and State Ombudsmen is being sought in that country in the matter of the investigation of complaints.  The Australian Law Reform Commission recommended that the results of investigations should be referred to the Ombudsmen who would be able to receive complaints directly and who in exceptional circumstances would be able to conduct their own independent investigations.  The Commonwealth Ombudsman, commenting on increasing community pressure for a completely external system of investigation, said that such a system, though likely to be more expensive, was unlikely to be as effective in obtaining a similar degree of co-operation from Australian Federal Police <Col N="2366" /> members.  That factor has been borne in mind in this legislation.</P>
    <P>In the US, the Home Office Research and Planning Unit in a paper published in 1983 considered civilian review schemes in a number of locations in the States and pointed to their lack of success which they said was caused either by the opposition of the police themselves or by failure of the review bodies to command sufficiently widespread public support and use.  They said that the latter to some extent resulted from a lack of confidence that they would carry out truly independent investigations of complaints.  The commissioner of the New York Police drew attention to the practical effect of removing the investigation and examination of complaints from the police and there followed a dramatic reduction in the number of complaints leading to disciplinary action against police officers.  In other words, the effect of having a totally independent complaints commission in the US had the effect of reducing the number of complaints in the first place.</P>
    <P>The Police Complaints Board in Toronto drew attention to the mistrust by some people of the ability of a police officer to be objective in investigating complaints and at the other extreme by some members of the police community if investigations were carried out entirely by civilian investigators.  These are merely some examples of the findings in other countries.  They are outlined in the publication, <i>Police Complaints Board, Final Review Report 1977-1985,</i> which was published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London.  The Minister in his role as guest writer in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 27 October 1984 is reported as saying that with the Criminal Justice Act and the Garda Complaints Bill he looked forward to having, at the end of the day, a system of criminal law and pre-trial diligence in bringing offenders to justice with respect for the personal rights of persons in custody and their dignity as human persons.  I accept that in some cases false accusations of ill-treatment will be made by suspects in order to discredit evidence that has been obtained by thoroughly fair and proper procedures.  I <Col N="2367" /> realise that the police who question the suspect in such cases will be placed in a vulnerable position and I have no wish to see any man who is doing his job properly being maligned.  However, it is important to note the point that was made by Justice Barra Ó Briain at paragraph 10 of his report.  I quote:</P>
    <P>... we came to the conclusion that protection of persons in Garda custody and protection of gardaí from false allegations are two sides of the same coin.</P>
    <P>Various procedures can be adopted to protect the suspect from false allegations. Some of these involve contemporaneous controls which might include provisions such as tape recording and other protections involving procedures that might be invoked after the event.  With regard to contemporaneous provisions, recommendation No. 47 of the Ó Briain report is that when a person is arrested and taken to a police station he should on arrival at the station have assigned to him a member of the force who would be responsible for ensuring that the person is treated humanely and in strict accordance with Garda regulations while he is in custody.</P>
    <P>It is recommended further that the custodial guardian should be one not connected with the investigation or with other police action which led to the arrest.  It is recommended that the custodial guardian would be someone who would be responsible for looking after the prisoner's rights and needs and would have the right to prevent any member of the force, whether senior in rank or otherwise, from ill-treating the person in custody.  That recommendation is not the perfect answer but it is a step along the road to ensuring that suspects in custody and the gardaí involved in questioning them would be better protected.</P>
    <P>There is also a recommendation in relation to tape recordings which is the second and most discussed procedure for interviewing suspects in custody.  The advocates of this procedure claim that it <Col N="2368" /> will provide not only an accurate report of all that was said during questioning but will indicate also the way the police conducted the interview by reason of the court being able to hear the suspect's tone of voice and to determine whether threats or inducements were involved. Those who are against tape recording put forward the argument that the use of this equipment would have an inhibiting effect on the suspect in relation to admissions about the offence concerned and to the gathering of criminal intelligence generally.</P>
    <P>It is argued also that attempts might be made by some suspects to feign assaults or to make reference to false allegations of inducements given before the recording commenced.  I submit that the taperecording of interviews would be of assistance to the Garda and to the suspect.  Tape recording deters, if not prevents, the use of unfair questioning methods that some, and I stress &ldquo;some,&rdquo; gardaí might use.  It should reduce, if not remove, the risk of untrue and unfair allegations being made against police officers responsible for conducting interviews.</P>
    <P>What transpires during an interrogation is vital frequently to a case brought subsequently against the person questioned. It is very important that the court be provided with the best account possible of what took place and a tape recording is one of the best possible accounts that can be provided.</P>
    <P>With regard to the objections put forward by some people that the presence of the recorder would hamper investigation and would enable false allegations of inducements or violence to be made, I should like to refer to the findings of a Royal Commission who visited the USA and Sweden to examine how this procedure worked.  They found that the experience and views of the US investigators was that the advantages of having admissions on tape far outweighed the drawbacks and that, while the presence of a recorder inhibits some suspects from talking, this would not constitute a weighty objection since the subject has a right not to answer questions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2369" /> The Royal Commission found in relation to the argument that suspects might use the tape recordings to attempt to make false allegations that &ldquo;police officers in the United States and Sweden could not recall any incidents in which suspects had tried to use the recording to compromise them.&rdquo;  This helps to put things in perspective.  We have had an unbalanced submission from different quarters.  It might help also to allay some of the fears that members of the force might have in relation to this form of protection.</P>
    <P>Tape recording of the questioning of suspects presents certain difficulties. First, because recordings made in the open or in public places by the use of a portable recorder would often be of poor quality it would be necessary to record the interviews at police stations.  Thus, the effectiveness of tape recording of interviews would initially depend on ensuring that the suspect should be interviewed without delay in a properly equipped police station.</P>
    <P>A second major practical problem which must be faced is that of transcripts. It is difficult to work from the tape itself in the preparation or presentation of prosecution or defence cases.  The courts, the prosecution and the defence, will almost certainly need transcripts if there is not a plea of guilty.  The prosecution and the defence may well want them for pre-trial preparation, even where the case is not going to be contested.  Because of the amount of material that would be produced from some interviews which is irrelevant to the purpose of proving the case against the suspect or is inadmissible evidence which may related to previous criminal offences and because of the problems of transcription, it may not be desirable to provide transcripts of the whole interview.  Difficulties would then arise in achieving agreement between defence and prosecution on which parts of the interview should not be included in the transcript used in the trial.</P>
    <P>While tape recordings of interviews will undoubtedly improve the accuracy of the record of interviews conducted in police stations, there are other changes <Col N="2370" /> that could be made to improve the accuracy of the evidence of witnesses who may be reluctant to go to a police station to have their statements recorded, or statements made by suspects on arrest.  I shall return to that later.</P>
    <P>I should like to continue with other safeguards that can be provided for suspects in custody.  The custodial guardian recommendation and the tape recording of interviews are contemporaneous safeguards for suspects being questioned. The third contemporaneous safeguard could be provided by having a small panel of lay visitors for a police station.  I would envisage that these visitors might be a local doctor, lawyer, clergyman or other responsible citizen within a district or area.  Provided that these people could call into a police station and ask to see suspects in custody it would help to eliminate any abuse that might occur, I suppose in the same way as a member of the visiting committee of a prison would operate.</P>
    <P>It is also desirable that we have controls after the event.  This involves a review of the interview procedure when the case comes to court.  In the United States there is an automatic exclusionary rule which has been used for more than half a century. Its use is justified as a deterrent to unlawful conduct by the police, to prevent prejudice at trial by eliminating certain kinds of evidence and to preserve the integrity of the court by preventing its involvement in illegal activity.  I would ask the Minister to examine this carefully. One of the reasons that the United States Supreme Court felt constrained to develop the rule was to protect the citizen's constitutional right in the face of what has been called a vast abnegation of responsibility in the law enforcement agencies in disciplining themselves.</P>
    <P>Do not think that an automatic exclusionary rule for any breaches of the rule for obtaining evidence should be used. However, since reliability is the primary purpose of the code of practice for interviewing suspects, the reliability of confessions obtained by breaching it must be open to question.  Therefore, it would not be right for statements obtained in breach <Col N="2371" /> of the code to be accepted uncritically and without comment by the criminal courts.  It should not fall to the defence counsel to point out the unreliability of statements obtained by such means.  The judge should also point out to the jury the dangers of acting upon a statement the reliability of which is in doubt due to breach of the code of questioning.  They should be informed that under pressure a person may make an incriminating statement that is not true, that a code of questioning has been introduced to minimise the risk of untrue statements being made and that if they are satisfied that a breach of the code has occurred it can be dangerous to act upon any statement made and so they should look for independent support for it.</P>
    <P>The effect of the wording would be that where a breach of the code has occurred it would be necessary for the prosecution to consider the availability of other evidence before deciding whether it is proper to permit the case to proceed. This would encourage that which is universally regarded as good police practice, namely, that so far as is possible evidence from questioning should be checked and independent confirmation of its reliability should be sought.</P>
    <P>I should like to return briefly to the note-taking procedure and the use of these notes in court.  Part of the difficulty with such evidence is that while it may be prepared on the basis of notes taken contemporaneously and has been written out afterwards and while it is often represented as a verbatim record of the account given by the person interviewed, it is not.  Even very experienced minute takers will not get down a verbatim record of conversations; that can only be done by highly efficient shorthand writers. No written record after the event can be more than a good summary of the main points made unless the interview was conducted in so slow and stilted a way as to allow an almost verbatim record to have been written in longhand.  The Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure who looked at the question of the accuracy of notes recommended that in <Col N="2372" /> all cases where it was not possible to take a verbatim record or full contemporaneous notes of the interview, or where the suspect does not make a written statement under caution, the product of the questioning, if given in evidence, should be represented to the court as what it is &mdash; a minute of the main relevant points.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a minute of the main relevent points made at the interview. The commission also recommended that detectives should be given courses in either speed writing or shorthand, thus helping to improve the accuracy of their accounts of interviews with suspects.</P>
      <P>We also need a provision in the Bill whereby general policy in a district or area can be examined.  Especially in a country with our size of population, it would be a good way of cleaning up the entire area.</P>
      <P>There is also a problem which can arise in the case of a complainant where it is alleged that he must have suffered or witnessed police conduct.  It was emphasised very strongly during the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill that all kinds of people go into police stations and I am drawing attention here to people who are nervous, illiterate, or the uneducated whose fluency of language may not enable them properly to express a legitimate complaint.  I would like the possibility of the board initiating inquiries if it is not happy with certain aspects of a case to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Britain, the Police Complaints Board was established in 1976 and was replaced by the Police Complaints Authority in 1985.  The role of the authority is supervisory, just like that of the board that it replaced and just like the Garda Síochána Complaints Board as proposed in this Bill.  I am glad that the Minister recognised the importance of having the <Col N="2373" /> confidence of the public in the integrity and impartiality of the investigation of complaints and the subsequent adjudication on them.  If he is following those criteria he needs to be very careful about introducing the Bill in its present form which I submit is totally unsatisfactory because it is not independent.  The arguments put forward by the Minister do not hold water and saying that the Garda Commissioner must be involved does not hold up either because, in the final analysis, he applies discipline.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not introduce a system which would have the confidence of the public and the only system which will have the confidence of the public is one which relies on an independent investigation.  To carry out such a procedure it would be necessary to appoint independent investigators.  I should like to make a point now which I will develop later.  I do not see the difficulty outlined by the former Minister in finding people to carry out such investigations if, of course, there is the will to find them.  We have them in other fields, barristers, tax inspectors, customs officers, harbour police and social welfare inspectors and there is no reason for not getting a body of people who would carry out investigations independently. Customs officers, tax inspectors and social welfare inspectors are employed by the Government to investigate cases which can at times be extremely complex. We could recruit people with such skills and, after appropriate training, they could carry out these investigations.  Such investigators would have the benefit of their investigative skills plus the added bonus of not being reluctant to condemn a fellow officer.</P>
    <P>It is all right for the Minister to tell us that the investigations will be carried out under the direction of the complaints board but if the board have not got and cannot get to the bottom of a matter because of the reluctance of an officer to investigate a colleague, then the whole procedure will collapse.  I have demonstrated that adequately by the examples I gave in relation to different parts of the world.  The Minister said that even <Col N="2374" /> if there were no recruitment difficulties, neither the scale nor seriousness of the problem in this country could be said to warrant such an extreme solution which would be far more costly than the solution proposed.  I wonder if we are being offered a cutprice discounted system of complaints which will only make a half-baked effort to solve the problem.  I do not think that cost should be a factor and anyway it would not be great given the seriousness of the situation.</P>
    <P>A former Minister for Finance is now Minister for Justice and we will not argue about figures or hide behind them because we are talking about the freedom of the individual which is one of the bedrocks of a free society.  That, therefore, is an argument which holds no water.  It is not good enough to attempt to solve the problem.  We must make every effort to solve the problem of police misconduct because, if we do not respect the Garda, the law itself will diminish.  It is in their interests as well as those of the citizen that we get this right.</P>
    <P>In October 1974 the Hon. Mr. Justice Donald R. Morand of the Supreme Court of Ontario was appointed to inquire into allegations of misconduct made against certain members of the Metropolitan Toronto Police Force.  One of the issues that Mr. Justice Morand discussed was complaints against the police and in particular the effectiveness of the complaints bureau within the force which was responsible for handling complaints of police misconduct in 17 cases.  Public hearings were held for 14 months and 97 complaints were examined in detail.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Morand criticised the lack of vigour and skill in the pursuit of investigation of citizen complaints by the bureau, its lack of effective supervision and the practice of turning the case over to regular members of the force &ldquo;who may have conflicts of interest and loyalty&rdquo; where a criminal offence is suspected.  We can see that in our own system and I do not have to go into detail. As a people, we do not obey laws or regulations totally until there is a complete breakdown.  I spoke earlier in the week on the Dublin Transport Authority <Col N="2375" /> Bill and I mentioned that the appalling carnage on our roads and our high insurance rates are due to the fact that the Road Traffic Act has not been enforced for the past 16 years.  You can literally do what you like; you can drive with 15 pints inside you; go through a red light and so on.  How, in the name of God, can the public be expected to entrust a secret examination of a complaint to the police? They do not do it in other countries and it should not be done here.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Morand's report also stated that a system must be developed for the prompt, impartial, vigorous and &mdash; he stressed &mdash; independent investigation of such complaints and incorporating appropriate safeguards for the rights of police officers.  I do not think I could ever be accused of neglecting the rights of police officers.  The tag that certain members of the force might like to put on people who are honest or courageous enough &mdash; or maybe mad enough &mdash; to dare to criticise the system constructively would not hold up on the basis of the contribution which I made because I have tried to be as balanced as possible.  Unfortunately, Deputy Hyland seems to have consulted his friendly local cop for his contribution to this Bill and it was totally unbalanced.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Morand's report went on to say that such a system must be highly visible and manned by personnel who command the respect of the force and the public.  He also referred to The Metropolitan Toronto Review of Citizen-Police Complaint Procedure &mdash; Maloney Report, 1975.  This report was carried out by Mr. Arthur Maloney, QC, an Ombudsman for Ontario.  The report concerned itself specifically with citizen complaints against the police and the provision of an effective system for the ventilation and redress of such complaints. His proposals contain a number of recommendations similar to those set out in the commission's first report.</P>
    <P>The principal points of similarity include the emphasis on conciliation, the obligation to report all complaints, the independent investigation unit of the <Col N="2376" /> police, the appointment of an Ombudsman by the Commissioner to act as an impartial filter in the process and the creation of a tribunal to determine the serious cases only in the provision for appeals.  The only recommendation implemented so far is that the complaints bureau has been moved into a separate building distant from police headquarters. The others have not been adopted. Whether one goes from Sydney to Toronto one will find the same thing. Tribunals set up to investigate complaints come up with the same answer &mdash; that people have not got confidence where the police are investigating themselves and are reluctant even to make complaints. Investigations are not carried out with any vigour and enthusiasm.  There is a total dissatisfaction wherever these systems are set up throughout western democracies.  What do we do?  We just follow the leader, perhaps because we have not the confidence to devise our own system.</P>
    <P>All 47 speakers who had an opportunity to contribute to the earlier debate on the Criminal Justice Bill began by saying how much they admired the police force. It begs the question: What are we afraid of?  Why not have an independent complaints tribunal?  We trust them, we love them, they are the greatest, the best &mdash; all kinds of praise is heaped on them, yet in this Bill we are bringing in repressive measures, powers we do not need which will totally alienate the gardaí from the people.  We are supposed to be doing it in the interest of both the police and the people, but the whole thing is farcical.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the abuses in the police force and the treatment of members of the force.  I do not want to delay any further.  I again express my outrage at the short-circuiting of democracy in this House by allowing only three and three-quarter hours and guillotining the Second Stage.  It does nobody any good to carry on in this way.  These are jackboot tactics.  Least of all does it do the new Minister any good.  He does not think it is important enough to come and listen to the debate.  I think the Seanad suspended proceedings during the debate <Col N="2377" /> on the Criminal Justice Bill because of the non-presence of the Minister.  He has reduced this debate to farcical proportions. We know what we are up against and to what extent the contributions, though limited, will be listened to.  It is inexcusable to do this.  We have Fridays, Mondays and Tuesday mornings.  We sit for very short hours and people should be able to contribute to this debate.</P>
    <P>I want to refer finally to the comments made by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties in regard to this Bill.  They regard the Bill as a radically flawed half-measure and state:</P>
    <P>Lacking a convenient procedure for reception of complaints, an independent investigative unit, and a truly adversarial hearing process, it cannot provide a fair and effective system for the resolution of citizens' grievances against the police.</P>
    <P>They go on to mention the practical difficulties. A complaint may be made orally or sent or given in writing to the complaints board at its office or to the police. They state that the Bill inherently compromises the independence of the board by preserving the power of investigation within the police.  They call for greater police accountability, saying that law enforcement practices have become utterly conviction-oriented.  They also declare that an independent investigative unit responsible to the chief executive of the board should be instituted.  They make the point that the process is not genuinely adversarial since the complainant is not allowed to examine the investigation report, to cross-examine witnesses or to have legal aid.  They conclude as follows:</P>
    <P>Plainly, then, a fair and effective complaints system is a matter of great urgency.  It must be able to ensure that the police are held accountable if they violate citizens' rights, to guarantee a fair hearing to the complainant and the accused officer...</P>
    <P>This is the body which operates for the protection of people's rights.  I think they were ignored the last time as well and I <Col N="2378" /> wonder where the Minister gets his advice.  We have come a long way from the Criminal Justice Act.  The whole thing is unnecessary now.  We should have a totally independent complaints tribunal and I do not think the Minister should enforce the sections in the Criminal Justice Act.  It will be a sad day for Ireland when they are introduced.  If we in this House and the people have full confidence in the Garda, the Garda bodies by their submissions and their actions and what they are calling for are saying that they do not have confidence in the people.</P>

      <P>I recognise that there is limited time for this debate so I do not propose to speak at length on the issue.  I hope we will have time to deal with specific sections and objections on Committee Stage and that the Minister and the House will permit a much longer debate on that Stage.  When the Criminal Justice Bill was before the House there was considerable debate over a long period which resulted, in my view, in a Bill which, while not totally acceptable to me, was a better Bill than would have been the case if only limited time had been allowed to discuss it.</P>
      <P>When the Minister introduced this Bill I welcomed it as a step in the right direction. The Workers' Party and I have been insisting on the need for an independent complaints procedure for the investigation of complaints of misbehaviour by the gardaí.  This Bill is, therefore, welcome. When introducing the Criminal Justice Bill the Minister offered this complaints procedure as a means of having accepted in the House the rights of detention and questioning and so forth incorporated in that Bill.  I argued then that this need not necessarily be tied to that legislation because it was required irrespective of the other legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I have reservations about this Bill, I welcome it.  It is important that the confidence of people generally be maintained in the gardaí and it is equally important that the confidence of the gardaí be maintained.  That can only be done if people generally are sure that <Col N="2379" /> when they come in contact with gardaí they will get fair treatment and that if they have a complaint it will be dealt with fairly.  There are parts of this city and probably other cities around the country where the gardaí are not acceptable. There is a feeling among the poorest sections of the community that the Garda are against them and automatically they feel that they are against the Garda.  That feeling has developed as a result of the application of the law by the Garda and there is a feeling among the poorest that there is one law for the rich and one for the poor.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that the vast majority of those who come before the courts are the poor and they are the people who have the least opportunity to defend themselves.  The vast majority of the people in jail come from the poorest sections of the community.  It is little wonder, therefore, that there is antipathy against the Garda who are responsible for the administration of law, as they are seen to be enforcing the rules and regulations of our society.</P>
    <P>An independent complaints commission or board would go a long way to reduce that antipathy against the Garda in the areas I have been speaking about.  Whether it will be an independent board is the most important element in this.  The Bill does not have a provision for an independent investigation procedure. It is still left to the Garda to investigate complaints against themselves, and that is the main complaint we have heard from the people.  When introducing the Bill on 28 January last the Minister argued against an independent team of investigators mainly on the ground of cost.  He said:</P>
    <P>Moreover, even if there were no recruitment difficulties, neither the scale nor seriousness of the problem in this country could be said to warrant such an extreme solution which would be far more costly than the solution proposed.</P>
    <P>That is a very strange approach to this <Col N="2380" /> suggestion.  It seems to me that if the scale of the problem is small it is hard to understand why it should be a costly solution to have an independent body of investigators.  We have the Ombudsman's office and there does not seem to be any problem in relation to cost.  We have agencies for investigating other matters, perhaps not independent, and we are never told of the cost.  I do not think the argument that it would be too costly to have a board of independent investigators appointed is acceptable because the nub of the problem is that the people feel the present procedure is not independent.</P>
    <P>Unless we show in the Bill that we are concerned seriously about this problem and that the board we will appoint will have to appoint independent investigators, this board will not be acceptable and it will not do what we hope it will do, improve the confidence of the public in the Garda, and the competence of the Garda in relation to their duty to enforce the law.  The Garda themselves have expressed a number of objections, and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors have expressed very strong objections.  It would be a mistake for us to ignore these objections.  I do not agree with all of them, but if we are to retain the confidence and morale of the Garda we must not ignore their strong reservations. I hope that on Committee Stage there will be no restrictions on time and that we will be given every opportunity to tease out the various sections in regard to which I, other Members and the Garda have expressed their views.</P>
    <P>The procedure in the Bill for lodging complaints seems very weak.  It is provided that they can be made at Garda stations or directly to the board's office, which presumably will be in Dublin.  Even for people in Dublin it is not convenient to write letters expressing complaints.  In many cases complaints may emanate from people who are not very skilful in using the pen or in expressing themselves in writing.  For people outside Dublin the procedure will seem remote and difficult. To say that people can go to Garda stations is not acceptable.  We are suggesting <Col N="2381" /> the establishment of an independent complaints procedure and though we agree that the vast majority of Garda members are honest, decent men and women who do not overstep the rules or abuse the citizens, the person making a complaint will fear, having come up against a member of the Garda who has not acted in the best interest of the force, that the procedure for lodging complaints at a Garda station is wrong.</P>
    <P>I will be putting down amendments for Committee Stage, but I should like to emphasise that I think the procedure for lodging complaints should be as convenient as possible for the persons who have complaints to make.  It should not depend on the person with a complaint to make having the courage to overcome nervousness to go into a Garda station to make a complaint.  In many cases complainants will be obliged to go into the stations where the complaints may have arisen in the first place.  It is not acceptable that the procedures laid down should remain unaltered.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision to establish a complaints board.  I feel strongly that there must be an independent team of investigators.  I do not go along with the idea that such a board would be too costly.  Even if the Minister could show that a large cost would be involved, it would be worth it to protect both the integrity of the Garda and the confidence of the people in them.  It is only through an independent board that this can be done.</P>
    <P>I should like to read a point made in the report of the Ó Briain Committee at paragraph 59, page 18 where it was recommended that a complaints tribunal with a strong independent element should be set up.  No detailed proposals were made but they stated that, whatever the composition, the membership should be clearly so impartial and above any suggestion of bias that it would earn the respect and co-operation of both the Garda Síochána and the public.  It further stated that to function effectively no effort should be spared to secure the goodwill of several representative bodies. In paragraph 10 at page 7 of the report <Col N="2382" /> the committee came to an important conclusion:</P>
    <P>However, we come to the conclusion that protection of persons in Garda custody, and protection of Gardaí from allegations are two sides of the same coin.  The general view of those who we heard and our own conclusions, was that the more difficult it is made for the Gardaí to ill-treat persons in their custody, the more difficult it will be successfully to fabricate charges of illtreatment against the Gardaí.</P>
    <P>That clearly expresses my view and the view of other Deputies in the House that we must ensure that as far as possible the opportunity for fabricating charges against the Garda should be minimised. As the Ó Briain report points out, that can only be done by ensuring that the opportunities to abuse the powers available to the Garda, the tiny minority of gardaí inclined to abuse their powers, are minimised.  I appeal to the Minister to give ample time for debate on the Committee Stage of this Bill because it is very important to the public and the Garda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not take up much time on the Second Stage debate but, like Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Skelly, I appeal for ample time to be allowed for the Committee Stage debate so that we can be satisfied that the same importance is accorded to this Bill as was accorded to the Criminal Justice Act.  That is important from the point of view of the public and the Garda.  What we are dealing with here is really the most humane way of dealing with people involved in crime and the victims of crime, and reducing the level of crime in our community. We are trying to make the processes easier and to support as much as possible the Garda Síochána.  I echo Deputy De Rossa's point that all of us who debated the Criminal Justice Bill felt it essential for all the reasons I and others have given that this should be an independent tribunal.  It is absolutely essential that impartiality is seen to operate.  In making his Second Stage speech on 28 <Col N="2383" /> January 1985 the Minister said he believed that investigation by a fully independent body was unrealistic.  Why is it unrealistic?  On Committee Stage we will come back to that.</P>
      <P>Cost should not be a priority when we are ensuring that the community are safeguarded.  If we set up the right structures, cost could be reduced in other areas in both human and financial terms. The NESC report entitled The Criminal Justice System: Policy and Performance, No. 77, of December 1984 in trying to look in depth at the criminal justice system here felt that when we were talking about the due process of law it must include openess in decision making, a right to be heard in one's own defence, and impartiality by those making decisions. The due process of law under our Constitution must be applied in all cases and certainly in regard to what we are trying to accomplish in setting up this complaints tribunal.  The Minister's argument that a completely independent complaints tribunal is unrealistic does not stand up to the criteria demanded in the NESC report.</P>
      <P>In relation to cost and our effectiveness in the criminal justice system, a lot of the front line work and risk is taken on by the Garda.  In the structures we are trying to set up we must ensure that the cost of setting up an independent tribunal is offset in other areas at which we have not yet looked.  The NESC report states that our information and evaluation of the system is not a worthwhile base on which to base improvements and reduce costs. The report says:</P>
      <P>Very little is known about the distribution of the discretion exercised by the police in deciding whether a person suspected of a criminal action will be charged or whether the charge will be proceeded with.  Minimal attention is paid to the contribution that social policies can make to reducing avoidable crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These two sentences probably encapsulate what we are talking about with regard to the support of the community <Col N="2384" /> for the Garda and the difficulties they are experiencing in not having a true evaluation of their work and the type of investment and commitment we should be giving to the social policies that will be reducing avoidable crime.</P>
    <P>The setting up of a tribunal which would be trusted by both sides would go a long way towards reducing the cost and would give people who find themselves caught up in crime, or accused of crime and who believe that the system is against them, more confidence in the system. These people consider themselves victims and the tribunal must try to get it across to them that they are impartial.  A great deal of crime, and hopefully it will be avoidable crime, occurs among the lower socio-economic groups, the disadvantaged, those who are not so well educated and do not have much faith in the future.  It is essential that this tribunal should be seen by the people whose lives are most affected to be impartial and worthy of trust.  The tribunal should be accessible and these people should have enough confidence in the tribunal to apply to have their complaints listened to knowing all the circumstances will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>When appointing members of the tribunal, social factors should influence the selection to the board.  I do not intend to go in detail into the judicial system today, but one area which gives rise to most concern is the gap which exists between the people who judge and the people who are being judged.  We must have people with experience of life, with compassion and who are caring, to judge others who have not had the same advantages and who feel that the system works against them.  We can come back to that at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The Garda may feel that in some way this House is attempting to punish them by setting up such a tribunal.  It is essential for the Garda to realise that if they are to operate independently, this tribunal is needed as much for them as it is for the rest of the community.  In the debate on the Criminal Justice Act the point came through very clearly that what was most needed by the Garda was the support and <Col N="2385" /> confidence of the community.  In arguing for this tribunal I would expect the Garda to welcome it because it is not the intention of this House that this tribunal will work in any way against the Garda.</P>
    <P>On page 10 of the NESC report it is stated:</P>
    <P>The consultant argues on the basis of international research that there is no evidence that the size of a police force is related to its effectiveness in controlling crime; instead, the method of policing and its degree of community support appear to be the critical factor.</P>
    <P>That is the cost we should be talking about.  If the crucial factor is community support, then a totally independent and impartial tribunal is what we need and in the long term it will be less expensive than a tribunal of which either side is suspicious and has no trust in it.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister for Justice brought about changes in the training of the Garda.  Because of the change in social attitudes, bringing with it an increase in crime, and sometimes coming from areas where they had no experience of urban life, gardaí are under great pressure.  I believe that with proper training and with confidence in this tribunal the police will be able to get our from under some of these pressures which must have contributed to some of the cases of misbehaviour we have all heard about. The hierarchy of the police is run on a military model.  As somebody who would seek non-violent alternatives, I have serious questions to ask about hierarchical organisations of authority which are run on military models because they do not contribute to the kind of caring and non-violent alternatives we would all like to see.</P>
    <P>Up to now we did not have the right kind of statistics to show us just how bad the crime rate really was.  With this increase in crime there was tremendous pressure put on the Garda to get convictions, to lock people up and to throw away the key.  If results were the priority, that must have put an intolerable pressure on the Garda.  The fact that we have <Col N="2386" /> not yet reformed our judicial system must give rise to a lot of exasperation and frustration among the Garda.  Even more than the rest of the community, the Garda are suffering because of a lack of information and statistics.  They seldom know why cases processed by them end up the way they do.  This must lead to a lack of confidence in the system they are operating.  This cannot be divorced from what we are talking about here today &mdash; the setting up of this tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Minister when referring to a complainant taking a case to the tribunal said: &ldquo;Finally, the complaint must not be frivolous or vexatious&rdquo;.  That worries me because we have to be more definite about how we define &ldquo;frivolous or vexatious&rdquo;. Pressure could be brought to bear on people who were told that their complaint could be seen as frivolous or vexatious. We have to be very definite about how we define that phrase so that people would not be deterred from making serious and justified complaints.</P>

      <P>The Permanent Defence Force have in operation at present 72 saloon cars which were purchased over the past ten years. Details of the total cost involved are not readily available but I can inform the <Col N="2387" /> Deputy that the cost of 11 vehicles purchased in recent years amounted to £102,700.</P>
      <P>Saloon cars are used to carry military personnel whenever possible in the interests of economy and to preserve the more expensive operational vehicles.  I am satisfied that the cost of providing these vehicles is fully justified.</P>
      <P>The provision in the 1986 Defence Estimate is £252.415 million.</P>

      <P>Military transport is requisitioned and allocated in accordance with Defence Force regulations.  That includes the conveyance of military stores and equipment and also the conveyance of military personnel when such personnel are on duty.  In the context of the conveying of military personnel, I should point out that it has been a long standing practice to provide four saloon cars, primarily for the official use of the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant General, the Quartermaster-General and the Assistant Chief of Staff.  This practice derives from the official demands made on these officers.</P>

      <P>I presume that the 72 saloon cars are Army staff cars, that they would not be used for conveying military equipment but rather entirely for the conveying of personnel.  Would the Minister agree that in a State the size of ours a figure of £252 million &mdash; which is greater than the overall Garda budget, less than the IDA budget and equivalent to approximately 12½ per cent of the total <Col N="2388" /> revenue from tax in this State &mdash; cannot be justified to maintain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will alter Army regulations to provide for a more humane and less demeaning relationship between officers and soldiers; if he will impose a ban on the paraphernalia of senior officers such as moustaches, gloves and batons; and if he will reject suggestions of military service or conscription as a solution to the unemployment problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the implication in the first part of the question. Defence Force regulations provide that officers and men will, in their treatment of subordinates, adopt such methods as will ensure respect for authority and at the same time engender feelings of self-respect and personal honour which are so essential to military efficiency.</P>
      <P>The answer to the second part of the Deputy's question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said &ldquo;no&rdquo;. On the first part of the question, would the Minister not agree that there is an excessive show of superiority suggesting superior <i>versus</i> inferior in our Army and that that is evident in the quarters and in the messes, that there is not the same equality as there is, for example, in the Garda force between gardaí and their officers?  It is a ridiculous 19th century carry over, where soldiers of 25 years' service have to bow down and salute greenhorn officers of 20 years of age.  Will the Minister not accept finally, if he said &ldquo;no&rdquo;, that military service is not a solution to our unemployment problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is under a misapprehension on two fronts. Taking the second one first, I do not accept that military service is a solution to the unemployment problem.  In relation to the substantive issue mentioned by the Deputy, he mentioned a moustache as paraphernalia.  I do not accept that either.  That is a purely personal choice by members of the Defence Forces.  It applies to no particular rank and I do not accept, or indeed propose, that action should be taken to deprive people of making individual choices in relation to whether they should wear moustaches. It applies to all ranks and there is no discrimination whatever.  In regard to gloves, that is a prescribed form of dress, again for all ranks and there is no discrimination there.  In relation to the carrying of batons, the only batons carried are those carried by conductors of military bands.  Therefore, I see no discrimination whatever there.  However, in order to preserve efficiency and discipline, which <Col N="2393" /> is badly needed in military service and possibly elsewhere, there is a long standing tradition that officers and men have certain respect for one another and they show it in a prescribed way.  I think the Deputy is under a misapprehension in relation to the implication of his question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may take it from me that as soon as circumstances <Col N="2394" /> permit I will wish to see the 14-day period for training purposes restored.  However, at the moment circumstances do not permit that and the position in 1986 would seem to indicate that the restricted period will continue.  However, I reiterate that the payments will not change. The people participating will be given full credit for the full period when they are eligible for payment.  I accept that personnel participating would prefer to have a 14-day training period.  However, I point out that the seven day period can be of great benefit and it is a question of how efficiently the seven day programme is ordered.  Experience over the past few years would suggest to me that the seven day period is working very well and that benefits have accrued to the participating personnel in relation to weapon training and so on.  It depends really on the efficiency with which the course is organised.</P>

I do not think that is the thing to do.  While I would like to see an expanded FCA force, restrictions are such that at present we cannot contemplate expanding to any substantial extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question No. 5 and Question No. 25, which is a priority question, together.  The question of the replacement of the FN 7.62 mm rifles held by the Permanent Defence Force has been under consideration in my Department including the evaluation of a number of alternative weapons. There are, however, no proposals to replace the weapons used by An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that the present weapons on issue to the FCA, the main weapons being Bren guns and rifles, were being used at the beginning of the last World War and that they are obsolete by any international military standard.  In fact, some of the subversive outfits here are equipped with more modern weapons than are FCA personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is pushing an open door in pointing out the obsolescence of the weapons because I accept what he has said.  Steps are being taken to replace the FN 7.625 and the .303, which is even more obsolete if such could be the case, with what are now regarded as standardised light weapons which are to become the main light weapon in the armies of Western Europe, the 5.56 mm rifle which is now being tested.  We have had tests carried out on a number of alternatives and this seems to be the one most suited for a variety of reasons, including weight, cost and the cost of ammunition.  The phasing in of this 5.56 mm weapon will be taking place shortly.  Exhaustive tests have been almost completed and final evaluations are taking place.  I am referring to the PDF, not Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider issuing the FCA with the same rifles in so far as the existing .303 is a waste of time, energy and finance because separate ammunition is being used by the PDF <Col N="2396" /> and the FCA.  Would it not be a more acceptable financial proposition to be using the same weapons and ammunition in relation to the main weapon, the rifle for both forces?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

The Deputy will appreciate that the cost of such weaponry is very high and we will have to be guided by the availability of finance for this purpose but the procurement programme by the military side has been submitted to me.

Maidir le moltaí a bhí sa phlean i leith Ranna Stáit, tá na céimeanna seo a leanas déanta cheana féin: (a) cuireadh Láraonad Forbartha Gaeilge ar bun faoi stiúrú Rúnaí Cúnta de chuid mo Roinnse (b) cuireadh Coiste Forbartha Gaeilge ar bun i ngach Roinn/Oifig; (c) cuireadh le chéile treoirlínte faoi chur chun cinn na Gaeilge agus an dá theangachais sa Státseirbhís. Cuireadh chuig rúnaithe/cinn oifigí iad.</P>
      <P>D'ullmhaigh Bord na Gaeilge tuarascálacha faoin dul chun cinn a rinneadh sna blianta 1983-84 agus 1984-85.  Cuireadh faoi bhráid an dá Theach den Oireachtas iad.</P>
      <P>Tá an tuarascáil don bhliain dár chríoch 31 Márta 1986 á cur le chéile faoi láthair ag an mbord agus cuirfear faoi bhráid an Oireachtais í sula bhfoilseofar í.  Os rud é go dtugann na tuarascálacha ó Bhord na Gaeilge cuntas ar an dul chun cinn atá déanta i Ranna Stáit, meastar nach bhfuil gá le suirbhé ar leith den saghas a luaigh an Teachta.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Department of the Gaeltacht operate as Gaeilge but, as I have outlined in my reply, steps are being taken in this regard in other Departments.  A central development unit for Irish has been set up in my Department while an Irish development committee exists in every Department. In addition, my Department have issued guidelines on this issue.  There have been reports from Bord na Gaeilge and I am expecting a further report from them for the year ending 31 March.  That will contain comment on the developments from an objective point of view.  It was on that basis that I considered it inappropriate that a separate survey should be undertaken by my Department.</P>

      <P>An undertaking in regard to a general reference to the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector was included in the pay proposals at present being considered by public service groups.  In accordance with practice, such a reference would cover office holders and parliamentarians as well as higher public servants generally. As I announced in the Seanad on 12 March 1986, the Government intend that, when such general reference is being made, the review body will be asked specifically to consider the question of office holders' pensions.</P>

      <P>This arises in the context of a general reference to the review body which arises out of the pay proposals. The Government decided that it was in that context that a specific reference to this question would be made.  I cannot be exact as to when this will take place but the Deputy can rest assured that there will be no delay on the part of the Government and that there will be no delay either in the matter of the provision of full secretariat facilities.</P>

Does it depend on the present attitude of the public service unions to the proposals before them and to whether those proposals are accepted?

      <P>As I have mentioned, the reference to the Review Body on Higher Remuneration arises from a proposal put in the context of the general pay proposals at present being considered by the Public Service groups.  I am anxious and hopeful that these proposals will be favourably received.  It is in that context that reference to that review body is being made.  The decision was made by the Government in the context of that reference specifically to ask the review body to consider the question of office holders' pensions.  I cannot at this stage deal with a hypothetical question that might arise in circumstances such as were pointed out by the Deputy. Obviously, all I can say is that, in the event of such circumstances arising, the matter would have to be reconsidered by the Government.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not accept that this question of ministerial pensions, in particular, has arisen quite separately from that of public service pay?  Certainly the impression which I got from the original announcement was that this issue of ministerial pensions was being referred as a specific item to the review body.  Would the Minister now tell the House that this question will be referred to the review body as a matter of urgency, irrespective of the outcome of the public service pay talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We should be clear when talking about this question.  First, it is quite proper to say, as has always been my opinion, that when a question of this nature arises it is not for me, or indeed anybody in office, to be judge and jury of his or her own case.  I have always felt it to be appropriate in the past that questions of this nature should be looked at independently.  It is important to recall, in case there is any suggestion that this type of question originated only in the last year or two, that the background goes back to the year 1937 when the Shanley Committee examined this whole question and following their report and recommendation, this procedure was put in place by an Act of 1938.</P>
      <P>Since then the general question of remuneration has been looked at twice, again independently by the review body. It is no harm to point out that the review body made it clear, when they last looked at the question of remuneration for Ministers, that they took into account, in making recommendations on remuneration, that there was a pension scheme or superannuation scheme in existence. From that point of view the system has been set up independently, has been reviewed independently, and that is the right approach.  As I mentioned earlier, I am hopeful in the context of the pay proposals that the review body will be in operation pretty quickly.  I am glad to see the review body having the opportunity to examine this whole question, specifically the point raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very wide ranging subject.  First, I welcome the Government decision to refer the matter to the review body.  The quicker there is a reply from the review body, the better.  Normally the Devlin committee reply fairly promptly.  Have the review body received specific terms of reference in this case and, if so, would the Minister put them on the record of the House?  Perhaps that has been done in the Seanad, but it should be on the record of this House.</P>
      <P>Secondly &mdash; and this is the kernel of the matter &mdash; in the statement made by the Government last week reference was made to pension and taxation issues and also in the context of salaries.  The whole history of the case must be taken into account.  In the decision made, there was a link with an alternative to incremental salaries.  Has the Minister asked, in the terms of reference, that this matter should be taken in the context of incremental salaries?  If pensions were abolished in a straightforward manner, which perhaps is desirable if it is what the public wish, they would have to be replaced. There is no section of the population which gives the same salary to one person with 20 years' experience as to another on the first day, with the exception of politicians.  It is very important that any review body looking at the question will not take it in isolation, as Deputy De Rossa has said.  It was never set up as a system in isolation.  It is part of a structure of replacement for an incremental salary system.  Any review must take into account the pay, conditions, salaries and pensions of Deputies.</P>

      <P>The exact terms of reference have not yet been settled.  The proper approach would be for us to ask the review body to look at the remuneration in the overall, fullest sense.  It is also important to bring to the attention of the House the fact that when the review body looked in the past at these aspects of remuneration and superannuation for office holders, they accumulated a large body of evidence and much detail about comparative figures.  I anticipate that it would not be a terribly onerous job for them to bring this information up to date.</P>
      <P>On the point raised by Deputy Ahern, it is quite important to reiterate that at the time when remuneration recommendations were last made they were made on the basis that there was in existence a superannuation pension scheme.  It was made clear at that time that, were it not for that fact, the remuneration proposals would have been considerably higher.  I feel that the review body, which has always consisted of people of the highest standing in the community generally accepted as having no commitments in respect of, or significant affiliation to, any of the groups within their remit, can look at the question in its broadest sense and come up with recommendations which are independent and seen to be so.  We then are not judge and jury of our case. We have an independent body to make their recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, by and large, with what the Minister has said and with most of what Deputy Ahern has said.  When I argue for the issue to be taken separately I am asking for it to be taken separately from the present public service pay talks, negotiations, or deals. I welcome the fact that it has been referred to the review body.  However, I am anxious that the issue should be dealt with urgently.  The Minister is aware of the widespread concern about the manner in which pensions are paid to former Ministers of this House.  That is of keen concern to many people outside <Col N="2410" /> this House who have not received even one week's wages.  I am asking if the Minister would agree that the question of remuneration, allowances, pensions and all their various facets should be referred to this review body as a matter of urgency, separately from and completely independent of the public service pay talks and negotiations that are going on at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I could accept the Deputy's suggestion in that regard even though I share his feelings and would like to see these issues settled quickly.  The Deputy should bear in mind that the reference to the review body is to consider the pay of the higher echelons of the public service generally and it is in accordance with that that the reference to cover office holders, parliamentarians and higher public servants will be looked at.  I am not sure if it would be wise to separate the two and I am also hopeful that the pay proposals made will be accepted which will enable the review body to go into operation quite quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In drafting the terms of reference could the Minister say whether two anomalies will be taken into account? One is that a Member of this House who has 20 years service, who may have experience chairing committees and so on, is on the same salary as a person who comes in here newly elected.  I should also like the Minister to take into account what happens to all other categories of civil servants and those in the public service who receive a pension from a separate job and who are drawing a salary or wage from the public service.  There are thousands of people in that category inside and outside the House &mdash; not in the Chamber &mdash; and throughout the public service.  We are not talking about Members of the Oireachtas but of many thousands of people involved.  I hope the review body will examine the right issues, not those which some people would like them to concentrate on.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>I take it that both Deputies are referring to the draft proposals which emerged in January last.  These followed a protracted series of discussions between my predecessor, Deputy John Boland, and (i)  the Civil Service unions recognised for the purposes of the conciliation and arbitration schemes and (ii) the staff side of the local authority and health services conciliation and arbitration scheme. Details of the package as as follows:</P>
      <P>(i)  25th Round Agreement</P>
      <P>The overall length of the proposed agreement is 18 months with a pay pause of four months from 1 January 1986.  The proposed general pay round consists of a 3 per cent increase on 1 May 1986, 2 per cent on 1 January 1987 and a further 2 per cent on 1 May 1987, giving a cumulative increase of 7.16 per cent.</P>
      <P>(ii)  Special Pay Increases</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  Existing findings on special <Col N="2412" /> increases will be implemented in three phases over the period from 1 December 1986 to 1 July 1988; (b) Other cases may be implemented in three phases over the period from 1 December 1987 to 1 July 1989.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Superannuation Lump Sums</P>
    <P>In the case of existing adjudication findings, superannuation lump sums would be paid as if the findings had been implemented on the dates recommended.</P>
    <P>The following is a summary of the current position:</P>
    <P>(1)  Civil Service: Higher Panel (3,000 approx.)</P>
    <P>The package of proposals was put to the staff panel on 20 January last and was taken away by them for further consideration.  To date no formal response has been received from the higher scheme staff panel.</P>
    <P>(2)  Civil Service General Staff Panel: (27,000 approx.)</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the general council on Wednesday, 19 March the official side in response to a claim from the Civil Service Executive Union offered this package to them and they took it away for consideration by their members in the normal way. It was made clear that this offer is available to all the individual Civil Service unions comprising the staff side of the council.</P>
    <P>(3)  Local Authority and Health Services: (35,000 approx.)</P>
    <P>The package of proposals was put to the staff panel under the local authority and health services C &amp; A scheme on 17 January.  No formal response has been received to date.</P>
    <P>With regard to the possible separation of general increases from outstanding arbitration awards, the Government's position is that there can be no question of dismantling the package and dealing with any of its component parts in isolation. Throughout the negotiations which led to the package, the Government's main priority was, quite simply, cost.  It was clear to my predecessor that a concessionary stance on the 25th round terms <Col N="2413" /> would necessarily entail a restrictive line on special increases and <i>vice versa</i>.  The negotiations took place in an attempt to arrive at a &ldquo;mix&rdquo;, relating to the 25th round, special increases and other pay issues, a mix which would be as generous as circumstances permit and would be designed to satisfy, in so far as it was possible to do so, as many as possible of the priorities and concerns of the two sides.  It was in that context that the eventual package emerged, involving the general increase of 7 per cent and the phasing in of specials.</P>
    <P>The negotiations with the two groups I mentioned earlier concluded on 20 January. The Government then went ahead and made provision for the additional cost in 1986, £68 million, in the budget of 29 January, giving a revised Exchequer pay and pensions bill of £2,652 million. In doing this, however, the Government clearly recognised that their ability to pay was being stretched to the limit and that there could be no question of adding further to the strain on their finances.</P>
    <P>Since then the position of the Government finances has become even more difficult. On the other hand, the package on offer is now much more attractive for the staff because of the major change in the outlook for inflation over the period of the proposed agreement.  Inflation is now projected to fall substantially this year and virtually to disappear next year. When account is taken of the carry-over increase of 1.5 per cent this year which arises from the effects of the 24th round increase in the public service, it will be seen that the package on offer will mean a significant real increase in living standards for all public servants both this year and next.</P>
    <P>Despite these projected falls, the Government stand by the terms of their offer.  As I have already indicated, Government policy in this entire area is dictated by cost factors.  As I have also said, the Government have provided the additional money in 1986 to apply the terms of the package throughout the public service.  A promise to pay which <Col N="2414" /> was not realistically backed up with ability to pay would be fraudulent and worthless. The package on offer is a very fair one and, in the circumstances, I call on the unions to reconsider their position and put these proposals to their members for final resolution.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that no major union has accepted the Government's offer for the 25th round?  Is the Minister saying that the Government will not consider paying the 25th round increase and dealing separately with outstanding special arbitration onwards?  Is that clearly the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  No union has specifically accepted the 25th round proposals as negotiated on 25 January and outlined in my reply.  Deputy Ahern suggests that one could separate the 25th round from the specials and other minor matters.  Experience has been that the cost of some specials can be very substantial and significant and have a quite disproportionate impact on the overall cost of pay in the public service.  For that reason it was decided to get an integrated and comprehensive package linking those elements together.  The overall size of the general round &mdash; 7.16 per cent over 18 months &mdash; was in part influenced by the deal being offered in relation to the specials. I referred in my reply to getting the right mix between the two.  It is not possible and it is not the Government's intention to separate this pay offer so that the general round could be considered by unions and the specials considered in isolation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since October last the Government have gone through considerable discussion and negotiation with various unions.  We would have preferred to deal on a broad base with one general group.  We have at all times attempted to negotiate an integrated, comprehensive package with only one limiting factor, namely cost.  We have put on the table, honestly and openly, the best possible offer which is available to the public service which we know we can pay and will stand up in terms of the Book of Estimates before the House.  To do anything otherwise might in the short run enable some kind of agreement to be reached <Col N="2416" /> but it would be totally fraudulent and misleading to the House.  The offer cannot be improved.  I have to hand the statement issued today in relation to the mid-February consumer price index.  The rate of inflation is 4.6 per cent but it will come down to just under 3 per cent.  The offer has actually improved between 20 January and now.</P>

      <P>The position has drifted on since 14 August and it is time to get down to the bottom line.  I take it the Minister is stating that the 25th round offer of 7.16 per cent over 18 months is non-negotiable and that he is rejecting the argument put forward by some of the unions that it should be taken separately from outstanding special arbitration awards.  The Minister's predecessor stated last August that there would be no increase in 1986 but now the Government are talking about 7 per cent, although the inflation rate had dropped.  What is the Government's latest thinking?  I do not want to be discourteous to the Minister who has been newly appointed to this office but the Department of the Public Service have changed their view on at least five occasions since last August.  Is the 7 per cent negotiable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me clarify the word &ldquo;negotiable&rdquo;.  The package was negotiated by my predecessor on behalf of the Government, working to a Government brief cleared at Cabinet, with the various union representatives in the three main panels.  Substantial, detailed and long negotiations took place between both sides and the package described in my reply emerged.  It was taken away for further consideration and our understanding was that it would be put to members in the normal way.  That has not been the case with a number of unions but one of the unions has now decided to do so, some weeks after 20 January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been some suggestions that this Government are trying to divide and conquer or act in some way as an exploitative employer of thousands of employees <Col N="2417" /> in the public service who give constructive and marvellous service to the nation. We have one constraint only, that is, the ability of the taxpayer to pay.  There is no other factor, no reluctance or impediment. We have put on the table an offer which on 20 January was the best possible offer that could be made.  That offer has actually improved since then, having regard to the projected rate of inflation and the fact that the cost of living will be falling, while the rate of inflation will be zero or minus zero.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Between 14 August and 20 January the Government moved from zero to 7 per cent.  Two months later the offer is still 7 per cent.  Is that figure negotiable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Deputy is looking for a curt reply, the answer is that it is not negotiable.</P>

Is it not also true that over £14 million is owed to this country by the United Nations from three different funds?  Would the Minister agree that, if this money were available to his Department, it would go a long <Col N="2418" /> way towards providing part of a new headquarters and new equipment?  Can he inform the House of any plans to exert pressure on the UN to ensure that those who owe money to the various funds will make their contributions to ensure that Ireland, a small nation making its financial and military contribution to world peace, will get due and fair recompense?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept that we are owed something in excess of £14 million for services rendered in the peacekeeping area in the UNIFIL force and also in Cyprus and as far back as our operations in the Congo.  We are owed that because other UN member nations do not, for some reason, see fit to pay their contributions to the UN as we do, an enormous contribution in terms of money and peacekeeping through our personnel in different areas.  It is unfortunate.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked me what plans I might have.  This is primarily a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs who loses no opportunity in his contact with the Secretary General, privately and in consultation with other member states, to impress on all concerned the importance of contributions being made by member states.  It is difficult to say how far we can go to pressurise the Secretary General if he has not got the money in the form of contributions from member states.  It is a serious matter.  We are pursuing it and in the current year we have written in £7 million in appropriations-in-aid, a provision for receipts from the UN for the current year.</P>

As regards the annual cost of these pensions, my Department recently completed a study which has been actuarially examined and which concludes that no significant change in real terms is expected over the next 30 years.

    <Title>Gárda Síochána (Complaints) Bill, 1985: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I was stressing the importance of the complaints tribunal from the point of view of the public generally and the Garda.  The tribunal must be so formulated that it will have the confidence of the people.  I referred to the Minister's Second Stage speech earlier.  He said that complaints reported to the tribunal should not be frivolous or vexatious.</P>
      <P>We must realise the type of atmosphere in which complaints would arise. The Minister said there need not be intimidation or violent behaviour towards somebody.  There must be common courtesy in dealing with people being interviewed by the Garda.  That is very important.  Deputies pointed out that many people have to come before the Garda and the courts and a large proportion of them come from disadvantaged environments and are deprived from the point of view of availability of information and education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not wish to over burden this body with complaints that might not be serious, but we must consider the attitudes adopted by some gardaí towards people whom they may suspect of crime. It has been put to me again and again by people living in the less privileged areas that the manner used when gardaí go into estates is much more careless than the courtesy extended in the more independent middle class areas.  It should be the reverse.  Educated people know their rights, do not lack confidence and are not as easily intimidated.  This should be <Col N="2477" /> included in the safeguards and should be taken into account in training gardaí.</P>
    <P>This House will be reminded painfully of the psychological pressure to which people can be subjected when held in detention on looking back to what is now known as the Kerry babies case where people confessed under psychological pressure to crimes they did not commit. The lesson learned from the Kerry babies case must be translated into safeguards by the independent complaints tribunal. We also emphasise that what must be kept in mind is that we must achieve the highest possible support for the Garda. It is not the strength of the Garda but their deployment and their treatment of the community which give the results we all want in lowering crime rates and in treating our people equally.</P>
    <P>I am aware that we are running out of time and that a great number of other speakers want to speak on this.  I noted that towards the end of his speech the Minister said he would introduce safeguards. We hope to debate those regulations here as soon as possible.  In setting up this tribunal we are giving power that could be so open to abuse that it will cause serious worry for us.  In line with that we must have clearly defined safeguards which can be recognised by the public at large so that when people are in custody they will know their rights and will not be unduly intimidated.  That can only reflect positively on the Garda because people who do a good job should not be subjected to frustration and should not be smeared with the bad behaviour of others.  The tribunal along with the safeguards will sort that problem out.</P>
    <P>We can never underestimate the positive effects of safeguards.  Some years ago an experiment was carried out in a police station in Britain.  The police were flexible enough to allow a 24 hour visual and sound recording of the events in the station.  The public had an opportunity to see the recording afterwards and one of the dramatic highlights in it was how a woman who claimed to have been raped was treated by the police in the station. This recording brought the police and the public up with such a jolt which could <Col N="2478" /> not have been equalled by any thesis or written submission, that police behaviour has been changed towards rape victims and a whole set of safeguards has been laid down.  At long last the Judiciary realise that there must be a change of attitude towards rape victims.</P>
    <P>Everything we are saying about independence and impartiality in relation to this tribunal translates into a much fairer and more informed implementation of justice so that the community will support the gardaí and the gardaí will be seen as being part of the community.  On Committee Stage I shall again urge the independence and total impartiality of such tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the opportunity to speak on the Criminal Justice Bill as it passed through this House and I will now speak on this Bill.  It has taken a long time for the Government to introduce this Bill.  The Criminal Justice Act gives the Garda new powers of arrest and detention.  It enables the Garda Síochána to arrest and detain persons in Garda stations without being charged for periods of six, 12 or 20 hours.  When introducing the Criminal Justice Bill the Government said that the provisions giving increased powers to the Garda would not be implemented until such time as the new procedures dealing with the handling of complaints against the Garda were in operation.  This was a wise decision but it has taken far too long to bring the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill before this House.  Section 1(2) of the Criminal Justice Act provides that an order shall not be made in respect of sections 4, 6, 8 and 10, 15, 16, 18 and 19 until legislation is enacted relating to investigation of complaints from the public against the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that new powers are necessary but the high levels of crime made them inevitable.  The real problem is to balance the legislation to give extra support to the gardaí to enable them to curb the escalation of crime while at the same time protecting the right of the citizen. As legislators we have a duty to ensure that this country is not turned into <Col N="2479" /> a police State.  We must have balanced legislation to protect the citizen and to give the general public faith in the ability of the Garda to carry out their duty in a fair and impartial manner.</P>
    <P>We must give our full support to the Garda in carrying out their duties.  We live in difficult times and the hardened criminal is part and parcel of our society. The Garda must have every co-operation through legislation and the support of the people to safeguard the community.  On the other hand the Garda in their role as protectors of the State must adhere to standards and obligations which are not unacceptable to the people.  We need a totally independent complaints board in order to deal with complaints against the force.  The words &ldquo;totally independent&rdquo; are very important if the complaints board is to work.  I am very disappointed that the Minister does not agree with the suggestions from all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>The Garda complaints board could not be described as independent when the Minister intends the seven member board to contain the Commissioner, or his deputy or an assistant commissioner. Many politicians believe that no member of the force should be entitled to be a member of the proposed board.  The general public will lack confidence in the board's ability to be fair in its dealings with complaints against the gardaí if it contains a member of the force.  They will say its conclusions are biased.  Whether this is right or wrong, the public feel the board cannot be fair, impartial or independent if a member of the force is sitting on the board.  The Garda would have a better image if they were not represented on the board.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years the image of the Garda has become tarnished by the irresponsible actions and low standards of a minority in the force.  I accept that the number of such incidents is small when compared with the overall strength of the force but, with the exception of the very small percentage of the image tarnishers, the competence and standard of the Garda force have always been very <Col N="2480" /> high.  The fact that there have been undesirable incidents which have caused widespread public concern and alarm, justifies setting up a complaints board but it should be independent.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the public will see the fact that the Commissioner has a place on the board as ensuring that the garda, against whom the complaint is made, will be reasonably well protected because, it is with the Commissioner that the buck stops in relation to the competence of his force, and they will say he is not in a position to make a fair judgment.  They will see it more as an internal inquiry.</P>
    <P>The perception of Garda internal inquiries in recent years has not been accepted by the general public.  There has been widespread alarm at some of the internal inquiries which have been carried out.  The public see some of them as a bit of a joke and as a cover up.  We all know about the Kerry babies case.  There was an internal investigation which failed to satisfy the public or the politicians and we ended up with a judicial inquiry which cost the State a very large amount of taxpayers' money.  At the end of the day the image of the Garda was completely tarnished and the public considered that they did not have any great trust in internal Garda inquiries.</P>
    <P>We also heard of a person who died in Garda custody &mdash; the Shercock case. There was an internal Garda investigation, but the results were inconclusive. We also had the Bunratty case where allegations were made about the involvement of the Garda and of a subsequent cover up.  This internal investigation left many questions unanswered and has created deep divisions among Garda families in that area.</P>
    <P>All this doubt and public disquiet could have been avoided if we had had an independent board free of Garda involvement which could have investigated these allegations and complaints against the Garda.  I hope the Minister will look again at the possibility of setting up such a board which we feel will serve the best interests of the Garda and the public.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2481" /> Another area of concern is the membership of the board.  The Minister mentioned a chairman and six members.  He suggested two members from the legal profession with at least ten years experience, which is a very good idea.  I suggest a medical representative should also be a member.  In the past there were claims against the Garda of injuries, mental stress, psychological and other effects on people held in custody.  For that reason it is essential that a medical person be a member of the new complaints board.</P>
    <P>If the Garda are to survive as protectors of the State we must have community support.  In these difficult times of crime and vandalism we hear a lot of talk about community policing and neighbourhood watch, all good initiatives in their own right.  In recent years we have had many cowardly vicious attacks on old people and the Minister, politicians and community leaders are calling on the general public to become more involved in the fight against crime and against such atrocities.  There are calls for greater liaison between the Garda and the public.  If we are to solve the problem of crime we must involve the community because they will know who is responsible and will be in a position to work with the Garda to enforce the law.  If we encourage community interests to become involved in this area, they too must have a place on the board.  The Minister should look at this seriously because on Committee Stage we will be putting forward amendments to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not intend to make these people members of the board, who does he intend to appoint?  I hope it will not be composed of political hacks or jobs for the boys.  I hope that practice has gone forever.  Different Governments down the years ruined many good ideas by appointing such people.  People were put in charge of institutions who were not capable of running a corner shop.  That is completely wrong.  I hope the Minister will approach this problem in a reasonable manner and will take on board some of the suggestions I and others have made to ensure that we will have a board in which the people can have trust and <Col N="2482" /> which will serve the best interests of the public and the Garda.</P>
    <P>The Ó Briain report called for the setting up of an independent system for dealing with complaints against the Garda by the public.  He said any such independent board would have to have the blessing and goodwill of the Garda if it was to succeed.  The Garda are not too happy with certain sections of this Bill particularly those sections dealing with the right to remain silent.  Sections 7(9) and 14(6) compel them to answer questions in the course of investigations.  This is an exceptional measure and the Garda objections should be seriously noted by this House. These sections go far beyond what is applicable to ordinary citizens.  Questions can be asked about a garda's private life, his family life, his business or financial affairs.  This type of pressure is totally unacceptable and at the end of the day will probably discourage the garda from carrying out his duties.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Garda should answer the complaints brought against them, and they will be expected to co-operate fully, but the danger is that the proposals in this Bill intend to achieve more than that. They leave the force very vulnerable and open to attacks and silly accusations that would allow the public to compel gardaí to make disclosures about aspects of their personal and private lives which are universally regarded as private.</P>
    <P>These are areas about which the Garda have serious reservations.  The Minister has had sufficient time to have discussions with the Garda to ensure that those problems were overcome.  On Committee Stage I hope we will be able to discuss this matter further with a view to seeking solutions to the problems at present being highlighted by the force.  Enforcement of law and order is in need of radical change if we are to survive the ever-escalating crime rate.  Indeed, when one examines the overall position in relation to crime and the problems confronting the Garda one could not but be concerned at the length of time Garda recruits spend training. I do not believe it is sufficient to meet the ever-increasing demands being made on the force.  As legislators we have a <Col N="2483" /> duty to ensure that the Garda receive total support and also that the public feel confident of their right to make complaints about the Garda.  We must maintain a balance in legislation which will ensure that the Garda can go about their daily duties while, at the same time, the rights of the citizen are protected.  Indeed it could be contended that a garda at present fulfils the roles of a social worker, communicator, educationalist and youth worker in his dealings with the different types of criminals and crimes committed and the problems confronting him.  We should ascertain how we can improve the overall educational process of the Garda, enabling them to combat the problems facing us.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Prendergast for allowing me to speak; I understand his name is on the list also. As somebody who served with the armed forces on the Border I have seen at first hand the work undertaken by the Garda Síochána, particularly from the year 1969 onwards.  I fully appreciate the efforts they make on behalf of people, particularly in Border areas, the frontline of defence of the country, against terrorism and all sorts of serious crime.</P>
      <P>During Question Time I was horrified, to say the least, to hear a Member suggest that we might eliminate the Army.  I wonder does the Member concerned understand that the Army and the Garda Síochána have given 100 per cent support to democratically elected Governments of the day since this State was founded. Never at any stage was that in doubt.  It should be remembered that we here who enjoy the privilege of free speech would not have that privilege were it not for the Army and Garda.  That sort of talk on the part of a public representative is the sort of thing that creates unease within the force.  This House must indicate clearly its uncompromising support for the Garda and Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill has given rise to a certain amount of unease.  I have been looking up the records and speaking to people at every level in the force. <Col N="2484" /> Listening to public statements one would be forgiven for thinking that there was no form of disciplinary code within the force.  It could not be contended that in other sections of the community, in industry or the services, there is a more strict code of discipline than that obtaining within the Garda Síochána.  If one goes back to 1972 one finds that there were three members of the force dismissed and 49 fined, that in 1985 there were four dismissed and 107 fined, whereas in 1984 there were 17 dismissed and 103 fined.  That is a very high proportion measured by any standard.  That clearly demonstrates to me that the system of discipline obtaining within the force &mdash; whatever difficulties it may have presented &mdash; had a good track record.  Certainly the figures I have obtained from 1972 onwards demonstrates that it operated satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>I believe, and have believed, that this Bill is not necessary, that an up-dating of the existing complaints system within the force would have been sufficient.  On the last occasion to which we debated this matter I said I felt this should have been done by negotiation between the Garda Síochána, the Minister and departmental officials, that all that was needed was an up-dating of the existing regulations.  I am quite satisfied that such negotiations would have succeeded.  However, once again, pressure groups have forced politicians into producing an unnecessary Bill. Indeed, this has created within the minds of the Garda and the general public a fear that people are being abused wholesale by members of the force, which is just not the case.</P>
    <P>One must remember that the Garda deal with criminals daily and that anybody who upholds the law need not be afraid of them.  It is only those who break the law who need harbour such fears. While a person always must be regarded as innocent until proven guilty, we see more and more in our homes and streets, particularly in urban areas, incidents of attacks on old people and young girls by thugs and groups of people who move from one place of entertainment to another simply to cause trouble within <Col N="2485" /> the community.  It is within that atmosphere that the Garda must operate.  As public representatives we must demonstrate clearly our full and absolute support for them in their difficult task.  Of course there are members of the force who break the rules and the law &mdash; they are only human beings like the rest of us &mdash; and when they do so, they should be dealt with in accordance with the law. They should not be disadvantaged any more than an ordinary member of the community; the rules of behaviour and procedure should be equal in all cases.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that the provision of this Bill will mean that the Garda will have to spend more time dealing with complaints, more time defending themselves, introducing additional legal procedures within the system than dealing with criminals.  The danger is that they could spend more time defending themselves against frivolous complaints than with criminals.  Hardly does a day pass now but we hear reports in the media of armed confrontation and robberies.  On most occasions the Garda are involved in such happenings, unarmed, dealing with people who have no hesitation in shooting and killing them.  I believe that the existing system of complaints against the Garda is more than adequate.  Now that the Bill has been introduced I would suggest that the Minister give very serious consideration to its provisions.  On Committee Stage I will be putting down a number of amendments, as I am sure will other Members.</P>
    <P>The length of time within which a complaint can be lodged &mdash; six months &mdash; is ridiculous, to say the least.  No employer or trade union would accept that an employer could dismiss an employee six months after a complaint had been made against them.  Whilst the Garda have representative bodies at various rank levels, they have not the right to strike, therefore they are not protected by law in that regard.  They must depend entirely and absolutely on fair play within their organisation.</P>
    <P>There are dedicated representatives of the public who will complain consistently about members of the Garda.  I meet <Col N="2486" /> them regularly in my constituency and I am sure Deputies from other constituencies will agree with that.  Very often when checked out the complaints are found to be not only frivolous but false.  Frequently we find public representatives making statements against the Garda Síochána without checking out the facts properly.  The fear I have is that gardaí may have to spend so much time defending themselves against frivolous complaints with no means of paying for what could be a very costly defence system. There should be some arrangement whereby effectively a complaint would be first investigated on the same basis as within the trade union end by a rights commissioner or somebody skilled in that way who could advise the tribunal as to whether the case should be heard.  As submitted by the Association of Garda Sargeant and Inspectors there is no means within the Bill of terminating a hearing of a complaint against a garda. In other words, a guy could simply emigrate or disappear and there is nothing in the Bill which provides that as a result of that the case could be terminated.  One question that must be answered, is how do you conclude in the middle of the investigation of a complaint if the tribunal discover that false information has been given or that key witnesses in the investigation are not available, do not turn up or make themselves scarce?</P>
    <P>I thank my colleague again for allowing me the opportunity of a few minutes and I reserve my main comments for Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill which, of course, should have been brought before the House long before now.  At least it has reached us.  This Bill is introduced as a consequence of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 which provides that an order shall not be made in respect of sections 4 to 6, 8 to 10, 15, 16, 18 and 19 until legislation is enacted relating to the investigation of complaints from the public against members of the Garda.  Therefore we have this Garda Complaints Bill before us.  Over the years <Col N="2487" /> since the State came into being gardaí in this community have had a very high standing, and rightly so.  The Garda have played their role in looking after the interests of the people very well indeed. However, over the last decade or so they have come under severe pressure due to change in society.  We have had cases such as the Kerry Babies, Shercock, Bunratty and so on which have brought about a certain amount of doubt and questioning about the members of the force.  It is important that the confidence that was always there in the Garda should be retained and improved and one way to do that is to set up an independent complaints board.  The complaints body which the Minister referred to would not be seen as independent due to the fact that the Commissioner, or one of his assistant commissioners would be a member of that board.  I do not wish to cast any slur on either the Commissioner of today or the Commissioner or assistant commissioner whoever he may be at any time, but I feel that certain sections of the community would make hay of the fact that if the Garda are represented on this complaints body then this board would not be independent.  For the confidence and trust in which the Garda should be held a completely independent board would be most beneficial for the Garda Síochána themselves.  The board should be free of Garda involvement and should investigate independent allegations and complaints against gardaí.  I hope the Minister will look again at the possibility of such a board as we on this side of the House and many other Members have referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another area of concern in this Bill is that the Minister in his wisdom does not see the inclusion of a representative of the medical profession or community representatives on the board as mandatory. He talks about having the legal profession, up to two in number, of at least ten years qualification, as ordinary members of the board.  It is essential, I agree with him, that we have experienced legal persons on the board, but I ask him if it is not vital that a medical person be <Col N="2488" /> on the board as in many cases claims are brought against the Garda for injuries. People claim mental stress and other psychological effects, and if a complaint is brought before a court it is important that a person with experience in both psychological and physical medicine be there to advise and adjudicate and help the other members of the board in making a decision.</P>
    <P>In this day and age a good thing is happening in our community.  People are taking a more active part in helping the Garda in the policing of their own areas. Community bodies throughout the country are taking a very active part in neighbourhood watch and so on.  It would be good if the Minister would take note of this and place a member of one of these voluntary organisations who are organising all these watches and so on on the board.</P>
    <P>A matter which worries many gardaí is the question of the right to silence which it seems the Bill intends to do away with. The gardaí who, like the rest of us, are citizens of the country, have a right to silence in relation to private and family matters and when accused of criminal activities, and they should not be allowed the right to silence in relation to the carrying out of their duties.  In relation to the other matters they should have the same rights as the rest of the community. Gardaí fear that the relevant section in the Bill will open up questions and that they will have no right to hold the normal silence that everybody else in the community is allowed to hold.  It is important to allay the fears of the gardaí, which perhaps need not be as great as they seem to be.  However, there is always the possibility of an individual abusing the spirit of the law and, by using the letter of the law, causing great wrong to individuals.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the recording of questioning.  The use of recorders by themselves could cause great problems to individuals.  There is no doubt that certain sections of the criminal class are highly educated and know all the tricks of the trade.  One can be sure that during an investigation they would not be above <Col N="2489" /> pretending that they were being assaulted.  If a garda does not have any independent way of showing that an assault did not take place he could be dismissed from the force or his promotion prospects destroyed.  It is vitally important that a video tape of the proceedings be made in conjunction with a tape recording.  One without the other should not be accepted.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the fact that a person has six months to make a complaint.  As Deputy Bell stated, that is an inordinately long time to have to wait. After six months a person may make a complaint out of the blue and there may not be any record of that individuals visit to the station.  A garda may not know what the complainant was referring to. The Minister should reduce that period significantly.</P>
    <P>I do not believe frivolous complaints will be made to the board although the impression is being created abroad that, as a result of the provisions in the Bill, there will be an increase in the number of frivolous complaints.  I have no doubt that most complaints will be dealt with at local level but there may be a concerted effort by certain individuals to cause trouble.  The Minister should consider granting legal aid to gardaí against whom consistent complaints are made.</P>
    <P>In this day and age of specialisation in every walk of life there should be a more in-depth form of training for all members of the force.  Fianna Fáil had plans to provide facilities for further training at Templemore but I understand they are at a standstill.  However, when inflation goes down to zero the Minister will be able to provide the necessary funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally I preface my remarks, like most Deputies on this <Col N="2490" /> side of the House, by saying that I welcome a Bill before us but like a number of other Deputies, such as the distinguished Member and former Lord Mayor of Dublin, Deputy Michael Keating, I have reservations about the need for certain provisions in the Bill.  A police force is one of the arms of a democracy and rests on the will of the people, like the Army in our position, as outlined by Deputy Bell.  The structure of police in Ireland, which came into being in 1836 through the development of the Irish Constabulary was, in terms of the time, unique because it was a very clever amalgam of models which operated in Britain and in Europe at the time.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to one of the most excellent and definitive analyses of the position in Ireland over the last 20 years, as published in the spring edition of <i>Studies,</i> an Irish quarterly review.  That analyses was compiled by Thomas J. O'Reilly, a chief superintendent in the Garda Síochána.  I suggest that those referring to crime, lawlessness or vandalism in Ireland at present should read that article.  Most Members will remember that it is the first principle of science that everything has a cause and an effect.  It might be well for us to bear in mind that a great deal of the criticism of the Garda Síochána is ill-founded and, in some cases, naive because those concerned do not understand what led to the present position in Irish society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Superintendent O'Reilly pointed out that when the structure of police in Ireland came into being in Europe it was thought that the police not only enforced laws but frequently made them too, and, as with a good and wise father, police were trusted on behalf of government to make the right decisions for what was good for society in matters of order, cleanliness and right living.  In England the model eschewed government control and policing was seen to derive its function from a community's desire to regulate itself.  The position in Ireland was different and up to the time when the Constabulary was replaced by the Irish Free State Government there were no great changes from what obtained since <Col N="2491" /> 1836.  In fact, the only difference that has obtained since then is the decision by our native Government that policemen should not be issued with firearms, except in the case of some individual members. They lived under what might be described in present day terms as draconian conditions. The rules required members of the force to live in barracks.  They were forbidden to discuss crime and enforcement policies and practices with other members of the community.</P>
    <P>It was left to the police, as a result of that, to run the country.  That was fine up to about 20 years ago when a combination of circumstances led to the present increasingly unsatisfactory position.  We need not go overboard about the position but at last week's meeting of the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism I asked the members of the Garda advisory panel who met our committee, about the position here between the general public and the police authorities.  I expressed the opinion that I thought that because of the strong spiritual ethos which prevailed up to 20 years ago, and to a large extent to the present day, Irish people were, <i>per se,</i> amenable to law and order.  I am told that while the position here is relatively satisfactory <i>vis-á-vis</i> the rest of Europe and the Western world we are nonetheless moving into a position where some aspects of crime will, if we do not do something effective about them, finish up as bad as anything known in Western society.</P>
    <P>There are reasons for this decline because in Irish society as well as in other societies there are people who are anticleric, who have a kind of vocabulary of abuse which they apply to people who comment on a religious-sociological dimension to society.  There are people who sneer at the mention of any such dimension and as someone said once, it is difficult to rebut a sneer.  In America the sociologists are now lamenting the passing of the Tammany Hall arrangement in American politics though that arrangement was much criticised when it was in existence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point that sociologists are saying now that because of the decline in spiritual influence in Irish society and because there has been an absence of any consequent respect for the civil authority to fill that vacuum we are now experiencing so much crime and so many other problems. There is increasing urbanisation and higher expectations in terms of material rewards.  The police force are faced increasingly with the kinds of decisions that they never had to take before and they are being criticised by the public. Consequently, the Garda are rightly indignant about the measures proposed in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a measure which was in some way a reaction by the previous Minister. After putting through the Criminal Justice Act, despite the amount of criticism from the people to some of the measures in the Act, I presume the then Minister considered it necessary to introduce something on the lines of this Bill in order to meet the criticism of actions of some gardaí, instances of which have been given here, notably one instance that occurred not too far from my area. I refer to the Bunraty case where a deep suspicion hangs over members of the force.  There were other instances, too. We must strike a balance in these circumstances. In a free society we must be fair to people and ensure that a suspected offender is given every opportunity that is based on the old maxim common in western society that one is innocent until proved guilty.  At the same time, we must remember that because we are a free society, and elect a Government to represent us who in turn provide an army and a police force as the arms of democracy, the vast majority of people who are lawabiding citizens should be free to walk the streets or do whatever they wish without the fear of being mugged, robbed, raped or beaten up.  Law abiding citizens should be free to sleep in their beds in the enjoyment and comfort of <Col N="2493" /> their homes without the fear of being attacked by intruders.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, because of the reprehensible actions of some gardaí, people who would not be too concerned about the tenets of democracy either in this or in any other country will accuse the Garda in general of actions that are wrong.  As the elected representatives of this democracy we should say loudly and clearly and in the interest of fairness and objectivity that we have an unarmed police force which can be said to be one of the finest in any free society in the world.  There is not much point in talking about police forces in societies that are not free.  Our police are very concerned about the proposals in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the editorial in the <i>Garda News</i> of June 1985 some of the reservations in regard to the Bill are expressed.  I quote from the editorial:</P>
    <P>One can only speculate on the reasons why Mr. Noonan, at the very last minute, decided to introduce the controversial `right to silence' measure in the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill.  Without even being told he must surely have been aware of the likely reaction among gardaí which such a proposal would generate.  So there must have been some powerful and compelling reasons for taking such a step.  If that be the case the Minister has been less than anxious (at least at time of going to press) to spell them out and certainly the evidence available to the gardaí and the general public is insufficiently convincing to sustain an argument in support of this extraordinary measure.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fundamental rights aspect of this issue there is a deeper and far stronger reason why the gardaí so determinedly oppose this particular provision, Many gardaí feel genuinely hurt that they, and their profession, should be held in such low esteem by the Government that they can no longer be trusted, can no longer be accorded the same rights and respect as all other public servants &mdash; not to mention the criminals.  At a time when gardaí are under siege from <Col N="2494" /> all sides the least they could have hoped for was that their own Minister for Justice would not add to the cacophony of abuse, but would instead do something to boost flagging morale.</P>
    <P>The logic behind this piece of legislation is to make the gardaí more accountable for their actions.  Fine.  But how more accountable are they going to have to become before the Government is satisfied.  Right now they are held accountable under a draconian disciplinary code where they can be summarily fined, suspended or dismissed; they are accountable to the courts where every minute particular is daily analysed under the miscroscopic attention of the legal profession; they are accountable to the Minister for Justice who can order an inquiry into any aspect of garda behaviour and through him they are accountable to the Oireachtas who can, and most recently did authorise an inquiry into garda behaviour.</P>
    <P>In a later paragraph it states:</P>
    <P>Nobody is arguing that the gardaí should not be accountable but, in the much used words of the Minister himself, a &ldquo;balance&rdquo; need to be struck.</P>
    <P>That is what we should be striving for in this legislation.  The article continues:</P>
    <P>And that balance is not just between the rights of the citizens and the powers of the gardaí, important though that is, there is also a balance needed between how much attention is paid to the negative aspect of gardaí discipline and control and that paid to the positive element of defining a clear role for the gardaí in Irish society and giving them the resources, structure and management to fulfil that role.  Unfortunately too little attention has been paid to the latter.</P>
    <P>The article concludes with the remark that something must be done about the present situation but that if something is not done about it soon a resolution would be even more difficult to achieve.  I might outline also some other major concerns.</P>

      <P>The Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill is to be welcomed and is long overdue.  It deals with an area of great sensitivity and the immediate context of its introduction underlines both the necessity for it and the complexity of the problems with which it deals. The Bill is by no means original and, like so much Irish legislation, draws very heavily on a British Act.  It will require to be carefully reviewed in the early years of its operation.</P>
      <P>I propose to discuss some matters of general principle related to the Bill and to make a number of specific criticisms of it.  This House has not often addressed itself seriously to problems of policing. Criticisms of the Garda have often to be answered by almost overly lavish praise from both Government and Opposition, while a small minority of Deputies have indulged both in the House, in committees and elsewhere in hostile fantasies so paranoid as to make serious debate impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of this Bill is instructive.  It was introduced by the former Minister for Justice as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the increased powers of detention conferred on the Garda by the Criminal Justice Act, 1985.  Such a balancing factor was thought necessary because of the significant degree of unease about the treatment of persons in custody, highlighted by a number of dramatic cases such as the Sallins train robbery case, the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions versus Lynch, the Kerry Babies case and, most disturbingly, the death of Mr. Matthews in Shercock Garda station.  This last case, in which a person in Garda custody received injuries from which he died, highlighted the central problem in the policing of the police.  It is virtually impossible to establish the truth of a <Col N="2496" /> disputed incident inside a Garda station if evidence is not forthcoming from the Garda.  The other cases were less dramatic but involved statements by way of confession from people in custody, the truth of which later became open to grave doubts, at the very least.</P>
    <P>Cases such as these have serious implications with regard to public confidence in the force and encourage the manufacture in other instances of wildly false allegations against members of the Garda Síochána.  In response to all this, the Ó Briain committee were appointed and reported some eight years ago.  For reasons never properly explained, their recommendations have been ignored.  A steady trickle of disturbing cases continues to undermine public confidence. For a variety of reasons, including the overactive interpretation of the <i>sub judice</i> rule, this House has never adequately considered the problem.</P>
    <P>The problem has two aspects &mdash; that of restoring and maintaining public confidence and that of providing a quick and effective means of investigating complaints. The two are obviously related. The latter was left, heretofore to the Civil and Criminal Courts on the one hand and to the Garda discipline regulations on the other.</P>
    <P>Many complaints against gardaí, and almost all the more serious ones, also constitute criminal offences.  This fact raises problems of reconciling the Garda's rights as a citizen with the need for proper administration of the force.  It is responsible for one of the most unattractive features of the present Bill &mdash; its great complexity.  But whether or not a complaint amounts to an allegation of a crime it has always, heretofore, been investigated by the Garda themselves.</P>
    <P>Probably the most dramatic change envisaged by the Bill is that future investigations will be under the control of an independent board and can, if the board so decide, be conducted by their chief executive.  This is a desirable change.  To some extent it is a halfway house, since the board's ability to supervise the investigation will be dependent on reports <Col N="2497" /> from Garda investigators.  But experience of recent investigations have shown them to be generally efficient and impartial and the presence of the board with their power to investigate directly should encourage this.  I do not think that at present a case can be made for a new Garda investigative body other than the chief executive of the board.</P>
    <P>Much of the complexity of this Bill relates to the overlap between complaints and allegations of criminal offences. Where it appears that a crime may have been committed, the board yield immediately to the DPP though the case may subsequently return to their ambit.  I question whether so rigid a demarcation is necessary.  The DPP will arrive at his decision from considering reports of a Garda investigation.  If such investigations are to be supervised by the board where there is no question of a criminal offence, it is hard to see why there should be no such supervision where such an offence is in question.  These cases would generally be more serious.  Supervision of the investigation by the board would in no way hamper the DPP's discretion.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Commissioner or his nominee to sit on the board is probably not as desirable as this might previously have been.  It would be better if the board were wholly independent.  The Bill as drafted contains very wide powers for investigations which would exempt them from the ordinary law about, for example, telephone tapping and searches.  Was this intended?  Perhaps the Minister could clarify this.</P>
    <P>The scope of the Act is very wide, extending to &ldquo;any conduct&rdquo; of a member of the Garda.  There is no requirement that the conduct must be in relation to, or capable of affecting, his official duties. There are recent examples of gardaí being proceeded against under the discipline code for matters in relation to the their personal life and matters which have absolutely nothing to do with the carrying out of their duties as members of the force.  The provisions of this Bill extend those powers further and that is undesirable.</P>
    <P>Because of the time factor and the fact <Col N="2498" /> that Deputy Glenn also wishes to speak, I will end by saying that I welcome this Bill.  Its passage will allow the introduction of the Criminal Justice Act of 1985 in full, which is a good thing.  Time will tell whether the Bill is satisfactory.  We will have to review its operation continually, particularly in the early years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AliceGlenn" hpid="Mrs. Glenn Mrs. Glenn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  I wish to draw attention to some of the sections of this Bill to which I would like consideration to be given on Committee Stage. The Bill was intended to redress the imbalances created by the Criminal Justice Act of 1985.  It should do just that and no more.  First, I want to draw attention to the much too broad definition of conduct.  It should be confined to conduct on duty or in the course of duty. With regard to section 4, six months is an excessive period in which one has the opportunity to make a complaint.  I suggest that there should be a limitation of 28 days maximum and that the accused person should be given notice four days after the lodging of the complaint.</P>
      <P>In section 4 the Commissioner can delay notification of complaint to a member for the purpose of obtaining or preserving evidence.  This is oppressive when coupled with the previous section. There should be some kind of guarantee given here that no attempt will be made to phone tap or investigate through stealth the person under investigation. Section 5 undermines the authority of the Commissioner in that the complaints board can overturn his informal resolution of a complaint and order an investigation. Some safeguard is needed here for those who would be involved in what they would consider to be an informal situation.  Any information given under such circumstances should not be used in different circumstances.  That is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a little concerned that the complaints board have rather sweeping powers.  They could, in fact, be judge and jury.  I suggest that where they decide that action is necessary those members of the board who have come to that conclusion should not then be the members <Col N="2499" /> who would judge the person concerned. There should be a difference of personnel in that instance.</P>
    <P>The right to silence is the contentious issue.  The section, in essence, requires members to convict themselves under the complaints procedure.  Since this cannot be accomplished under ordinary rules of evidence, it is an area to which serious attention must be paid.  The right to silence is afforded to all who are under investigation.  To deny gardaí that right is a denial of natural justice.  A lot more consultation and discussion should take place between all concerned in that regard.</P>
    <P>In section 14 no provision with regard to free legal aid is made in cases where a member of the force would be found guilty and have to proceed through the courts.  Very few people in that circumstance would be in a financial position to provide themselves with the necessary legal assistance.  Will gardaí be entitled to free legal aid if they must answer to the courts?  There is also no provision to deter people from frivolous and vexatious accusations.  Some ground rules need to be laid down in this regard, otherwise everybody brought to account would claim that he or she had not been treated fairly.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that on such an important issue we should have been so restricted in time.  There are many Deputies, my own colleagues included, who are going to be deprived of the opportunity to speak.  I ask that this would not arise again.  We are entitled to air our views on such an important matter and about which so many of us feel very strongly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take up Deputy Glenn's last remark which is a matter mentioned by a number of Deputies during the course of the discussions.  It is regrettable that there is not, perhaps, as much time as people would like to discuss Second Stage <Col N="2500" /> of a Bill of this kind.  However, I shall try to show that Second Stage debate of this Bill has properly fulfilled the purpose of a Second Stage debate.  It has emerged from the debate that there is general agreement on the principle of the Bill. There is agreement on the need for the Bill and during the course of the debate a number of matters have been pointed out which could properly be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>My predecessor, when introducing Second Stage in the House some time ago, concluded by saying: &ldquo;I am confident that the Bill will be approached on ... a constructive basis and I look forward to a constructive debate&rdquo;.  That has turned out to be the case with this Bill. The Second Stage debate which we have had will be a very useful foundation for what I am quite sure will be a searching examination of the detailed provisions of this Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>During the course of the debate it emerged that there is disagreement in relation to a number of provisions, for example, the composition of the board, the extent of their powers of investigation and other aspects.  However, they seem to be matters which can be dealt with properly on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly anxious that this Bill will be enacted before the summer recess. It is inevitable that this Bill will take longer on Committee Stage than on Second Stage.  I am anxious to proceed as quickly as possible while respecting the need for a full debate in the House and to set up the board because the complaints machinery must be in operation before the Criminal Justice Act can be brought fully into operation.  Another step must be taken, to which a number of Deputies adverted during the course of the debate, and that is that we must have new regulations for the treatment of persons in custody.  I hope that I will be in a position to publish my intentions in relation to those regulations very shortly and I will be looking at means whereby we can have a constructive discussion on them before we make the regulations.  The first publication will take the form of a document <Col N="2501" /> for general public discussion and I will make a point of having complete and full discussion of those proposals with the interested bodies, including those representing members of the Garda force, before we proceed to make the regulations.</P>
    <P>I was unable to be present in the Chamber for a good deal of the debate today which is a matter of regret but, no more than any other Member of the House, including Deputy Skelly, I do not have the gift of bilocation.  He may be listening on the monitor as I was this morning and if it is any consolation to him, as his sensitivities seem to have been a little bruised by my absence this morning, I listened to his contribution while reading speeches made by other Deputies with a view to preparing my remarks for this afternoon.</P>
    <P>A number of points were raised during the course of the debate on which I should like to comment.  I assure the House that if I do not deal with some points which were raised it is not because they are unworthy of consideration but because of time constraints.  We will, of course, have an opportunity to deal with them on Committee Stage.  There are a number of areas where I will be considering possible amendments on Committee Stage and in doing so I hope I will be responding to the genuine concerns expressed in the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>There is consensus in the House in that we want the best complaints procedure which we can provide, both from the point of view of the general public and that of members of the Garda Síochána. Deputy Woods and other contributors suggested that the new complaints board could not properly be regarded as independent because of the Commissioner's participation.  I do not believe that that suggestion stands up to scrutiny.  Under the Bill at present, the Commissioner or his representative will be only one of seven members of the board and only one of three members of any tribunal established by the board.  The remaining members of the board will be civilians in the sense that they will not be drawn from the ranks of the Garda Síochána.  The <Col N="2502" /> procedure envisaged for the board and their tribunals is that they will arrive at their decisions by majority.  I do not think it can reasonably be suggested in those circumstances that the board are not independent of the Garda, nor can it be suggested that the Commissioner or his representatives would be in a position to exercise undue influence on those decisions.</P>
    <P>The Garda member of the board will be either the Commissioner or a deputy or assistant commissioner nominated by him.  This member will have experience of police work at all levels and will be in a position to make a responsible and essential contribution to the deliberations of the board.  I do not thing I need emphasise the point that the contributions to be made by the Commissioner or his representative will be fully supportive of the board in their concern to see that complaints are properly and thoroughly investigated.  We should not lose sight of the fact that the Commissioner is the custodian of the good name of the force and also the chief disciplinary officer. From that point of view it is right that he should be involved in a formal way in the processing and adjudication of complaints alleging breaches of discipline. Otherwise the Commissioner, the chief disciplinary officer of the force, would be denied an adequate role in ensuring that the highest standards are maintained in the force.</P>
    <P>Another consideration which is relevant in this connection, mentioned by Deputy Woods was that the complaints procedure should have the confidence of the public.  I agree and Members who mentioned this aspect attached great importance to it as I do.  It is equally important that the procedure should have the confidence of the members of the Garda Síochána if the scheme is to operate satisfactorily.  That being so, the presence of the Commissioner or his nominee on the board would contribute to ensuring that that is the case.</P>
    <P>A number of suggestions were made in relation to the constitution of the board. Deputy Woods said that the Bill should <Col N="2503" /> make provision in relation to membership of the board which would include a medical practitioner and representatives of community and vocational interests. That is an interesting proposal and I accept that it is desirable that the board should be representative of a crosssection of the community.  It is necessary, of course, that a board of this kind should have a number of legally qualified members, if only to ensure that proper procedures are followed.</P>
    <P>The Bill already provides that three of the board's seven members are to be legally qualified. It requires also that one of the remaining members is to be the Commissioner or a deputy or assistant commissioner nominated by him.  The final three members of the board will be nominated by the Government.  I cannot anticipate what specific decisions the Government will make in that regard or what the professions or occupations of those three members will be.  It would be a mistake to provide in the Bill that the Government of the day should be obliged to appoint persons to these positions with particular qualifications or interests.  I have no doubt that concerns expressed in the House on Second Stage and on Committee Stage will be borne in mind by the Government when they come to make these appointments but there are other concerns which perhaps have yet not been expressed that should be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>One particularly important aspect relates to the question of public confidence in the board and the Government will be very concerned to ensure in the appointments they make that they will respond to that need and that the people they appoint to the board are people who will immediately command the respect and confidence of the general public and of the Garda.  It has been suggested that there is nothing to prevent the Government from appointing further members of the Garda Síochána to the remaining positions on the board.  It is the Government's intention that none of the remaining members of the board would be members of the force.  If Deputies feel <Col N="2504" /> it necessary to do so, I will be prepared to make this clear by moving an appropriate amendment at a later stage.  For the moment I want to make it quite clear that it is not the Government's intention that any of the three positions would be filled by a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods was concerned that the Bill should not prevent any necessary preliminary investigations being undertaken in relation to a complaint, pending the appointment of an investigating officer by the Commissioner.  He was concerned that section 4(5) of the Bill would come into operation only when the Commissioner was formally notified of a complaint. That is not the case.  While the section provides that the Commissioner may take any necessary measures to obtain or preserve evidence on being notified of a complaint, it also provides that any member of the Garda Síochána can take any necessary measures on becoming aware of a complaint.  A member of the force will also be under a duty to take these measures in the absence of a complaint where a criminal offence had been committed.  I accept that the provision in the Bill could be made clearer in this regard and I am looking at subsection (5) of section 4 to see how this might be done.  Depending on the outcome, I will come forward on Committee Stage with an appropriate amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods was also concerned that the procedures which the Bill provides for the informal resolution of complaints should not be over-centralised or bureaucratic.  He expressed some misgivings about the procedures set out in the Bill and indicated his belief that it would create a wasteful administrative nightmare.  I share the concern to avoid excessive bureaucracy in this connection. It is important that the procedures we provide for the resolution of complaints should have the maximum flexibility consistent with the need for an element of supervision by the board.  The Bill is intended to provide this flexibility and I think the concern expressed by Deputy <Col N="2505" /> Woods is based on a misunderstanding of the provision in question.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that the informal resolution of a complaint will be undertaken by the Commissioner.  Section 1(2) states:</P>
    <P>Functions of the Commissioner under this Act may be performed by any member of the Garda Síochána authorised in that behalf by the Commissioner and references in this Act to the Commissioner shall be construed accordingly.</P>
    <P>This provision makes it possible for the Commissioner to delegate any of the functions he is expected to perform under the Act to another member or members, including the function of deciding which complaints are suitable for informal resolution and for actual resolution of a particular complaint.  It may be that it would be desirable for all complaints to be routed through the Commissioner's office for some initial period while experience is being built up in the operation of the new procedures and that would be a matter for the Commissioner to decide.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill to prevent complaints being referred by the board directly to the chief superintendent in whose division the conduct occurred, that is, where the Commissioner would have delegated his responsibility for the informal resolution of those complaints to a chief superintendent.  The local chief superintendent could then arrange for the resolution of a particular complaint to be undertaken by a member of appropriate rank.  I agree with the contention by Deputy Woods that the informal resolution of complaints could best be dealt with locally from the outset and I would envisage that this would be the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods also mentioned the absence of any provision prohibiting disclosure of information by members, officers or servants of the complaints board.  There does not seem to be any uniformity of procedure on this point in the legislation setting up State boards with comparable functions.  Some have provisions about disclosure of information but others do not.  In this case the <Col N="2506" /> board's officers and servants will be civil servants and as such they will come within the scope of the Official Secrets Act, 1963.  The members of the boards are not covered by the 1963 Act but of course any improper disclosure of information by them would constitute misbehaviour which, if it were sufficiently serious, would justify their removal from office by the Government under the terms of paragraph 2 (8) of the First Schedule of the Bill.  I am not convinced, therefore, that a special provision on this point is necessary, but it is another of the matters to which I will give some thought between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates suggested that a member of the board who was involved in deciding that a complaint should be referred to a tribunal should not sit on that tribunal. This point had already been raised by three of the Garda associations in their discussions with my officials and my predecessor. He drew attention to it in his introductory speech and indicated then that he had been impressed by the arguments put forward by the associations. This is a matter I will examine again before Committee Stage to see whether the concern expressed here and by the three associations can be met by a suitable amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland mentioned the Garda disciplinary regulations.  Lest there be any misunderstanding, until they are replaced by any new procedure or body of regulations they continue in existence. Deputy Hyland claimed that there seemed to be some uncertainty about the present position.  The existing disciplinary regulations remain in force until such time as they are replaced by something else.  On that score there is no uncertainty.  The procedure provided for in this Bill will replace the disciplinary regulations for the purpose of complaints concerning the conduct of a member made by a member of the public and which the complainants wish to have dealt with by complaints board.  The disciplinary regulations will continue to govern matters of internal discipline in the force and minor indiscretions which a member of the public might prefer to be dealt with <Col N="2507" /> without the involvement of the complaints board.</P>
    <P>Discussions are taking place with three of the Garda associations on the preparation of new discipline regulations.  This is being considered at present by officers of the Department under the auspices of the Garda Conciliation Council.  The new regulations will incorporate the changes proposed in the Bill to the 1971 regulations. Further changes will be made in existing procedures which experience has shown to be necessary or desirable.  The concern expressed by the Garda associations in relation to the existing regulations will be taken fully into account.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland made a number of points and, though I would not agree with him on all points, I share the general drift of his concern, for example, to have the remaining provisions of the Criminal Justice Act brought into operation as quickly as possible.  I regret that we have not got further with this Bill.  I want to put the record straight about the timetable.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Act was passed in November 1984.  This Bill was circulated in June last year.  The drafting of an entirely new measure of this kind and the consultations involved with the interests most directly affected inevitably take time.  Pressure on parliamentary time did not allow the Second Stage to be taken earlier, but I hope we will have this Bill passed before the summer recess.  Deputy Hyland seemed to think that my predecessor, Deputy Noonan, needed to be convinced by the Opposition of the need for an independent complaints procedure. That is not the case.  When the Criminal Justice Bill was published in October 1983, the Minister circulated, in addition to the normal explanatory memorandum, a further memorandum spelling out the Government's intention.</P>

In the short time available I am very anxious to deal with all the points raised. The memorandum to which I have referred spelled out very clearly the Government's intention that the provisions in the Bill giving increased powers to the Garda would not be introduced until a new complaints procedure had been established.  Deputy Browne got it right in the course of his contribution.  It is a pity Deputy Hyland was not here to hear it from one of his own colleagues.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hyland wants us to establish a dialogue with the Garda, who will be affected by the Bill.  I want to assure the House and Garda representatives that there is no difficulty about continuing and improving dialogue, as far as I am concerned.  I already have had discussions with the Garda Representative Association and I will be meeting the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors shortly.  In addition, there have been regular discussions in the Garda Conciliation Council between officers of the Department and representatives of all the Garda associations except one, in relation to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal with some of the comments made on section 7(9) which provides in limited circumstances safeguards for the gardaí concerned against any possibility of criminal prosecution and that the board would require information to be furnished.  On that point there was full consultation with all Garda associations before the Bill was published.  There were discussions in the Garda Conciliation Council, my predecessor met representatives of the associations to discuss their objections, and after consultations with his Government colleagues he decided to proceed with the provision, but indicated that he would be prepared to consider any reformulation which would leave the <Col N="2509" /> underlying principle intact.  After discussions with three of the associations, an amendment was agreed that will exclude from the provision matters not arising in the course of a garda's duty.</P>
    <P>It is not always possible for a Government to negotiate on matters which they regard as necessary in the public interest, and I know there has been some discussion as to the adequacy of the talks that went on before the Bill was published, I do not think continued discussion on the point would have produced a different result.  I do not intend to go in detail into the justification for that provision &mdash; my predecessor dealt with it in his introductory remarks &mdash; because we can deal with it more fully on Committee Stage.  However, I re-emphasise the point that it is intended in that provision to place a garda in the same position as any other public servant whose conduct is complained about and who is asked for an explanation by his superiors.  During the course of today's debate I got the impression that that is not entirely understood.  It would place members of the Garda in exactly the same position as other public servants. It does not discriminate against them or treat them differently as compared with other public servants.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa complained that the Bill does not provide adequate facilities for some people who would wish to make complaints, expecially people who would not wish to go to their local Garda stations, or those who live outside Dublin where the office of the board will be.  I understand his concern but I am not sure it is well founded.  He seemed to be referring to people who are not literate, people who feel they could not express themselves properly in writing.  There is nothing to prevent such people from going to a friend or neighbour and getting the substance of the complaint set down in writing and sent to the board.  That is what I would expect anybody to do who had a complaint to make and who did not want to go to the local Garda station. Whether the complaint is expressed in writing or orally to the board or in a Garda station, it would be further investigated in detail by an investigating officer <Col N="2510" /> who would call on the complainant in order to get a full statement of the complaint. Deputy De Rossa indicated his intention to put down an amendment to deal with this problem and I am perfectly open to consider the terms of such an amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes wanted clarification of the position in regard to frivolous or vexatious complaints.  The Bill provides that the chief executive of the board, when deciding whether a complaint is admissible, must consider whether it is frivolous or vexatious.  If he is of the opinion that it is, he would notify the complainant accordingly and that would be the end of the matter.  His decision in that regard would be subject to review by the board, but the complainant would be informed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland asked about the proposed Police Authority.  The Government have undertaken to establish such an Authority and that will be honoured. The matter is now being pursued and we have had a considerable amount of initial discussion and fact finding in regard to the type of Police Authority that would best suit our needs.  Both Deputy Glenn and Deputy Bell thought that six months was too long a period during which complaints could be accepted.  My predecessor dealt with that point in his opening remarks and indicated that he was prepared to have a further look at this.  One alternative was to reduce the period to three months, while allowing a complaint to be accepted for up to six months in exceptional circumstances.  There are other considerations.  One difficulty in fixing any period in a provision of this nature is that there is always a possibility that the complaints board could be precluded from investigating a matter where a garda had been guilty of misconduct. The public interest would not be served by that kind of outcome.  It is a matter which both my predecessor and I indicated we would look at with an open mind.  I will certainly do that between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for what has been a very useful Second Stage debate on this. It has clarified a number of matters and has brought me to the point where I will <Col N="2511" /> consider some amendments before Committee Stage to meet the kinds of concerns outlined here.  I thank the House for its application to this and I am quite sure that Committee Stage will be dealt with in the same positive and constructive fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate comes at a difficult time for agriculture following the climatic conditions in 1985.  Those problems very from time to time.  The difficulties we are discussing this evening are of a more long term nature and are relevant for the future.  Community and world markets for most of the products of main interest to this country are heavily over-supplied &mdash; some for cyclical reasons; others for structural reasons.  At the same time, the Community's budgetary position is right at the limit.  The fall in the value of the dollar means that the record provision of over 21 billion ECU is not sufficient to cover likely agricultural expenditure, even before the need to fund a major stock disposal programme is taken into account.</P>
      <P>This is the sobering background against which the recent commission review of the CAP has taken place and which has already coloured their price proposals for 1986-87.  It is a scenario that all of us must take into account.  There is no place for an ostrich-like approach based on a forlorn hope that all the problems will simply go away.  We are, perhaps, the member state with the single biggest interest in having an effective CAP, but the policy cannot be effective if it is beset by problems which are continually threatening it with destruction.  The problems must be confronted and overcome, but they must be overcome in a gradual way that takes reasonable account of the income needs of family farms and which does not discriminate against member states such as Ireland that are heavily dependent on agricultural production and trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2513" /> This requires a balanced approach which the present proposals have not achieved. That is the main reason why I am seeking substantial improvements.  We accept the need for change and evolution in agricultural policy &mdash; otherwise no policy could survive &mdash; but the change must be proportionate to the problems before us and it must respect the fundamental principles of the CAP.  It must remain a policy which is common in operation and financing over the whole Community.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the details of the price proposals and our problems with them I will concentrate mainly on three areas &mdash; beef, cereals and milk.  This is not because other areas are not important, but because of the over-riding importance of the three areas to us and of the far reaching consequences in at least two of them of the Commission approach.</P>
    <P>The Commission proposals on beef are particularly worrying.  They envisage in reality the dismantling of the present intervention system by November 1987 and giving much freer rein to market forces as the main determinant of beef prices.  Producers would be partly compensated by a system of premia.  In the background there would be a vaguely defined provision for intervention in crisis situations at the discretion of the Commission.  Export refunds and private storage aids would continue in operation hopefully at effective levels, but the basic position would be that there would be no firm floor support level in the market.</P>
    <P>We export as beef or on the hoof five cattle for every one we ourselves eat.  We produce a high proportion of our beef in a short period in late summer and autumn. We have the lowest average market prices in the Community.  We are furthest from, and marginal suppliers to, the markets of most other member states.  In this situation intervention is not a luxury to us.  It is an essential element in ensuring some stability in the beef market, and I shall be concentrating in the current negotiations on having that point recognised by the Commission and the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the Community has a <Col N="2514" /> serious problem with beef at the moment. Market prices are low.  Public stocks are high.  Consumption is static.  World market prices are depressed and the beef sector is currently a large drain on the budget.  It is important to identify the cause before imposing the solution.  The milk super-levy caused shockwaves in the beef sector.  Large numbers of cows were slaughtered and this extra cow beef forced an equivalent quantity of prime beef into intervention.  The high level of intervention stocks depressed all markets. So intervention became the best outlet and intervention stocks grew further. The super-levy was not the only problem but it was by far the main one.</P>
    <P>Is it reasonable to suppose that by eliminating one of the main symptoms &mdash; large intervention stocks &mdash; one can cure the ills of the beef market?  I do not see it that way.  The Community is little more than self-sufficient in beef.  The production trend is downward, since the lower cow numbers mean fewer calves and thus less beef in a couple of years time.  Consumption should increase gradually, provided price relativities with other meats are not distorted.  Over the medium term the problem is self-correcting and, therefore, there is no need for a fundamental change in policy now.  I am not opposed to measures which would make intervention most cost effective but there must continue to be the possibility of access to intervention, at least at a regional level, on the basis of clearly defined market criteria.</P>
    <P>There is a major problem at the moment in the beef sector.  We have far too much beef in intervention and there is a problem in the marketplace.  The problem is only temporary.  If correct and sensible measures are taken that problem can be overcome.  There is no need to take far-reaching measures such as are proposed by the Commission which could have dramatic and drastic effects on the beef industry in countries such as ours, ours most of all because we export approximately 80 per cent to 85 per cent of all the beef we produce.  Proportionately and in real terms we are by far the largest beef exporters in the Community. <Col N="2515" /> That fact escapes many economists and people who study the agricultural scene. In real terms we export more beef than the Germans or the French.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the beef market with which the Community will have to come to grips soon is the question of imports. Each year the EC import 400,000 tonnes or more of beef, under various agreements, at zero or reduced levies.  This amounts to about 8 per cent of total consumption and is a severe burden on an already over-supplied market.  Irish processors and traders are of immense benefit to the Community in that we export such a large amount of what we produce.  We alleviate what would be a much more serious situation through the competence of our exporters who supply third countries with such very large quantities. The beef problem has knock-on effects on prices, on intervention, on export refunds and on the competitiveness of Community beef processors.</P>
    <P>I recognise that no simple solution is available since a root-and-branch attack on these imports would in most cases be a breach of contractual obligations and would involve retaliation against the Community in other sectors, or indeed in the beef sector itself.  Also the Community sees itself as having an exporting orientation in beef and other products. We cannot expect to have the right to export while refusing to accept imports ourselves.  However, it is time to take a critical look at all these régimes and see how they could be adjusted to take greater account of changed market circumstances and of the burden which is being imposed on Community producers. The imports of 400,000 tonnes to 500,000 tonnes of beef is creating enormous difficulties for us and this matter will have to be studied.  It would be better if those imports were eliminated &mdash; although that is probably not a realistic outlook &mdash; but if they were reduced considerably we would not be facing this dreadful proposal which is being put before us by the Commission.</P>

      <P>Yes, about 800,000 tonnes. As regards cereals, everybody recognises the difficulties facing the Commission this year in trying to frame acceptable price proposals.  World production of cereals continues to reach new heights while consumption remains relatively stagnant. Prices are weak and there is intense competition for such markets as do exist.  It is sobering to realise that countries like India and China, where famine was commonplace up to a few years ago, are now net exporters of grain.  That further complicates an already difficult situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Community, disposal of surpluses is becoming more and more difficult in the face of steadily mounting production.  Carry-over stocks are at record levels and, unless some solution is found, the Commission estimate that by the early nineties unsold stocks within the Community will amount to half of annual production, with storage alone costing over £2 billion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission have put forward a package of measures aimed at achieving a greater balance in the market.  These measures comprise a restrictive prices policy, the introduction of a co-responsibility levy, the tightening of quality standards and changes in intervention arrangements.  I will give the House a brief outline of what that actually means. The co-responsibility levy proposed is 3 per cent.  The intervention proposal is that no grain be taken into intervention until December whereas we would normally be putting it in in August or September. That would create severe difficulties not just for our producers but also for our millers and grain merchants.  But the greatest danger in all the proposals is that <Col N="2517" /> concerning quality standards.  This would mean a vastly reduced price for poorer quality grain, that is, grain with a high moisture content, and the price reductions in an average year because of the quality standard could be as great as 9 per cent to 12 per cent, and it would be much greater in a year like last year. Between the co-responsibility levy and the quality standards the reduction would be of the order of something like 12 per cent to 15 per cent.  Deputies will realise that in such a situation cereal growing in this country would not be a profitable pursuit and if the proposal went through commercial grain growing would not be an option for many farmers here.</P>
    <P>The support prices fixed each year by the Council of Ministers in effect determine market prices and, the measures proposed, if accepted in full, could lead to price reductions of 10 per cent to 15 per cent.  Reductions of this order are unrealistic.</P>
    <P>Everybody accepts that in difficult market conditions quality products offer the best sale prospects.  The Commission proposals, however, would impose severe price cuts not just on poor quality grain but also on grain traded as a quality product and meeting high international standards.  Although I am in no way in favour of price cuts for cereals, nevertheless I think it would be far more honest for the Commission to come out with proposals for price cuts than to try to achieve the same result by pretending that the aim is to secure higher quality. All of us are prepared to look at how quality might be improved in a gradual way in line with the requirements of the market.  This requires much more thought and discussion and should not be attempted by way of a rushed blunt instrument.</P>
    <P>I am not against the principle of the co-responsibility levy if it helps to get rid of surplus stocks but when it is used as a device to depress the price, then I am against it.  Last year the Community had a surplus of around 22 million tonnes of cereals and most of this had to be exported at a high cost to Community <Col N="2518" /> taxpayers.  At the same time, vast quantities of cereal substitutes and alternative products were being imported into the Community, mainly for animal feed.  It makes little sense that high quality grain is sold out of the Community at sacrifice prices while at the same time such a high proportion of our livestock are fed with rations made from ingredients imported from the ends of the earth.  I know that mainly because of existing agreements &mdash; and I am referring in particular to GATT &mdash; it is not easy for the Community to terminate or diminish this trade, but steps must be taken to redress this situation. We are constantly advocating in Brussels that if a discipline is being introduced, as is happening with this proposal, then the importation of cereal substitutes must be curtailed and reduced.  We do not see why we should suffer as a result of the importation of cereal substitutes from third countries.</P>
    <P>The milk proposal is that production throughout the Community be reduced by 3 per cent &mdash; this is called the Community cessation scheme.  We are contesting this proposal on the basis that in the 1984 super-levy agreement we were told that the level of milk production would not be reduced during the lifetime of this régime.  Therefore, we are looking for a derogation from the proposal by the Commission but a number of other countries are also looking for derogations and this is not helpful to us.  Most of them are seeking a derogation on the basis that they are deficit producers of milk and therefore should not be penalised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is no derogation will the Minister consider renegotiation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Collins may make those points when he is making his contribution. The major problem in the milk sector at the moment is the high level of butter stocks in intervention.  At present we have 1.1 million tonnes of butter in intervention and stocks are growing rather than being reduced despite the imposition of the milk super-levy.  Added <Col N="2519" /> to this is the overall problem of inadequate financial resources to sustain the Community's policy on milk.  The fall in value of the US dollar has compounded this problem.</P>
      <P>While I am opposed to the Commission's proposal to leave the milk price unchanged, there is clear merit in their approach once again to change the balance between the skim and butter prices. This should assist towards greater balance. But we must get back to a situation in which, with production limited, producers can look to some increase in price to protect their incomes.  This could be achieved by eliminating the co-responsibility levy on milk.  Despite a decrease in EC butter production over the past two years, intervention stocks have increased by 25 per cent in that period which seems rather extraordinary.  It illustrates the difficulty the Community have in getting rid of stocks.</P>
      <P>The Commission have also introduced a mechanism recently which has the practical effect of reducing the price being paid for butter going into intervention. This is a temporary measure only to stop profiteering by people trying to get rid of stocks before the price fixing is concluded. Despite all these difficulties, dairying is still an important and attractive enterprise in this country.  The demand for quotas is ample proof of that. My objective is to protect the interests of producers and processors.</P>
      <P>There are other areas in which there have been developments in the fairly recent past, some of which are rather helpful.  In particular, our sheep producers have benefited from the improved market in the Community.  Of course, we do have a quality problem but we are improving slowly but surely.  In addition, the council recently agreed to a measure to extend the use of sugar in the chemical industry which opens up some prospects of increased sales by the Sugar Company and is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall the position is very worrying. I would be the last to deny that.  The real discusions will commence on Monday next.  I envisage that those discussions <Col N="2520" /> will continue for at least two, perhaps three, months.  They are extremely complicated, the main complication being that the proposals cover such a wide range of issues and their extent is so serious and so potentially damaging.  For example, I would regard the proposal on grain to be of such magnitude that it could well destroy the cereals industry here were it allowed to go through in its present form.</P>
    <P>Overall the proposal on beef is the most damaging because it would shatter our beef and cattle trade.  In terms of its effect on our economy the loss would be quite enormous.  The overall effect of the three proposals, were they pushed through in their present form, would mean at least a loss to our economy of something in the region of £150 million. That is how serious the situation is.  The roll-on effect of that damage would be catastrophic.  Ultimately it would mean the loss of a considerable number of jobs, particularly in the beef processing industry.  If intervention were done away with, we would be left with something like 80,000 or 90,000 tonnes of beef on our hands each year.  One can well imagine what would be the resultant effect on our cattle trade.</P>
    <P>It behoves us to oppose these proposals, to ensure that they are modified. There will be some hurt at the end of the day.  Let nobody evade that issue; there has to be.  The budget is in such a desperate position that these will be terribly difficult negotiations.  I hope that we can come out of them in reasonably good shape.  The priority of the Community should be to curtail imports of products from other countries which we produce and which distort the market.</P>
    <P>I welcome the views of Members of the House.  I hope they appreciate the difficulties facing us.  At the end of the day, we would all like to see a satisfactory outcome of these negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): I listened with great interest to the Minister.  There is one point he made with which I can fully agree, that is, in regard to the benefits undoubtedly reaped by this <Col N="2521" /> country in past years from the Common Agricultural Policy, the best and most developed Community policy which has been of great benefit to us.  Unfortunately, in recent years we have been at the poor end of returns therefrom.</P>
      <P>When I read the Commission's proposals I cannot but think how some member states, in which agriculture has already been fuly developed, might well be prepared to accept these proposals.  The position here is very different as everybody in this House is well aware.  Ireland, more than any other member state, is dependent on agriculture for a great part of its economic life; it is our greatest industry.  The number of people employed in agriculture here, who derive their living directly or indirectly from agriculture, is larger than in any other member state with the exclusion of the most recent additions to the Community.</P>
      <P>It is in that perspective that the Minister must oppose these proposals with all the power at his disposal.  In doing so he will have our full support provided he is positive, bearing in mind the importance of agriculture to our economy and more particularly the real concept of the agricultural policy as outlined in Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome.  Unfortunately I have doubts, because agriculture appears to be the forgotten Department within this Administration.  Indeed, with all the puffing and blowing that surrounded the recent Cabinet reshuffle, one Department only remained untouched, that was Agriculture.  I suppose one could content that, if promotions and demotions were effected on merit and performance, there would surely have been a different Minister across the floor today.</P>

      <P>Of necessity we will be forced to rely on indigenous resources for the creation of new wealth and subsequently the provision of new jobs.  As a nation, our greatest economic challenge lies in the creation of an integrated farm industry linking the produce to the processor, to the marketer and finally to the consumer. It is imperative, therefore, that a marketled approach be devised to create a range of value-added goods which will successfully penetrate the Community market of 320 million people and beyond that market.  We have the land, we have the climate and we are fast acquiring the technology despite the cutbacks by the Minister on the resources to the Agricultural Institute and to ACOT.  It is tragic, therefore, to reflect that, rather than grasping the opportunities afforded by our rich grassland and benign climate for real productive growth which would benefit all our people, this Government <Col N="2524" /> unfortunately have adopted a negative attitude to farming which if allowed to continue will further erode the productive base of our single most important industry.</P>
      <P>It is clear that this Government lack vision and even commonsense.  Rather than boost our single most important source of output and exports, this Government in reducing farm spending have chosen to ignore the fundamental first rule of economics that spending in a productive sector, far from being extravagant or spendthrift, would act as a stimulus to farm output &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): This party agree with Farm Commissioner Andriessen's recent statement that Europe's farm surpluses are a time bomb <Col N="2525" /> threatening the European farmer.  We agree with that statement, but the savage farm proposals put forward by the Commission and the failure of the Minister for Agriculture to negotiate exemptions, however, indicate yet again the failure of the Brussels policy makers to come up with a flexible policy mechanism to deal with farm surpluses.  They seem unable or unwilling to take into consideration the varied agricultural conditions in the different regions of the Community and the industry's relative economic importance in the different member states.</P>
      <P>The latest proposals in this present price package, if it is allowed to go through, could cost Irish beef £60 million in 1986 and the loss to cereal farmers could be as high as £25 million.  In the long term as well as in the short term this proposed phasing out of beef intervention and the proposed further cutbacks in milk production have critical, serious implications for the Irish agricultural economy.  It would be well for the Minister to reflect very positively on those at the negotiations next week.</P>
      <P>The proposals on beef intervention have alarming implications for our beef industry which has been the focus of farm expansion since the possibilities of expansion in milk have been curtailed.  The Commission's proposals to phase out Community beef intervention for all but emergency purposes, such as price collapse, are positively frightening.  Not only do they threaten an essential export industry, they jeopardise the development of the Irish food industry which depends on a constant supply of good quality raw material.  Forcing farmers out of business and battering farming confidence is not going to help the Irish agrifood industry which at present employs in the region of 40,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, if food processing is to develop to its vast potential in terms of jobs, quality products and quality export markets must be explored.  If we are to exploit our richest natural resource, our grassland, in the national interest, then we must fight tooth and nail against these <Col N="2526" /> proposals which cut across the fundamental principles of the CAP.</P>
    <P>This party in a document recently published have accepted fully the need for a reform of the CAP in order to eliminate the distortions which have been allowed to develop in the community's farm policy and to bring it into line with its basic founding principle, that is preservation in Europe of the traditional family farm.  The people of Ireland, the farmers of Ireland, have a vital national interest at stake in this process of reform.  From an Irish perspective and from a European perspective our attitude in seeking a return to the basic founding principles of the Community enshrined in the Treaty of Rome is both positive and constructive.</P>
    <P>By way of encouraging the Minister it is only right that I should bring to his attention that the Fianna Fáil administration and Fianna Fáil Ministers for Agriculture in the past achieved a number of very notable advantages for Ireland through the CAP.  The list of these advantages is already well known.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): I should <Col N="2527" /> like to refer to an editorial in today's issue of <i>The Irish Press</i> which states:</P>
      <P>The assistant director of An Foras Taluntais, and its chief economist, Mr. Brendan Kearney, pointed out yesterday that the removal of one factory farm on the Continent from the reckoning of EEC agricultural out put, would leave enough room for more than 100 farm families in the West of Ireland under the Common Agricultural Policy.  Yet, it will again be the small producer, whose relative pittance of output has not created beef mountains, or milk lakes, who is to face the full brunt of the CAP reform measures now being pursued by the EEC Commission.</P>
      <P>Mr. Deasy and his Government must make the EC face up to this bizarre and unfair anomaly.</P>
      <P>That is the Minister's duty and when Fianna Fáil were in Government our Ministers carried out that duty.  The editorial continued:</P>
      <P>They must insist that the Treaty of Rome guarantee on `Community preference' for EEC production is rigidly applied.  If CAP cutbacks must be enforced then the contributors to the surplus must bear them, not the thousands of small farming families in this country who now face the brunt of fiscal rectitude.</P>
      <P>That is the point Fianna Fáil have been making for a long time.  We must face that.</P>
      <P>In its rigorous drive to rationalise the CAP the European Commission, unfortunately, is failing to abide by the statutes of the Treaty of Rome.  The latest policy and price proposals signal once again their failure to devise suitable and flexible instruments to achieve CAP reform within the context of the Treaties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission's weapon of a price freeze will hit beef farmers big and small, just as in 1984 when the milk super-levy was applied to milk producers with scant regard for their varying levels of progress and efficiency.  The Commission have, of <Col N="2528" /> course, again trained their sights on the milk producer.  The milk cessation scheme, with its aim of a 3 per cent across-the-board cut in milk production, again reflects the failure of the Commission to approach farm policy reform, guided by the principles of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>In effect, the blunt, indiscriminate approach of the Commission has made a mockery of Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome, which states that in the implementation of the CAP account should be taken of &ldquo;the particular nature of agricultural activity which results from the social structure of agriculture and from the structural and natural disparities between the various agricultural regions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years, we have witnessed a lack of flexibility and discrimination in the application of the farm policy which undermines the Treaty and the basis of the CAP and is in danger of undermining the very foundation of the European Community.  Let us not forget that the farm policy is the only fullyintegrated Community policy.</P>
    <P>Irish farming has seen very encouraging progress since our accession to the European Community in 1973.  In the following decade, the value of farm output increased five-fold, while the value of agricultural exports increased to seven times the value of that in 1973.</P>
    <P>However, farm production did not increase to the level projected.  The volume of farm output increased only by one-third in the 1973-83 period.  Nor has Irish agriculture developed the food processing industry, in pursuit of value added products for the quality export markets, to the level that one might have expected. Under-capitalisation, high interest rates, the rampant inflation of the past ten years, and the age structure of Irish farming, not to mention high transport costs, and other factors have combined to hinder development.</P>

      <P>At the same time, the importance of agriculture to the Irish economy is widely acknowledged. Farming accounts for 14.2 per cent of GNP in Ireland.  This compares with 1.9 per cent in Germany, 2.1 per cent in the U.K. and 3.7 per cent in Holland.  That is an indication of the importance of agriculture to Ireland. Milk alone accounts for 33 per cent of gross agricultural output and 4.5 per cent of GNP.  Dairy cows are vital to the beef industry, making up 8 per cent of the total cattle breeding herd.</P>
      <P>The future of Irish agriculture is of crucial concern to all sectors of the economy.  The general economic situation with regard to unemployment &mdash; who created that &mdash; and the crisis in the public finances dictate that our strategy must be one of exploiting our natural resources to increase output and generate economic growth.</P>
      <P>Therefore, we must fight EC decisions which fail to reflect accurately the needs of Irish agriculture and its vital position in the national economy.</P>
      <P>In this process, we are simply reminding the Brussels, policy-makers of the underlying principles of the CAP.  I hope the Minister will do that.  The founders of the Community's farm policy intended that a balanced expansion of agriculture should take place within the Community, taking into account the relative importance of the industry in the different member states, and its different stages of development.</P>
      <P>It is high time that the Minister, Deputy Deasy, stood up to his European counterparts and insisted on Ireland's rights under the Treaty of Rome and under the terms of our accession as Fianna Fáil did.  He must reassert our position in Europe as previous Ministers, like Deputies MacSharry and Lenihan, did successfully.  He must reassert the Community's commitment to the farm family as Fianna Fáil Ministers have always done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He must not apologise for his existence <Col N="2530" /> at the Brussels bargaining table.  Whether he realises it or not, he has a very strong case, and he must not tire of restating it.</P>
    <P>Why is it that countries like Holland and Britain, whose imports from third countries of artificial feed stuffs are the real reason behind the food surpluses, always get their way while Ireland, who plays according to the rules, pays the penalty of quotas and restrictions?  Could it be true that our Minister really does doze off at the meetings in Brussels?</P>

      <P>Perhaps his scriptwriter was not as efficient as the person who wrote the script for Deputy Noonan.  We have been in the EC for a considerable period of time during which there has been a Common Agricultural Policy that was designed almost completely to our taste.  We enjoyed high guaranteed prices for unlimited quantities of agricultural produce and we were free to proceed within our capacity to produce as much as we wished, to sell into intervention and to export with the help of Community aid.  Deputy Noonan quoted a figure of 30 per cent in respect of increased volume during our 13 years of membership but my information is that the figure is 20 per cent and I do not have a script writer to rely on.  My information is also that net agricultural output has decreased in that period by 4 or 5 per cent.  This means that the net efforts of all those engaged in Irish agriculture have been reduced in that time.  Despite those terms of the Treaty of Rome which we would like to <Col N="2532" /> interpret as guaranteeing that everyone on the land earns an income comparable to incomes in other areas and be able to remain on the land for as long as they wish, regardless of whether they are efficient producers, 80,000 people have left the land since we joined the EC. This is despite the fact, too, as Deputy Noonan has said, that we enjoy very favourable conditions in terms of soil and climate for the production of beef, cereals, and dairy products.</P>
      <P>Today we seem to wish to blame everyone except ourselves for our plight.  Even now we cannot stand up here at a time when the agricultural industry is in a state of grave crisis and address ourselves to the problem in a reasonable way.  Apart from saying what policies we will not accept in Europe let us say what we stand for.  In the past we have stood for higher prices, unlimited production and the right to run our economy in our own way.  At times that meant 20 per cent interest rates for farmers and inflation rates of 22 per cent.  Sometimes it created the economic climate in which it was totally impossible during the terms of office of several Governments for farmers to apply themselves to the business of producing more, to borrow money or to take risks.  Today, we are faced with the grave situation and there is no point in us trying to blame everyone in the world except ourselves.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out that we import beef to the value of £400,000 but later in reply to someone on the far side of the House he said that we export 800,000 tonnes of beef.  We must acknowledge that we are producing more beef than we are consuming, that we are selling the surplus and are contributing to artifically high prices.  Whether we continue to import to this extent we will continue to have to fix our own prices.  Therefore, the 400,000 tonnes is not an important factor.  It is the result of agreements entered into so we we should not lead Irish farmers to believe that if we can railroad the Community into preventing these exports to our country, we will solve the problem.  Such a move would not leave us any nearer to a solution than is the case now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2533" /> The same applies to cereals.  Deputy Noonan suggests that some of the big continental farms be closed down.  That is not a very sensible proposal because one might find a small farmer in Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal or west Mayo who would consider that he ought to be allowed produce more and that a 200 or 300 cow farm in the Golden Vale should be closed.  In other words, a solution is not all that simple.</P>
    <P>I understand that the 15 million tonne figure in respect of cereal substitutes is a four year old figure and that the up-to-date figure is much lower, but even accepting that, the fact remains that this Community is more than self-sufficient in terms of cereals.</P>
    <P>The same applies to beef.  While the dairy farmers of Holland use a lot of these cereal substitutes for feed they are paying almost as much for their daily rations as we are paying, so the benefits are not going to the farmers of the Community.</P>
    <P>In the context of fair play in regard to the CAP, let us consider the average farmer in Cork, for instance, whose income is £7,000 per year but who, by way of the Community, receives about £2,700 annually while a small farmer in Donegal with an annual income of £2,000 benefits to the extent of £150 out of total European spending.  Therefore, even within this country the benefits of membership are not being applied.  We do not want increased spending on agriculture but we must ask ourselves whether we wish the money that is available to be spent more evenly and equitably.  Are we concerned for social justice within the agricultural industry?  If so, let us reflect on a situation in which half the farmers of the country are in Connacht and Ulster and receive in the region of 25 per cent of the total aid from the CAP.  I urge the Minister to concentrate on a move back to income aids and structure.</P>
    <P>Cereal farmers are demanding quotas so that the <i>status quo</i> can remain.  The man with 100 acres can remain in cereals but the Irish farmers will pay for this since we do not have a big cereal surplus.  We are not even self-sufficient in this respect so from a national economic point of view <Col N="2534" /> we have nothing to gain by increases in cereal prices.</P>
    <P>We claim to have favourable soil and climatic conditions which enable us to compete.  If that is so, it is not wise for us to adhere to the principle of comhaltas for the foreseeable future.  We would be better off by putting our economic act together in order to put ourselves in the position of taking advantage of our favourable conditions to enable us to compete and increase our production. The truth is that we are not working very hard in that direction.</P>
    <P>I would prefer our Minister for Agriculture to go to Brussels with a package designed for the long term development of Irish agriculture rather than, as has been happening on every price fixing occasion, have Irish Ministers go to Brussels with, in their heads only, the latest demands from the farmers' organisations and from the political scene as it happens to be on the day the Minister leaves the country.  This is not the right approach. In Europe we are resolving the crisis from day to day.  That has been the case for the past four or five years.  Community preference will have to be observed.  We cannot allow products into this country that are in excess of what is being produced here.  If we allow in such products as cereals, beef and milk we should insist that the taxpayers of Europe pay for the export of surpluses.  On the other hand, if we want to close the borders of Europe and not allow anything in, we need not expect to export anything and must just produce enough for consumption within the Community.  Obviously, at the price that farmers within the Community expect, we will not be able to sell abroad.</P>
    <P>Recently great play was made of the amount of beef exported to third countries. I warn the Minister and everybody concerned that this is not normal selling. This is selling to markets that pay a very bad price.  The Deputy or ordinary farmer who sells his cattle is not aware of the high level of subsidies paid on these exports by the European Economic Community. We should seek to direct our food sales to the lucrative markets of Central Europe and the highly industrialised countries. <Col N="2535" /> Other who are less efficient at producing or have less advantages than we have are the people who should be forced to sell outside the Community in markets where they dump their produce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed at the two and a half hours' debate this evening on a very important national issue.  It shows a lack of concern on the part of the Government, considering the crisis facing agriculture.  Three weeks ago I requested a day's debate at least to be given to this major issue concerning our beef, milk, grain and the whole agricultural scene.  It appears that the Government were not worried enough about the major problems facing the nation&mdash;farmers and workers.</P>
      <P>Taking this debate at 5.30 p.m. on a Thursday evening means that most rural Deputies have gone home.  However, they might as well go home because time has not been allowed for speakers on either side of the House and I must register my protest.  It was requested by the Leader and the deputy leader of my party and myself over the past three weeks that ample time be given.  We would have been serving the nation very well had we allocated at least another three hours to the debate.  I hope Brussels will not see it as a lack of concern on our part that we should treat this matter in such fashion. Because of the seriousness of the problems facing agriculture, I hope that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture will get a fair deal for everybody, whether in the production of milk, grain, beef, sugar beet or other commodities. We have so many unemployed and so many farmers on the verge of bankruptcy that this matter must be taken seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Common Agricultural Policy cut-backs must be enforced, then the people who contribute to the surpluses must be made to carry the can and not our thousands of small farmers.  There is a litany of problems facing farmers now&mdash;the milk quota and a threatened reduction in the price of milk of 1.2p per gallon on 1 April.  I hope that will not happen, but it looks as if it will.  I hope that the Minister <Col N="2536" /> will do his best in this regard.  So many thousands of jobs are involved in the industry and on the land.</P>
    <P>There is also the threat of a levy on cereal production.  I was surprised to hear the previous speaker talk about 100 acres of grain.  He must know very little about grain production.  The margins of profit on grain, in the past three years at least, have been very narrow.  Input costs have gone up and prices have gone down. Some of the finest tillage farmers have gone out of business because they could see no profit there.  I am sure that the Minister does not want to see us using imported grain of lower quality, with many losing their jobs and the nation as a whole being worse off.  There are also suger beet quotas.</P>
    <P>Where will the farmers go?  Where will the young farmers go?  I was also surprised at the MEP from the Fine Gael Party, who should be well versed regarding agricultural prices, particularly during the past four or five years, with a drop in our incomes, saying that we should not object to all the imports from outside the EC.  This is our major national industry and we have a right to demand special concessions and a fair deal.  We need not make an apology to anybody.  I hope that the Minister will not, because he is entitled to make as strong a case as possible, bearing in mind the high level of unemployment and the number of farmers in very severe financial straits through no fault of their own.  The Taoiseach and the Minister should take this crisis very seriously.  There are 180,000 farmers and 300,000 workers employed in the agribusiness. There are many families involved there.  As many foreign industries as they like may be brought in at the expense of the taxpayer, stay around for a while until their period of tax relief is over, and then they fly off in the night, but when the farmers are down, the nation is down.</P>

      <P>If the beef intervention which was worth £173 million to the economy last year is stopped, it will be a <Col N="2537" /> calamity.  Cuts in the cereal price supports amounted last year to £30 million and there was a milk quota cutback of more than 30 million gallons, amounting to at least £30 million.</P>
      <P>I tried to raise on the Adjournment the matter of the absence of a stand to display Irish beef, mutton and lamb at the major world fair at Barcelona last week.  A number of meat factories employing many people had to travel to that fair under their own steam and put their goods on a British stand.  A representative from the CBF came along on the day after the fair finished, and said he would make sure that Ireland would be represented in two years' time.  If this carry-on lasts much longer, how many farmers will be around in two years' time?  Are the Government really serious?  If the Minister has not control over CTT and CBF, he should have.  The boot should be put in.  They should not be just globe-trotting. Why was nobody in Barcelona three or four weeks previously, giving the Irish an opportunity to display their goods in a market at which 70 countries were represented? What could befall our beef if anything happened to the intervention?</P>
      <P>Are we serious about marketing our produce, with all the semi-State bodies in existence?  I tried to raise this subject in the House last week and was told by the Ceann Comhairle that it was not the responsibility of the Minister.  Who is responsible?  The buck must stop some place.  The taxpayer is paying all those fat cats in those State bodies.  We have become the laughing stock of Europe, with jobs at stake and all this pussyfooting and shoving away of responsibility.</P>

      <P>It is not good for our unemployed highly educated young people and our over-taxed people to see these officials globe-trotting.  What value are we getting for this?  Very little. Nobody is responsible for anybody in this country, as far as I can see.  We are at the cross roads in agriculture.  We have committees, debates, conferences and when we want to market our products nobody is around to do anything about it.  That is one glaring example.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Taoiseach and the Minister to see to it that this never happens again.  It was an insult to the people. We have lost many markets in that area which could have been valuable to us in the months and years ahead.  I am very disappointed, indeed.  I hope we do not end up unable to grow beet and to sell our beef.  I hope our young people who inherit farms will still have an opportunity to farm the land as it should be farmed, so that as many people as possible can rear their families on the land, make a decent living and create jobs for others down along the line.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to do everything possible, as was done about two years ago, to meet the Heads of State of the EC countries and tell them that our backs are to the wall.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most important agricultural issue which the House could debate and it is probably the most important subject to be debated for several months.  The background to what is happening in Europe at present is very well known.  When we sift through the rhetoric of many commentators it is obvious that there is an over-production and supply of certain <Col N="2539" /> products which the consumer either does not want or is unable to pay for.</P>
      <P>As a small agricultural exporting country in a very large club our backs are to the wall.  The first major serious onslaught on us as an agricultural community and on the economy generally was launched by the EC two years ago with the super-levy system.  Whether one is a supporter or opponent of the Minister for Agriculture, it is generally recognised that in the very difficult circumstances at the time, he put up an admirable show to ensure that our special circumstances were recognised and that we were allowed some flexibility within the system.  Obviously most farmers would have preferred to get much more if that had been possible, but everybody understood the tremendous pressures on us as a small community on the periphery of Europe to fight this huge machine.  We fought it and did relatively well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guns are now pointed in almost the same direction but at a different target, the beef intervention scheme. Obviously some of the people who pay the piper in the Commission, principally the Germans and other who, unlike us, are net losers in so far as the CAP is concerned, say that the available finances should be channelled to the small producers who have to make a living from the land and to try to divert the many millions of pounds which heretofore were made available through the system to the industrial farmers in parts of the Continent. I assume that this makes sense to the German taxpayer.  However, we are primary producers and we depend largely on exports but the mix of big farmers to small farmers in this country is very much in favour of small farmers.  It is all very well for commentators and European politicians to tell us that it is important to divert the funds and the various subsidies away from huge farming combines &mdash; there is nothing wrong with that and the EC will have to address itself to that matter &mdash; but we do not have that system and we operate on the basis of a small farming family pattern with very few exceptions.  Because we are so dependent <Col N="2540" /> on the small farming society for various farming products such as the store cattle industry, the minute anything happens in that industry it reacts on the small primary producers.  They always feel the draught more than anybody else and that is why I have consistently argued in Brussels and elsewhere that it should be a matter of deciding to channel available finances to the people most in need of them.</P>
    <P>One must question the capability of the EC for getting rid of some of the socalled beef mountains.  Their world sales policy is not aggressive enough to get rid of as much of this beef as possible.  We all know that beef intervention can be a very costly system but we also know that, in so far as the system is concerned for a nation like ours, it is exceedingly important that there is a facility like intervention or something similar which will have the same effect.  I have no doubt that Minister Deasy and the Government will argue extremely strongly on that point.  Of course, as has been said on both sides of the House, no discussion in Brussels at price fixing time would be in order unless they talked about cheap food imports. The problem is that that is all that has been done about it over the years.  It has come up time and time again but the problem is still there.  If the EC and its various governments are interested in what is happening, this is a major factor which will have to be taken into consideration sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>One thing which has not been mentioned this evening is the amount of money coming through the disadvantaged areas scheme.  That stood at about £40 million last year and because of the Government decision to increase the beef cow grant to £70 and to extend the disadvantaged areas to the category of severely handicapped, that £40 million will be £60 million in 1986, a 50 per cent increase. That is extremely important as a 50 per cent increase must be welcome even against falling incomes in agriculture. They have now stabilised but The Agricultural Institute say that the incomes on those farms are very small.  It is against that background that we must be treated <Col N="2541" /> in a special way in Europe for many years to come.  Our development was extremely slow for a variety of reasons and that is why present negotiations are extremely important to every farmer, big and small.</P>
    <P>Under the structures side we have now implemented a new farm grant scheme for this country which has been widely acclaimed.  There will be great investment in Irish farms over the next few years, to a much greater degree than has been the case over the last three or four years.  Most of this has emanated from Brussels and it is against that background that that type of investment programme is extremely important and it must continue. The consumers of Europe are very vocal in their criticism of this policy but it is fundamental to every farmer that we adopt this attitude to ensure that our best interests are served irrespective of consumer demand in Europe.</P>

      <P>We are discussing not only the CAP but the future of the agricultural economy and the national economy generally.  Over the past 13 years since we entered the EC we have not devoted adequate time to discussing agriculture. There have been practically no policy changes and we have been trundling along the same old road.  Many people would be termed alarmist if they talked about the seriousness of the problem now facing us, but the reality is that 78 per cent of our produce is accounted for in areas of surplus &mdash; grain, beef and milk.  In the area I represent grain is not a big consideration but it is nevertheless important.  Poultry production plays a very strong role and the importation of grain has caused problems for grain producers in the competitive areas in the south.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most serious aspect is the problem of the family farm.  During the fifties the country was being denuded of population after the war.  When we began to talk about entering the EC people saw an opportunity to develop farms in order to produce a reasonable livelihood to maintain their families.  From the late forties until the early seventies I was associated <Col N="2542" /> with the co-operative societies and I am aware of the work they did to ensure that the family farm would be retained.  They gave every possible assistance by supplying fertilisers on a non-profit basis and providing long term credit for the purchase of stock.  We believed our entry to the EC would be a levelling-up process, that Jack would be as good as his master and that the position of the small farmer would be recognised.  It has not been recognised.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to concessionary imports to the EC and this problem must be tackled.  The strong economies in Europe which use concessionary imports should suffer for their sins and this country, which is not involved in concessionary imports of grain, should not have to bear the brunt.</P>
    <P>In my area people live or die by milk production and the levy placed them in a serious position.  The Connaught-Ulster region was very badly done by in the allocations following the imposition of the super-levy.  The large, fully developed farms which I visited during by-election campaigns in the south and east were given the same percentage as the smaller farms.  Those producing 200 gallons of milk were treated in the same way as those producing only 20 gallons.  I have always objected to this and will continue to do so.  The cessation milk scheme militated against the small regions.  One very small co-operative in my area lost 58,000 gallons of milk, a massive amount to such a small co-operative.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about diversification and it is time this was tackled. I am not satisfied with the way it has been approached by the co-operatives and the State agencies.  The IDA report a few years ago pointed to product areas into which we could diversify, but all we hear about nowadays is easy spread butter. Those who should be trail blazers in the area of diversification from milk must move into some other product.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister for Agriculture has left because I should like to raise the question of the milk monopoly which is enjoyed by the Dublin and Cork milk boards.  I was unsuccessful in trying <Col N="2543" /> to raise this issue during Private Members' Time but I raised it in my contribution during the budget debate. This monopoly is operated under the 1936 Act but prior to Christmas the Commission gave the opinion that the monopoly should be discontinued.  Now four or five months later nothing has been done.  I put down a question to the Minister asking him to bring in amending legislation to discontinue the monopoly.  He replied that the system under which the milk boards operate is currently being examined by the EC Commission and that he would be considering the position in the light of that examination.  I understand that the EC will be taking the Government to court on this matter.</P>
    <P>At the same time the EC Commission have a case against the British Government regarding milk pricing practices. There is a parallel case which is not likely to come to court for some time involving Bord Bainne and the British Milk Marketing Board.  It is time to examine the position and to discontinue the monopoly. The Minister should not bow to pressure from very strong elements around Dublin who have the power to ensure that fair play is not given in regard to a product produced in the provinces. At the same time, these same dairies can go to the provinces and dump their produce there.</P>
    <P>We must be very concerned about the western package.  In 1981 Deputy Mac-Sharry negotiated one of the best packages ever negotiated by a Minister.  The sum of £300 million was to be spent over a ten-year period, to be matched £ for £ by the national Government and the EC yet after the first five years only £103 million had been spent.  This was not the way we had envisaged the scheme being operated.  We believed there would be a big uptake under the calf to beef scheme but, due to restrictions imposed by way of income limits, only a few dozen people qualified.  Income references also play a part in the farm improvement scheme. Part time farmers and others who could not qualify as development farmers applied.  Many of them will not be <Col N="2544" /> included among those 90,000 who are qualified under this scheme.  Those small farmers were disregarded from the point of view of silage making funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to this year's EC price proposals stems from the Green paper entitled <i>Perspectives for the Common Agricultural Policy.</i> this was debated in various forums, including the Council of Ministers, and resulted in the drawing up of Commission guidelines which were produced in December 1985 in a paper entitled <i>A Future for Community Agriculture</i> together with related policy documents on beef and cereals.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the EC Commission had in mind further proposals for curbing the structural surplus in milk which still persists despite various measures taken in the past including a co-responsibility levy and, of course, the quota restrictions combined with the super-levy. The Commission has argued that the budgetary situation and market conditions in many sectors and most notably in the beef, milk and cereals sectors have made it necessary to review the support arrangements so that they become much more market price orientated.</P>
      <P>While we may not like the trend the debate in relation to the CAP is taking, nevertheless the problems which face the policy are formidable ones and must be tackled if we wish to preserve that policy in similar terms to the way we know it now.  We have a major interest in the CAP and would not therefore wish to see radical changes made overnight.  In the forthcoming negotiations our aim will be to minimise the potential damage.  It will be essential to bear in mind the fundamental importance of the CAP, the need to maintain employment in agriculture as a major element in the economy and, of course, the importance of the family farm and farm income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission laid much emphasis on the question of surpluses and overproduction but these are not the only problems which face the CAP.  We are <Col N="2545" /> very conscious of the need to highlight the fact that there is free access to the Community of cheap animal feeds which supports the development of highly intensive production divorced from the land. If curbs are to placed on the production of Community based feedingstuffs, it is equally necessary to try to check the imports which displace them.</P>
    <P>The situation with regard to prices for the coming year is that the Commission has proposed a virtual standstill.  Nevertheless, we think, it unfair that prices should be pegged at their present level particularly in the sectors which are at present subject to production controls, for example, sugar and milk and equally some price improvement could justifiably be sought for a product in deficit such as sheepmeat.</P>
    <P>However, our main preoccupation this year will be in the beef, cereals and milk sectors where the price related measures proposed could, if passed in their present form, result in a serious financial loss for the country and the farming community. The Commission is proposing on the beef side that the permanent availability of intervention buying be abolished with effect from 1 December 1987 and that intervention be retained solely as a &ldquo;safety net&rdquo; for use only in exceptional circumstances to avoid severe market disruption. In the interim, intervention purchases would be severely restricted and producers would be partly compensated by a system of premia.  Export refunds and private storage aids would continue but in the background the spectre of budgetary constraints could severely curb the availability of funds for these supports.</P>
    <P>Since we export five cattle for every one consumed on the domestic market, price support is of paramount importance to us.  We have at present the lowest average market prices in the Community. We are furthest from, and marginal suppliers to, the markets of most member states.  Intervention is an absolutely essential element in ensuring some stability in the beef market.  We are opposed <Col N="2546" /> to the premia which are offered in compensation. These are too small, restrictive and have provision for payment of supplementary national amounts.  Intervention is Community financed and it should be replaced by a community financial measure.  Restrictions apply as to both the numbers of animals which would qualify and also the measures would be confined to specialised beef producers &mdash; mixed dairy-beef enterprises would be excluded.  The latter restriction in particular takes away from its usefulness in the Irish situation.  The Commission is also proposing to abolish the special element of the suckler cow premium amounting to £15 per head which was payable in Ireland and Northern Ireland and additionally the calf premium of £6.75 per head payable at present would not be renewed.  Another factor which will dilute the support available to Irish farmers is the proposal not to renew the UK variable premium under which Irish beef exports benefited.</P>
    <P>While the Community has a problem with beef at the moment as far as build up of stocks is concerned and standstill in consumption, we do not agree that this scenario will persist.  Much of the problem has been caused by the fall-out from the introduction of quotas in the dairy sector which resulted in a peak of cow slaughterings.  The Community is little more than self sufficient in beef and production trends are downward so, in the medium term, we envisage that the market will come back into balance.  We will, therefore, given the importance of beef to our economy be urging that the Commission review its proposals particularly in so far as the support mechanisms are concerned.</P>
    <P>We have another very unusual peculiarly Irish problem, the seasonality of our beef production, winter fattening and so on.  This new approach to the CAP would be catastrophic from the point of view of prices.  There is very little we can do about that.  Big numbers of our cattle appear on the market at one time of the year and I am afraid that position will continue.</P>
    <P>On the milk front the most serious <Col N="2547" /> issue facing us is the proposal to introduce a milk cessation scheme.  The Commission aim is to buy up 3 per cent of quotas on a Community wide basis and abolish them.  We would, of course, be very much opposed to any scheme that would involve a reduction in our national quota.  The special situation of dairying in the Irish economy was recognised at the time of the introduction of the super-levy quota measures when specific guarantees were given about the level of the Irish quota including an assurance that it would not be reduced in future years.  We will be vigorously contesting any measures which would impinge on one of the greatest natural advantages we have, i.e., milk production.  It may be opportune during the course of the negotiations to endeavour to seek come changes in the super-levy system particularly in so far as the linking of quotas to the land is concerned.</P>
    <P>We have been giving attention to other possibilities, and I look particularly in the coming year to further production of foodstuffs such as soft cheese and green peas and related crops for processing. We will have to look at new areas of production, and these include flax.  This will not be of any great acreage but it will have good possibilities.  We are inclined to relate new produce to land use but we must continue to develop new uses which will be of benefit to farmers.</P>
    <P>The third element of the price proposals of major interest to us is that concerning cereals.  The proposals embracing a co-responsibility levy, changes in intervention procedures and quality standards could, if adopted, reduce producer prices here by up by 10 per cent to 15 per cent.  Quality standards are dependent on climatic factors which vary greatly throughout the Community and, as a consequence, it may be impossible for us to comply with all the standards being proposed.  We must see to it that the proposals do not have the effect of making cereal growing uneconomic for many of our better specialised tillage farmers for whom there is now no comparable alternative.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2548" /> While we will be opposing the adverse factors I have mentioned, it is plain to see that difficult challenges lie before farmers. It will be necessary for them to adapt their enterprises to the changing conditions such as the various production curbs visibly in prospect.  New lines of production must be sought out.  Production must be geared towards meeting the needs of the market place rather than relying on intervention.  Now that the demand is there the farmers are willing to have a go.  The time is ripe for such a development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The few minutes available for this debate does not do justice to the importance of the subject.  Instead of recriminations between who did what and who did not do what, what we should be doing here is telling the Minister for Agriculture that a hell of a job needs to be done here.  The Minister should use the veto if necessary and finally he may be required to renegotiate our conditions within the Community because we are not getting a fair crack of the whip, regardless of what some speakers have said.  When we joined the EC in 1973 we relied on Article 39 of the Treaty.  That has not been lived up to.  The special care of the farming community and the family farm has gone out the window.  This was foreshadowed four or five years ago.  In my time in Europe on every Common Agricultural Policy debate and in the framing of the budget I have said this.  I am one of the few who totally opposed the milk quotas as a sell-out so far as we are concerned.  It is a sell-out because it was given to us to understand then that even though we objected to it is was something that was there as an experiment for five years.  If one builds something in with sufficient cement, as this has been done, the five years becomes eternity.  We were given to understand that the expansion of our quota related to the datum year in arriving at the quota. That increase that we got at the time implied and could have been construed to imply by those who would willingly listen that this would continue for the remainder of the five year period and would then be reviewed.  It has not turned <Col N="2549" /> out that way.  The quota has not been regarded as sacrosanct to our country and we now have the cessation scheme, the buying of quotas and the unfair situation that so far as the country as a whole is concerned those who were in milk and had very good quotas have their land values increased by at least 100 per cent while the land values of others in other walks of life who have no opportunity of going into milk in the future see their land values reduced by about 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>It is true that we have a surplus of cereals and butter and that we have a surplus of beef but from where did we derive them?  Where were those who should have been talking in the high places during the last five or six years when this scene was developed, when it was clearly evident that the import of cereals from North America, not to speak of Third World countries, would be disastrous for this country?  North America has been sending to the Community as much as 25 million tonnes of grain per year at zero or small duty.  Who has been taking it up?  Large combines who do not own an acre of land on the Continent or within the EC, who have huge buildings on tens of thousands of acres and have put there herds the like of which we never contemplated, herds of milk cows producing milk to such a degree that Germany has gone from a net importer of milk and dairy products to a net exporter of milk and dairy products.  It came about as a result of this situation.  Let us deal at source with this phoney surplus we are allegedly producing.  We should contrive by every means at our disposal to reduce those imports from North America and where necessary from Third World countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should look at the beef industry also and take into account this cheaper feed which the mainland Europeans have been able to get as a result of these agreements, which are not for our benefit but for the benefit of large manufacturing exporting countries and for the benefit of the multinationals who pluck the strings which play the tune that suits them.  We will be told that these things are arranged under GATT and other international <Col N="2550" /> agreements and that if we try to upset those, worse would be visited upon us.</P>
    <P>We went into the Community and have paid the price.  In the first 12 years of our existence there we have lost 50 per cent of industrial employment in this entire island.  That is because we conformed to the conventions that we signed in 1973.  In return for that, during those free years we got expanding agricultural production in all directions.  For that time we were doing very well &mdash; too well as it turns out.  Now that the chickens have come home to roost, now that those industries which we lost as a result of the Common Market are gone beyond recovery, we are being squeezed where it matters, in our agricultural activity.  The proposals which the Minister today is rightly afraid of are only the beginning. We will be squeezed to the degree that we will not really be a truly agricultural country in the future unless one can call ranch lands such as there are in North America, an agricultural country, that is the scene I see.  It is a sad situation and we through our Government and Ministers have to a large degree been responsible for it, even if we have been conned into that situation by believing we are good Europeans abiding by the rules while at the same time we are strangled from behind.  That is what has been happening. We have been too soft.</P>

      <P>We have been too easily put upon on too many occasions until we have reached the stage where if we do not put the boot in, agriculture will not be just the pale shadow it now is but the substance will disappear altogether.  That is the sad situation which faces us today because we were honest and conformed to what was required of us by way of payment in dissipating many of our industries to the point that 50 per cent of our employed numbers in industry in 1973 had disappeared by 1983.  That is a stiff price to have paid only to get this in return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2551" /> We should be given special consideration because of our geographical location, the cost of transport and so on.  In relation to grain, they talk about cereals and the moisture content.  Surely the moisture that helps the grass does not help the grain, particularly if one gets it when one is trying to harvest it as we have done in the recent past.  These things are not taken into consideration.  Neither has an effort been made to get a common market, for instance, in potatoes which mainly concerns the people in my county and of the north-west generally.  That industry is practically goen and it was the mainstay of the small tillage farmers of my county and of Mayo, parts of Sligo and as far south as Athlone.  The seed trade is gone.  Soon we will have nothing but imported potatoes both for the table and for seed as nobody will be growing them because it just does not pay any more.  These are the facts.  These are the things in relation to which we want the Minister's help.  The Minister should be strengthened knowing that the Members of this House are totally behind him in any steps he proposes to take&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have achieved great benefits' from being a member of the <Col N="2552" /> Community, whether the Opposition want to accept that or not.  I suggest that they look at the record over the past ten years and they will ascertain just what we have gained from being a member of the EC.  Likewise, our European partners have been very lucky to have us in the Community because we were in the business of producing goods which were essential in making Europe self-sufficient. The EC should try to become self-sufficient and that is the area in which we have played a role.</P>
      <P>Obviously there have been difficulties down the years in relation to surpluses in a number of areas and this difficulty continues.</P>
      <P>Agriculture is our main economic plank, the industry on which the greatest number of people depend.  It is not reasonable to expect that we should be asked to make sacrifices now when the going is getting rough.  Notwithstanding all the benefits we got from our membership and all the benefits Europe enjoyed as a result of our membership, there is still room for a greater and continued contribution from Ireland.  The efforts of our producers, our farmers and all involved in the agri-industry should be recognised by our European partners, and we in turn must continue to be allowed to expand in the areas where this is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Blaney mentioned a number of areas where possible expansion is being hindered by imports from non-EC countries. While we have benefited from our exports of beef in particular to non-EC countries through export refunds and so on, by the same token our potential market in the EC has been eroded by imports from non-EC countries.  That seems to go against the spirit of the original agreement.  One must take the rough with the smooth not only in this country but in the Community itself.  In many places people are talking about more than co-operation; they are talking about total European union.  I think it is unreasonable that people in Europe should contemplate that we might consider accepting any curtailment of the produce <Col N="2553" /> we hope to sell on the greater European market.</P>
    <P>As regards the proposed limitation on milk production, there are two sides to that story.  Depending on which side of the garden gate one is looking at, even in this country one regularly hears that there is milk over-production and that money should not be wasted on continuing to exacerbate that problem, but it must be remembered that a great number of Irish farmers and a very proportion of our agriculture are dependent on milk production. Because we are so dependent on that one area of production, many industries have suffered as a result of our membership of the EC.  They must be prepared to accept that we claim the right to be allowed to expand and to explore further those areas where we hoped to capitalise when we became a member of the EC.  If we do not do that, then people might say the benefits are not what we expected and that we should think again about this.  I do not accept that opinion. I fully accept that we have benefited greatly from membership of the EC and we should never forget that.  If we do not accept that, it will appear to our European partners that we have taken for granted everything we have got and that we do not feel we have a further contribution to make.</P>
    <P>The beef sector is an area where there is room for further expansion regardless of what people say about the world market.  In my view the present Government and Ministers have done their utmost and have been singularly successful in the way they have negotiated so far.  I congratulate them and I want to reassure the Opposition that the affairs of the farmers are still in safe hands.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity of speaking on the most important debate to take place in the House in a long time.  The one criticism I would voice is the failure of the Government to make available more time for such an important subject.  It is proof of their lack of commitment to the agricultural industry, expecially when the debate did not take place under a Whip with a vote when, naturally, they would be nervous of facing into a general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consequences for Irish farmers and our agricultural industry generally were never as serious.  An agricultural-based nation like ours must be granted a special position in Europe.  We tend to be apologetic here in all our speeches because of something we appear to get for nothing. It must be stressed that we are not <Col N="2556" /> getting anything for nothing, we are getting our entitlement.  We are a nation on the periphery of Europe that has been oppressed over a number of generations. No other country of the 12 member states of the Community has the same dependence on agriculture &mdash; milk and beef being our two main commodities.  We are a relatively new nation, having achieved our freedom only 60 years ago, having been almost tied to the United Kingdom's cheap food policy which did not allow us to expand or develop in the way many other European countries advanced prior to joining the EC.</P>
    <P>The main wreckers of the Common Agricultural Policy are the Dutch.  They are abusing their concession within the Community to a very large extent, importing massive quantities of cereal substitutes from outside the Community for their factory-type farms.  They developed large pig farming operations based on cheap food substitutes over the years. Now they have the largest factory-type farms in western Europe.  That is something we cannot tolerate.  Indeed it is something we must highlight and expose at every available opportunity.  It is ironic that the Dutch Minister is now the President of the Council of Ministers, Mr. Brax, which means that he would have little sympathy with a policy of curtailing cereal imports into the Community.  The German Minister has accused the Dutch of trying to destroy the Common Agricultural Policy or the normal EC market because of cheap cereal imports.  To date they have shown little concern in this respect.</P>
    <P>I was most impressed on reading a copy of the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> for the week ending 22 March 1986 to see a headline: &ldquo;Germany calls for radical shift in CAP thinking&rdquo; under which it stated that the German Minister for Agriculture, Ignaz Kiechle, has sympathy for the Irish farmer.  That is something of which our Minister must take cognisance.  The Minister must be seen to rally in behind the German Minister, getting as much support as he can from that area of the EC.  Like ourselves, they are a nation who were deprived&mdash;who fought a world <Col N="2557" /> war &mdash; a nation that has built up its economy and agricultural industry.  Further-more it was alarming to see in today's <i>Cork Examiner</i> a headline, &ldquo;German Package to embarrass Deasy&rdquo; from the point of view of making national aids and concessions available.  If the EC travel down that road it will have catastrophic consequences for our farming industry and our farmers generally, bearing in mind our small economy and unsuccessful efforts to generate wealth in order to subsidise that sector of our community.</P>
    <P>The main objective of the EC Commission should be to reform the Common Agricultural Policy and not to dismantle it.  If the present EC proposals are implemented the Common Agricultural Policy will be sacrificed at the altar of international trade and politics with the blessing and support of the EC Commission.  Everybody agrees that the Common Agricultural Policy needs to be reformed.  This means there must be more consideration given to market management. Instead of a policy forcing EC prices down to world market price levels, an environment must be created in which farmers will produce primarily only the volume the market requires and achieve prices for those volumes which will guarantee them a decent income level.  However, it is clear that the EC have not given any thought to market management in their current proposals.  That cannot go unnoticed.</P>
    <P>In 1985 the EC imported 14 million tonnes of cereal substitutes.  That is equivalent to the amount of EC grain forced into intervention last year, having been displaced by cheap imports such as tapioca, dried orange skins and fillers generally.  It is ironic that such proposals should come forward at a time when Holland hold the Presidency of the EC. While Mr. Brax was in Dublin last week he did not give us much hope.  Indeed, were it not for the insistence of the President of the IFA I believe he would have returned home thinking that all Irish farmers and the Irish agricultural industry generally were quite satisfied.</P>
    <P>Intervention purchases of 400,000 tonnes of beef in 1985 were occasioned <Col N="2558" /> almost totally by the importation of 360,000 tonnes of beef from outside the community under favourable terms. That cannot go unnoticed, it must be highlighted, fought and those imports stopped.  Eighty thousand tonnes of New Zealand butter continue to be imported at the same time as EC milk producers are being asked to cut back production by 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>While common preference was once the cornerstone of a brave new Europe, this right of European farmers to produce food at a reasonable price for the citizens of Europe has now been disregarded because of political expediency which dictated the scandal that large imports should continue into the Common Market though production is already in surplus.  The Commission's thrust is to lower prices to a level which would render a great many family farms, the mainstay of our economy, uneconomic.  We have a total of approximately 144,000 full time farmers and 45,000 part time farmers. Many of those farmers, because of their slowness to develop, now find themselves with dangerously high bills on super-levy, with no economic future in cereal growing and beef production.  The future for grain is dire, with no concessions being given.  This constitutes a sell-out from the point of view of the grain farmer.  While grain may not be one of our most important commodities it has served our farmers well and we must recognise that fact.  The grain proposals for lower prices are a good example of the EC trend to move forward toward world prices.  If the price policy on cereals is allowed to go ahead it will require approximately 600 acres of spring barley in 1988 to give a grain grower the average income of an industrial worker.  Last year it required only 115 acres to achieve that level of income. That is a frightening prospect for any grain farmer.</P>
    <P>Similarly, if the EC proposals on beef go ahead overall beef prices will fall by at least 10 pence per pound this year and 15 pence per pound in 1988, costing the beef industry a staggering £170 million by 1988.  There is no need to spell out the disastrous effects such proposals would <Col N="2559" /> have for employment in the agri-business sector.  They would make the super-levy threat look like a teddy bears' picnic.</P>
    <P>There is now an even more serious threat to our agricultural development than when the super-levy was being introduced. The Taoiseach and his Government have done absolutely nothing to offset the consequences of the shattering proposals now being brought before the EC Commission.  Our Minister for Agriculture has failed to sell his case in Europe.  I am horrified to admit that, when the super-levy threat first emerged, the Taoiseach went on a tour of EC capitals to spell out its disastrous consequences in Ireland.  The Government, with the support of the main Opposition Party &mdash; I go on record as saying that here in spite of what Deputy Durkan said &mdash; rallied to protect our people, to show Governments in European countries and the EC Commission that they were not prepared on behalf of this electorate to be dictated to by Europe.</P>
    <P>Our family farms structure cannot be expected to compete in price terms with the Americans where the average farm size is seven times greater than that of its Irish counterpart.  It is a sobering thought to realise that if Irish farms were the same size as American ones, there would be room only for 30,000 farms here.  This would have a disastrous effect on our rural areas, as against our current figure which is in the region of 180,000 farms. The effect on rural Ireland would be devastating if the destruction of so many family farms was to take place as a result of EC policy.  It would lead to wholesale poverty in those areas.  Indeed it would be worse than the policy of former generations. It would be like Oliver Cromwell's policy, &ldquo;To hell or to Connacht&rdquo;.  There is also a line being sold that the Common Agricultural Policy costs quite an amount of money.  Let us put that in perspective. Last year the increase in the American defence budget was 40 per cent more than the annual cost of the CAP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>He has spoken in a negative way like a man who had no confidence in himself.  He spoke as a Deputy who has no confidence in Irish agriculture, in Irish farming, and he has not much confidence in the Minister.  I do not share that view and I have no reason to share it.  Over the past three years the Minister has proved conclusively in some of his achievements that he is quite extra-ordinarily successful.  I would like to compare his record with that of others at any time Deputy O'Keeffe likes and I think he will agree and accept that the performance of the Minister, Deputy Deasy, is superb, and above all his performances on the super-levy which he brought to an extraordinarily successful conclusion in comparison with other countries. Nobody can take that from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can refer to the dairy situation and the EC 3 per cent cessation scheme. Whether it will come this year or next year, one hopes that we will have our own national scheme before that.  It is important that our farmers and our co-operatives become more concerned and involved in the creation of this scheme because without it the consequences for <Col N="2561" /> dairying, for farmers and for jobs will be devastating.  I am convinced that the Minister's job is to bring all of these people together and tell them that they must have this or that, that the co-operatives are owned by the farmers and that the farmers have a duty to put their act together, to put this deal together and retain that 3 per cent which is particularly valuable to this country, perhaps more than to any other country in the EC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be co-operation, but I am not so sure that the Minister should become involved in everything. Governments are far too involved in far too many areas.  We should be doing more for ourselves and not going cap in hand for money, leadership, or whatever it may be, to local authorities or Governments for something when we should be up and doing it ourselves.  I have no doubt that the co-operatives have the talent and the expertise to do this and we should encourage them to go ahead and do it.</P>
      <P>The intervention of beef will create a problem in the next year or so, but again I have absolute faith in the tenacity and determination of the Minister to get the best possible deal for us.  This is important. So much is involved here in both the dairying and beef sections because they are interlinked and the consequences of a bad deal on both or either will be tremendous for us all.  I do not think the Minister will allow this to happen.</P>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy O'Keeffe has gone because this is an opportunity for me to refer to Erin Foods, an industry in the process of closure in north Cork, in Mallow.  From the information available to me I am convinced they will reopen much more financially sound and that the expertise available to them will be much better than has been available to them heretofore.  I blame Sugar Company management publicly and privately for that closure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>A point I wish to emphasise which is not appreciated sufficiently is that this is a national matter which affects everybody in the Irish community. Beef and dairy exports alone account for 22 per cent of our exports, so we are talking here about a big earner of foreign currency that helps to keep the whole Irish community, farmers and non farmers going.  This is as important to the urban dweller and consumer as to the farmer.  The nation as a whole benefits from a positive agricultural policy that can develop only under a positive CAP within the EC.  What is being done now threatens the very existence of the CAP which is the main reason why we joined the EC initially.  There is no question about it; we are at the cross roads.  Everybody and every party in this House should join in a united fashion in this matter to back every effort to secure the best possible arrangement.  That lies in emphasising that Ireland's vital national interest is involved in this whole matter. An EC Council regulation of 31 March 1984 acknowledges that position, and the Minister should pin his case very strongly to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Commission proposals in regard to cereals go into effect then the price to grain growers will be reduced by almost 15 per cent.  That, in effect, means the end of cereal growing in Ireland.  It will be as serious as that if that continues without challenge in its present form.  The proposal undermines totally the whole price support system as far as cereals are concerned.  We must get back to a price support system and a quota system in the last analysis if that is necessary.  The cereal substitute scandal has been referred to and the people promoting the dismantling of the CAP are themselves <Col N="2563" /> the biggest offenders in regard to importion of cereal substitutes.</P>
    <P>One aspect of beef production will be hit disastrously in this country if the proposal to dismantle the intervention buying of beef is introduced.  In particular the EC reference price for cattle on which the intervention price will be based is totally unsuited to our requirements because of the national situation in Ireland. Relating Irish intervention to an overall European trigger price is just not on because of Ireland's system of beef production.  We must have a national reference price in regard to intervention and I am certain we will get the support of France in that connection.</P>
    <P>With regard to the milk cessation scheme, here we have a complete case of Ireland's national interest being involved and we must secure a derogation from that.  The dairy industry gives direct employment to 11,000 people, linked into beef production which is 80 per cent dependent on the dairy herd linked, into cereal production, because the dairy element of agricultural production utilises 44 per cent of compound production in this country.  Dairy production is six and a half times more important to Ireland than it is to any other member country of the EC.</P>
    <P>Finally, I emphasise that it is important to exercise political will on this occasion, to say to our European partners: &ldquo;This is a matter of vital national interest.&rdquo; If that is pleaded strongly by Ireland we will win out.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that we should make positive use of the Euro-currency &mdash; Deutsche Mark loan facilities. We may have low inflation here but it is not reflected in lower interest rates.  Our interest rates now stand at about 17 per cent and while they may go down to about 15 per cent they are still far too high. We need interest rates for all forms of agricultural production in the region of 6½ per cent to 8½ per cent.  Money is available at that rate in Deutsche Marks by way of Euro-currency loans provided the State guarantees the exchange rate. On previous occasions when there was <Col N="2564" /> such an exchange guarantee the experience of the Exchequer was excellent.  The availability of reasonably priced money for further development in agriculture is the fundamental aspect underpinning agriculture at present.  Further development in that industry is dependent on a Common Agricultural policy that is positive, meaningful, and guarantees Ireland, by reason of its special acknowledged position, the maximum utilisation of the CAP benefit for its own circumstances and requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I like listening to Deputy Lenihan and I was not too worried about him going over his time limit.  I should like to thank all Members who contributed to the debate. Most of the contributions were constructive. The contribution of Deputy Lenihan was extremely constructive and I should like to think that the magnanimous point of view expressed by him, and his pin-pointing of the difficulties we face, is recognised throughout the House.  I got a feeling earlier in the debate that some of the participants would prefer if I slipped on a banana skin rather than be successful in these negotiations.  It was the same feeling I had three years ago during the debate on the super-levy.  What we are facing now is far too serious for people to indulge in personality attacks or in petty politics.  We have our backs to the wall on this issue and it will be a serious setback not just to agriculture but to the economy if we cannot reduce the impact of these proposals.  The three of them are absolutely vicious in their intent and would be serious for the country in their impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan was correct when he said that the proposals represented a frontal attack on the Common Agricultural Policy.  They are a barefaced attack on the CAP and we must remember that the CAP is the reason we joined the community originally.  What is happening in tandem with these proposals is that an effort is being made by some of the moneyed countries in the Community to bring in national aids to finance their own financial structures knowing well that a <Col N="2565" /> country like Ireland that has a disproportionate amount of its economy tied up in agriculture cannot hope to compete on equal terms.  That is the kernel of the problem.  We cannot match the others when it comes to putting Exchequer funds into support systems for agriculture. The matter is that serious and unless we can offset those proposals considerably we are in tremendous difficulty.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the proposals again.  They want to get rid of intervention for beef which would leave us with 80,000 or 90,000 tonnes of beef every year on our hands.  We could end up having to dump it and the obvious effect of that would be a collapse in cattle and beef prices.  The second proposal is that cereal prices for all practical purposes be reduced by 12 per cent or 15 per cent. That would mean that cereal growing here would not be a profitable pursuit.  It would eliminate commercial growing of cereals.  The third proposal is an extension of the super-levy in that a cutback in milk production of 3 per cent is being sought.  We can ill afford any loss in our milk production.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to Deputy Lenihan that the March 1984 agreement is the basis of our case.  The super-levy agreement of that year stated that Ireland would not have any reduction in milk production during the lifetime of that super-levy system and that is the basis of my defence of our position in Brussels. Of course, we must look at the underlying reason why the proposals have been brought in.  They have been brought in because the Community has vast surpluses of the commodities we produce here.  There are 15 million tonnes of grain in intervention, 1.1 million tonnes of butter and 690,000 tonnes of beef.  The Community cannot afford building up those stocks because it has to pay something in excess of £2 billion per year to store those stocks.  The community is selling those stocks at a colossal loss, sometimes at a tiny fraction of what they are costing the Community to purchase.  It is an intolerable position and it is unfortunate that we are the ones who have to <Col N="2566" /> suffer as a result of this untenable situation.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some of the points made during the debate.  Some people think we have an unenviable climate and soil conditions but that is not so. We have an uphill battle when it comes to our climate as we found out last year.  We are not the most advantageous country in the commodity where soil and climate are concerned.  Almost two-thirds of our country is totally unsuitable for the growing of cereals.  In areas where we can grow cereals we have a very serious problem with moisture.  That causes us considerable problems with the Commission's proposals.  Deputy Noonan suggested that I should have sought an exemption but I must point out to him that the talks are only beginning.  If exemptions arise it will be at the eleventh hour in the talks, in about three months time.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartin expressed a different point of view from that of many speakers. He was inclined to lay a lot of the blame on our own doorstep.  We should not always blame everybody else.  A lot of the blame probably emanates from this country.  Deputy McCartin would not entertain the thought that because cereal substitutes and beef were being imported into the Community we should raise such a hue and cry.  We have to have a two way trade system within the Community. We have to have a limited amount of such imports into the Community.  They did not start today or yesterday.  Those imports have been going on since before we joined the EC and the level of those imports was as high back 13 years ago. We have numerous GAAT agreements from which we cannot escape.  They are legally binding bilateral agreements from which we cannot withdraw if we do not like the terms we agreed upon originally.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne criticised the lack of participation by CBF at a trade fair in Spain. We need all the outlets we can have to get rid of beef but I should like to tell the Deputy that CBF do not have a bottomless pit of money.  They have a budget to live within but I take the point that they should be represented wherever possible. <Col N="2567" /> One interesting thing in all these negotiations is the attitude of the French Government.  Traditionally, the French have been our main allies at negotiations in Brussels but on this occasion the French want the price of cereals to be depressed because they feel they can sell cereals on the world market as cheaply as the Americans, the Canadians, the Australians or the Argentinians.  Instead of being allied to the French on this issue we find ourselves at loggerheads.  Last year when we suggested that a quota system be introduced for grain the French nearly went through the roof.  The last thing they want is a quota system for grain.  They feel they can expand their grain production and outsell any other country in the world if the price is low enough.  For once we find ourselves at odds with the French in that area.</P>
    <P>An Opposition Deputy said that the Germans would bail us out at the end of the day.  I hope that Deputy is right but I have my reservations because the German economy needs all the money it can obtain.  They might like a cheap food policy like the British.  It might be a central Government policy decision.  We simply have to wait and see but as of now I cannot guarantee the House that we have any strong ally on any of the three main issues.  We might find ourselves on our own on some of them.  Some of the larger states in the Community are drawing up plans to support their farmers by way of national aid.  That is something we cannot do.  It is all highly dangerous.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan in his most sensible contribution pointed out that there remains tremendous scope for expansion in the areas of a number of commodities in respect of which a quota system does not operate in the community.  I agree.  That is a positive way of viewing matters. However, I would not agree with Deputy Leonard when he says there was not a fair shareout of milk quotas under the super levy system.  The west and the north east got more in this regard than was the case in any other part of the country.  We <Col N="2568" /> could not have been more fair.  Regrettably a point that has not been alluded to at any length is the need for a national cessation milk scheme which would operate hand in hand with the EC cessation scheme.  We should have a national scheme.  It is needed to restructure our industry.  It is a vital component of all these talks because it would be in tandem with the EC scheme.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their contributions, some of which were very constructive and some of which were rather petty. However, I was glad to hear the deputy leader of the Opposition being so supportive in his contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>My question which was No. 49 on yesterday's Order Paper asks the Minister for Industry and Commerce if the IDA have in the past grant-aided the IMP-Cork Marts Leixlip plant in any way and, if so, to what extent; if the IDA have granted-aided the Cork Marts Group in the past and, if so, to what extent.</P>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I tabled the question and sought this permission because of the frustration and anxiety being expressed by the people in Leixlip, County Kildare &mdash; those who have been involved as employees of this plant, the farmer producers and the entire community in the area &mdash; in the past few months at the lack of information relating to the disposal of part of the assets of Cork Marts in Leixlip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cork Marts Group purchased the IMP plant at Leixlip in the late sixties. They were assisted in that regard by reason of the goodwill of the workers in the plant and of the farming community also who ultimately were the producers who would supply the mart.  The group were given every facility to raise money by share capital and, more important, they were given every facility in terms of goodwill which is an essential element in <Col N="2569" /> the take over of any plant.  One of the reasons for the farming community having co-operated to such an extent was that they considered it necessary to have an independent meat processing plant which would be available to the farming community in north Leinster so that they could sell their products on a competitive market.</P>
    <P>Through the late sixties and early seventies the plant prospered and benefited greatly from our membership of the EC and from intervention in particular. During the same period the management did not take account of the fact that all times would not necessarily be the good times and that everything in the garden would not necessarily remain rosy.  It was decided by the group during that period &mdash; I accept fully that this was their right &mdash; to build a plant in Midleton, County Cork.  I am sure the Minister of State who is present was proud that the plant was located in his constituency but it might never have been built there if in the first place IMP in Leixlip had not been the only meat processing plant owned by the Cork Marts Group.</P>
    <P>In the late seventies and early eighties the whole operation took a turn for the worse.  There was a series of stop go sessions whereby the plant was closed for periods and then reopened.  Some people were offered redundancies while no such offer was made to others.  Some of those who accepted redundancies were reemployed by the firm a short time afterwards which at the very least was extraordinary. More important and more recently the factory closed with the loss at that stage of 300 jobs.  In the early sixties 1,000 people were employed at the plant but, through mismanagement and the mishandling of the entire operation, the number had dwindled to about 300. Those people have not been give any indication as to what their future is.  They do not know whether they are to receive redundancy, whether they will be reemployed and if so, who will employ them, or whether the factory will ever open again.  There has been no information from any quarter as to the purpose to which the purchasers intend to put <Col N="2570" /> the plant.  There is no indication as to whether it is to be used at all as a meat processing unit or whether slaughtering is to be continued there.</P>
    <P>In the north Leinster area this meat processing plant was the major hope of the farming community and of the economy of the area as a whole.  The plant was a major employer but all of that hangs in the balance by virtue of its having been sold to an unnamed person or persons for a sum alleged to be in the region of £2 million.  Despite repeated requests from the workforce, from public representatives and from various Government Departments, no information has been given to anyone as to what use the plant is to be put.  To exacerbate matters, prior to closing finally the previous management who were the Cork Marts owned group, took on, on a contract basis, the processing of meat for another firm.  Most of that meat is impounded at the plant by reason of there being a picket on the premises.  That meat is worth several million pounds.  This contract was undertaken callously in the knowledge that there was a proposal to dispose of the property.  The management at the time must have realised that a situation would have developed in which the workforce would try to establish their rights.  I can understand the owners of the meat trying to realise their assets. After entering into the contract with the other firm the management washed their hands of the whole operation.</P>
    <P>In the past month various attempts have been made again by the workforce and by public representatives to elicit information but, as was the case prior to and during the Christmas period, we were treated with contempt.  Nobody considered it worthwhile even to return telephone calls or to give any information to the union representatives or to the farmers' representatives though both these groups are crucial from the point of view of goodwill and from the continuation of the plant as an economic entity.</P>
    <P>I do not see any reason for our allowing this situation to continue.  If the plant had never received any grant aid I could <Col N="2571" /> understand fully that as a private enterprise the management had the right to sell to whomever they wished to sell or to the highest bidder and do whatever they wished with the plant thereafter, themselves or the people who purchased it.  I refer to the answer given to my parliamentary question yesterday which was:</P>
    <P>According to the IDA, Irish Meat Producers Limited, Leixlip were approved grants totalling £985,908 of which £459,046 has been paid to date. The Cork Marts IMP Group, including the IMP plant at Leixlip, were approved grants totalling £2,443,987, of which £1,459,214 has been paid to date.</P>
    <P>That is £1.5 million of State funds which has been paid into that group over the last number of years.  If that group now think they have no responsibility to their workers and those who produced cattle for them for processing in that plant and to the taxpayers of this country an if the group want to callously disregard all the calls made to them by all the public representatives, it is time we took a very firm hand.</P>
    <P>Having managed to accumulate those grant aids, to which they were entitled, they are now deciding to withhold all information as to the future use of the plant.  Not only should we now decide to curtail the amount for which approval has been given, but also other grants for which they might yet be considered, and that should apply right across the board to the entire group.  We cannot tolerate a group dictating to anybody and everybody, workers, management and perhaps to the Government for all I know, but certainly to the general public.  They have not been accountable and have not indicated that they will become accountable. They have snubbed us all.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to take firm decisions, first to undertake an evaluation of the outstanding amounts of money for which the Cork Marts Group have got approval and to ask them specific questions such as: To whom has the plant <Col N="2572" /> been sold, for what purpose and for how much?  What do they intend should now become of the workforce there?  What do they intend should become of the goodwill generated by that workforce and by the farming community who assisted them in the first place in their takeover of that reprocessing plant?  Do they feel that they have any moral or financial responsibility to those concerned, the workforce, the producers, the Government and the taxpayers in return for the grants which they have already received? Do they feel they should in the future look for further grant aid, perhaps to continue to pursue the same line in another area?  Those are questions which need to be asked firmly and answered now.</P>
    <P>It is not the responsibility of the Minister now present but I have a suspicion that the same operation would now be entitled to considerable grant aid under another heading and may also be entitled to further grant aid under that heading &mdash; I refer to the FEOGA grant system.  I do not intend to pursue that matter any further, but would ask the Minister to intercede with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture in an effort to elicit the vital information from that quarter and to find out where further grant aid will accrue to the plant and for what purpose, and whether it is desirable to find out the intentions with regard to what will happen in Leixlip from now on.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 300 people on the workforce and they now have no future.  They have been given no information and will not get any, as far as I can see.  The public representatives are not going to get any information, nor are the IDA.  The only way to elicit information is by way of a parliamentary question or by raising the matter in this House.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that Government Departments cannot intervene or interfere in the day to day running of individual companies. However, I strongly believe that where companies have benefited from the grants available to them through the State system, they have a moral responsibility to inform us now as to what they did with the assets they have disposed of <Col N="2573" /> or will do with those they propose to dispose of in the future.  They have equally a moral responsibility to state whether they propose to have a condition imposed whereby the workforce who served them so well for so long will continue in employment or have no future at all.</P>
    <P>If reasonable answers are not given and quickly, the Minister and the Minister for Agriculture must inform the group concerned that, if they feel they do not have to divulge what they are doing with the money they have received, the answer to that is simply that there is no more money forthcoming.  That may seem a stark and harsh decision to take but, if the situation is not faced now, it may be too late to do it in the future.  The people of Leixlip who have worked for this company for so long have got the impression that they are being treated with contempt and let there be no doubt about it, they are.</P>
    <P>The farming community who assisted them in the takeover of the plant in the first place back in the sixties are getting no recognition for their efforts and their confidence has been betrayed as in the case of the workforce.  We are not in a position to elicit the vital information on what is proposed to be done with that plant and we have the right to call the tune.  We have to ask what they are doing with the money they got and what they propose to do with the further funds approved for them.  If they do not give satisfactory answers, it behoves us to cut off the supply.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to criticise any individual but, at a time when every other meat processing outlet in the country was expanding, obtaining grant assistance, forging new markets in other countries and improving the situation generally, both competively within the country and outside it, it is amazing that the plant in Leixlip could not remain in business despite the fact that the trend elsewhere was the reverse.  Everywhere else people seemed confident enough to invest further in the industry and continue to give employment.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient to blame fluctuations <Col N="2574" /> in the market.  What about all the other plants?  How were they able to expand and open up new markets?  Why did many ex-management staff from this plant go elsewhere, open up new plants and forge new markets and links with new customers successfully?  There are many questions to be answered.  I do not expect that they can all be answered tonight by the Minister but as a public representative, along with every other representative in the constituency of Kildare, I say that until such time as these answers are elicited from the firm, and until such time as the workers and farmer-producers are given an indication as to what will happen in Leixlip in the future, there will be no respite.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised two questions in the House and got a specific answer from me yesterday in relation to Question No. 49 concerning the grants both approved and paid to Irish Meat Producers Limited in Leixlip and to the Cork Marts IMP Group.  He quoted that answer.  He also received a reply from the Minister for Agriculture to Question No. 164 in relation to the IMP plant at Leixlip.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, in his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 164 yesterday said&mdash;</P>
      <P>The sale of the IMP plant at Leixlip is a private commercial transaction and I have no details in regard to it.  The question of the future use of the plant is primarily a matter for its owners.  My role is rather the creation of the most suitable environment possible for the production and processing of cattle and meat.  Every effort has been made and will continue to be made to achieve such an environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern to see the reopening of a plant which has given such worthwhile employment in the past in his constituency.  The plant in question has had seasonal difficulties over the years and the workers involved were disappointed at the lack of continuity of production.  I know that the Deputy will <Col N="2575" /> understand that the beef business of its nature can be cyclical and that problems can arise in relation to raw materials and markets.  Unfortunately, this is a fact of commercial life.</P>
    <P>I would like to see continuous and successful production in all spheres of industry, including the meat sector.  It is a matter for the private interests concerned, in the final analysis, to make commercial judgments on the best way to run their businesses.</P>
    <P>The State through its promotional agencies continues to offer a very wide range of incentives towards the development of Irish industries but it is a matter for the private sector to take advantage of these incentives and to initiate worthwhile proposals in the various industrial sectors.  The Deputy will also be aware that the Government White Paper on Industrial Policy focused particularly on the need to develop our natural resources. In this regard the strategy for the development of the beef industry is to encourage firms to explore fully the possibilities for new product and market devlopment by a greater utilisation of the broad range of grants, technical expertise and facilities which are available.  The emphasis will be on consumer ready and value added products and on markets identified for our exports.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce will maintain a close interest in developments in this case, and I hope there will be a satisfactory outcome to the problems besetting this particular factory at present.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised specific issues to which I would like to refer.  As the Minister for Agriculture already stated, the sale of the plant is a private commercial transaction.  The Deputy also referred to IDA grants which have been approved and suggested that they should not be paid.  The IDA have statutory independent responsibilities and I cannot interfere in this regard.  In relation to any grant agreements, the IDA would have contractual arrangements with the company and grant agreements contain a stipulation in relation to change of <Col N="2576" /> ownership.  The Deputy may rest assured that any agreements between the IDA and the Cork Marts Group will be followed up on the completion of the sale. However, this is primarily a matter between the IDA and the company concerned.</P>
    <P>The Deputy implied that further grants may be due from FEOGA.  Again, this is a contractual matter between the company and the EC FEOGA sector.  I should add that quite often where grant approval seems to be substantially higher than grants paid it can be a reflection of certain parts of a programme not being completed by a particular company and the grant approved not being taken up.  I am unable to comment on the position of the workforce.  The matter is in private hands but I assure the Deputy that Minister Noonan and the Minister for Agriculture will keep in close touch with the situation.  It is not within my Department's competence to comment on the industrial relations at the plant as it is outside their remit.</P>
    <P>I should like to see this problem resolved because I am aware that many people are looking forward to being employed in the plant and obviously it is the wish of the Government that it should reopen at an early date.  I am sorry that I cannot be more helpful.  The Government try to assist the development of plants by way of incentives and grants and market entry schemes through the IDA or in this case the CBF.  However, the matter is a private commercial transaction between the Cork Marts Group and the buyer.  I do not have any statutory powers which would enable me to give any direction to the Cork Marts Group in this issue.  The Deputy may take it, however, that whatever legal agreements have been entered into by the IDA will be overseen by them and they will reserve their position under any legal contracts entered into.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 21 March 1986.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position regarding the civil <Col N="2424" /> servants concerned is that those employed in the industrial categories and in manipulative, sub-clerical and manual grades are free to engage in political activity, subject to the general restriction that they are not permitted to stand for election to either House of the Oireachtas or to the European Assembly. Members of the clerical classes in the Civil Service, and civil servants in non-manipulative grades with salary maxima equal to or below the clerical officer maximum, may apply for permission to engage in politics on the same basis, but officers employed on particular types of work may have their applications refused.</P>
      <P>These arrangements &mdash; which were introduced in 1974 and which represent a relaxation of those previously in force &mdash; are kept under review by the Government who are conscious of the need to have as many citizens as possible play an active part in the affairs of the State, while at the same time ensuring public confidence in the political impartiality of civil servants.  In particular, the Government consider that civil servants concerned with the framing of policy should serve, and be seen to serve, all Governments objectively and impartially; and that civil servants whose work concerns the execution of policy and entails, for instance, a direct service to the public or access to confidential information, should not be known adherents of a political party.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have stated on a number of occasions that the problems of the Central American region can only be resolved by a political agreement coming from within the region itself which respects the principles of non-interference and inviolability of frontiers. To this end Ireland has consistently supported the Contadora process along with our partners in the European Community as representing the best opportunity to achieve a political solution to the crisis in the region.</P>
      <P>The foreign ministers of the Contadora countries, (Colombia, Mexico, Panama, Venezuela) and the support group, (Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Uruguay) are expected to meet their colleagues from the five Central American states, (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua) on 21 March to assess the state of the Contadora process and decide what new courses of action should be followed in the present circumstances. The Dutch Foreign Minister, representing the Presidency, will never contact with these countries, which include Nicaragua, after the meeting with a view to seeing what support they would wish the Community to give in furthering the Contadora process at this stage.  It will not be possible therefore to decide what steps the Community will be able to take until the wishes of the countries concerned with the Contadora process become known.</P>

      <P>Covert subsidisation may take many forms and may give rise to different responses by the Government.

      <P>The Deputy's question relates to a claim by Garda staff interests that all allowances paid to members of the force <Col N="2440" /> should be reckonable for superannuation purposes.  The claim was submitted to arbitration, and the arbitrator recommended that a number of the Garda allowances should be so reckonable. However, the arbitrator specified 1 October 1982 as the commencement date for the settlement recommended by him. Accordingly the finding is directly applicable only in respect of members who retired on or after that date.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the publication of the arbitration report, the Garda Síochána Pensioners' Association requested that the scope of the finding be extended to include Garda pensioners who are not covered by its terms, that is, members who retired before the commencement date specified by the arbitrator.  Unfortunately, because of the number of pensioners involved, such extension would have entailed considerable extra costs for the Exchequer.  For that reason, having regard to the current position in relation to the public finances, I regret that it was not possible to accede to the association's request.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the disappointment felt by the Garda pensioners affected by this outcome.  Moreover I wish to assure the Deputy that the decision in this case, which was necessitated by budgetary constraints, was not due to any lack of appreciation on the Government's part for the sterling service given by the members of the Garda Síochána since the foundation of the State.  I also wish to assure the pensioners concerned that their case will be reviewed as sympathetically as possible in the context of future budgetary developments.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the inspector of taxes who has been dealing with the taxpayer's affairs has neither been advised that the taxpayer had ceased employment nor has he received an application for a repayment of tax from the taxpayer.  On contacting the taxpayer's employer the inspector was advised that the taxpayer retired on 21 January 1986 and is entitled to a pension from that date.  The inspector will now communicate directly with the taxpayer in the matter.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that on the basis of the information available to the inspector of taxes, the taxpayer recently recommenced employment.  A certificate of taxfree allowances for the current year, 1985-86, incorporating all the allowances to which the taxpayer is entitled was issued to her on 14 March 1986, in respect of her new employment.  Any refund due will be made by her employer on operation of this certificate.</P>

      <P>Cervical smear tests are available nationally through health centres, maternity hospitals on an outpatient basis and through general practitioners.  The level of demand for this service varies significantly from area to area: in areas where demand is low the service is organised on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis while in areas where <Col N="2445" /> demand is high a more structured approach is taken.</P>
      <P>The following table lists the health centres which provide specific clinics for cervical smear tests.</P>
      <P>The waiting period for delivery of this test in health centres varies.  While some health centres provide the test on demand, others operate specific clinics which are organised at different times.  In all areas the general practitioner provides the service on demand.</P>
      <P>In general while the methods of delivering this service may vary from area to area I am satisfied that a cervical smear test can be obtained in any part of the country on demand.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the statement and report of the chief executive officer of the North Western Health Board about the incidence of Down's Syndrome births in County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have commissioned a study under the chairmanship of the deputy chief medical officer of my Department to consider the <Col N="2453" /> situation.  The purpose of the study is: (1) to determine if Donegal has in fact a higher than average incidence of Down's Syndrome; (2) further, to determine if the apparent increase in incidence rate for Down's Syndrome in Donegal in 1985 is peculiar to that county; and (3) to examine the incidence of Down's Syndrome in Donegal in 1986.</P>
    <P>A further stage in this study will be to look into the etiology of Down's Syndrome in Ireland by carrying out a case control study.  Until the results of these studies are available and have been analysed, it would be premature to express an opinion about the factors which are likely to have contributed to the incidences referred to.</P>

      <P>It was never the intention that the feed voucher scheme should fully compensate farmers for fodder losses arising from the adverse weather conditions last year.  The aid available was limited and in order to utilise this aid as effectively as possible it <Col N="2468" /> was necessary to allocate it on a selective basis.</P>
      <P>Some 90,000 applications were received under the scheme and, of these, about 80,000 qualified for aid.  It is inevitable that some proportion of applicants would be dissatisfied with the amount of aid they received or because they did not qualify for aid under the scheme. Eligibility for aid was based on particulars of livestock numbers and fodder stocks supplied by farmers on their application forms and a standard method was used for assessing entitlement.</P>
      <P>Relative to the number of applications, the number of complaints received under the scheme was small and I am satisfied that the vast majority of farmers are happy with the manner in which the scheme was operated.</P>

    <P>The numbers of women who acquired Irish citizenship by way of a post nuptial <Col N="2469" /> declaration under section 8 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, for the same years were: 1981, 312; 1982, 271; 1983, 221; 1984, 367; 185, 513.</P>
    <P>Statistics are not maintained in such a way as would enable a distinction to be drawn between certificates granted under section 15 and section 16 of the Act but the difference between the figures in the last column of the two tables above represent the cases granted certificates of naturalisation under those provisions taken together.  To provide information based on the distinction in question would require an examination of all the papers concerned which would not be warranted.  I can say, however, that the bulk of cases granted certificates under section 16 consist of husbands of Irish citizens (81 in 1985).</P>

I would, however, refer the Deputy to the Government White Paper <Col N="2476" /> on Tourism Policy, published in 1985, which estimates that in 1984 upwards of 40,000 jobs arose directly or indirectly from out-of-state tourism including carrier activity.</P>
      <P>CERT Limited have recently published their manpower survey of the hotel and catering industry for 1984.  The survey indicated an employment level of over 62,000 in these industries.  A tabular extract from the survey is attached distinguishing between permanent, seasonal and casual employees.</P>
