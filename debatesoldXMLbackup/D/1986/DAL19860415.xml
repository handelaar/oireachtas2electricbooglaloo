    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement on the outcome of his recent discussions with the Churches on the problem of marriage breakdown; if any further such discussions are planned; if he will now be placing proposals before the Dáil for the removal of the constitutional prohibition on divorce, or if he is planning any other initiatives to deal with the problems of marriage breakdown.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice and I had very useful consultations, on the range of matters arising from the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, with representatives of the principal Churches, namely, the Roman Catholic, Church of Ireland, Presbyterian, Methodist, the Jewish Congregation, the Society of Friends and the Baptist Union of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The question of the Government's response to the issues raised by the joint committee is at present being considered, and I hope it will be possible to reach a conclusion on at least some of these issues shortly.  No further meetings with the Churches are proposed at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach give an indication of the time scale <Col N="630" /> within which he expects the Government to reach conclusions on these deliberations and proposals in relation to marriage breakdown?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect the Minister and I will come to the Government shortly with proposals and I expect the Government to deal with them with their usual expedition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach expect to have legislation on this issue before the House prior to the summer recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is for the Government to decide when the matter is brought before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach foresee two Bills or one Bill coming before the House &mdash; a referendum Bill and a divorce Bill together or will they be separate Bills?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the issues dealt with by the committee were wide-ranging.  There were eight separate topics identified as appropriate for consideration with the Churches and on which I sought their views.  I could not easily assess at this stage what pattern of legislation might be necessary to deal with the various issues because they would not necessarily all fall within the framework of a single Bill. That is a matter the Government will have to consider when the Minister for Justice and I report to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach see a divorce referendum as a priority among the issues raised in the report, and does he see that there is a necessity to bring forward legislation on this issue as quickly as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the major issues, but it is only one of a number of issues involved.  This is an issue which, of its nature, would have to be dealt with before legislation can be introduced in regard to the question of the dissolution <Col N="631" /> of marriage.  The question of how these matters should be handled is something the Government will have to determine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the widespread dissatisfaction which exists in the Mid-Western Health Board area regarding the inadequate level of dental services; if he has any proposal to improve the service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board provides a comprehensive dental service, including the most advanced orthodontic therapy for children.  In recent times the health board have found it necessary to curtail the <i>ad hoc</i> dental scheme under which eligible adults are referred to private dentists for treatment.  However, eligible persons can obtain emergency treatment for the relief of pain at short notice through the health board's own dental service.  In 1985 a total of 34,000 courses of treatment was provided by the health board for eligible persons as against 26,000 in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate the number of people who are at present awaiting dental treatment in the Mid-Western Health Board area, particularly in County Clare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1985 25,000 children and 9,000 adults completed courses of treatment, a substantial increase over the 26,000 people treated in 1984.  The waiting list is being tackled and at present there are 6,000 children and 3,000 adults awaiting treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that now up to 10,000 people are waiting?  Is that number correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The number last year was quite substantial and, as the Deputy knows, a consultant orthodontist <Col N="632" /> was appointed to the Mid-Western Health Board last April and he has introduced a comprehensive assessment programme in accordance with the guidelines drawn up by the Department of Health.  He has also trained a number of his dental colleagues in the assessment of orthodontic cases.  So far since last April 1,750 children have been assessed and of these 568 children are now under active treatment.  The situation overall has improved in that health board but, as the Deputy is aware, the backlog is still substantial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in this regard in the Mid-Western Health Board area is now chronic.  Can the Minister give any indication that additional finances or personnel will be provided to the board to enable them to deal with the backlog?  At current trends it will be probably ten to 15 years before the backlog is cleared and then, unfortunately for many people, it will be too late especially for many young children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>With the appointment of a consultant orthodontist last April we will have a full year's return from him very shortly.  I am quite pleased at the exceptional work done there, but at the moment priority is still being given to those children with the most severe problems.  The Deputy is aware that for adults specific priority is given to expectant and nursing mothers, the handicapped and the elderly, but emergency treatment is available at short notice for adults who require it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give an indication of when it is likely that the backlog will be cleared, or is it possible that it will ever be cleared?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got an indication but, as the Deputy knows, with the appointment of a consultant orthodontist assessments tend to go up and, therefore, we are dealing now with that substantial backlog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the health board <Col N="633" /> intend to fill the two established posts for dental officers that are vacant at present? Also can he tell us the number of persons treated under the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme in 1985?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the exact number, or any number, currently available to me of those treated under the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme by the Mid-Western Health Board.  The question did not relate to that.  Regarding dental officers, they too are involved in the public service embargo, but the important development in that health board area was the appointment of a consultant orthodontist, and the Deputy knows that there are six vacancies throughout the country in that area at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely listening to the Minister's answer to Deputy Daly one would see a need to fill those two vacant posts of dental officer.  Surely the embargo should not apply.  That is a national problem which we do not want to go into now because this refers to the mid-west.  Can the Minister explain why in answer to a question here on 20 March he was able to give the figures for treatment under the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme in every health board area in 1985 except the Mid-Western Health Board, and why these figures are not available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will seek the information from the health board, but that was not specifically asked in the question which was in regard to the generality of the service.  In fairness to the health board and the Department of Health, 8,000 more people received dental treatment in that health board area last year than in the preceding year and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point.  Ten thousand people are waiting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that in 1986 there will be a substantial increase there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the <i>ad hoc</i> dental scheme, does such a scheme exist in the mid-west?  In the south-east, which I represent, we are considering abolishing it because no finance is available for it. Are finances available for the <i>ad hoc</i> dental scheme in the mid-west?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The board, nevertheless, are providing courses of treatment. The important thing is that persons in need of dental care and treatment should receive it.  I reiterate that last year 25,000 children and 9,000 adults completed courses in that health board area, which was 8,000 more than in the preceding year.  In fairness, that is not bad going.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will receive a deputation from the Southern Health Board in connection with his decision to close St. Anne's Isolation Hospital in Killarney, County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter having regard to recent decisions taken by the health board, including a proposal that he should meet a deputation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have agreed to meet a deputation from the Southern Health Board in association with members of Killarney Urban District Council and staff representatives of St. Anne's Hospital. This meeting will take place on 30 April.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for indicating his intention to receive this deputation and I look forward to joining them when they meet.  Is the Minister aware that the people of Killarney and south Kerry are greatly concerned about the proposed closures in the Killarney hospitals which appear to have emanated from his Department and particularly regarding his decision to close down the Killarney isolation hospital?  Having regard to recent decisions taken by the Southern Health Board, will he confirm now that his proposals originated in his Department with his knowledge and consent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make one comment on it by way of reply.  The Killarney isolation hospital, as the Deputy knows, is GP staffed.  It is the last remaining hospital of this type in the country.  All other infectious diseases units in the country are consultant staffed and function as part of or in association with major hospitals.  Therefore, the infectious disease patients treated in this hospital would be far more appropriately treated in a general hospital.  I have been considering that in the context of the Tralee General Hospital which opened in 1984. I hope to discuss the matter in detail with the delegation from the Southern Health Board.  I assure the Deputy that every effort will be made on the Department's part to accommodate the interests concerned. Apart from that, I do not propose to elaborate on the discussion I will have with the deputation.  The Deputy, of course, will be part of that deputation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the immense pressure on hospital beds in the Killarney area and south Kerry generally?  It is very difficult for the public to understand the reasoning and thinking behind the closure of the Killarney isolation hospital.  Is the Minister aware also of the serious concern of trade union members in Killarney at the consequences which job losses in Killarney hospital could have for staff and the local community?</P>

      <P>A number of options are open to the health board and to the Department on this matter and I propose to discuss them with the deputation who will have representatives from the Southern Health Board.  The Deputy will agree with me that it is best that we both await the outcome of that deputation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should take into consideration that there are 3,000 geriatric patients in County Kerry for places in geriatric homes.  This isolation hospital has been used as a geriatric hospital partially for the past nine or ten years.  The Minister should take that into consideration when he is making his decision in regard to keeping that hospital open.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the Taoiseach's statements in relation to the Minister's announcement of closures, that they were a foul-up, inadequate and premature, and due to human imperfection the matter was communicated badly?  Will the Minister comment on the Taoiseach's statements as carried in the <i>Roscommon Champion</i> of 11 April?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that, in spite of an offer to increase the annual revenue grant from £43,000 to £60,000 for this year from the Eastern Health Board, the council of the HOPE hostel found it necessary to close their services on 4 April.  I understand from the Eastern Health Board that they are in the process of making arrangements to ensure that appropriate services are available to replace the service provided at the HOPE hostel.  I have requested my officials to keep in touch with the health board to ensure that alternative arrangements are put in place as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Pending the setting up of suitable alternative accommodation, the Eastern Health Board have taken care of the children directly concerned on an interim basis.  My Department and the Eastern Health Board were aware of the deterioration in the financial situation of HOPE in recent years and we had anticipated what needed to be done when the need arose. I do not accept that the Department or the Eastern Health Board were in any <Col N="638" /> way negligent in providing very substantial resources to this organisation which, unfortunately, seem to be quite incapable of managing their financial affairs, so much so that they accumulated a debt of £90,000, £50,000 of which was due to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of PRSI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give an assurance that no children who were formerly being cared for by the HOPE organisation are on the streets and that they are all being catered for on an interim basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The hostel had a maximum capacity of 12 places and, from the information available, the average occupancy was between four and six persons nightly.  The staff structure consisted of a director, a hostel leader, four house parents and an administrator, a ratio of one child care worker to four children. The financial problems of the organisation, which was marked by a prolonged period of very loose management and a serious deterioration in basic book-keeping, resulted in a debt of £90,000.  Despite the fact that we provided £68,000 last year, including a once off payment of £25,000, the organisation seemed to be incapable of providing even a small service. Over the same period the organisation also received grants totalling nearly £30,000 from the Dublin Youth Services Council and the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any suggestion that we have been in any way reluctant to provide resources is totally without foundation. The organisation informed the Department and the Eastern Health Board that they would not provide services this year unless approximately £110,000 was provided. They subsequently reduced this figure to a sum of about £75,000 and the Department and the Eastern Health Board said that they were prepared to provide a sum of £65,000.  Indeed, additional moneys might have been forthcoming but it appeared that the council of the organisation had taken a decision to close <Col N="639" /> the service.  I am convinced that with that sum of money available we can provide a service for six to eight children on an emergency nightly basis and that we can get other agencies to provide &mdash; with no disrespect to those involved &mdash; an equal and perhaps more effective service.  I regret that the council decided, for reasons best known to themselves, possibly because they had accumulated such a large deficit, to close down the service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not primarily concerned with the fate of HOPE but with that of the young people who are homeless.  Can the Minister give an assurance that all the children cared for by HOPE are now being catered for by the health board pending new arrangements? Could I also ask if the Minister's Department have issued any guidelines to health boards in general in regard to monitoring the operation of various voluntary organisations which provide essential services such as those for the homeless, to ensure that if they get into trouble replacement services will be available before a crisis arises?</P>

      <P>In recent years funding of organisations by the health board was substantial.  In 1982 it was £32,000, in 1983 it was £40,000, in 1984 it was £43,000 and in 1985 it was £68,000 plus a sum of £30,000 from the Dublin Youth Services Council.  There was no stinting on the part of the Department of Health or the Eastern Health Board because, basically, section 65 grants are provided through the Eastern Health Board.  I regret very much the incessant public relations statements that we were cutting back on the money available to the organisation. We most certainly were not.  Had I been convinced that the organisation were going to stay open, I might have been able to find additional resources but a decision had been taken several weeks ago to close.  Of course, the organisation left £50,000 owing to the Revenue Commissioners which should never have happened in the administration of any voluntary organisation.  I am quite certain <Col N="640" /> that, through the health board, we will reach agreement with the other voluntary child care agency that has expressed an interest in running the service for homeless young people.  Hopefully, the matter will be resolved.</P>

      <P>I intend to take questions Nos. 5 and 27 together.  I am aware of the increase in the incidence of lung cancer in women in Ireland.  The death rate among women from the disease has fluctuated in recent years but shows an overall tendency to increase, rising from 20.4 deaths per 100,000 women in 1979 to 25.1 deaths in 1983.  The increase in deaths is most noticeable in the older age groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The underlying causes of the trend are <Col N="641" /> difficult to ascertain, but increased consumption of tobacco by women could partially explain the increased mortality rates.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn will be aware that in January of this year I signed new tobacco products regulations which, when they come into operation later this year, will help emphasise the risks to health from smoking.  Under the new regulations, which replace regulations made in 1979, advertisements and packages of cigarettes will be required to carry, in rotation, more forceful health warnings.</P>
    <P>I also intend to amend the law governing the conduct of events sponsored by tobacco companies and to introduce a new Tobacco Products (Health Protection) Bill in the near future.  I expect to be in a position to publish the Bill shortly.</P>
    <P>The Health Education Bureau have been given an allocation of £2 million this year &mdash; an increase of £250,000 on last year &mdash; to expand their health education activities, including their campaign to dissuade people from smoking.</P>

The unit built in Dundrum was to provide accommodation for those persons, but that unit has been taken over for another use within the prison service.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall make a general response to the Deputy because I cannot be specific pending the outcome of the discussions that are taking place. Simultaneous with the Government decision for a new use of the unit was one to appoint a chief medical officer for the prison service.  That is a senior consultant position and it will be filled in the immediate future.  A great deal of work has been done in regard to the care of prisoners who have drug histories and are, to use an appropriate pharase, ongoing drug addicts in need of constant care.  The position has improved because of a greater awareness by all concerned.  I am never satisfied, but certainly I am a lot happier than I <Col N="644" /> was six months ago.  When the post is filled and final arrangements worked out in about six months time, we will have come to grips with the requirement for the use of Arbour Hill, of Dundrum and the new services in Dublin outside of Jervis Street hospital.  It is beginning to gel together now as a real service.  I am fairly certain that this year we will have it all in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will approve an allocation to fund the appointment of a consultant obstetrician/gynaecologist and consultant paediatrician to the maternity wing of Roscommon County Hospital with full back-up staff; and if he will outline the cost of this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that such a development could be justified, having regard to the many unsatisfied <Col N="645" /> demands for developments which have been fully justified and to the fact that full consultant staffed obstetric and paediatric services which are capable of catering for Roscommon mothers and their children are already available in the Western Health Board area.  In this regard the extension to the Maternity Unit at Galway Regional Hospital which cost over £4 million was commissioned in August 1985.  A second paediatrician took up duty at Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, in November 1985.  These developments, in addition to the facilities already available, ensure a comprehensive obstetric and paediatric service in the Western Health Board area.</P>
      <P>I do not have available to me the additional funds which would be required to provide a consultant obstetrician/gynaecologist and consultant paediatrician at Roscommon County Hospital.  The cost of providing a full time consultant in these specialities with appropriate back-up staff would be about £182,000 for the obstetric service and £238,000 for the paediatric service.</P>
      <P>In view of the developments which I have outlined above expenditure on this scale could not be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the services are not being provided for mothers in County Roscommon, that there is now no service being provided at the County Hospital in Roscommon for maternity cases, that the maternity unit, which is fully equipped and was provided at considerable cost, is now under-utilised because an obstetrician/gynaecologist has not been appointed by the Minister and the paediatrician has not been reappointed?  The Minister should reconsider his decision in relation to the need for maternity services in County Roscommon because the necessary facilities are there.  The Minister should be aware also that Comhairle na nOspidéal approved the appointment of an obstetrician/gynaecologist in the maternity unit of Roscommon County Hospital and that the Comhairle also approved the appointment of a paediatrician who took up his position in the county hospital in <Col N="646" /> Roscommon, who has left and has not been replaced.  In the light of the history of this hospital and the need for the services there, I am availing of this opportunity to ask the Minister to reconsider his decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should first put to rights the inaccuracy stated by the Deputy concerning the role of Comhairle na nOspidéal.  The Comhairle, on 22 November 1985, having considered all of the factors involved, decided that the application should be refused on the grounds that, as a matter of policy, they do not support the concept of single-handed consultant appointments in situations where the potential for a second appointment does not exist.  Second, the policy of An Comhairle, as set out in their 1979 publication on the development of hospital paediatric services, is to develop general paediatric services in parallel with maternity and neo-natal units.</P>
      <P>The Deputy and his colleagues in Roscommon should accept that there is no justification whatsoever for what might be described as the commencement of a consultant staff maternity unit in Roscommon County Hospital.  The last figures I have relate to the year 1984 &mdash; there were only six maternity and ten children beds there anyway &mdash; when there were 23 live births in the hospital.  On the basis of any assessment &mdash; population projections, birth rate projections, the facilities in Galway, the facilities at Portiuncula, the fact that, relatively speaking, the hospital is a small county type one with a minimum consultancy staff of one physician, one surgeon, one anaesthetist, one radiologist &mdash; it is not suitable for the development of a major maternity unit which, in order to be fully viable, would need approximately 1,200 to 1,500, and preferably 2,000, births per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that basis only could one justify the appointment of a paediatrician in the area.  Therefore, there is no medical, maternity or other rational reason why that should be persisted with.  I know the Leader of the Opposition has said time and again that we will have a large, full <Col N="647" /> scale maternity unit in Roscommon hospital while, at the same time, there is no justification for it as has been shown by any examination carried out by my Department or Comhairle na nOspidéal. Indeed, any consultant obstetrician or paediatrician to whom I have spoken has said it is a nonsense to so suggest.  But of course promises are made time and again all over the place and people tend to complain that that is what is wrong with the delivery of the health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that, in his reply, he is misleading the House.  Comhairle na nOspidéal approved the appointment of an obstetrician/gynacologist in 1981&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, made on a political basis.  The appointment was made on a political basis.  The paediatrician did not stay there.  He had no work to do and it cost thousands of pounds because Deputy Haughey wanted to have a paediatrician there&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that he is also misleading the House in stating that there were 23 births only in 1984, whereas there were over 900 births to Roscommon mothers in Portiuncula, Galway, Sligo and other hospitals.  In the light of the demand for such services in County Roscommon the Minister should review the position there because, if he does not, in time, others will.  In the meantime would the Minister say if he proposes to use the maternity unit of Roscommon County Hospital for psychiatric patients from St. Patrick's Hospital in Castlerea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I see absolutely no reason why the particular area in the county hospital which is totally redundant &mdash; the maternity and paediatric area &mdash; should not be put to effective use towards the delivery of an acute psychiatric unit thereby enhancing the role of the hospital. The way some people go on about psychiatric units &mdash; notably Deputy Dr. Woods &mdash; one would swear it constituted <Col N="648" /> a total diminution of the services of a general hospital.  I was in Roscommon County Hospital when there was one glorious little child there in a large maternity wing, the best cared for child in western Europe at the time, and the mother was doing well also.  It should be remembered that in 1984, 23 children only were born in that hospital.  They are all wonderful Roscommon children.  It is great to be born in ones own county.  But I would remind the Deputy that that was the most expensive child born in western Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not appear to be taking this situation seriously.  Would he agree that if specialists are non-existent in Roscommon, one cannot then expect mothers to use a hospital that has not the full services required by them?  I mean the services of an obstetrician/gynaecologist in particular. Is the Minister now stating that the hospital in Roscommon cannot be used as a maternity hospital?  By closing the unit, turning it into a psychiatric one, would the Minister agree that he is virtually doing away with the possibility of having a maternity unit operable there? Furthermore, is the Minister aware that, under the Health Acts, he must hold a public inquiry before ceasing to provide such services in a general hospital?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The mothers of Roscommon have one advantage &mdash; they vote with their feet on such issues, and I have a great admiration for them.  They go to a fully consultant staffed hospital, including the second paediatrician unit, at Portiuncula.  As well, they go to Galway city where we spent £4 million building a grand new maternity unit, fully staffed with all the back-up services of an acute general hospital.  There will continue to be medical and surgical facilities in Roscommon but there are only six maternity beds there which had an occupancy in 1984 of about 10 per cent, or less, and my function &mdash; I hope the Deputy would be inclined to share it &mdash; in regard to the women of Roscommon is to provide the best possible maternity services.  My advice to women who wish <Col N="649" /> to avail of maternity services is to go to Portiuncula, not so far down the road, where there is a magnificent maternity unit.  In Galway there is another magnificent unit.  Many Roscommon women come as far as Dublin to have their children in equally good facilities.  In fairness, there is no justification for the arguments put forward.  Fianna Fáil once again want catscanners, maternity units, major this and major that, in every county in Ireland. I am aghast at Fianna Fáil.  What is wrong with the health services is that we are so criticised we cannot reorganise anything.</P>

      <P>I am never surprised at what I regard as extraordinary reactions from all sorts of people about Department of Health proposals.  On 20 February 1986 the draft guidelines were sent out to a wide range of interested bodies.  The proposals are extremely rational and the organisations I have met have all accepted that, generally speaking, the proposals are fair and reasonable. Some of the extreme observations made about these documents would make one wonder if the organisations concerned bothered to read them.  I am prepared to meet the organisations, as I indicated in the initial correspondence to <Col N="651" /> go through the various appointed procedures. It is frustrating because I am the first Minister for Health to get down to have a look at the idea of a common selection procedure for consultants and senior registrars.  I am the first person in this position to become preoccupied about this.  Having done it, after years of agitation from the Irish Medical Organisation, no sooner have the documents gone out than some entirely negative reactions come back.

Over the past few weeks I have had lengthy discussions with three of the trade unions concerned &mdash; the Irish Transport and General Workers Union and the Federated Workers Union of Ireland and yesterday I had discussions lasting several hours with the Psychiatric Nurses' Association, as part of the process.  In brief, my reply regarding psycho-geriatric patients is that we have always clearly indicated that their needs must be catered for.  We have put forward proposals to both health boards as to how this should be dealt with.  As the Deputy knows, taking St. Dympna's Hospital as an example, out of 342 patients, 127 are over the age of 65 years.  There are special <Col N="655" /> problems affecting these patients.

      <P>I have monitored carefully over recent months the position in relation to residential accommodation in hospitals and homes for elderly persons and I am satisfied that, in general, no major problems arose over and above those experienced during previous winters. On the information which is available to me, no exceptional difficulties were experienced in any health board area, apart from the North-East where <Col N="658" /> the demand for beds for elderly patients was higher than usual.</P>
      <P>The position in general is that there are available an adequate number of beds for elderly patients and any additional resources which can be made available for geriatric services should be used to strengthen the community based services which in turn should result in a lowering in the demand for admission to hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the extent to which the non-capital allocation which has been approved for each health board for 1986 may not meet the projected estimate of requirements prepared <Col N="659" /> by the board.  The Deputy will appreciate that these estimates are invariably subject to negotiation and review and when made are dependent on the anticipated rate of inflation.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will, no doubt, appreciate implementation of Government policy to reduce public expenditure must involve some restriction of the Exchequer resources provided for health services since the non-capital health estimate accounts for about 19 per cent of the total estimates for non-capital public services for 1986.</P>
      <P>I would like to record my appreciation of the constructive and responsible way in which health boards have, in general, approached the task of containing expenditure within the 1986 approved levels. Inevitably some difficult decisions will have to be taken but I am confident that the measures selected by health boards for coping with the situation will be such as to enable essential services to be maintained.</P>

      <P>We made a very comprehensive report to each health board on the level of resources available for 1986.  We have had a long series of meetings with each health board.  Overwhelmingly we have resolved those difficulties but since 70 per cent or 75 per cent of all health expenditure is in relation to the payroll, we have had to devote considerable attention to that aspect, particularly premium payments.  I am glad to see that one hospital in Cork which was paying £500,000 in overtime has taken care of the situation in the budget for 1986.  The position overall is quite reasonable.  With an inflation rate of 3 per cent, the benefits to hospitals of reduced energy costs and the prospect of some additional moneys being available in appropriations-in-aid, <Col N="660" /> we will get through 1986, with some difficulty. The level of health expenditure has been contained, despite all the difficulties we have had to face.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The framework for the provision of an adequate dental and orthodontic service for eligible persons already exists.  In the case of the dental service the embargo on the creation of additional posts in the public service does not permit the health boards to increase their dental staff numbers at present, but all the health boards are managing to maintain staff numbers at the approved level.  Some health boards have cut back on the use of private dental practitioners for the treatment of eligible patients in order to cut costs.  The amount of money which is allocated to any particular service is a matter for the individual health board to decide on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of orthodontics, the health boards have been given approval to employ a total of six consultant orthodontists. One consultant orthodontist has been appointed to date and the Local Appointments Commission are seeking to recruit consultant orthodontists to fill the remaining posts.  It is expected that another post, and possibly two, will be filled quite soon.  In the light of the remarkable progress that has been made in such a short time in the one health board that has a consultant orthodontist I am confident that the filling of the vacant consultant orthodontist posts will go a <Col N="661" /> long way towards providing an adequate orthodontic service for eligible persons.</P>

      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs and the Irish Embassy in Rome have succeeded in making telephone contact with several Irish citizens in Libya.  On the basis of information available to the Department, it would appear that most Irish citizens are safe and well and we would hope that all our citizens will also be able eventually to report safe and well. The Department of Foreign Affairs is providing an emergency telephone service to deal with calls from relatives and friends seeking information about Irish citizens in Libya.  While at the moment there are delays in telephone communications with Libya, telephone lines are open in both directions.  Tripoli airport is currently reported closed and we have no information as yet as to when it is likely to reopen.</P>
      <P>The Government strongly share the concerns of the United States about international terrorism.  For our own part, we believe that terrorism can be defeated by political methods aimed at the isolation of those who engage in or support terrorist acts.  In co-operation with our partners in the Twelve, we have been co-ordinating measures against terrorist attacks and to ensure the eradication of this evil.  In the statement which they issued last night, the Foreign Ministers of the Twelve emphasised that States clearly implicated in supporting terrorist acts should renounce such support and respect the rules of international law.  They called upon Libya to act accordingly.  I have placed the full text of the Twelve statement in the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to assist the achievement of <Col N="663" /> a political solution, the Twelve Foreign Ministers in their statement also underlined the need for restraint on all sides. The Government now appeal to all sides to avoid further actions which would escalate international tensions and lead to further tragic loss of life.</P>
    <P>The Security Council of the United Nations is already seized of the crisis in US-Libyan relations.  They will resume their consideration of the crisis today. Ireland is not currently a member of the Security Council but our Permanent Representative at the UN is following closely all developments.</P>
    <P>The Government are remaining in close touch with our partners in the Twelve in this matter.  It is likely that there will be a further meeting of the Twelve Foreign Ministers in the next few days which I will, of course, be attending.</P>
    <P>Community Foreign Ministers at their meeting yesterday had no advance indication of the American action.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister deplore the US attack on Libya particularly in view of the large number of civilian casualities and of the threat that such action poses to world peace? In view of the statement by President Reagan that he is prepared to launch a similar attack again, is the Minister concerned for the future safety of Irish citizens working in Libya and does he consider that he has a special responsibility to convey in the strongest terms possible to the US Government his concern for the safety of those Irish citizens and also his abhorrence at the thought of any further bombing raids.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I am concerned about the safety of Irish citizens, whether in Libya, Berlin, Rome or Vienna and I should hope that the events which culminated in the attack on Libya this morning, that is, international terrorism, could be eradicated so that such measures would not be necessary in the future.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not <Col N="664" /> prepared to condemn categorically what was clearly a terrorist attack by the US on Libya?  Everyone here would support the Minister's condemnation of any involvement that Libya may have had in terrorist attacks on citizens of any State but would the Minister not condemn the American attack on innocent Libyan people?  This is an important occasion in terms of the Government demonstrating their independence and their condemnation of terrorism, regardless of where that terrorism emanates from.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not lose sight of the events that gave rise to this morning's incident.  It is not sufficient to say that we should condemn the US in this instance when clearly US citizens were under terrorist attack for the past few months in many parts of the world by way of actions that appeared to be the result of encouragement or even active support from Libya to terrorists.  We should bear that in mind when we think of what has happened.  Obviously, I would not have available to me information that would allow me to say that the Americans were justified in the action they took but I am sure that when the UN meets this evening, the US action will be justified to world opinion.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that it is the position of the Irish Government that all international disputes should be settled by peaceful means?  Would he agree that it is not legitimate to engage in military action in response to terrorist attacks?  In other words, would he agree that it is not legitimate internationally for a country to respond by way of large-scale military action to any terrorist attack or to any series of such attacks?  Also, will the Minister deal specifically with the matter I raised in my question, namely, whether the Irish Government, by whatever means available to them, will press for an initiative by the UN, because whatever view one takes of this incident, we can all agree that it has serious and dangerous implications for world peace?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in my original reply that for our own part we believe that terrorism can be defeated by political methods aimed at the isolation of those who engage in or support terrorist acts. The actions of this Government within our own country in the past few years must underline our very strong belief in politics rather than in action of another kind.  However, it is clear that since last summer deliberately provocative acts of terrorism have been aimed at US citizens in many parts of the world, particularly around the Mediterranean.  We are not a member of the UN Security Council but I suspect that when the Council meet later today the US will justify their action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that this Government believe strongly that politics and dialogue are the means of solving problems either here or in other parts of the world.  We regard the UN as the world body which oversees those solutions but there is such a concept as self defence, a concept that has been invoked on many occasions.  I am not saying that will be the reason given today at the UN but it is the reason that has been put forward by some of America's friends and allies as a justification for what happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether he considers what happened this morning to have been in breach of international law and whether he considers that the self defence option is open to a country on the basis that some of its <Col N="666" /> citizens were attacked two or three weeks previously?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had answered that clearly.  I understand the attitude of the Americans following terrorist attacks on some US citizens in four or five different parts of Europe, in some instances by groups of whom Libya has been supportive. The provocation posed by those attacks presumably prompted the American Government's decision to attack Libya this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I deplore any action that is necessary in this regard which endangers lives or causes lives to be lost but conversely I deplore the actions that lead countries to believe that retaliation of this kind is necessary.  We have taken that line consistently and I wish all Deputies would adopt the same line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There are serious implications in the Minister saying that US action was necessary on the basis of alleged previous action by Libyan terrorists. On that basis would it be the opinion of the Minister that any state, the UK for instance, would be correct, presumably on the basis that they believed themselves to be correct, to launch an attack on Ireland because of terrorist acts by Irish people in Britain?  That would seem to be the logic of what the Minister is saying. What is his reaction to the use by the US <Col N="667" /> of its air bases in Europe to launch the attack on Libya?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that I understand that the Americans may say their action was necessary on the basis of attacks on their citizens throughout the world.  I do not think that this House and myself in particular are in possession of enough facts at the moment to make a judgement on that, but I believe that over time the facts will evolve and we will be able to come to a cooler and more clearly argued decision as to whether the action was justified.  I believe the Americans in taking the action they did last night, felt they were justified in international law and morally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister says must urge me to ask this question.  Are he and the Irish Government not deeply concerned that this situation contains grave dangers for world peace?  I would ask him to deal with that question specifically. Is there not in his view and in the view of the Irish Government inherent in this situation a very real danger to world peace and the possibility of an outbreak of war?  In those circumstances would he not agree with me that the important thing for the Irish Government to do at this stage is to use every possible resource at their disposal to stop this situation from escalating any further?  That should be a key objective of Irish foreign policy &mdash; to stop any possible further escalation or extension of this threatening, dangerous and ominous situation.  Would he care to comment on those two aspects of this matter and perhaps give us some hope or some indication of action by the Government in the light of those fears which I think are universally held throughout this country at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the Irish Government are gravely concerned, as I said in my reply, about any violence taking place in the world which has the potential to escalate into a wider area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="668" /> We are deeply concerned about that.  It is because of that concern, which is not just peculiar to the Irish Government but is shared by all the countries of the Twelve, that a special emergency meeting of the Twelve Foreign Ministers was called yesterday.  There is a probability that a further meeting will be called the day after tomorrow to deal with the situation which has changed in the last 24 hours.</P>
    <P>Of course we will use all our good offices in the United Nations to give whatever aid we can to the Secretary General, or to whatever other body would wish to seek to bring an end to the causes and the effects of what has occurred in the last few days.  I have to stress again that the Security Council is meeting today, possibly at this moment.  We are not a member of it but we will give encouragement to anybody on that Security Council to try to bring about a solution and to avoid any further escalation of what occurred yesterday.</P>

The Taoiseach will be aware of the fact that the introduction of Second Stage of the Bill in the House is two weeks later than the Taoiseach's undertaking.  I understand that it is now being proposed by the Government Whip to limit the debate on Committee Stage to three days which will prove to be entirely inadequate for a Bill which contains 108 sections.  I would assume that, since as a direct consequence of the Government's decision and the Taoiseach's failure to honour his commitment to the House we are now two weeks late starting Second Stage, he will not make a mockery of this House or allow it to be mocked by pushing through the Committee Stage of a most complex Bill in three days.

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1986: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill gives statutory effect to the taxation changes introduced in the 1986 budget.  It also contains a number of other provisions not announced in the budget.  The more important of these are additional measures intended to encourage economic activity and employment and to promote greater employee involvement in share ownership.</P>
      <P>I will deal in due course with the more significant individual aspects of this Bill. I would like in the first place to speak on the general economic and budgetary position and on the broad taxation startegy underlying the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is a new optimism in the economy. The reduction in energy prices and the continuing downward trend in inflation have increased confidence.  This will be reflected gradually in improving investment and employment prospects. We have a good competitive position internationally and the opportunities exist in the new climate for significant economic growth.  The Government's role is to provide the best possible environment for growth and to provide special incentives where appropriate.  In particular, we must encourage investors to break out of the traditional mould and to show a greater willingness to take risks in building up enterprise.  For the first time in several years the outlook is bright, we are on a rising curve and we must not miss our opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the budget, the positive outlook <Col N="784" /> for the Irish economy and for other oilimporting countries has been enhanced by the steep fall in energy prices.  While oil experts and economic commentators are still unsure about future trends, there is general agreement that the maintenance of lower prices will boost the projected growth in demand in most economies and lead to a more pronounced reduction in inflation rates than had been envisaged some months ago. This should benefit our economy in a number of ways.  The annual increase in the consumer price index at mid-February of 4.6 per cent was the lowest since 1968.  Inflation will be lower than projected at budget time and should average no more than 3 per cent this year.  Indeed, the year-on-year rate of increase will decline further to around 2 per cent in the second half of the year.  As a result of this reduction and the income tax reliefs in the budget, the growth in real personal expenditure should be considerably more buoyant than in 1985.  Investment should also maintain the upward momentum experienced last year due to the better economic climate now in prospect and due to the measures introduced by the Government to assist activity in the building and construction sector.</P>
    <P>The stimulus to the economy from public expenditure will be somewhat larger than originally intended.  As most public expenditure outlays have already been determined in nominal terms, the lower level of price increases now being forecast will lead to a higher real level of spending.  The Government have already reaffirmed that the cumulative increase of 7 per cent under the 25th pay round is still on offer despite the lower projected rate of inflation.  I am sure that public servants in particular will recognise the real benefits which these proposals will c on them over the next 15 months and that they will appreciate that the pay provisions in the budget represent the maximum that we can afford.</P>
    <P>The prospects for the balance of payments are that the surplus on the balance of trade will continue to grow.  Overall, the balance of payments deficit in 1986 <Col N="785" /> should be much less than the 3 per cent of GNP projected in the national plan.</P>
    <P>With lower inflation and higher economic growth, the climate for employment should continue to improve. The indications are that non-agricultural employment showed a small increase towards the end of 1985.  Overall, the economic environment for 1986 augurs well for a continuation of this upward trend which will be supported by the wide series of measures introduced by the Government to increase the opportunities for employment.</P>
    <P>The returns on Exchequer receipts and expenditure for the first quarter of the year show that the budget targets are on course.  While price reductions and other developments will give a welcome boost to economic activity, they will have only a negligible impact on the public finances and will not allow for any relaxation of budget discipline.  The budget deficit remains uncomfortably high and reducing this deficit must continue to be a priority. In emphasising this I am not preoccupied with book-keeping but merely drawing attention to the fundamental reality that we have a serious public finance problem and pointing out that, while the improved economic outlook offers considerable opportunities, it also carries the risk of generating unrealistic expectations about our public finances.</P>
    <P>The improvements in personal taxation, which were announced in the budget, are now in effect and the taxpayers generally are beginning to feel the benefits.  In addition, the new child benefit is payable from this month onwards.  The tax improvements will cost the Exchequer £120 million this year and more than £200 million in a full year. The improvements more than meet the Government's commitments on personal taxation in the national plan and they will result in a significant increase in disposable incomes.  To put them in perspective, the £120 million cost of the concession in 1986 adds up to 8½ per cent of the total estimated yield from income tax in the same period.</P>
    <P>Despite these improvements however, I readily acknowledge that our levels of <Col N="786" /> taxation remain unduly high.  While we are committed under the national plan to no further increase in the burden of personal taxation the aim should be, as in 1986, to improve on that objective in so far as the constraints allow.  Tax increases have borne the main burden of public finance adjustment in recent years and they no longer provide a means of closing the budget gap.  All the economic arguments are in favour of reducing taxation and spreading the tax burden more widely.  We can make steady progress in this direction provided we accept that it requires us to bring down our expenditure profile.  If we cannot accept the logic of this, then there can be little prospect of tax reductions.</P>
    <P>The consequences of high taxation are disturbing.  It encourages the practice of payment through benefit-in-kind so as to avoid high marginal tax rates.  This is becoming a widespread problem and these benefits must be taxed more comprehensively in future.  High taxation also gives a boost to the black economy, making life more difficult for the legitimate trader.  It causes distortion of trade because of price differentials and the leakage of trade across the Border is now very worrying.  Finally, it adds to the problems associated with tax collection and enforcement.  If taxes are perceived to be severe and the incentive to evade is sufficiently attractive, then the difficulties of a tax collection system, however effective, are magnified.  As matters stand, our tax collection system is by no means as effective as it should be.  Some changes have already been announced, further changes are under examination and I consider improvements in collection to be a priority.</P>
    <P>If we want lower taxes, we must be ready to accept certain consequences.  I mentioned already the necessity to reduce expenditure.  The other fundamental requirement is that the tax base be widened.  This requires that we limit exemptions and reliefs.  This is the nub of the problem.  People are most reluctant to concede tax benefits, which they have come to take for granted.  Interest groups are continually pressing for bigger and <Col N="787" /> better tax incentives.  The common attitude is that tax adjustments to widen the tax base are most welcome in principle but unacceptable in practice.  We must get off this treadmill of illogicality and decide where our priorities lie.</P>
    <P>There are significant tax changes incorporated in this Bill.  First and foremost are the changes in personal income tax, which have not so far received the attention that they merit.  Much attention has been focused, however, on the taxation measures affecting the financial institutions. The moneys being raised from this source are required to meet the reductions in personal income tax.  This is entirely consistent with the policy, which I have outlined, of widening the tax base in order to lower overall tax levels.</P>
    <P>There are a number of provisions, including the reduction in the tax take on income from dividends of manufacturing concerns and incentives for research and development, which are designed to encourage risk capital investment by a wider cross-section of the community. We do not have a strong tradition of such investment and we are behind others in this respect.  This is a pity because we need indigenous investment of this kind to lift the economy and provide more employment.  I have a strong interest in promoting the profit-sharing idea or employee shareholding and a provision is included in the Bill to give a further impetus to this.  There are also changes in the treatment of share options.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the individual sections of the Bill and I will concentrate on the more significant items.  As the Bill is long and much of the text is of a technical nature, it would be impractical to deal with all sections.</P>
    <P>The early sections of the Bill give effect in the main to the income tax changes announced in the budget.  These provide for the increases in the exemption limits, the new rate bands and the changes in personal reliefs.  These changes in conjunction with the abolition of the 1 per cent income levy will mean a substantial improvement in the take-home pay packet of practically all workers.  For <Col N="788" /> example, a single PAYE taxpayer on £11,000 will have a reduction of £290 in tax, while a married couple with two children on £15,000 will be £322 better off as a result of the tax changes and the new child benefit.  These are the most significant improvements in income tax for several years.  I expect that workers generally appreciate the value of those changes, now that the benefits are coming through to them.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the special circumstances of elderly people the age allowance has been doubled from £100 to £200 and the age exemption limits have been increased by 5 per cent.  In conjunction with the retention tax concession being granted to those aged 65 and over, the standard of living of elderly people will definitely be improved as a result.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the 1 per cent income levy and the reduction of the top rate to 58 per cent will, together, have a significant effect on those highly paid employees with particular skills who may feel that there is little incentive for them to earn additional income.  Their income tax on each additional pound earned is being reduced from 61 pence to 58 pence.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of new significant incentives to encourage business. The current tax treatment of stock options is based on the date on which an option is first exercisable.  This may act as a disincentive for some companies to make use of stock option schemes to buy shares at below the market price and it leads to uncertainty about ultimate tax liability.  Provision is being made so that, in future, a charge to income tax will arise at the date the option is actually exercised and capital gains tax will be payable on the difference between the market price at the date of acquisition of the shares, irrespective of the price paid for them, and the proceeds received on sale of the shares.</P>
    <P>It has been alleged that the new tax treatment of share options will reduce their attractiveness.  This may be so in particular circumstances where options are granted at the market price and I propose to introduce an amendment to avoid this possibility.  The provisions now <Col N="789" /> incorporated in the Finance Bill will be extended to provide that, where an employee or director obtains an option in respect of shares in a company, or in another company by reason of his employment with the company and the option price is not less than the market value of the shares at the time the option is granted, an income tax charge will not be imposed in respect of the benefit.  The gain on the ultimate disposal of shares will in all cases be treated as a chargeable gain for capital gains tax.  It is worth recalling that the Bill also provides significant improvement in regard to capital gains tax anyway with the rates on long term gains down to 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>In support of my belief that increased share ownership can only help to improve the general industrial climate of the country and increase the productivity of workers, in section 8 I am reducing the qualifying period for full tax relief from seven years to five for shares issued under approved profit sharing schemes.  I will also introduce a Committee Stage amendment to abolish the 1 per cent stamp duty payable on the first sale of such shares.</P>
    <P>Given the success of the Business Expansion Scheme, which in its first full year of operation caused some £5 million to be invested in qualifying companies, I have extended the scheme to 1991.  In 1985, some 570 investors have qualified for tax relief under the scheme.  The attractiveness of the scheme has been further enhanced with the recent launching by the Stock Exchange of the smaller companies market.  This market will provide an additional exit mechanism for investors in the shares of qualifying companies.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill provides for a scheme of relief from full rates of income tax on dividends paid out of the income of companies qualifying for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.  The aim is to improve substantially the after-tax return to Irish shareholders in such companies so as to provide an enhanced incentive to encourage increased equity <Col N="790" /> investment from Irish sources in manufacturing companies here.  The mechanism by which relief will be given under the new scheme is to exclude from the charge to income tax an amount equal to 50 per cent of all dividends received by individual taxpayers.  The balance of a taxpayer's dividend income will then be liable to income tax at his marginal rate after deduction of the full tax credit.  It follows that the effective rate of income tax on the distributed profits of manufacturing companies and certain export service companies qualifying for the 10 per cent rate will be 23.74 per cent.  The total tax take on such profits, inclusive of corporation tax in the hands of the company and income tax in the hands of shareholders, will fall from 60 per cent to 32.55 per cent under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Relief will, however, be subject to a limitation in the form of a ceiling on the amount of dividend income which may be excluded from the charge to income tax in any year.  The ceiling for each taxpayer has been set at £7,000 per annum. Given average rates of return on investment in Irish industry today, the level of relief available under the new scheme will be sufficient to enable an individual to invest a sum of almost £300,000 and still obtain the full benefit of relief.  It is, therefore, an extremely generous relief by any standards.  By providing a facility to receive investment income of an amount up to £7,000 per annum completely free of income tax, the new relief will represent an incentive to encourage Irish investment in qualifying companies which is unequalled in the member states of the EC and may be without parallel anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>This, to my mind, is a very important part of the Finance Bill and should be seen to be linked to the Government's White Paper on Industrial Policy.  In the White Paper the Government said that, while they appreciated the importance of foreign manufacturing investment in Ireland, they wanted to see a greater development of strong Irish-owned companies in manufacturing rather than major Irish companies in the service or semi-protected sectors of the economy. <Col N="791" /> The best way of doing that is to encourage Irish people to invest in either whollyowned Irish companies or in companies operating in Ireland which may have some ownership outside as well.</P>
    <P>The philosophy underlying the Finance Bill is one which seeks to attract funds of Irish people away from forms of saving which are not autonomous wealth generators, where in a sense the money is being kept safe or static, into risk investments and into the manufacturing or trading sectors of the economy where the benefit will be enjoyed not just by the saver but by our population generally since that investment of savings will also create jobs.  By developing a flow of funds into Irish-owned manufacturing companies we will be reducing what in the past may have been an undue dependence on foreign investment for the growth of manufacturing in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This and other provisions in the Finance Bill should be seen as a direct consequence of earlier decisions taken by the Government in the White Paper on Industrial Policy to shift the incentive for saving into the risk oriented sector and to shift the emphasis towards domestically-owned companies rather than an unhealthy reliance on foreign-owned companies.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill provides for the continuation for a further year of the existing stock relief arrangements for farmers. Section 12 provides for a credit for farm tax paid against income tax liability generated by farming.</P>
    <P>In Chapter III of the Bill there is a new mechanism designed to encourage taxpayers to invest in research and development projects, where the risk is high, but where the rewards may be equally high when they materialise.  The level of R and D in this country is disappointingly low by international standards and we must do something about this.  Expenditure in 1984 on industrial research and development in Ireland accounted for 0.4 per cent of GDP as compared to 1.2 per, cent average for the OECD.  The scheme for relief for investment in R and D may <Col N="792" /> appear detailed and lengthy as it is set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The need for complex legislation arises in order to prevent the provisions of the scheme being abused and serving solely as a means of avoiding tax rather than facilitating the objectives of the scheme. Such detailed legislation will also assist genuine prospective investors by removing any uncertainty as to the scope or application of the relief.  Under the scheme qualifying investors may get tax relief of up to £25,000 in respect of moneys invested in a research and development company.  The investment may be short to medium term and it is unlikely that many long term investment projects will be involved.</P>
    <P>Qualifying research and development is defined in terms broadly similar to those used in the Industrial Development Act, 1969.  Because of the varied nature of the projects which it is desired to promote it is not possible to provide a more detailed definition of &ldquo;qualifying research and development&rdquo; without running the risk of excluding some worthwhile project.  There is a requirement that the benefits of any such project must accrue substantially to this country and, in order to encourage involvement by outside investors, the ceiling on investment by the sponsoring company, which must be a manufacturing company incorporated in this country, will be limited to 20 per cent.  This incentive will supplement the existing provisions of the business expansion scheme which may be used for raising capital for research and development in the case of a manufacturing company.</P>
    <P>There has been, as Deputy O'Kennedy will recall, some criticism from time to time of the business development scheme.  It was said that it was unduly complex.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is fair to say that in response to representations very substantial changes have been made in that scheme since it was introduced, there may still be a need in respect of the <Col N="793" /> business and development scheme and the scheme for research and development to promote actively an understanding of the way in which these schemes work among the accounting and legal professions and among investors.  I hope it will be possible for the Revenue Commissioners, in conjunction with other bodies with expertise in this area, to produce guidelines which would be of assistance to people seeking to avail of these schemes.</P>
      <P>The business development scheme and the research and development scheme are designed to give a major boost to the development of a strong self-sufficient Irish manufacturing and food processing sector.  Clearly, they will only work if they are widely understood and availed of by small investors as well as the few who may have access to the highest possible professional advice.  It is my view that the Revenue Commissioners in conjunction with myself and other Government Departments, should be active in promoting an understanding of the way these schemes work.  Once this Bill is passed I intend to make arrangements for the dissemination of the maximum amount of information on how to avail of these schemes.</P>
      <P>I regard the emphasis the Bill gives to the promotion of research and development as particularly important.  If any Member of this House looks at the range of goods on display, at, say, a trade fair he should ask himself how many of those goods would have been available at such a trade fair five years ago.  He will probably find that up to half the products on display would not have been there at that time. The logical extension of that is that if you were to go to the same trade fair in five years' time you would probably find that 50 per cent of the products now on display would not be on display then.  The lesson is that unless one is constantly developing new products to meet new tastes one will simply not survive in the marketplace; hence the need for companies to have priority for research and development which this Bill gives them the financial means of implementing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been argued that the present rates of capital gains tax are a disincentive <Col N="794" /> to investment.  This Finance Bill will go a considerable way towards ensuring that this is not the case.  In addition to the planned reduction in the 40 per cent rate of capital gains tax announced in the budget, the Bill also provides for a new lower rate of 30 per cent which will apply to assets held for six years or more and also to gains made on trading on the Smaller Companies Market.  The Smaller Companies Market is in its infancy and it is important that it succeed and open up new sources of capital to companies which at present qualify for quotation on the Stock Exchange.  With this in mind, the Bill provides that, for a period of three years, gains realised on trading on the new market will be subject to the 30 per cent capital gains tax rate.  This, I hope, will provide an impetus to the new market and will help to ensure its success.</P>
    <P>The incentives for industry, also the food industry, in this Bill should give a major impetus to investment in an already very favourable investment climate. There is no reason why industry should not be able to utilise this climate to create new jobs on a significant scale. This is the ambition which underlies the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Chapter IV of the Bill gives effect to the deposit interest retention tax scheme. The retention tax, as announced in the Budget, has received a mixed reaction. The financial institutions generally have welcomed it as a major step forward in harmonising the tax treatment of invested funds.  There has been criticism of the tax because of its impact on certain individuals and institutions.  The order which has now been brought to the tax treatment of deposit interest is overdue and, together with the uniform reporting arrangements, it will create an environment for fairer competition among the financial institutions.  For a long time some of these institutions have been asking for standard tax arrangements to apply across the board.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to clarify some aspects of the tax which appear to have been causing confusion. First, the tax is deductible from deposit interest paid or credited after 5 April <Col N="795" /> 1986: it is not a tax on the capital sum, simply on the interest.  Secondly, the tax does not represent double taxation since the interest earned by a capital sum is regarded anyway as a new source of income and has always been liable to tax in the hands of taxpayers.  Finally, there have been allegations that taxpayers will have to pay double tax on deposit interest for 1986-87.  This is not true.  As a transitional measure, the previous-year basis for taxing deposit interest is being suspended for relevant deposit accounts on 5 April 1986, and the 1985-86 tax liability for deposit interest will be switched to an actual year basis.  That is, 1985-86 liability will be based on interest paid or credited in 1985-86 only.</P>
    <P>The imposition of the tax will not materially alter the tax position of the bulk of depositors who are liable to income tax: the measure is a more effective tax collection system for that liability. The tax as originally announced was to apply to the deposit interest of all resident depositors.  In granting concessions to charitable bodies, incapacitated persons and individuals aged 65 and over, I feel that the best possible balance has been reached in minimising the extent of genuine hardship while at the same time maximising the yield from the tax.  It should not be forgotten that the tax will also apply to deposit interest paid in respect of moneys earned in the black economy.</P>
    <P>A tax of this nature will ease considerably the administrative difficulties involved in collecting tax on deposit interest. No doubt there will be continuing demands from other bodies and groups of taxpayers to have exemptions similar to those granted to charities and to older and incapacitated persons.  I must emphasise that, since exemptions are costly to administer, increase the complexity of the tax code and reduce the tax yield, there can be no question of any further concessions being granted.  When the Bill was published, I said that the Government had decided to exempt the over 65s and incapacitated persons as these are the categories most likely to be solely <Col N="796" /> dependent on interest for income, because of inability to engage in other income-earning activities.  Obviously, there will be a small number of individuals outside these categories who may be able to make a similar case.  Wherever the line is drawn, however, there is the risk of genuine cases being on the wrong side of it.  Refunds for all non-liable persons cannot be considered, however, because this would be far too costly.</P>
    <P>Chapter V gives effect to the tax incentives which have been announced by the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment to promote development and reconstruction in certain designated inner city areas in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.  The precise areas in which the incentives will apply are defined in the Third Schedule to the Bill.  This chapter complements the Urban Renewal Bill, 1986, which is already before the House and provides for the establishment of a new statutory authority to promote and control development of the Custom House Docks site in Dublin and for schemes of rates remission in relation to development on that site and in the other designated areas.</P>
    <P>For many years, inner city areas of the major urban centres in Ireland have been decaying and large areas have become derelict.  For decades, there has been a significant tendency for new development to locate in suburban areas and in outer urban areas which are perceived by the property market to be more favourable. There has been a consequent increase in the extent of physical decay, unemployment, crime, vandalism and the dispersal of established communities in the inner city areas.  Inner city decay also poses a continuing and increasing threat to the architectural character of urban areas generally.  Although public sector housing of a high standard is being provided in inner city areas, efforts to encourage private development there have had little or no success to date. Activity by the private sector has, in general, been painfully slow in securing the redevelopment of inner city areas.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill, in conjunction with the Urban Renewal Bill, 1986, represents <Col N="797" /> a major effort by the Government to stimulate activity to redress this situation and I am hopeful that the private sector will now respond to the needs of the areas in question in a positive way.  A further objective of the incentives is employment creation.  I am pleased to report to the House that the anticipated activity in the designated areas, along with the activity generated by the home improvement grants and the general pick-up in housing demand, have an employment potential of more than 3,000 jobs per year.</P>
    <P>Section 42 contains the promised legislation to counter abuse of limited partnership arrangements for tax avoidance purposes.  The legislation has retrospective effect from 22 May 1985, the date when my predecessor announced in Seanad Éireann the Government's intention to introduce such legislation.  The abuse in question arose from the fact that, in a limited partnership arrangement, the limited partners have had the right to set off losses and capital allowances arising out of the partnership trade against other income without any restriction. Limited partners could thus circumvent their tax liabilities by manipulating in a contrived way a partnership arrangement so as to create highly inflated tax losses.  Their investment in the partnership need only have been nominal, but limited partners were in a position as a result of that investment to obtain a guaranteed return in the form of a reduction in their tax liability which could be, and most often was, a multiple of the investment.</P>
    <P>A number of instances of such blatant abuse indicated that there was a significant loss in tax revenue occurring as a consequence of limited partnership arrangements.  In these circumstances, the Government have had no alternative but to move against the abuse in the interests of tax equity.  In commending this section of the Bill to the House, I wish to put formally on record my intention to extend the scope of the proposed measure with retrospective effect to all general partnerships in the event that these are now used for the purpose of continuing the abuse which heretofore <Col N="798" /> has been confined to limited partnership arrangements.</P>
    <P>I want to say something at this point about the film making industry in Ireland. The abuse of limited partnership arrangments was exploited to a considerable extent to fund film projects.  Because of the contrived way in which such arrangements were structured, the cost to the Exchequer in terms of tax foregone was out of all proportion to the benefits accruing to film making.  Since the announcement of the Government's intention to legislate against the abuse, there has been pressure for some special tax incentives to encourage investment in the industry. In response, I have fully reviewed the taxation arrangements which now obtain in relation to film making and I wish to take this opportunity of saying that I consider them to be generous by any standards.  When I referred to existing incentives in film making, I particularly have in mind the fact that film making qualifies under the business development scheme whereby individuals can invest up to £25,000 of their income in any year and do not have to pay any tax on that money, if it used for film making or put into an investment fund whose purpose is film making.  That mechanism has already been very successfully used in respect of an Irish made film which is now on a first run showing in cinemas all over the country.  That model provides a very effective tax incentive to commercial film making where people are investing in film making with a view to making a profit but also in the knowledge that they might lose something if the film did not do well, in other words, a normal commercial investment.  Unfortunately, what some people seem to want as an incentive for film making is a completely no risk situation for the investor, where he puts in his money, gets his tax break and cannot lose.  That is not a desirable way of encouraging any form of commercial activity.</P>
    <P>Clearly there has to be a risk element for the investor as well as a tax incentive and that is why I have decided that we have gone far enough in the provisions already made for film making without getting into the area of providing risk free <Col N="799" /> investment opportunities in any sector of the economy which would be most undesirable in the headline it would give to the rest of the economy.  It would also be most undesirable from the point of view of the ordinary taxpayer who could not afford to avail of such incentives but whose tax burden would be increased as a result of the erosion of the tax base by such proposals.</P>
    <P>Section 44 provides for the application of a surcharge on ultimate tax liability where certain income returns are not received by an inspector of taxes within a specified period.  This change was announced by the Taoiseach in this House last October as part of a tax reform package.  The charge will be 10 per cent of tax ultimately payable.  It is a significant imposition and it is aimed at improving compliance by self-employed and corporate taxpayers in submitting income returns at an early date.</P>
    <P>The ceiling on the restriction on capital allowances for business cars and the <i>pro rata</i> restriction on the running expenses of such cars is being increased from £3,500 to £4,000.  This is a modest increase which, of course, does not take account of the increase in the general level of car prices since the introduction of the £3,500 restriction in 1976.  However, the cost to the Exchequer in raising the restriction to a level consistent with present prices for appropriate cars would be quite prohibitive and is out of the question at this time.  It would also be inequitable since it is clear that many of those who have business cars enjoy a considerable advantage over other taxpayers who must meet all their motoring expenses out of after tax income.  This is due to the fact that the private benefit derived from the business car is subject to less income tax than monetary income. In these circumstances, it would not be fair to ask other taxpayers&mdash;and, indeed, taxpayers who cannot afford to run a car at all &mdash; to bear the cost of a substantial increase in the restriction.</P>
    <P>For the future, I am prepared to consider raising the restriction beyond its present, revised level on the basis that <Col N="800" /> the cost of doing so is matched in large part by an appropriate increase in the benefit-in-kind charges which apply in respect of the private use of business cars and by taxation of business mileage payments.</P>
    <P>I shall now deal with indirect taxation. Part II of the Bill is concerned with Customs and Excise.  For the most part this confirms the changes already announced in the budget.  The duties on tyres and tubes and spare parts are being abolished.  In the case of tubes and tyres this will be effective from 1 September 1986.  The duty on spare parts will be reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent on that date and abolished from 1 January 1987.  Section 64 amends the betting duty legislation to facilitate the Revenue Commissioners in countering evasion of duty in non-registered premises.  The two following sections provide more effective measures for the Revenue Commissioners in the control of red diesel oil. Section 70 provides for the new rates of road tax on private motor cars announced in the budget, with effect from 1 March 1986.</P>
    <P>Part III gives effect to the VAT changes announced in the budget, primarily, the reduction to 10 per cent in the rate on many services previously liable at the standard rate; the increase in the 23 per cent rate to 25 per cent; and the exemption of services supplied by dental technicians.  The reduction in value-added tax for services is a significant boost to the employment-intensive sector of the economy and should create more employment.</P>
    <P>Some additional measures are also included.  These deal with the taxation of services received from abroad that can currently avoid tax, the use for VAT record keeping purposes of data stored in electronic form and the withholding of VAT repayments in certain cases involving associate companies.  The existing provision that allows for newspapers to be liable at the 10 per cent rate is being re-worded to extend the benefit to certain fortnightly newspapers.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the reduction in the VAT rate on services, which will take <Col N="801" /> effect from 1 July will bring real economic benefits, in particular for the tourist sector but also for employment generally. It will also strike a blow against the black economy by helping to restore the competitiveness of legitimate traders.  Finally, I am confident that consumers, too, will quickly see beneficial spin-off effects in the form of lower prices for the services affected.</P>
    <P>Section 85 imposes a once-off stamp duty at a rate of 9 per cent on the investment income and the profits on the realisation of investments of life assurance companies.  The life assurance companies have enjoyed extremely favourable arrangements on corporation tax and this special duty is intended to recoup to the Exchequer some of the tax revenue forgone under these arrangements. A further reason for this new charge is that there would be an unfair competitive advantage for life assurance investment if the tax regime applicable to it remained unchanged at a time when a retention tax is being imposed on deposit interest.</P>
    <P>Since a special tax imposition may sometimes present particular difficulties for the sector affected, it has been decided to reduce the impact of the charge, as originally announced in the budget, in a number of respects.  The rate of duty is being reduced from 15 per cent to 9 per cent, industrial branch business and business relating to credit unions are being exempted, in addition to pensions and foreign branch business, and the final 10 per cent of the duty will not fall to be paid until mid-1987.  In addition, this charge will not apply for future years; instead there will be changes in the corporation tax rules applicable to life assurance companies which will increase considerably the corporation tax yield from the companies.  These changes will be incorporated in the Bill by way of an amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 92 provides for the continuation of the stamp duty exemption for transfers of agricultural land to young trained farmers.  I am conscious of the fact that this scheme has over the past <Col N="802" /> four years facilitated the transfer of land to young farmers but I am also conscious of the fact that its indefinite extension would remove the urgency for an early transfer of land and so would defeat the object of the scheme.  Accordingly, the Bill provides that the scheme will expire at the end of September next year and that for the final 12 months of its operation the age limit will be reduced from 35 to 30 years and the minimum qualifying ACOT courses will be extended from 100 hours to 150 hours.  This will give an added urgency to the need for an early transfer of land and will also encourage more in-depth agricultural training, both of which should lead to an immediate improvement in agricultural productivity.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives effect to the decision announced in the budget to impose a 1 per cent annual charge on those discretionary trusts which were made subject to the 3 per cent once-off charge introduced in the 1984 Finance Act.  The charge is directed at those trusts which are set up essentially to avoid or delay indefinitely the payment of capital acquisitions tax.  As such it will not apply where the disponer is still alive and any one of the principal beneficiaries is under 25 years of age.  I do not feel that a charge of 1 per cent is in any sense excessive or that it is a threat to the viability of any ongoing business concern.  If over a period of time a return of greater than 1 per cent per annum cannot be secured from the assets in a trust, economic pressures should force an adjustment in the disposition of the assets within the trust. The effect of the tax might even be to speed up this natural process of adjustment.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier, I have not followed the text section by section in my address but Deputies will, of course, have an opportunity of discussing each section on Committee Stage.  It has not been possible to incorporate all the proposed changes in the text as circulated.  Consequently, I will introduce a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  For the most part these are expected to be of a minor or technical nature, dealing with <Col N="803" /> omissions or textual improvements.  As I indicated earlier, I will circulate an amendment for changes in the corporation tax provisions applicable to insurance companies.  These changes are intended to provide a long-term basis for securing a reasonable tax contribution from the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>No doubt the standard criticism will be made that the Bill does nothing for employment.  This simply is not true, as I demonstrated earlier in my speech.  This Bill is to a considerable extent about changes in taxation that are designed to encourage greater economic activity, to increase disposable incomes and thus generate more employment.  I am optimistic about the outlook for employment. The reduction in inflation, the falling energy prices and the income tax improvements in the budget provide a background for a strong growth in real consumer spending.  There is a new confidence among the business community and this will be translated into improving job opportunities as the year progresses.</P>
    <P>I commend the Finance Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody coming into the House this afternoon would expect a sense of great urgency, a new sense of direction and a sense of dynamism from the Government even at this belated stage in their failed administration.  Anybody coming in would be further disillusioned by the tone and content of the Minister's statement to the House having regard to the appalling problems that exist in every sector of our community. We have had a nice cosy, one might say smugly reassuring, introduction from the Minister when the reality is that what is required is a total new sense of direction from the Government and a sense of purpose from the new Minister which will somehow lift the veil of pessimism and gloom that is all over the place.  If the Government are not aware of the position outside, I despair of any sense of positive response from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finance Bill is a totally inadequate response from the Government to the <Col N="804" /> critical condition of the nation and the chronic problems of unemployment and emigration.  The Minister was right in anticipating that the standard criticism will be made that the Bill does not do anything for employment.  I wonder what the Minister means by, &ldquo;the standard criticism&rdquo;.  Does he mean that the criticism I made in 1983, in 1984 and in 1985 will be repeated again in 1986?  Those criticisms made down the years were proved to be all too accurate despite the reassuring general tone of the Minister's predecessor.  That tone is reflected exactly in the same general reassuring tone of the Minister today.  If they are standard criticisms let me say that they have been proved to be all too accurate. The same standard criticism that will be levelled at the Minister, and the Government, in this debate will equally be proved to be accurate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Minister.  Before the debate on Second Stage concludes we will demonstrate how the standard criticisms will prove to be accurate once again.  We will show how the dismissal by the Minister of what he called the standard criticism relating to unemployment is not warranted.  The reality is that outside the House everybody is waiting for an improvement in employment and some hope and opportunity for those who have been unemployed for so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason for the problems our citizens face is seen clearly in the negative and repressive policies of the last three years which, even at this late stage, require to be fundamentally changed to create a new climate for enterprise and for investment and a dynamic spirit throughout our community.  There is no sign of that in the Finance Bill and there is no sign of a message from the Minister. The absence of our colleagues in the House today demonstrates just how irrelevant they think the exercise is.  This <Col N="805" /> should be an occasion for there being a packed house awaiting a new message.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>The Minister will regret having made that point.  When it comes to Committee Stage the Minister will find that he will be alone on those benches, as was his predecessor on many occasions, and that I will have the company of very many colleagues on this side of the House.  The Minister will discover that he will have not even one joining him in his vain attempt to defend a Bill that is not easily defended.</P>
      <P>Instead of the radical change required in policies, direction, even in philosophy, what we got was a change of responsibilities within the Cabinet.  The facts are that the personnel remain the same.  The budget policies, so universally rejected by the people, have not been changed and are being implemented, with some minor adjustments only, under the provisions of this Bill.  Not only are the policies not being changed but the whole purpose &mdash; in terms of dealing with late payments to the revenue, increasing the efficiency of collection, the whole objective of getting in as much as possible at whatever cost &mdash; remains exactly the same.  The scriptwriter, whoever he may be, is presenting the same material to the Minister for Finance.  With the exception of the Minister's facility to depart from his script on occasion he has not got the authority or the imagination&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I <Col N="806" /> am capable of presenting my own ideas. Indeed the Minister might remember that I do not have the benefit of the administrative back-up he has.  The reason I am responding spontaneously now is that I am genuinely gravely concerned and disappointed at both the tone and content of the Minister's remarks.</P>
      <P>The Minister has seen fit to say that there is a new optimism prevailing in the economy.  I might ask: where does this Minister live?  It may be that in certain lush parts of County Meath there is a new sense of smug optimism for one reason or another.  I can tell the Minister that there is no new optimism felt in this economy in any sector I can identify whether on the part of the old, the young, the worker, the farmer, the businessman or whoever.  I see no trace of a new optimism prevailing in the economy which the Minister claims, indeed at a time when there should be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept and endorse that there should be a new optimism prevailing. But the Minister claiming that there is will merely add to the frustration experienced by so many people over the last few years.  The reason for there being a new optimism in our economy is all too clear.  The Minister has referred to it but he has not indicated what the Government propose doing to take advantage of the magnificent boost they have received externally, the first Government to receive such an unprecedented boost to our economy.  Yet they have not got the wit or capacity to take advantage of it. With international oil prices falling to their lowest level since 1973, the dramatic drop of the last six to nine months has brought the oil prices on which this small open economy is so particularly dependent, to the same level at which they stood prior to 1973.  In nine months they have dropped as much as they increased over a period of almost ten years.  No Government in the history of this State has been presented with such an opportunity. We moaned and groaned at the consequences of the increasing oil prices, <Col N="807" /> the first experienced in 1974-75, the second, the Iranian oil crisis when I was in Government in 1978-79, when we foresaw the effects of those increases on our economy.  But when we receive the boost we have in the last six to mine months, the best this Government can do, through their ever-present public relations men, is to get across the message that this magnificent, external boost is a mixed blessing, a term used in many journals.</P>

      <P>The Minister should read all the material being trotted out by the Government Information Service over the last six months, pointing out that for instance, it may give rise to a certain strengthening of our currency against sterling which, in turn, will reduce our competitiveness.  Has the Minister not seen such remarks?  Some of the Minister's favourite pets, who produce the favourite columns through informed sources, have been trotting out that nonsense for quite some time.</P>

      <P>Then the Minister had better begin exerting authority.  The Minister is a member of the same Government who introduced those policies. If I thought the Minister could change the attitude of the whole Government I would be very happy but I see no sign of it judging from his introduction of this Bill.  I will demonstrate that not alone have such policies not been changed but are even getting worse.  Let us look at the reality of the situation.  With oil prices falling to their lowest level since 1973 world economies have been given a major boost for expansion, with unparalleled growth projections for almost all of the European and major world economies. For instance, the growth projections for the Federal Republic of Germany over the next three years are unprecedented.</P>

      <P>The projections of growth in the Netherlands are unprecedented as they are in almost all of the western economies.  In fact those growth projections are now well in excess of anything experienced since the sixties.  What do we do?  Somehow we decide to mark time.  Obviously we have no plan whatsoever to avail of the new market opportunities obtaining.  It is even suggested by some that because falling oil prices improved people's position on the outside it does not help us because our competitiveness is not improved by reason of the fact that it helps them as well.  It is time we stopped that kind of nonsense and demonstrated that when there is a new enhanced, buoyant market externally, new opportunities are opened up for everybody.  This Government appear to have no plan whatsoever to avail of those favourable market opportunities, the enhanced consumer demand for the products of what is a very open economy.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister had better hold his tongue as I managed to hold mine when he was delivering that awful, flat, toneless, lifeless, spiritless introduction to the House.  If I managed to be patient while I listened to that I hope the Minister will exercise the same discipline and restraint listening to me.</P>
      <P>Instead of promoting these new market opportunities the Government tinker with policies which have failed demonstrably. I notice the reference to the budget deficit, an amusing hint of an enlightened attitude.  The Minister will remember in 1983 &mdash; he was in Government then &mdash; when the total commitment of this Government was to eliminate the budget deficit in four years.  It got to the stage that there were old ladies talking about the budget deficit at front doors.  The preoccupation of the Government was with the elimination of that awful cancer, the current budget deficit, in four years. They managed to convince the electorate that they, and they alone would do just that, that others could not be trusted because they did not have the same missionary zeal to do so.  A change of mind took place when, as a consequence of their policies, not only did they not eliminate that budget deficit but increased it, increased unemployment and all the other negative factors in our economy.</P>
      <P>The second stage of reducing the budget deficit came in <i>Building on Reality</i> in which we were no longer talking about eliminating anything.  That was gone.  We changed our sense of direction and spoke about reducing the deficit to 5 per cent by 1987.  That was the target a little more than 12 months ago.  That is more of the cloud cuckooland of the 1983 reference to eliminating the budget deficit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today the new Minister for Finance spoke about reducing the budget deficit, and said it remains a priority.  He said &ldquo;the budget deficit remains uncomfortably high&rdquo;.  It was lower than that when they came into Government but they regarded it as not only uncomfortably high but as the major constraint, the chain around our necks, the scandal of international financiers.  It is now still higher but it just happens to be <Col N="810" />&ldquo;uncomfortably high&rdquo;.  We are assured that reducing it continues to be a priority. If this treatment of the budget deficit as a priority is to be as successful as the attempts to eliminate, the Government will have to re-write history as well as their present policies.</P>
    <P>I wonder if our party would be allowed in our policy statement approaching the general election to make a pronouncement on the budget deficit and borrowing. Are we sufficiently cleansed to be allowed to say that reducing the deficit would be our priority?  Would that be as acceptable from us as from this responsible Government?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would we be allowed to say we will reduce the total national debt which the Government have increased by 66 per cent in three years? Let us acknowledge that the Government not only have failed in all these things but they have totally forfeited any right to credibility from people who match their performance with their words.</P>
      <P>In this new international economic climate what have the Government been doing?  Are they tinkering at the edges? They are doing worse, as I intend to demonstrate.  Instead of availing of the new opportunities they maintain artifically high prices by increasing taxation on products that are falling dramatically on international markets &mdash; petrol and diesel oil.  When the prices of these products are falling internationally the Government are ensuring that it will not be allowed in this nation, further undermining our competitiveness in labour intensive industries like tourism.  They maintain huge prices on petrol and diesel oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Government came to office excise duty and VAT on these products accounted for 123.5p of the retail price of 248p per gallon of premium petrol. Granted, international prices of oil in those days were high.  Consistently in successive budgets the Government increased the level of excise duty and <Col N="811" /> VAT on these products with the pinnacle now proposed in this Bill of 178p of the retail price of 267p, namely, 67 per cent of the total take from the user of petrol. Less than three years ago the Exchequer take was 49 per cent.  I will give the incremental stages by which this pinnacle was reached.</P>
    <P>Pre-January 1983, the retail price of a gallon of petrol was 248p.  The tax take was 123p, representing 49 per cent of the total retail cost of a gallon of petrol.  The change introduced in January 1983 meant that the tax element was increased by 16p to 139p of the total cost of 267p, representing 52 per cent.  This continued until June 1985 when the tax element was increased to 174p, a jump of exactly 45p since the Government took office.  That 45p jump meant that the Government take on a gallon of petrol was 56 per cent. Before this year's budget the tax take on a gallon of petrol was 57 per cent, but in this year's budget and Finance Bill the actual proportion of tax on a gallon of petrol was increased by 9 per cent, almost 10 per cent, to 67 per cent of the retail cost of a gallon of petrol.  The tax now is 177.8p of the retail price.</P>
    <P>That has been done by a Minister who told us about the great signs outside, the great new economic resurgence.  How could the Minister have the effrontery to tell the House that things are looking up when by this Bill he is increasing the percentage of tax take on petroleum products by 10 per cent, the biggest single increase in any one year, far surpassing anything his predecessor, who was pretty widely criticised for his tax takes, ever attempted?  The tax element now on the retail price of these products is 45 per cent higher than when the Government came to office.  Yet the Minister tells us about a new climate for investment, activity and buoyancy.</P>
    <P>Driving through my constituency today I heard on the radio of a crisis call from the Society of the Irish Motor Industry. They are recruiting every possible agent they can get to approach every Member of this House to underline the extent of the crisis because of the tax level that <Col N="812" /> has crippled the industry.  Obviously, the Minister did not listen to his radio when he can introduce increases like this and pretend we are not in a critical state. Instead of passing on benefits which are there to be passed on, the Minister is blocking them at source.  If we are to continue with the same depressing experience we have had in the past three years it is not surprising that there has been a major fall off in the consumption of these products in recent years with an inevitable reduction in confidence in the Government.</P>
    <P>The consumption fall-off in petroleum products in the last three years, as illustrated by replies which I received from the Minister for Finance, represents 30 per cent.  Can the Minister see that as a sign of renewed buoyancy of the economy? There is in consequence a very sharp drop in the real return to the Government in revenue, which the Exchequer returns for end of year demonstrate as exactly the same with regard to petroleum products as last year.  Perhaps there is an extra £3 million or £4 million, but that is of no consequence in a yield well over £100 million.  We have clearly reached the point of diminishing returns and the Government are determined to prevent our enjoying any benefit from the new opportunities available now.  It is not surprising that international tourism is decreasing, even though it had been during the whole recession the great growth industry.  Elsewhere there appear to be very optimistic projections in this regard, but any possibility of growth in our tourism sector was stifled by those prohibitive price increases and the magnetic attraction across the Border, of which we all have been aware.  This gave rise to the desolation of the economy of the Border counties.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware that in his own constituency it is a matter of crisis proportions, particularly in the northern end of County Meath, if he ever happens to go that way.  There and in County Cavan he would see the critical consequences of recent actions which he now proposes to further aggravate.  He will surely get a hero's welcome in County <Col N="813" /> Meath from petrol station and garage owners for this proposal in the Finance Bill.  I thought that the Minister might have had a change of mind in this area, but that was not so.  He is going to increase the tax take on petroleum products. The desolation of the Border counties is a direct consequence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As the continuing growth in the unemployment figures and the ever-increasing spiral of emigration underlines, the only new jobs available for our people are all outside Ireland, as a consequence of this Government's policy.</P>
      <P>Quite a number of the Government Ministers took the opportunity over the St. Patrick's Day period to visit the United States.  I, too, spent some time in the United States at that period.

      <P>Our tax levels are clearly the highest in the whole OECD area and instead of moving towards lower levels and taxation reform this Bill proposes to add further to the complexities of the tax system by introducing the inequitable and confiscatory DIRT proposal. Year after year we have argued and tried to persuade this Government that the tax levels they were imposing would have disastrous effects in every area but they ignored what we said.  We <Col N="818" /> pointed out that there would be effects in the black economy and that the investment climate would be undermined and put us at a very major disadvantage.  Each year the Government ignored us.  The Minister said today that all the economic arguments are in favour of reducing taxation and spreading the tax burden more widely.  It is a pity he is not here to hear my welcome for that statement.  I agree. All the economic arguments were there for doing these things three years ago, two years ago and last year, but despite that the Government went the other way and increased the tax burden.  They are doing precisely the same today, although the Minister says that all the economic arguments are in favour of reducing taxation and spreading the burden more widely.  The burden may be spread more widely but it is certainly not spread more fairly.</P>
      <P>The Minister also stated:</P>
      <P>High taxation also gives a boost to the black economy, making life more difficult for the legitimate trader.  It causes distortion of trade because of price differentials and leakage of trade across the Border is now very worrying.</P>
      <P>This repeats and endorses what I have been saying for a considerable time.  The leakage of trade across the Border, the disadvantage for the legitimate trader and the growth of the black economy have been promoted with special favour by this Government.  This Finance Bill, particularly in maintaining high levels of excise duty and VAT, will do exactly the same.  While the Minister at least recognises in his speech that our tax levels are too high, I should like to see him go a step further and take effective action to reduce them.  Our tax levels are the highest in the whole democratic world, a point underlined in the OECD survey. Instead of moving towards lower tax levels and taxation reform this Bill proposes to add further to the complexities of the system by introducing the DIRT proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance indicated during his publicity presentation of the <Col N="819" /> Finance Bill when he met political and economic correspondents that the income tax reductions, as he calls them, are urgently needed and that difficult measures like this new tax must be contemplated to achieve the overriding priority of reduced income tax.  That is what the Minister said when he was trying to justify this totally inequitable and confiscatory tax.  Today he says more or less the same and perhaps we should give him some marks for consistency.  He said that the moneys being raised from this source are required to meet the reductions in personal income tax.  Those who will be paying DIRT should know that their money is necessary to meet the scarcely visible reductions in personal income tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say the retention tax as announced in the budget has received a mixed reaction.  I am convinced the Minister is totally out of contact with reality in describing that reaction as &ldquo;mixed&rdquo;.  We will have much difficulty in speaking the same language, much less agreeing on economic measures.  The Minister also stated that refunds for all non-liable persons cannot be considered because this would be far too costly. Refunds cannot be considered for people who are not liable to tax on the grounds that it is too costly.  How could any Minister for Finance or Government justify those principles?  People who are not liable for tax will be made to pay this tax in order to reduce the burden on those who do pay tax.  Those are outrageous principles to present to any House.  It is outrageous and cynical that minimal income tax reductions for those within the income tax band can be achieved only through the imposition of a 35 per cent retention tax on those whose income is below the income tax base.  No Government should introduce such a proposal and attempt to justify it by the kind of statements the Minister made here today. No Government with any sense of justice could advance such an indefensible justification for imposing a 35 per cent income tax on the poorer sections of our community, hitherto exempt from income tax.  The Minister for Finance <Col N="820" /> even has the temerity to claim that he is increasing the exemption limits, while at the same time imposing tax at source on the income of many of those who are being exempted.  He is making sure that the increase in the exemption limits will not be of any great benefit.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about this tax.  All under the age of 65, widowed, married or single, who are totally dependant on interest on their deposits will henceforth, on the proposal of this Minister for Finance and this Government, have tax deducted at source on the interest on their deposits.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Hegarty, has arrived.  I heard him recently speaking on radio.  This Government seem to have social contact cnly at a very privileged and smug level of our society.  I heard the Minister say that the farmers with whom he is in contact have really no objections to paying the new service costs to ACOT.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that we have a Minister at the Department of Agriculture rather than the Minister for Finance, perhaps we should turn to that.  The Government intend to apply this income tax at source to all under the age of 65, irrespective of their income or their capacity to earn who will have deposits in the banks and regardless of whether they are widows, single or married persons or whether they are young people <Col N="821" /> on behalf of whom parents may have deposited some moneys by way of giving them a start in life or of encouraging the savings habit.  In most enlightened countries people who save are given tax breaks.  The Japanese economy has been built up to a considerable extent by way of encouraging savings through tax allowances.  That should be our attitude also but the Government are taking the opposite approach.  Young people and children who by definition have no taxable income will be subjected to the same harsh treatment without any regard to their needs or dependency.  This tax offends every principle of justice and equity.  Any Government with a semblance of respect for those principles would ensure that this type of tax would apply only to those whose income is within the normal income tax bands.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil will table amendments for Committee Stage in an effort to ensure such provision and we will be expecting support from every party but particularly from Labour who have expressed their concern about the lower income groups, about widows and people below the income tax level.  Our amendment will enable also The Workers' Party and the Progressive Democrats to support us in ensuring that people whose income, regardless of source, is below the income tax level will not be subjected to a deduction at source at the rate of 35 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is Deputy Durkan aware that, for instance, a widow living on her own does not qualify for family income supplement but will be subjected to this tax?  The same applies to anyone living on his or her own, so the family income supplement will not help the many who will be hit by this tax.  If they are under 65 the Revenue Commissioners will deduct from the interest on their savings at the rate of 35 per cent.  I trust that we will receive the response that our amendment will entitle us to so that there will be a more equitable position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the so-called concessions, <Col N="822" /> those over 65 or who are permanently incapacitated and their spouses are to be the only ones to be exempted from this tax, but the concession will merely allow them to claim refund of taxes that were deducted at source regardless of whether those concerned would be liable otherwise to income tax.  In other words, if such people can demonstrate that they are not liable to income tax and that they are over 65, they will be entitled at the end of the year to reclaim what was deducted from them at the beginning of the year and repayments would only be made by the Revenue Commissioners on receipt of applications at the end of the tax year.  We all agreed that we have an overburdened tax system, but now we are proposing to add an extra layer of bureaucratic weight.  This is being imposed in direct contradiction to the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation who recommended that there be no new taxes of this nature.  Such a tax is contrary to any principle of common sense and equity.  Most old people would either be unable or afraid in many cases to present claims for refunds and would consider awesome the task of proving to the Revenue Commissioners ineligibility for income tax.  One must ask who dreams up this sort of nonsense and what kind of Government can present a tax of this kind and imply that 75 year olds will have no trouble in making applications for refunds at the end of the year or in demonstrating clearly that they are not liable to income tax.  I did not think we would reach a stage where we would be imposing that burden even on those in respect of whom the Minister suggests there are to be concessions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made no reference to the matter of refunding the interest on the interest deducted at source.  If these people are to be deprived of their money at the beginning of the year and are not to be in a position to reclaim that money until the end of the year they will have lost the facility of the use of the interest in the interest.  There is no proposal to repay them the interest on the amount that was deducted during the 12 month period.  If he is not prepared to take an <Col N="823" /> approach on those fair lines even to those who are not even liable to tax and who may be in their seventies, eighties, or nineties, what may we expect from him? In section 44 he is providing for the application of a surcharge on ultimate tax liability where income tax returns are not received by an inspector of taxes within a specified period.  If the money is due to the inspector of taxes, the full whack of interest will have to be paid on it and in addition there will be a surcharge of 10 per cent.  If the money is withheld for 12 months from some impoverished person or old age pensioner, there is no provision to pay them interest on what has been deducted from them for the 12 month period even if they are being given a refund.  The Government must recognise that fair play should be an essential feature of every position and particularly so in relation to the poor and the old.  If the Revenue Commissioners are being given extra powers by reason of section 44 to recover interest payable to them on foot of outstanding debts, the least that should be done in respect of disadvantaged citizens is that there be repayment at the same level of interest as that deducted from their meagre income.</P>
    <P>The so-called concession to legal charities is also limited unfairly to those bodies or organisations whose activities are limited to legal charitable purposes only.  Let us be clear that legal charitable purposes are very limited, are very strictly confined and relate only to trusts set up for the specific and exclusive advancement of education, for the relief of poverty or for the advancement or promotion of religion. Many of the sporting, recreational or community organisations will find the interest on their limited funds diminished by 35 per cent on the basis that their activities are not specifically or exclusively for legal charitable purposes.</P>
    <P>One obvious example is the Lions Club, who do remarkably good work in many of our towns and cities.  Most of their work would otherwise be regarded even in law as specifically charitable work for the relief of poverty but they happen to be engaged also in what everyone <Col N="824" /> recognises are worthwhile community activities &mdash; for instance, the promotion of recreational facilities, support for certain social, cultural or artistic activities or perhaps the provision in hospitals or institutions of certain medical facilities. Because they are engaged in those other activities, which are in addition to the strictly legal charitable activity, whatever funds they might have would be subjected to this tax.  We need to promote a spirit of enterprise and community concern and to recognise the marvellous contribution of the many voluntary organisations, but instead we are to subject them to a 35 per cent tax solely because all of their work is not exclusively for legal charitable purposes.  The imposition of such a disability is most unfair.  Many people who conduct those activities would be subjected to the new tax because their other worthwhile community work or social work will take them outside the concession of charitable purposes only, which is referred to in the Bill.  Even those limited and specific charities which qualify for the concessions will find themselves for the first time under the income tax code. They have always been exclusively exempt but they will now be contributing to income tax because of lost interest on the 35 per cent withheld between the beginning of the year and repayment, where appropriate, 12 months later.  For the first time, even in respect of legal charges, we are going to have some level of loss in respect of tax deducted because of the interest which will be lost and which would otherwise be in their account for the full year.</P>
    <P>It is a cruel irony that a Government which has just asked the Dáil to sanction the establishment of a Combat Poverty Agency should now proceed with a proposal to spread poverty even more widely throughout the community and to penalise so many community organisations whose very spouse it is to provide an outlet and an escape from the all too pervasive poverty which exists at present. I am sure Deputy Durkan, who permits himself a smile, is aware of the fantastic <Col N="825" /> work of many of these community organisations. The only relief so many of those people get from grinding poverty is to enjoy community activities organised by these bodies.  For some, it may be bingo. This Government who pretend to combat poverty are now going to spread it even more and are going to tackle those people who are trying to make our country somewhat happier even in the face of the terrible poverty which we experience.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister argues that these unjust impositions are, &ldquo;justified by the fact that the top rates of tax, formerly 60 per cent, are now to be reduced by 2 per cent to 58 per cent&rdquo;. This new DIRT tax, so appropriately named, is necessary even for the poor because, the Minister says, &ldquo;the top rates of tax are reached at very modest income levels by comparison with other countries with whom we compete&rdquo;.  I agree, but even those at that income level who are clearly penalised very heavily by comparison with their counterparts in other countries would not have the gall to propose, as the Minister now proposes, that their burden at 60 per cent should be reduced to 58 per cent by applying a burden on people whose income is so low as to be beneath the tax level.  That is turning justice, logic, reason or any kind of economics on its head.  It is outrageous that the Minister should make such a statement.</P>
    <P>I have argued for a very considerable time in public and in this House that our tax levels, evidenced particularly by the top tax levels, are way above those which apply in other countries with whom we compete.  I will demonstrate in the course of Committee Stage of this debate, and the Minister will have to confirm this information, that both the level of top tax in Ireland and the income at which it applies is penal by comparison with anything that operates in other European Community countries.  In most cases a top tax level of 60 per cent is never reached.  If and whenever it is it will be at an income of six or seven times the level at which it applies here.</P>

      <P>I will introduce those figures on Committee Stage when proposing some adjustments to the income tax bands that the Government are pursuing in order to demonstrate the fact that our top tax levels are way out of line. It is a disgrace to suggest that the only way that those top tax levels can be reduced is to impose income tax burdens on people who are below the income tax limit.  That is an appalling injustice and should not be allowed to stand even in the interest of those on the top tax band whom the Minister claims he will relieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is that the comparison of tax levels for the top income earners demonstrate graphically the penalties which this Government impose on key personnel who are crucial to the promotion of enterprise and employment.  Many of the multinationals who came here for a while and then went away were not discouraged from doing so by their personnel who were located here.  They saw that the level of tax that they had to pay here was not such as to encourage them to continue their efforts here.  If we read behind the stories of some of those we lost we will find that one of the main reasons for going, at great cost to the taxpayer through subsidies of IDA grants and otherwise, was because of the tax levels which applied to key personnel.  The reason some of our own industries cannot attract people back is the very same, because of the tax levels that apply to top personnel.  If we are going to generate any sense of renewal and investment in the economy it will only be through recognising and rewarding people at every level and particularly at the top tax levels.  It is the only way that we will create a new enterprise and climate for investment which is so badly needed. While we need to generate wealth and employment the Government, as those figures will demonstrate, are determined to penalise it.  The politics of envy are alive and well in this Coalition.  They are trying to set every section against each <Col N="827" /> other.  They are now unfortunately setting taxpayers on the top tax band against the poor who have up until now been exempt from paying income tax.  The reaction will be, why should I have to pay tax so that the 60 per cent taxpayer will not have to pay his?</P>
    <P>This Government can at least claim consistency in line with the nonsense residential property tax, the yield from which is scarcely adequate to cover the administrative cost of collecting it.  Is it not a farce that we will still retain that nonsense tax on the Statute Book after this legislation is passed?  The reason for that is the politics of envy.  We want to signal to people that it is not acceptable under this Government to succeed or to generate wealth for reinvestment for one's family and for the economy.  That situation should be changed.  This latest development is going in precisely the wrong direction in order to do so.  The Minister for Finance should introduce an amendment not only to change the DIRT tax but to abolish it.  We will introduce amendments to give effect to the principles of fair play and equity and also to get rid of the nonsense residential tax which has killed the private house market for those who in many other countries would be included in the lowest income tax categories.</P>
    <P>There are some things in the Bill which I welcome such as the relief for dividend income and capital gains tax.  They are long overdue.  We have been calling for them each year and now that they have been introduced we will welcome them without reservation.  There are other concessions proposed by the Minister, such as the £500 increase in car allowance, which are so limited as to be inconsequential. Some, which he has now belatedly acknowledged himself, such as the stock option proposal, will in reality worsen the position for executives who might avail of the provisions of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I must say that it is quite significant that having introduced a provision for stock option the Minister has now belatedly recognised that in particular cases it may be that the new tax treatment <Col N="828" /> will reduce the attractiveness of what has already been operating.  This may be so in particular circumstances where options are granted at the market price.  The Minister proposes to introduce an amendment to avoid this.  We are used to this Government introducing amendments to their own proposals.  What was presented as a concession originally is now recognised to be, quite frankly, far from a concession but a disability.  We will support the Minister in changing the concession that he at first introduced which, in fact, we were determined to oppose by way of an amendment in any event if he did not come to that conclusion.</P>
    <P>The abolition in this Bill of the child tax allowance is going to impose a particular penalty on income taxpayers whose children are way above the age for children's allowance and who are pursuing third level courses of education.  At a point in the experience of every family when the maintenance in education costs are heaviest the Government blindly ignore these heavy burdens.  They add to them by abolishing the already limited allowances. In very many respects budget policies and the Finance Bill maintain the anti-family prejudice of this Government.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the child allowance scheme is matched by the obdurate refusal of the Government each year to provide for an adequate tax allowance for elderly relatives maintained at home by their families.  This Government are forcing many young couples through income pressures to look to the State and State institutions to provide for their parents or grandparents in old age.  Enlightened social policy demands that old people be cared for, if possible, in the comfort and security of their own homes.  Sound financial policy would reach the same conclusion because appropriate tax concessions would be very much less costly for the State than the growing cost of hospital and geriatric institutions.  The Government however close off all options for the care of the aged by forcing people to turn to the State while at the same time through the uncaring actions of the Minister for Health reduce the bed capacity of <Col N="829" /> geriatric institutions and in some instances close them altogether.  The Minister for Finance has an opportunity in this Bill to introduce some sanity and concern: sanity in terms of economic management because it will cost much less, and concern in terms of social policy.</P>
    <P>We will again this year, as we did last year, propose, and I hope not in vain, that the Minister offer appropriate tax allowances to couples, particularly married couples, who are providing for their parents or grandparents in their own homes.  It would be much more effective and appropriate social policy and more acceptable to older people if we did that. It has to be said, as I said last year, that it would cost the State much less than adding at great cost to institutional care and hospital facilities which clearly the Government are undermining at this stage through the zeal of the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned today that he had created, through Government policy, a major boost for the building industry.  I want to underline the fact that this again clearly illustrates that the Government are totally out of contact with reality.  We will demand in this Bill that the 5 per cent VAT introduced by the Government in the Finance Bill last year be abolished forthwith.  If the Minister for Finance comes into the House today and claims that the building industry and the level of building activity is buoyant I will tell him, as I told his predecessor, that this type of false representation is totally and utterly unacceptable and gives rise to even further frustration from the very industry which is being crucified by his taxation policies. I want to refer to statements which have been made by representatives of the industry in the context of where opportunities do arise for development and activity in this economy.</P>
    <P>There are very many areas where urgent action is needed.  The Government and the Minister for Finance have utterly failed to produce incentives for investment and development in areas of great potential for the national economy. The continued exclusion of the service <Col N="830" /> sector from the Finance Bill venture capital scheme ignores the investment and employment potential in this labour-intensive sector.  We asked the Minister for Finance in 1984 and 1985 to extend the scheme to the service sector.  We warned him that the complexities which he introduced in 1984 would guarantee that the scheme would meet inevitable failure and doom.  He ignored all our proposals and amendments and introduced a most complex scheme, the consequence of which is that today, two years after it was introduced, £5 million has been invested in a scheme that was then presented to us as being a great new world by the Minister for Finance just as today the current Minister for Finance presents the new research and development tax incentive scheme as being a great new world.  I want to appeal to the Minister again that he should extend the original 1984 scheme, which we welcomed, to the service sector.  Employment growth in the advanced economies, such as the United States and Japan, in the last two decades while always based on a sound manufacturing sector has been to a very large extent concentrated on the expanding service sector such as financial services, tourism and construction.  This Government continue to ignore this reality in an economy which has a major potential for such expansion.</P>
    <P>When one looks particularly at the treatment of the construction industry the imposition of the 5 per cent VAT is a monument to this Government's lack of awareness of the role of that industry and its current state.  The Minister claimed today that the building and construction industry was moving into a period of growth.  Let me tell him that apparently he is prepared to ignore the reality that was presented by the Construction Industry Federation as recently as last week.  That reality was based on the fact that cement sales for the first three months of the year show a 15 per cent fall in volume in comparison with sales for the first quarter of last year which were regarded as being the lowest on record.  Those figures indicate that the construction industry, which is being <Col N="831" /> crucified by this Government, will suffer an even worse experience than in 1985. Private house starts have fallen by 25 per cent and employment in the industry has fallen by 11 per cent over last year.  Yet the Minister tells us that the indications in the construction sector are encouraging. Cement sales, too, have fallen by an average of 15 per cent for the three months and in March alone by 32 per cent.  The Government, in saying that these trends are encouraging, are ignoring reality &mdash; the reality of unemployment, the reality of emigration, the reality of misery and poverty.  They are ignoring the lack of investment so necessary in any nation.  It is time the Government took a range of measures to counteract the slide in this important industry.  I would suggest that in the first instance they would undo the damage &mdash; and we will give them the opportunity of doing that on Committee Stage &mdash; by lifting the 5 per cent extra VAT imposed in last year's Finance Bill. I would also suggest that, instead of investing in agencies and corporations, they should restore the £18 million they reduced the public capital programme by since budget day and generate activity in this sector, put the money into productive, labour-intensive activity rather than the administrative agencies so beloved of this Government.</P>
    <P>They should restore the financing for building roads, sewerage treatment plants and other public works and introduce investment schemes for venture capital participation in those areas.  We are all aware of the deplorable state of our roads and the terrible lack of services. I am sure the Coalition Deputies beat their breasts when they are told by their constituents that the roads are in a bad condition.  Would it not make some sense to have money invested in the construction industry in all these areas rather than in these nonsensical schemes that are being insisted upon by the Government? Why not realise that here is a labour-intensive area that has literally been crushed out of existence by this Government? Why are so many of our major investors in the construction sector now <Col N="832" /> going out of Ireland to invest their funds? If there is one sector more than another that has been hit by lack of investment and leakage of investment, it is the construction sector.  Most of the major companies traditionally engaged in that sector here are now much more heavily engaged abroad in America, Saudi Arabia, Europe and Africa than they are here. Most of them are forced to be engaged much more heavily abroad to earn some return from their investments just to maintain a skeleton activity at home. That is the reality.  Yet this is the sector which the Minister says is improving and that he still intends to burden it with the 5 per cent extra VAT imposed last year.</P>
    <P>I want to turn some other areas in the service sector which are of vital importance. There is no incentive whatsoever for a marketing promotions scheme at a time when our marketing strategy is so deplorably weak.  With new marketing opportunities opening abroad we call on the Government once again, as we did last year, to introduce tax concessions for marketing and sales personnel who spend a considerable proportion of their working days abroad.  Our marketing is nowhere near adequate.  We need to familiarise ourselves with the market places to expand particularly the opportunities that now follow, especially in Europe.  A small concession by way of tax allowances to people who spend in excess of 100 days a year abroad engaged in sales and marketing promotion would reap dividends.  Last year the Minister, in refusing to accept my amendment, said that it might cost all of £5 million.  One would imagine that we were not an open economy trying to exploit the markets that are there.  One would imagine that we were totally satisfied with our marketing effort in Europe or elsewhere.  It is clear that we require a major new onslaught on the markets of the world and on those of Europe in particular. Our market penetration of the European Community is on a par with that of Malta and that should be to our shame.  It is to the shame of this Government who cannot even see the need for adopting <Col N="833" /> what we proposed last year and will propose again this year &mdash; adjustments in income tax for marketing personnel who spend most of their year abroad.  This would cost little or nothing to the Revenue Commissioners but would yield major returns to our manufacturing sector.</P>
    <P>We asked for concessions in respect of investment in research and development in the past and I am glad to see that they are being introduced.  But surely the Government should have learned from the experience of the business expansion scheme of 1984 not to surround a worthwhile scheme with so many limitations and qualifications as to almost guarantee that it cannot get off the ground.  The Minister said that the need for complex legislation arises in order to prevent the provisions of the scheme being abused and serving solely as a means of avoiding tax rather than facilitating the objectives of the scheme.  That was the same crazy justification for surrounding the business expansion scheme of 1984 with so many complex conditions, regulations and limitations. Let us face reality.  Any scheme that enables one to reduce one's tax liability is, by definition, a tax avoidance scheme.  If the Minister is going to introduce a worthwhile scheme which will at the same time reduce tax liability let him not surround it once again with regulations and so on.  If it is worth doing, it is worth doing simply.  The tax system is complex enough.  There is no justification for introducing further complexities of this nature, having regard to the experience of the 1984 Bill which failed.  There is no point in ensuring that this, too, will fail before it starts.</P>
    <P>The Government are continuing to play with the nonsensical idea of the farm tax.  They have a provision here to, as it were, keep it on the life support machine, without really implementing it at this stage.  The cost of administering this, of sending the adjusters out to dig holes and do soil surveys on every farm here, will be well in excess of the yield from that tax in its first year of introduction, whenever that may be.  It may be next year, but I <Col N="834" /> would not think so.  It may be the following year or it may be in five or six years' time.  But I can guarantee that it will not be so at that stage because we will have taken up responsibility and we will deal with that nonsense as we always said we would: we will replace it with a proper, fair system of taxation.</P>

      <P>All the time which the highly qualified agricultural science graduates should have been giving to help farmers will have gone for nothing.  All the holes will have been dug for nothing. All the gates will have been opened for nothing.  This Minister does not have the honesty to recognise that this is a nonrunner and to drop it.  Why does he not make a name for himself, be seen as a man who makes effective decisions and drop this nonsense which will be of no help to the country and certainly will not give relief to any sector of the economy?</P>
      <P>What agriculture needs at the moment is a comprehensive expanded programme to launch a major redevelopment which will culminate in secure employment from primary producer to employer and employee in a strengthened agri-food sector.  If we are to have a strengthened agri-food sector which will provide more jobs, and if we are to play to our strength, then one of the things we must do is to have skilled and sophisticated marketing personnel who know the eating habits and how the people dress in other countries and who will be able to translate that into ideas and product development. Clearly this is not being done at present. Small tax concessions for marketing personnel could achieve that objective.</P>
      <P>In the Minister's constituency and in mine, there was a great deal of moaning and groaning because of the closure of Erin Foods in Mallow, reducing the employment level in the Sugar Company and so on.  That is the pattern at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Some opening.  If the Government had a sense of confidence or a sense of purpose they would recognise that research and development, marketing and so on, would benefit everyone, as far back as the primary producer who is being prevented from producing some of the traditional products because of the Government's capitulation on the quota system on dairy products.</P>
      <P>There are areas of great potential which are very obvious, but this Government failed to see them &mdash; in the service sector, the manufacturing sector, marketing, research and development, agriculture, the construction industry and tourism.  Far from improving the opportunities for all these sectors, which are by definition labour-intensive, this Finance Bill does the opposite.  This Government are either unaware of this potential or, even worse, are determined to ignore it because they are adhering to the same dreary and negative prescriptions which will only guarantee more of the same needless misery and hopelessness which has been a characteristic of this Government for the last three years.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy painted the same pessimistic picture which he painted in his contribution on the Combat Poverty Bill some time ago. Again he outlined the worst possible combination of circumstances which could befall any nation or which might dominate the thinking of the people at any given time.  As on that occasion, I became more depressed as the debate went on and I hope future Opposition speakers will try to be more positive and optimistic and that as a result, they will inspire Government Deputies and the people generally to reach greater heights instead of attempting to demoralise us by telling us about the hunger, thirst, poverty, deprivation, the queues of Irish people at foreign airports, the overcrowded hospitals where people with terminal illnesses are dying in corridors and so on.</P>

I hope that in future we will have a little more optimism and less of the pessimism which has brought the country to the state it is in. The Deputy and his colleagues might have done a lot more about that situation when they had the opportunity to do so.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because it presents a reasonable attempt to capitalise on the circumstances which surround us. Despite what the previous speaker said, I believe events will prove that the Bill and the budget are exactly what are required to lift this nation out of the depression painted by the Deputy opposite.</P>

      <P>It is time we tried to lead the people to greater heights and to invigorate the nation as a whole by positive leadership.  If we continue with the negative attitude outlined by the previous speaker there will be no way of saving this country.  The day we start to think and act in the way Deputy O'Kennedy has suggested is the day the country as a worthwhile trading entity will disappear. Fortunately not everyone thinks like Deputy O'Kennedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the tax incentives to promote industry and as they affect PAYE taxation.  Following a period of high inflation and high interest rates we are now coming into a new era.  We have an opportunity to capitalise on external and internal forces, low inflation rates, lower interest rates and the prospect of even lower rates.  The most important thing is for this country to be in a position to capitalise on the upsurge in trade when it comes.  Deputy O'Kennedy suggested that we should try to capitalise on the position in the same way as they attempted in 1977, in other words, that politicians cushion themselves from the <Col N="837" /> electorate by promising to give them anything they wish and promising to deliver on any demands they make at any particular time.  In this way politicians would be removing themselves from reality. Surely we have learned enough not to go down that road again.  We should recognise that things like car tax and other &ldquo;freebies&rdquo; are not for our people because they produce nothing in terms of jobs of a lasting nature, and they do even less for morale.  If we are to do one worthwhile thing we should take stock of what is happening around us and try to provide not for the next 50 or 60 years but for the next five or ten years.  Eventually the people will give recognition to those who are prepared to face reality.  Deputies opposite have been very vocal when suggesting that realism is a virtue which should be practised by all.  One would have expected that a spokesman of Deputy O'Kennedy's calibre would have recognised that but, I am sorry to say, he does not appear to have done so.</P>
    <P>Another idea which is very worthwhile and labour-intensive is the provision of tax incentives to promote development in the many inner city areas.  People on the opposite benches have been calling for that because as intended it will give a considerable boost to the contruction industry.  We have listened time and time again to speakers on the opposite side calling for greater financial assistance for the construction industry, and here it comes.  Incidentally&mdash;&mdash;</P>

At this time the incentives and money being provided for inner city renewal is bound to <Col N="838" /> have a considerable constructive impact on the industry concerned.  It is to be hoped that we will see a fairly sizeable improvement in the number of people employed there.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy talked a few moments ago about the drop in sales of cement and so on.  The irony of that is&mdash; there is still nobody on the Opposite side of the House, and that is ironic because a few moments ago there seemed to be great emphasis on the fact that this was an important debate and that it was time that the people looked to this House for leadership etc., and it is amazing that the benches opposite are completely empty with not a spokesman in sight.  I am sorry for digressing.  Deputy O'Kennedy mentioned the drop in the volume of cement and other items associated with the construction industry.  It is amazing that the number of planning applications submitted to the various local authorities has increased dramatically, perhaps to the extent of 50 per cent.  I would not think for one moment that the speaker opposite was suggesting &mdash; he was present then &mdash; that perhaps people were looking for planning permissions and never intended to build.  I feel that the people are recognising the benefits set out in the various schemes being put forward of home improvement grants, house surrender grants and Housing Finance Agency loans, a combination of which obviously has provided them with the enthusiasm and confidence to go forward and make application to carry out improvements to their homes.  That was long sought on this side of the House and, I am sure, by everybody in the House.  Unfortunately, we had to wait until now to do that.  Let me repeat what I have said already on a couple of occasions, that there is still scope in that area, with particular reference to the need to ensure that every household in the country have basic sanitary services provided for them.  There is no excuse nowadays for not having sanitary services provided to each household.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to note that a Member is descending on the opposite benches and, no doubt, will lend to the debate the kind <Col N="839" /> of optimism we did not have heretofore from that side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Reynolds is very welcome, but I ask him not to spill all the water.  As I was saying, in that area there is still scope, and I would like to see the various local authorities coming up with a scheme to provide the necessary services to all households in their respective areas.  That could be done relatively easily with the aid of the extra funds now available under the SDA loans system, the full allocation of which has not been taken up over the last couple of years in many counties.</P>
      <P>Reference was made in the Minister's speech today and in the Budget Statement to the motor industry.  The last speaker was exceptionally pessimistic in that area, but it must be said that negotiations have been going-on with the motor industry over a number of years and many changes have taken place at the request of the motor industry.  Also it should be noted that duty on tyres, tubes and spare parts etc. is being abolished.  This will have some impact on the motor repair industry which obviously has been able to capitalise on the incentives available there.  Like every other industry, that industry is subject to attack from the black economy, and it is up to the industry to do its best to compete.  They should be able to do so.  The concessions in the budget and here to day in the Finance Bill will be of good advantage in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only discordant note I want to sound at this stage is to say that there are increases in road tax in the budget enforced through the agency of the Finance Bill.  People are a little sensitive to that at present and have been so for quite a number of years.  Road tax increases have taken place since 1977 with a great deal of regularity.  When car tax was removed to a great extent in 1977 everybody thought that extra money would be <Col N="840" /> made available through one source or another, mostly by some magic method which had not yet been discovered but was about to be discovered.  It did not happen and, of course, the roads suffered and continue to suffer.  Now it is almost impossible to maintain the main and county roads in any county and the result is that a great deal of money is required to bring those roads up to a reasonable standard.  It is difficult to explain to the public how they can be expected to accept an increase in road tax when they see at the same time the condition of those roads deteriorating.  It is all very well for us to say in this House that the reason for that deterioration is that for a few years as a result of election bonanzas and foolish and foolhardy election promises, money for those areas was cut off.  The source of suply was cut off and, as a result, the chickens are coming home to roost.  I would like to see more money made available if and when possible to the various local authorities for expenditure on main and county roads.  If we do not have that it will be extremely difficult to countenance motor tax increases which the public will see as unacceptable having regard to the condition of those roads.</P>
    <P>Another area which the Minister referred to today is the reduction of VAT levels on a number of services such as the catering industry.  It covers restaurants and hotels and a number of other service industries.  That is a positive move, an indication of a recognition by Government of people's feelings that a reduction in the taxation could have a useful effect. Government have responded in a positive fashion despite the fact that finances are very straitened and have been so for some time.  Incidentally, Deputy O'Kennedy seemed to be suggesting that further concessions could be made in all areas where the Government made some attempt to make concessions, but he avoided completely any attempt to quantify these concessions in terms of cost.  He never once indicated who would pay the piper, who was going to be the loser or who would have to pay if the kind of concession which he is now suggesting could be <Col N="841" /> made.  That has been one of the problems of Irish political life for a long time and I would have thought that we were getting away from it.  Surely the present generation are too intelligent to believe for one instant that people can be given concessions without somebody somewhere having to pay the cost.  I sincerely hope Deputy O'Kennedy did not believe all the things he said.</P>
    <P>The reduction in VAT in the area of tourism and by way of a general boost to employment, particularly in service areas, will be of great benefit which is obvious from the response we have had from constituents which indicate that the affected industries will capitalise on the relief given.  I note that there is a further exemption on stamp duty in respect of transfer of land to younger farmers.  The Minister is right in suggesting an end to that scheme because if any scheme is continued indefinitely on the basis of proposals to attract people into it, obviously its attraction is diminished.  Therefore, it is a positive proposal to terminate the scheme in 18 months or so, and perhaps at that stage the time would be ripe to introduce another scheme which would have the same effect.  Incidentally, the present scheme was successful as it encouraged the handing over of land and agricultural property, an asset which is obviously productive orientated, to young enthusiastic people who were in a position to utilise the land to its full potential.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to improvements in personal taxation.  In future years wage increases in certain income categories could come by way of tax concessions which would have the double effect of giving a wage increase on one hand and an indication to the people concerned that their labours are not entirely in vain.  They would see a positive return unlike the position over the past ten years or so whereby many employees found themselves running faster to stand still. There is and should be further scope for concessions of that nature which will remove one of the greatest reasons each year for increased claims for higher wages.  I am not suggesting that the claims <Col N="842" /> will not be there but, if tax concessions were granted, they would alleviate the problem to a considerable extent.  The Bill gives a sum of over £200 million in tax relief in a full year.  The Opposition regard this as insufficient but, of course, it is the business of the Opposition to castigate the attempts of the Government to provide anything of a constructive nature.</P>
    <P>However, one must not totally disregard a sum of £200 million.  After all, a few years ago there were strident calls from the other side of the House on numerous occasions in relation to expenditure of a similar amount of money which they suggested should be spent on capital works in relation to the construction and road building industry and that sum was regarded as a huge possible investment.  It is much more positive to spread it right across the board and to give an incentive to those who are working and heavily taxed.  Given the circumstances at present it should be possible by this time next year to provide even further concessions along those lines and then we can at least compare ourselves with our European partners in relation to tax levels.  Perhaps it will take some time, but it is many years since we were able to compare ourselves with our European partners, or any others for that matter, in relation to taxation levels.  Nobody on the other side of the House need say that this only happened over the last four or five years; it has been going on for quite some time and we should not attempt to delude ourselves into thinking that we can be on a par with any of our competitors in the short term.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy also mentioned <Col N="843" /> the farm tax and made veiled suggestions as to what might happen in the unlikely event of Fianna Fáil coming to power. He said that Fianna Fáil might replace the present tax by &ldquo;a fairer system&rdquo;.  We heard all this before but a fairer system depends on your vantage point.  Farmers and PAYE employees will be very worried when they hear the fair system war horse trotted out once more.  At a time when interest rates, energy prices and inflation are falling &mdash; and indications are that these trends will continue &mdash; there must be a great temptation on the part of politicians to capitalise on the possible buoyancy which might be created and to embark on a policy of give away.</P>
    <P>That might have the effect of placating the electorate for a short time but the long term consequences could only be similar to those which were patently obvious following the policies embarked upon in 1977.  I do not want to harp on this, but let us do the right thing now as far as the people are concerned.  We should not pretend that we can embark on a freebie system once again when we know the disastrous consequences it had in the past and would have in the future. I hope we have all matured as politicians because I know that the public are far more mature now than they were in 1977. For that reason, there is little fear that we will go down the same road and I hope that politicians will not fall into the trap of suggesting that we should.</P>
    <P>At a time when energy prices are falling and likely to continue to fall and interest rates are favourable from the point of view of this country.  I should like to see price reductions passed on to the consumer.  In a number of areas that are not Government controlled price increases have taken place although those moves have been somewhat inconsistent with present trends.  Some of those increases took place in recent times.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, in view of the deep and widespread anxiety of parents and pupils in regard to the holding of the school examinations this year, calls on the Government to arrange for the immediate appointment of an independent mediator in the dispute with the teachers.</P>
      <P>Several amendments have been put down to the motion which is in the name of our Chief Whip.  Before I address myself to the motion I should like to refer briefly to the announcement that the Taoiseach is to address the nation tonight on the teacher's issue.  I, and the many people who have contacted me, find it unseemly and quite discourteous to the House &mdash; to be bolder I would call it an affront to democracy &mdash; for the Taoiseach to see fit to go on television to give us his point of view when a debate on the issue is in progress here and a vote has to be taken. I realise that under an Act the Taoiseach is entitled to make a ministerial broadcast at any time he wishes but I question his decision to do so while a debate which is important for the future of the House and the country is taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving the motion I should like to refer to some of the matters I mentioned in the course of the debate on 4 February. The idea that the teachers in seeking the award made by the arbitrator are profligate is the first matter that must be settled.  The process that led to this award being made started in 1982.  The arbitrator announced his award last autumn and it was a compromise in that the original claim was for 22 per cent.  The award <Col N="845" /> amounted to an increase of 10 per cent to be paid in two stages, the first in September and the second in March.  There was a further compromise in that the teachers agreed to a further compromise. In effect, what we are discussing is a further compromise.  Last week the Minister said in the House that there was no need for a mediator in this dispute because there was no confusion.  However, there is confusion over the monetary implications of the agreement. When any member of the Government deals with the amount involved he or she gives a figure of 17½ per cent as if that was the amount that had to be paid out immediately.  I should like to make it clear, because the Government are confusing the issue, that the arbitration award was 10 per cent and the other 7½ per cent is the amount offered to all public servants, payable in two stages.  It has never been envisaged that the 17½ per cent would be paid out in one lump sum.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that great room for flexibility exists in the staged or phased implementation of retrospection.  That is one of the issues that a mediator could deal with.  It is an issue about which the Minister said there was no confusion but in my mind confusion exists in the minds of the public.  Mediation has been called for by almost everybody in the country.  I am delighted to be able to say that we find ourselves in tune with most of the people concerned with education, the three teacher unions, the Conference of Major Religious Superiors, the Conference of Catholic Secondary Schools, the Joint Managerial Body for Secondary Schools, VEC committees &mdash; including our VEC last night &mdash; the National Parents Council, the Conference of Catholic Secondary School Parent Organisations, the Christian Brothers Parent Federation, the Episcopal Commission, the Irish Council of Churches, Cardinal Ó Fiaich, the Presbyterians, the Methodists and the Religious Society of Friends.  Those groups in one way or another in the last four weeks viewed with alarm and disquiet the tension which is creeping into the ordered tenor of education.  They decided quite freely to add their voice to <Col N="846" /> the call for mediation.  It is worth nothing that representatives of all the Churches were met by the Taoiseach in recent days and had extensive talks on the holding of a referendum on the issue of divorce.  I do not object to the Taoiseach having such meetings but it is odd that he could spare such energy and enthusiasm to meet people who are calling on the Government to agree to mediation.  The Taoiseach cannot see his way to spare one minute in his busy and fussy schedule to meet any of the parties anxious to talk about mediation.</P>
    <P>There is nothing strange about mediation in the resolution of disputes.  If one looks back through history one will see that from primitive times, through wars and so on, consideration was given to the appointment of a mediator, a person who would view a problem dispassionately taking account of the causes of a dispute and, in his or her wisdom, putting forward a suggestion to solve the problem. Many disputes were settled in this way but on this issue the Government are determined to adopt a &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo; line.  We hear a lot about no surrender daily and great exhibitions of strength. They have led to an escalation of all types of unrest and tension.  It ill behoves the Taoiseach, who has made such a case for himself of being a democrat and one concerned to adopt the consensus view on all issues, to adopt this attitude.  This dispute is affecting parents and pupils throughout the country.  They are anxiously awaiting the outcome of this debate.  It is irresponsible of the Government to continue with their entrenched view of no talks, no mediation and no surrender.</P>
    <P>In the House last week the Minister for Education saw fit to upbraid Deputy De Rossa and myself for not calling on the teachers to cease their action and get on with the work involved in the examinations. I thought it an odd remark for the Minister to make.  He and I shared a common forum yesterday in our constituency, when there were a great number of teachers in the audience.  The Minister did not see fit to make the same plea to them.  He referred to the issue but he did <Col N="847" /> not ask them then to become involved in the examinations.  If the green light is given for mediation in this Chamber tomorrow evening, when the vote is taken, then I ask the teachers to suspend any action they had proposed.  In the light of that green light for mediation they should enter into talks freely without preconditions. If the talks are approached in that spirit I am sure there will be a strong willingness on the part of teachers to respond.</P>
    <P>It is too simplistic for the Minister to contend that they want all of the compromises in their favour while the teachers contend that the Government keep saying no to talks, no to mediation, no to a settlement of any kind.  Lest it be thought that I make this plea with scant knowledge I should say that I have a very strong, personal interest in the proper holding of the leaving certificate examination and the validation of its results this year.  Therefore, I speak from the heart.  I fear and feel for young people who should be pursuing their studies at present with a free, untroubled mind.  I hear their conversations, at weekends in my home and all around me.  The tenor of their remarks is to the effect: &ldquo;Oh, well, it will not matter this time&rdquo;.  The results will not matter if they are not corrected by practising teachers of the examination subjects.  The intermediate and leaving certificates since their inception in 1926 and the group certificate since its inception have all assumed great validity because the papers have been seen to be corrected to proper equitable standards of assessment.  It has been my experience that correction of a leaving certificate paper, at pass or honours level, must be carried out by practising teachers of the examination subjects.  There will always be exceptions but, in the main, such correction should be carried out by practising teachers, and by that I mean teachers who had charted and followed the course of teaching, teachers with extensive knowledge of history.  French, science, or whatever is the subject under examination.  They would know how the paper had been tackled by the students <Col N="848" /> and equally how they should go about correcting them.  When I read reports in the Sunday papers of some people who were offering themselves as examiners, one particular gentleman in Limerick, I felt I would not like my son to subject himself to that type of supervision or correction.  It is difficult to understand the intransigence of the Government on this issue.</P>
    <P>To revert to the subject of mediation, there are any number of people who would willingly put themselves forward. Some have already been mentioned.  I am sure there are many others, people who would willingly take on themselves the mantle of mediator in this dispute.  I have thought of the Employer/Labour Conference. I know that because of a clause in the conciliation and arbitration scheme the teachers themselves would be precluded, but why have the Employer/Labour Conference not been utilised to bring about a resolution of this dispute?  Neither I nor my party accepts that some formula cannot be devised by a third party to overcome this <i>impasse.</i> It has been done in other disputes heretofore. It should be remembered that all disputes must end.</P>
    <P>When I spoke in this House in February last I warned the then Minister for Education that educational chaos would be rife in the months ahead.  It gives me no joy to stand here this evening and say that I told them so.  I do not want it interpreted in that spirit.  When I said then that educational chaos would ensue I knew quite clearly what would be the effects of the motion put down by the then Minister for Education.  Those effects have culminated in the situation now obtaining.  If we do not employ a mediator the alternative is serious industrial disruption in primary and post-primary schools this term with whole areas of the country without any educational facilities.  Lurking in the background will be the holding of the examinations and their results.  A mediator or a forum such as that I have suggested, or any other, could provide the key to the resolution of the dispute.  The teachers have been saying they are willing to be flexible, they <Col N="849" /> are willing to phase out the payments but that there is nobody willing to implement those wishes.  That is where a mediator would be useful.</P>
    <P>I did not mention the teachers' unions so far.  They have been willing to have mediation.  It is interesting that the various unions, the trades councils and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have all supported the involvement of a mediator. All of these national bodies, organisations and Churches represent a substantial proportion of our people.  We hear so many tales out of school, leaks, it is difficult to separate the truth from the many rumours.  In that respect I found the intervention of the former Minister in the dispute bizarre, when she spoke on radio on Tuesday morning last saying that there were issues still to be clarified and that she wished to do so.  In the recent reshuffle of the Cabinet there were people like Deputy Noonan <i>(Limerick East)</i> moved from the contentious area of Justice with a new Minister taking his place, Deputy Dukes.  Yet we have not heard Deputy Noonan give Frankie Byrne-like advice to the new incumbent, saying for example &ldquo;This is how I would have handled the Glenholmes fiasco&rdquo;. He kept his counsel to himself.  The same applies to the former and present Ministers for Finance.  As we know, the Finance Bill has been changed completely since the budget.  Yet there was no advice offered retrospectively by the former Minister for Finance.  In this sphere of education the former Minister's intervention constituted a very busybody type interference when she told the nation that there were issues still to be clarified and that she wished to set the record straight on those issues.  All that did was to set aflame again all of the old tensions and passions which had arisen through her mishandling of the issues as far back as August last.  It throws an odd light on the whole of this debate and colours how some of us see the matter being discussed and handled at present by the Cabinet.  I cannot believe that a Cabinet, Government or party could view with dispassionate interest the wishes of so many people for a resolution to this dispute.  Since it <Col N="850" /> became known that there was to be a debate in Private Members' time here this evening and tomorrow evening, intense speculation has arisen.  Probably that highlights the work of Parliament, motions put down by the governing parties or any Member of the Opposition parties.  It means that people follow the work of Parliament, listening with interest and awaiting results.</P>
    <P>Education touches everybody, not just parents like myself with students taking examinations this year.  All of us know of somebody, in our family, among neighbours or friends, people with sons or daughters undergoing State examinations this year, all of whom are concerned.  I do not want preaching.  Everybody shares my anxiety, on all sides of the House and throughout the country.  All of us are interested in education.  We share a common feeling for young people and what they are facing.  Though the Minister on many occasions has sought to soothe the minds of our young people by telling them that the examinations will be held correctly, his amendment states:</P>
    <P>...the Minister for Education has been and continues to be available for talks with all interested parties, calls in the meantime on the teacher unions and all other relevant parties to facilitate the holding of examinations as their importance transcends all other issues.</P>
    <P>The importance of the examinations transcends all other issues in this land.  We are anxious about what is happening outside the country but the proper holding and the validation of the examinations have every one of us in their tentacles and therefore every one of us is seeking a resolution of the dispute.</P>
    <P>That is why we are all keen to see mediation.  I expect that when the Minister will speak here and when the Taoiseach will speak on television and radio, they will tell us quite simply that the Government do not intend to put themselves in hostage to any grouping, that they do not have the finance to pay increases to any sectional interest above another.  To allay the profligacy which <Col N="851" /> will be attributed to us, I would point out that in the past two and a half years sudden issues arose for which immediate finance was found.  I can think of ICI for which £170 million to £200 million was found.  We had Dublin Gas.  We read a statement by the former Minister, Deputy Cluskey, and the advice he gave to the Cabinet.  We heard about fighting in the Cabinet.  I speak of facts because we had a statement by a Member of the House.  If his advice had been taken some years ago, at least £100 million would have been saved.  We had a solution to the PMPA problem.  All these issues meant enormous sums of money and they had to be and were found suddenly.</P>
    <P>Here we are talking about a small amount by comparison with the enormous sums the Government have had to find in the past two and a half years.  At the time, we on this side gave our views on and our agreement to those payments because of possible disquiet in the country, but we did it with our traditional caution.</P>
    <P>This issue goes back three years but its roots go back further.  The Government cannot talk about this relatively small amount of money except in that context. Both the Minister here and the Taoiseach later will talk about £110 million over three years.  Do they not realise that at least half of that will go back into the State coffers by way of income tax, VAT, PRSI, and that the other half will be spent throughout the country, in every village, townland, city and town?  It will go back into the economy in mortgage repayments, furnishings, the buying of groceries and so forth.  The money will go round and round the economy, this time not only in Dublin.  It will be spent in a decentralised fashion by men and women who have given their working lives to the education of children.  Let us not put any gloss on it: we are talking about whether we are willing to give the value to our education system which we have always done.</P>
    <P>The legacy of this dispute will not go away.  There can be no winners and no <Col N="852" /> losers.  I am looking for fair play for teachers, parents, but above all for the children. I appeal to the teachers to let that be their outlook, and I appeal to all the groupings in education and to all political parties to appreciate that there cannot be winners or losers.  I am talking, for instance, about my son and about all other sons and daughters in the country who will soon be crossing the threshold into manhood and womanhood, whether they go into jobs in supermarkets or to AnCO.  They will need their script to show they got their maths, their English, their Gaeilge and so forth, and they will need the authority of that script to show that they got those exams correctly.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government, and the Taoiseach in particular, to pull back from this.  The slogan &ldquo;No Surrender&rdquo; has no place in the Dáil or on the national airwaves. I thank the House for listening so attentively to me.  I hope that when Deputies go to vote they will do so in the realisation that the motion was put forward without aggression but with the active intention of solving this dispute. Many thousands of people throughout the country have expressed agreement that the way to solve the dispute is through mediation.  I call on the Government to accept the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the motion:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, in view of the deep and widespread anxiety of parents and pupils in regard to the holding of the school examinations this year, calls on the Government to arrange for the immediate appointment of an independent mediator in the dispute with the teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask if it is not an extraordinary thing that though the future of many thousands is in jeopardy, the Government are in a state of apparent paralysis and have not made any serious effort to settle this dispute.  At present, with the leaving certificate imminent, students are under enormous stress.  I also have a son who is undergoing this stress.  These students are <Col N="853" /> at the culmination of 12 or 13 years of study.  What then must be their feelings, their anxieties and tensions?  What must be their frustration at the pathetic mumblings and insensitivity of a Government unable and apparently unwilling to extend to the teacher unions even a gesture showing that there can be positive negotiations in an effort to settle this problem?  The frustration of very many pupils was ably demonstrated in the Shannon Comprehensive school and in Ennis.  That will be the case throughout many areas if this dispute is not soon settled.  The pupils of these schools walked out of their classes and took to the streets at a time when they should have been studying, to demonstrate their total dissatisfaction with the present situation.</P>
    <P>The repercussions of this dispute on the long-accepted principles of conciliation and arbitration will be far reaching.  They are not for discussion under the terms of this motion, but the suspicion and the climate which has been created by the rejection of the arbitrator's decision will influence the thinking and confidence of very many civil and public service unions in regard to the whole machinery of conciliation and arbitration.  I reiterate that it was not the teachers who sought the 10 per cent increase, it was granted to them after a hearing before an arbitrator, after the State had had the opportunity of putting its full case and also the teachers' unions.  Like Deputy O'Rourke, I am quite sure from my contacts with very many teachers and teacher unions that they would respond in a very positive manner to a gesture, just that, of friendship and conciliation from the Government.  Sadly, it appears from what we read and hear that the opposite is the case.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer, as Deputy O'Rourke has done, to what I consider to be a most untimely and unwelcome intervention of the Minister for Social Welfare recently, with a suggestion that there may have been some shift in Government thinking.  I see that as confirmation of the determination of the majority of the Government to use public <Col N="854" /> opinion, in the form of the media and the understandable anxiety and fear of parents and students, to beat the teacher unions, regardless of the damage that this course of action could have, not only on the present leaving certificate students but all students and countless others, and on the goodwill and co-operation needed between teachers and any future Government.</P>
    <P>Do the Government in their arrogant approach really want this dispute to continue into the next school year?  Another example of the conduct of the Government in this dispute is the inordinate haste with which they rejected out of hand an earlier suggestion of mediation, made by very many independent people. Deputy O'Rourke listed the organisations which made that plea.  One wonders if this is a case of everybody being out of step except the Government.  Yet another example of the Government's approach to this dispute, only surpassed by the former Minister for Education's infamous &ldquo;morality&rdquo; speech &mdash; which in my view was the principal reason for the present conflict &mdash; was the suggestion of an unnamed Government spokesman that teachers might not be paid during the summer.  Is that the way to negotiate a settlement?  Is that the way to encourage teachers to return to the negotiation table?  The Minister for Labour on 6 February in the debate on teachers' pay, at column 2019 of the Official Report said:</P>
    <P>Tragically,</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;this was his word, not mine, but it is very apt&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>for the teachers and, perhaps, for the children, we are having this debate today because negotiations did not continue on the issues with the teachers, the unions and the relevant Ministers.</P>
    <P>Further, he said &mdash; and this comes back to a point which I am sure we will hear from the Minister and the Taoiseach tonight &mdash;&ldquo;It is nothing but the ability of the nation to pay&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, the Minister for Labour's reference to the <Col N="855" /> pupils and children was sadly understated. If this dispute is not settled, they will be the real losers.  Deputy O'Rourke rightly said that there will be no winners. If the Government accept this motion, the children who are doing the examinations will be the real and only winners. The expression of concern from the Government will ring hollow in the ears of those doing examinations if they do not accept this motion.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment offers nothing new and cannot be seen as giving any hope of a new initiative or of reaching any kind of settlement.  It requires just a little gesture to enable a start to be made on renegotiation.  I ask the Minister tonight to make that gesture.  I accept that it will require courage, but the consequences for very many young people could be catastrophic if that gesture is not made.  Like all disputes, there will eventually be a settlement; but it behoves the Government, as the employer on the one hand and the custodian and guardian of the rights of the pupils and children on the other hand, to make the opening approach.  In a dispute of this nature, when those who stand to lose most cannot influence in any way the outcome, it is the Government's duty to end its obstinate and intransigent stance and, in order to protect the pupils involved, again to start negotiations.  I beg the Government to take the first step, to accept this motion and appoint a mediator who will be independent and to relieve the anxiety of the thousands of young people who are looking for some break in the dispute which threatens their teacher.  I recommend the motion to the House and to the Government.</P>

      <Col N="856" />&ldquo;having regard to the resolution passed by this House on 6th February, 1986 as an integral part of the procedures under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for Teachers and which provided for the phased payment of the Aribtrators recommendation of 10 per cent increase and noting in addition the offer of the terms of the 25th round totalling in all an increase of 17.9 per cent and having regard to the fact that the Minister for Education has been and continues to be available for talks with all interested parties, calls in the meantime on the teacher unions and all other relevant parties to facilitate the holding of examinations as their importance transcends all other issues.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This dispute has been going on for some time and has been the cause of much public comment and much media reference.  I want to make a few reterences to what Deputy O'Rourke said in her opening speech.  With regard to confusion about the amount involved, the issue is quite clear.  The 7.5 per cent is payable under the 25th round and the special award is 10 per cent.  It is true that there is general confusion in the minds of the public, not only among parents but among teachers, students and in some cases among politicians.  There is a general air of confusion about the specific facts involved in this matter.  One could say that the Government in their deliberations may not have spelled out these facts sufficiently clearly and in that context it is the right of the Taoiseach to address the people of the country with regard to these facts.  Deputy O'Rourke questions his authority in this regard and his right to do so while the debate is actually in progress.  She refers to his meeting with members of the Churches during the past few weeks.  It is also true that the Taoiseach of the day appoints and vests with the necessary authority a Cabinet, democratically elected, with responsibility for various Departments.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has repeatedly called for talks with the teacher <Col N="857" /> unions, even as recently as last week on an Adjournment debate.  He has said that he is available at any time for discussions with the interested parties.  I would hope that a level of common sense would enter this debate and that this offer would be taken up.  There is no need at this time for the Taoiseach to meet the teacher unions while his appointed Minister for Education has an open offer before the parties concerned.  Deputy O'Rourke has referred to the teachers being willing to come forward and I would hope that the unions concerned would now be willing to come forward to discuss these important matters.  The call by the Minister last week is an open invitation to discussions to sort out the difficulties in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke speaks of the worth and value of education.  In my short time with responsibility as Minister of State in the area of education, I, too, question whether teachers can give of their best in the present circumstances.  I have had the privilege and the experience of having already travelled to many of the 26 counties. Having a responsibility in every parish in the country, I am only too well aware to the difficulties and the complexities under which teachers have to operate and conduct their business.  Many of our schools are not up to standard and many teachers who are absolutely committed and properly motivated in the true education sense are labouring in very poor buildings, dating in some cases from the last century.  The Department and the Government have a responsibility in this area too but much money is involved. The sum of £100 million would go a long way towards sorting out our school building difficulties in that sense.  I think it was Edwin Mason who once said that if education is to be the momentum of society it must allow people to give what they have.  The teaching staff are unable to give what they have when they have to work in substandard accommodation. While the Department, with the best will in the world, are trying to rectify these serious situations, there are always cases where facilities are inadequate and do not allow teachers to give of their best.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="858" /> There have been no calls of &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo; but there should be calls to commonsense. The detrimental effects of the teachers' dispute are varied but run very deep.  If the public perception is true, then quite a deal of confusion exists about it.  It is easy to point out the obvious consequences of what can happen in the event of the examinations not taking place or being perceived to be taking place, conducted by people who have not normally done such work over the years. If the examinations are to be held without the teachers, an obvious consequence is that there will be an embittered teaching body.  There is a political element contained in that and there will be an escalated and prolonged industrial action resulting.  We will suffer the effects of permanent teacher hostility and alienation. That will lead to stagnation and the stunting of the educational system.  When one follows that road one eventually aggravates the civic, religious, social and economic problems of the country.  If teachers are embittered, there tends to be an end to voluntary service in schools and there is no teacher co-operation either in the general running of the service or with further curricular development. This is a very serious matter to be considered by teachers, by Government, by parents and by students.</P>
    <P>If the examinations are held and the public perceive them as being held in a manner not fitting, conducted by those who might not have conducted them in the past but who would have an ability to do so, these examinations may be held in the face of disruption.  Calls about the devaluation of these exams will be rife. While the Department can claim that the correction of the examinations and the results will be as heretofore, calls to the contrary will be very evident.  This may seem to be a loss of face for any Government and one may perceive it as a loss of authority.  The effects of examinations not being held are manifold.  It will end up with disrespect for teachers, a deterioration in school discipline, cynicism and disrespect for the Government.  The young student population will be open to <Col N="859" /> an intensification of subversive or revolutionary activities, attitudes and inclinations. This is a matter of which we must take great cognisance and show understanding.</P>
    <P>The Minister was quite right when he made the announcement with regard to the preparation of contingency plans for the holding of examinations.  He was not aware of the position of the teacher unions with regard to the examinations and where the student actually stood. Being in a dilemma in not having the matter fully clarified, contingency plans have had to be arranged so that the students will have to be allowed cross the threshold of the education world, enter into the normal complexities of life and build for themselves, as is their entitlement, an individual livelihood.  Emerging out of that and having regard to the potential detrimental defects in that context, it is important to recall some of the facts of this dispute.</P>
    <P>The resolution that was put before the House on 6 February followed a detailed and full debate.  The effect of the passing of that resolution was to implement the findings of report No. 14 of the Teachers Arbitration Board, so that the pay of teachers would be increased by 10 per cent subject to a modification of the recommendation on the phasing in of the increase.  The modification provided for the 10 per cent increase to be paid in three phases &mdash; one-third from 1 December 1986, a further one-third from 1 December 1987 and the balance to be paid from 1 July 1988.  In arriving at their proposals in regard to the arbitration findings, the Government obviously had to give careful consideration to the relevant facts which included the arbitration award, the various provisions of the proposals for a pay agreement that had been offered to unions representing public servants, proposals, which provided, first, for a twenty fifth round general pay increase in three phases, 3 per cent from 1 May, 1986, 2 per cent from 1 January 1987 and 2 per cent from 1 May 1987; second, for a phased implementation of special increases; and, third, for certain <Col N="860" /> concessions on pensions and retirement gratuities or lump sums.  The cost factor had to be taken into account, particularly the fact that the implementation of the increase to the teachers on the phasing basis recommended by the arbitration board, that is, half the increase from September 1985 and the second half from 1 March, 1986, would cost the Exchequer £110 million in excess of what was proposed by the Government, the amount to be spread over the full period.</P>
    <P>In modifying the arbitration finding, the Government, with the approval of this House acted strictly in accordance with their terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers.  In my meetings with teacher executives around the country and with individual members of the profession, I have found a good deal of confusion about the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  That scheme sets out that in relation to a report from the chairman of the board, the Government would adopt one of the following courses: first, that within three months of the date of the receipt of the report by the Ministers, the Government would signify that they proposed to give immediate effect in full to the findings of the board or that at the expiration of three months from the date of the receipt of the report, a motion would be introduced in Dáil Éireann which would, propose the rejection of the finding or propose the authorisation by the Minister for Education of the modification of the finding or propose the deferment of a final decision on the report until the budget for the following financial year had been framed.  The procedures set out in the conciliation and arbitration scheme have been agreed for some time by the parties to the scheme, namely, the teachers; unions, the managerial authorities and the Ministers for Education and the Public Service.  These terms provide for the arbitration board to make a recommendation on a claim referred to them and also for the submission of such recommendation to Government. If the Government wish to reject or modify the recommendation the procedures require that the matter be <Col N="861" /> referred to Dáil Éireann as happened in this instance.</P>
    <P>It is not a valid argument against the action taken by the Government to assume that the findings of the teachers' arbitration board would be honoured always by any Government.  If there is a provision in an agreed conciliation and arbitration scheme either for rejection or modification of arbitration findings by Government, it is obvious that a situation could arise in which a Government might find themselves unable to accept the arbitration findings.  This is an accepted fact by the unions to the conciliation and arbitration scheme and is an integral part of that scheme.  Such a situation has arisen in the present case.  While we are all concerned that there should be a dispute between the teachers and the authority of this House, the Government are prepared to accept the recommendation of the board that there be a 10 per cent increase in teachers' pay but because of the very substantial cost involved they decided it was not possible, in the light of present difficult recessionary and financial circumstances, to implement the award from the dates recommended.  The cost involved has been referred to in this debate and before now.  The best estimate available to the Government is that in the full period the recommendation would cost £110 million.  There is no prospect of finding such extra money.  I have said already that if such an amount were available in the Department much valuable and necessary work could be undertaken in the area of school buildings. That is not strictly relevant to the award by the arbitrator but it is an important consideration in allowing teachers to do the valuable job for which they have been trained and to fulfil their vocation properly. I have not heard any suggestion from the people opposite as to where such money could be found.  Deputy O'Rourke referred to the ICI and various other matters but she did not refer to the commitment given in the House some time ago by one of her own spokespersons in regard to Irish Shipping.</P>
    <P>The framing of the 1986 budget involved the Government in determining that <Col N="862" /> it was absolutely necessary to give every penny possible to the two important areas of tax relief for the complete workforce and protection for those who depend on social welfare payments.  In arriving at the figures for public service pay this year and anticipating the knock-on effects in subsequent years of those increases, the Government designed a package in line with the upper limit possible in this respect while allowing some leeway in the matter of easing the burden of the taxpayer. All of us would like to be able to come here and offer greater tax concessions but in all the circumstances the Government considered they had gone as far as possible in this year.</P>
    <P>In addition to the £70 million extra needed to meet the terms of the package for 1986, about £150 million will be needed in 1987.  To increase that figure by £110 million in that period would restrict severely any further help that might be given to the taxpayer and would damage the economy and the prospects of reducing unemployment, a factor that is central to the development of the nation.  The amount needed to pay full retrospection to the teachers is almost exactly the same as the amount granted by way of tax reliefs in the 1986 budget.  Alternatively, the amount needed to meet the full cost of retrospection would be equivalent to postponing the abolition for about 18 months of the 1 per cent income levy for all taxpayers.  We are all aware of the necessity to reduce the burden of taxation. Experts, individuals and various groups have commented on this need down through the years but the more money given by way of pay increases in the public sector, the less there will be available to reduce the tax burden.</P>
    <P>The Government having determined the upper limit in the case in question brought the modification proposals before the House.  Such action is an integral part of the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  Payment in full of the money recommended could involve, for instance, an adjustment in social welfare expenditure.  It could be necessary to postpone for a year or more the increases <Col N="863" /> proposed in this year's budget for pensioners, the unemployed and all other social welfare recipients.  That would involve another hue and cry.  If the £110 million were not to be raised by way of increased taxes, it would have to be found by cutting expenditure or by increasing borrowing.  In reality, cutting expenditure means taking very difficult decisions. It could involve reducing social welfare allowances, cutting back on social services in the areas of health, education or the environment.  It could involve the employment of fewer teachers, gardaí and nurses.  We have enough teachers and nurses walking around the streets, people who are highly trained and well motivated but who are not in full time employment.  Nobody would be in favour of cutting back on unemployment benefit or assistance.  Expenditure on social services includes the transfer of resources to those in greatest need and obviously these include the elderly, the sick and the disabled.  It would not be desirable to cut back in the areas of education, health or security.</P>
    <P>The offer made to teachers right across the country has been referred to on many occasions.  The public perception of teachers is again somewhat confused.  The total increases payable up to mid-1988 under the terms of the draft proposals for the pay agreement would amount to 17.9 per cent.  That takes into account the 7.5 per cent and the 10 per cent already referred to in respect of the arbitration scheme.  This is a substantial offer by any standards.  In the present circumstances with falling inflation rates it would have to be regarded as being generous.</P>
    <P>To give some examples of what this would mean, the starting pay of a teacher with a three year training course and a pass primary degree would range from £8,940 to £10,539, an increase of £1,599 over the three years.  A teacher on the maximum of the scale with a pass primary degree without a post of responsibility would range from £15,913 to £18,758, an increase of £2,845.  These figures would of course be further increased by any <Col N="864" /> general increases which might be negotiated following the expiry of the proposed pay agreement.  I would like to stress that teachers are not being discriminated against <i>vis-à-vis</i> other public service unions.  A similar offer as that made to teachers has been made to unions representing other public servants. Some of these groups have arbitration findings which would be treated in exactly the same way as the teachers arbitration finding.  We are all aware that one of the Civil Service unions has already voted to accept the pay proposals and two other such unions are ballotting their members at present.  I expect and hope that the other public service unions will shortly ballot their members on these proposals also.</P>
    <P>With regard to the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations, I was disappointed and surprised that the leadership of the teachers unions should attempt to use the examinations as a weapon in their dispute with the Government. The public statements made by way of the teacher bodies differ somewhat from their private comments.  It is fair to say that everybody would like to see this dispute ended.  The seriousness of the holding of the examinations is evident on the faces of the students of the nation. These young boys and girls, who have been taught by the teachers presently in dispute with the authority of this House, have a high degree of motivation with regard to the taking of their examinations and feel in all justice that they are entitled to sit these examinations.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that work in connection with examinations does not fall within the terms of the contract of teachers.  This work is done purely on a voluntary basis.  It is carried out by a minority of teachers each year.  There are criteria laid down for the selection of teachers who participate in this important work.  It is fair to say that teachers value their remuneration from correction and from the supervision of the examinations. Over the years, it has been an accepted fact that teachers who participate in the examination process can do so to ensure <Col N="865" /> the smooth running and the proper correction of the examinations from year to year.</P>

      <P>I was disappointed by the vehemence of the teachers' unions with regard to the holding of examinations.  It is absolutely essential that the examinations go ahead. In the light of the Minister not being clear as to where the unions stood in this regard, contingency plans for the holding of examinations had to take place.  I would appeal at this stage, as Deputy O'Rourke has appealed in another sense, that commonsense would now prevail in this debate and that the teacher executive unions would take up the call issued by the Minister and reiterated by him last week to come and talk about this important and fundamental matter.  I had hoped that the examination would take place free of dispute and I have appealed for this on several occasions.  The Minister referred to the analogy of power strikes where essential services are always allowed to go ahead.  In that context I know that many teachers view the examinations as being of paramount importance to the development of the students. They feel, while they have an allegience to the unions, that the examinations should go ahead.</P>

      <P>The possibility of the examination boycott has been evident for some time and that is why the contingency plans have taken place.  The teacher unions have issued a statement this evening which alludes to the cessation of industrial action for the first time in this dispute.  I have no doubt that this would be given very careful consideration by the Government.  It is important to remember that the public perception of this dispute is that the Government have taken up a solid position.  Everybody <Col N="866" /> knows where they stand.  They are clear in their position, unlike the Opposition who have made very general statements about it.  We also know what the bottom line with regard to the teachers unions' comments are.  In the interest of everybody concerned and of the country as a whole the Minister has opened the door by way of his invitation at all times to the bodies to come along and talk to him about it.  If the ballots are to go ahead with regard to strike action by the teachers it might be important that they would first of all answer the Minister's call to come along and talk about it.  If they were to do that the results of the ballots might be frozen and held unopened by somebody such as the Electoral Reform Society.  The teachers' unions could accept that the process of the last arbitration claim has been completed.  It would be possible in these talks to get the immediate 7.5 per cent under the 25th pay agreement through.  They could accept that the announced time scale for the payment of the rest of the last arbitration award is as expressed by the Government in the vote in this House.  They could renew expressions of support for initiatives taken by the Minister in very fundamental areas of education.  It is not for me to in any way prejudice the decisions to be taken by the Cabinet although I am sure they will give very serious consideration to the statement issued by the teachers' unions this evening.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to reiterate our call to the teacher unions that they would accept the Minister's invitation to come <Col N="867" /> and talk about the dispute and to have a commonsense approach to it.  In the interest of the students I would ask the teachers to allow the examinations to go ahead without a mediator because the positions are quite clear on either side.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have come here this evening, as it were, out of retirement since I had the honour of being elected Lord Mayor of this city.  I have noted from details given in some paper that I was in the top six of those who spoke here.  Nobody said whether there was any special merit in what we said, but at least we were credited with having spoken.  I avoided coming here because I interpreted the office of Lord Mayor as one where I could find myself in contention with Ministers of the Government in a fashion that <Col N="868" /> would be unfair to the people of the city. That might seem a rather strange approach to my position as a Member of this House, but that was the decision I made.  I avoided coming here to speak on matters connected with Dublin Gas, Irish Shipping or other matters which affected very much the people of this city.</P>
    <P>I come here tonight because I know I am speaking on behalf of all the city and that includes all the public representatives whether they be from the Labour Party, The Workers' Party or Fine Gael, because I know they have already expressed their concern for the fact that now coming to the eve of the traditional examinations &mdash; group certificate, inter certificate and leaving certificate &mdash; there is such a state of chaos that it brings into every home a height of anxiety and concern which cannot be allowed to continue. I will avoid commenting on the contribution of the last speaker, the Minister of State.  I will say in passing that I am happy to congratulate him on his appointment.  I noted immediately that his characteristic and traditional freedoms would appear to have given way entirely to the requirement of the bureaucracy he now serves.</P>
    <P>I am appalled to think that we here should be avoiding the situation.  The Minister of State made a case on what the economists would call opportunity costs.  We had all that debate before. What we are concerned with tonight is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is your motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that we give the opportunity to the students in the traditional form to take part and compete in the examinations.  The Minister of State knows as well as I do, and every other Minister knows, that over the years there has grown up a tradition, respect, and prestige in regard to education second to none in the world.  We all accept that with equity and justice obtaining the system brings to the top those who deserve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak on behalf of all the people of Dublin.  They will be very disappointed if we cannot discover a formula as a result <Col N="869" /> of which the examinations can take place. The Minister of State kept referring back to the debate which took place last week. The debate tonight is about discovering a mechanism by which the examinations can take place in that traditional fashion. Thankfully in respect of Ireland there is an interest in education which is unparalleled. Our own parents were prepared to make sacrifices for us so that we could enjoy the benefits of education.  I am not saying that it was education in the old traditional style of education for its own sake but they saw in it the means by which we could engage in employment in accordance with our own intelligence and application.  In every house there is concern, a rather infectious concern that comes from the candidate, that on the eve of the examinations the candidate should have fair play.</P>
    <P>Education is about students.  It is not about the Minister, the Minister of State, or the Government.  If we are sincere in our expressions of concern we must be concerned about the student.  Is the Minister of State telling me from his experience that he is happy to leave the fortunes of our students in respect of the examinations in the hands of quacks, quack superintendents and quack examiners? In what other discipline would it be tolerated?  That is what he is advocating tonight, albeit, he is giving a presentation of matters which are extraneous to it to try to deflect interest.  He knows the checks and balances that obtain, I from one school supervise at another centre and he from another school does the same.  Because of the experience we have with our students we can develop this eye in the back of our heads to detect the student who might be given to getting results not appropriate to his ability.  That can be checked and we have the interest. The Minister of State is now proposing to take anybody and everybody in from the street whose only concern, as I would see it would be to get the 30 pieces of silver that that Department will give him for sitting in a certain place for a certain number of hours.  Apart from the injustice that will be done to the student, <Col N="870" /> he is going to injure the structure of education in a fashion that never has happened before.</P>

The problem is not of the kind that has been articulated by the Minister of State.  It is rather one of the Minister moving away from his stance of late.  I notice the Minister of State mentioned it.  The Minister is prepared to talk about &ldquo;it&rdquo;.  What is &ldquo;it&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is prepared to talk about &ldquo;that&rdquo; and to talk about &ldquo;this&rdquo;.  In no case did the Minister of State say that the Minister was concerned to talk with the representatives of the teaching organisations so that the examinations which are now imminent could be proceeded with in a fashion that will do justice to the candidate, the Department, the Minister and to all.  I do not pretend that I have the monopoly of what happens in the area of examinations, but I can say that, as a teacher and headmaster, I am aware of the provisions the Department make to ensure everything is as near to perfection as it can be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would isolate one area and ask how the Minister proposes to overcome the problems that will inevitably arise.  In respect of the group certificate, inter certificate and leaving certificate the Minister has practical subjects, and we all <Col N="871" /> desire this.  The regulation obtaining to date would not permit me, as headmaster of a school, to allow a practical examination to proceed unless the teacher of that subject was present in case a candidate might have some difficulty with a lathe, a steel saw, a milling machine, chisel or a hammer, all highly dangerous.  The Minister has adopted a &ldquo;we will not move an inch&rdquo; stance.  How does he propose providing for a situation which heretofore would not be tolerated under any circumstances in respect of the practical examinations? It cannot be done.  I am sure that many parents will be reluctant to allow their children to take part in practical examinations in these circumstances because there will be a risk to them if an expert in the machinery is not available in the school to act as a guardian to the students while they are at work.</P>
    <P>The investment that parents have made in education is incalculable.  When I was on the other side of the House I was always happy to say here that there was no such thing as free education. Parents pay dearly in indirect and direct taxation for it.  They might prefer some other system to obtain but it is acceptable to them and to everybody else.  Parents have been happy to forego many necessities so that their offspring would have this opportunity.  Generally speaking, apart from the occasional parent who may think his Seán, or Paddy or Doreen or Denise is the best and should get better, parents have absolute confidence in the system as it is.  Now the Departments are saying &ldquo;no, we must have our way.  We are not prepared to talk&rdquo;.  One would have expected the Minister of State to bring balance in this type of discussion. He never mentioned that the teachers' organisations this afternoon indicated their preparedness to talk.</P>

      <P>It is not a very educated word.  There is a proverb in the Gaeilge &mdash;&ldquo;Is fánach an áit in a bhfaightear an &rdquo; I would be happy and indeed honoured if the Minister and the leaders of the organisations were to have a preparatory chat in the Mansion House.  I take the Minister of State at his word.  The Minister wants to have discussions.  I take the teaching organisations at their word. They want to have meaningful discussions in respect of what puts the examinations in jeopardy.  One might say that the Lord Mayor is prejudiced because he is &ldquo;one of them&rdquo;.  I hold teachers in the same respect as I do other professions. I was happy to belong to the teaching profession.  I am not saying that they have the monopoly of everything that is best. In the teaching profession, as in all others, there are manifestations of virtues and all the other things that one gets elsewhere.  I do not think the teachers have presented themselves in that fashion.  But even though there might be sad exceptions, the vast body of teachers still retain the old idealism in respect of their profession which is not evident in other professions.  They are concerned for the students.  Any teacher worth his salt would not be in the profession if he was not concerned.  Naturally they are aware of the appalling uncertainty that exists.  They are also aware that that gap is not as wide as has been represented by the Minister and his Department.  As a neutral observer I would say that they have shown a greater degree of magnanimity and preparedness to move than has the Minister who has indulged in bland statements.  He has said in effect &ldquo;I will talk about it any time but do not ask me to move beyond the stance already taken&rdquo;.  There is an opportunity for the Minister to have a second look at it, especially in view of the much paraded new affluence that has come to the country in the last few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ministers are telling us that we have <Col N="873" /> rounded the bend and turned the corner and that there is plenty of light in the tunnel now.  The Minister of State tonight preached the old story of penury in a fashion that is not being copied by more senior Ministers.  Maybe changes have occurred that would permit the Minister to make adjustments while still retaining his overall position.</P>
    <P>Moves will have to take place to do justice to our students who are so deserving of it.  If we do not do that we cannot complain too much if, in return, they end up with an attitude which we will have cultivated in them.  Let us have these preliminary discussions leading to more structured discussions and let us start tomorrow so that the thousands of students submitting themselves as candidates for the group, intermediate and leaving certificates will get the same crack of the whip as their forebears.  Let us not deny them their entitlements on the grounds that this Minister does not want to lose face or some other Minister is insisting that if it happens he or she will do something else.  The matter is far too serious for personal feelings or reactions. It is one which affects the great educational structures that we have been building up over the years.  It affects the right of our students.  Let us not fail them, mar má tharlaíonn sé sin is orainnse a bhéas an locht.  Tá seans againn anocht cur suas nó cur síos leis an ábhar seo atá os ár gcomhair.

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Malin Head Radio Station.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for the opportunity of raising on the Adjournment the problem facing the radio station operators at Malin Head and I am glad the Minister for Communications is here to answer the case. Appreciation is not shown for the work done by the radio station operators around our coasts.  They are very remote <Col N="874" /> from the rest of the population and they give a service to the people involved with the seas and the airways.  The recognition given to these people by the general public is minimal and it would appear from the position in which they now find themselves that the recognition they are getting from the Department is similar.</P>
      <P>To cut back on the overtime worked by these people who provide this very vital service for the preservation of life is to put these stations in a position where they will not be able to give full emergency cover.  This is a ridiculous decision. Perhaps this decision has been taken by civil servants without the full knowledge of the Minister.  I accept that the Minister would weigh up the consequences of a cutback in overtime worked by these officers and I do not believe he would agree to such a move because, despite the economic climate, the savings made by these cutbacks would be very insignificant in the overall budgetary position.</P>
      <P>I am particularly interested in the Malin Head station which is most severely hit by Government cutbacks. Eleven men operate that station.  The Minister may say that two extra staff members have been provided but they are trainees and it will be almost two years before they are fully competent radio station operators and able to handle any emergency which might arise.  At present all overtime is banned but in exceptional circumstances they are allowed to call in another man.  Unfortunately, they are unable to get the Department to clarify what constitutes an emergency and as a result they are unable to carry on normal operations.  On at least 11 occasions in a two week period the secretary of the Arranmore lifeboat had to be warned that full cover could not be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present Malin Head radio station provides a service for the North Atlantic but cannot give full cover in an emergency. This should never have happened and it is very regrettable that I have had to bring this case to the floor of this House.  It appears that the people who do not have any clout will be trampled on and their voices will not be heard <Col N="875" /> despite the fact that the same people must accept responsibility when an emergency arises.  The Valentia station were responsible for the telecommunications when the Indian aircraft crashed.  About six weeks ago the <i>Snekker Arctic</i> sank in the North Atlantic and 18 lives were lost. The only radio communication available to those people was provided by the Malin Head radio station.  The Clyde could not give them any cover nor could Belfast.  There is ship-to-shore radio facilities in that station with the most modern equipment and they were the only people who were able to get rescue operations under way.  On the file the Minister will see a letter from the French authorities acknowledging the service provided by the men at the Malin Head station during that unfortunate incident.</P>
    <P>There is another problem at Malin Head and it is time the Minister addressed himself to it.  There could be a second station there if a piece of equipment which has just been lying there for three years was located in the Killybegs or Glencolumbkille areas.  I do not know why it has not been put into service.  As long as it is lying there it is denying the fishermen and the people who operate boats from south-west Donegal down to Galway a ship-to-shore radio service. The Minister knows the great advantage this would be to the people operating in that area.  Credit must go to this side of the House for initiating a ship-to-shore radio service.  It is only right that this equipment should be put into service and a ship-to-shore service provided for the people operating from south-west Donegal down to Galway.</P>
    <P>A new extension has been built to accommodate the telex equipment and other communications machinery which is at present installed in a room.  This room holds this equipment and houses two, and sometimes three, operators and if there is an emergency there could be up to 11 operators in that room.  It is not right that such a situation should be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to restore to those operators the conditions they enjoyed <Col N="876" /> prior to the directive which issued from the Department banning all overtime. That is all they are asking for at the moment.  I am asking the Minister to get the equipment that has been lying there for three years into operation.  I do not accept that no sites can be procured at Glencolumbkille to accommodate this equipment.  That is not an answer but it is the stock answer that is coming back. I ask him also to allow work to continue on the development of the premises there, to get the equipment transferred into those premises and to give the men in the station proper living and working conditions.  God knows it is dull enough to be stuck in Malin Head on a winter's night with a gale howling outside and to be working there under very unsociable and deplorable conditions.  Those men deserve better.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been unfair in his treatment of these men.  People at a station in the Shannon area in a similar situation made their case and got an allocation. Whether that allocation is sufficient to accommodate them over the next 12 months is not too clear, but I understand that it is given because they have a payment from the air services who have to communicate with them from time to time.  It is not fair that the operation which these men carry out and the important work they do should be quantified in terms of money.  On an island we cannot afford to take money as a yardstick of the services provided by the people who man and operate these radio stations.  I appeal to the Minister tonight to let them revert to their original working conditions, to update their present accommodation and instal the equipment that is there to give the people who must earn their livelihood from the sea the same protection that the people have in Malin Head.</P>
    <P>I conclude now to allow the remainder of my time to Deputy P. Gallagher who is very familiar with the conditions under which fishermen and people who have to earn their livelihood from the sea work. I am sure he will establish a case in this issue.</P>
    <Col N="877" />
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of adding my voice to that of Deputy Conaghan who has made an excellent case which I hope will elicit a favourable response from the Minister. In the light of the history of Malin Head it is unfortunate that in 1986 we are confronted with cutbacks in the Department of Communications resulting in a reduced service at Malin Head.  This service has never been interrupted in any way and this station has never been manned by fewer than two men since 1890 when it was set up by the British and taken over by the Royal Navy.  It was funded by the British until 1950 when it was taken over by this Government and the former Department of Transport and Power when it was out at Banbas Crown.  Later a more suitable location for it was found at Ballygorman.  After 90 years it is unfortunate that this year we are confronted with a problem such as this.</P>
      <P>Malin Head is responsible for some of the most rugged coastline in the world, from the north-west and west coasts of Ireland right down to Galway and Mayo and north to the Scottish coast and right into the Atlantic.  This station, like many others, has a capacity to cover hundreds of miles during the day and thousands of miles during the night.  It is unfortunate that we hear of Malin Head only at times of distress and tragedy.  Surely we have had enough tragedies, particularly on the west coast.  Deputy Conaghan referred to the <i>Snekker Arctic</i> and this was acknowledged by the French authorities at the time.  The Malin Head radio is in constant touch with the lighthouse on Tory Island. It is responsible for the monitoring of all communications between ship and shore, for assisting weather forecasting, for gale warnings and for making urgent link calls from ship to shore.  I found it necessary during the winter to make contact with Shannon Air Rescue who were most helpful, but at that time Malin Head had to confirm that there were problems on Tory Island.  One must give credit to the British who were prepared to fly into Tory that night but we have never established why it has not happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" /> Up to seven or eight weeks ago a satisfactory arrangement existed.  There was cover at all times for sickness and holiday periods for the staff there.  Up to very recently there was a normal complement of 11 men, nine experienced and two inexperienced.  With one experienced and one inexperienced on duty, if the experienced person became sick and had to go home he was not covered.  I understand that very recently an experienced radio officer went off and the station was left to be manned by a qualified but inexperienced radio officer.  Only as a result of pressure from public representatives in that area have the Government conceded to cover sickness.  Maybe the Minister will elaborate on whether he will cover the holiday periods.</P>
    <P>We are not looking for bouquets.  All we want is to ensure that the service we have been accustomed to over the years will continue to be provided.  If there are to be cutbacks in any Department let there be no cutbacks in regard to safety at sea.  I suggest that the Minister visit Malin Head or send his Minister of State there to speak with these people and ensure that this problem is resolved immediately.  I understand that there were representations even from Scottish authorities and radio stations in Scotland who realised the problems that could confront us as a result of these unnecessary cutbacks.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the VHF equipment which has been lying at Malin Head for over three years and to which Deputy Conaghan referred.  We have not the money to purchase a site in west or south-west Donegal to erect that equipment.  In short, Malin Head is vital for the safety of fishermen.  The Minister must provide the finance to ensure that we continue with the excellent service which we have been accustomed to over the years.  The outcry would have been much greater if the public had been fully aware of the position.  We hope that they will not be made fully aware of it as a result of tragedy.  One must ask if the Department of Communications and the Minister for Communications put a price on human <Col N="879" /> life.  I tell the Minister that we must resolve this problem before it is too late.</P>

      <P>I wish to make it quite clear that I do not propose to retain St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea, as an active psychiatric hospital.</P>
      <P>I have written to the Western Health Board outlining the means by which alternative arrangements can be made both for persons from County Roscommon who may need psychiatric services and for persons now living in St. Patrick's Hospital who are in need of continuing care.  These arrangements include, in particular:</P>
      <P>1.  An acute psychiatric unit at Roscommon County Hospital, to include a crisis intervention service and a day hospital.</P>
      <P>2.  Specialist psychiatric out-patient services at the county clinic in Roscommon.</P>
      <P>3.  Development of the Sacred Heart Home in Roscommon to provide a comprehensive day care service.</P>
      <P>4.  The acquisition of suitable premises for use as a high-support hostel.</P>
      <P>5.  The acquisition of domestic scale residences at a number of locations such as Roscommon, Castlerea, Boyle, Ballaghaderreen, Strokestown and Williamstown.</P>
      <P>6.  Special arrangements for mentally handicapped persons who are now living in St. Patrick's Hospital.  Discussions are now in progress with the mental handicap agencies to find appropriate accommodation for them.</P>
      <P>7.  The redesignation as a geriatric unit of some accommodation within St. Patrick's Hospital to cater for a number of elderly persons at present in the hospital whose main requirement is geriatric care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="675" /> I have indicated that financial assistance will be available, if required, to enable these facilities to be put in place.</P>
    <P>I am now awaiting the response of the Western Health Board to these proposals. Arrangements for funding St. Patrick's Hospital from July onwards will be examined in the light of this response.</P>

      <P>When I took office initially I was not satisfied with the functioning of Comhairle na nOspidéal because when considering applications for consultant appointments they did not take account of the financial resources which would be required to support the appointment. Consequently, I decided that before an application would be considered by the comhairle it should be submitted to my Department so that the financial implications of the appointment could be clarified and a decision given as to whether or not the necessary resources were available. This procedure has been in operation now since 1983.</P>
      <P>I also considered it desirable that when considering applications the comhairle should be aware of the Department's policy regarding the organisation of the specialty or service involved.  Consequently, since the new comhairle was appointed in October last my Department sends to the comhairle a statement of its policy which is taken into account by the comhairle in consideration of each application.</P>

The administration of St. Brendan's Hospital is the responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.  I am aware that both the Psychiatric Nurses' Association and the Eastern Health Board are concerned about conditions in St. Brendan's. The health board is at present preparing its detailed plans for the development of the psychiatric services and these plans will include proposals concerning persons now resident in St. Brendan's, I have already approved the construction of two 32-bed psycho-geriatric units to accommodate patients from St. Brendan's Hospital and I expect that the building of these units will commence shortly.

This development is now in the course of <Col N="679" /> construction and will be ready to receive patients in early 1987.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">

      <P>The determination of eligibility for medical cards in individual cases is a matter for the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  In each health board area, medical cards already in issue are subject to regular review in order to ensure that all holders of cards continue to be entitled to such medical cards in compliance with the terms of the Health Act, 1970.</P>
      <P>As a result of these reviews, some cards are withdrawn due to changes which have occurred in the financial and social circumstances of those who previously held them.</P>
      <P>A computer based medical card review update system was introduced by the Western Health Board in late 1984.  In 1985 this new computerised system facilitated a more through and complete review of medical cards in issue than would have previously been possible.  A net total of 1,189 medical cards were withdrawn in 1985 in respect of County Mayo.  These cards represented a coverage of 4,811 persons in all.</P>

In many cases temporary staff are recruited pending the filling of the permanent posts to avoid curtailment of services for eligible persons. There is not great difficulty in filling permanent posts of dentists in the health board service at present and there is generally a number of applications for each post advertised.  In the circumstances there is no need to make it mandatory for newly qualified dentists to serve for a given period in the health board service.

This and other matters have been the subject of examination by an inter-ministerial working group on motor insurance.  The Government has implemented measures to tackle the problem viz. increased fines for uninsured driving offences, increased garda surveillance, compulsory display of windscreen insurance discs.  As for careless driving, improvement here is very much in the hands of the motorist.  Careless drivers with claims against them do, of course, suffer loss of no claims bonuses, and may also attract loadings on premium if convicted.</P>

During 1985 a total of nine small industry projects were approved grant assistance in the BantryGlengariff-Durrus area of County Cork and two further projects have been approved grant assistance to date in 1986. On 7 February last the Taoiseach, as part of the special development package for west Cork, announced the provision of an enterprise centre in Bantry and a business development scheme for equity investment. Details of these proposals will be announced shortly by the Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 65 together.  Grants are available under the 1985 house improvement grants scheme for the replacement of windows/external doors which, in the opinion of the Department, have deteriorated to the extent that there is no option except to replace them.  The amount of the grant cannot exceed two-thirds of the approved cost subject to a maximum of £800.  The approved cost is that estimated by the Department's inspector using costings appropriate to standard materials and not to more <Col N="693" /> expensive materials such as aluminium or hardwood.  It is a matter for individual applicants to exercise their discretion on the materials they wish to use but no allowance can be made in determining the amount of the grant for any additional costs that may arise through the use of more expensive materials.</P>

      <P>Comparisons based solely on the relationship between casualty figures and the numbers of licensed vehicles can be misleading.  Total casualty figures are <Col N="696" /> difficult to compare because of variations between member states in the reporting levels of injury-only figures and comparisons based on the relationship between fatality rates and numbers of vehicles do not of themselves offer a reliable guide as to accident trends either on a national or an international basis.</P>
      <P>It is now accepted internationally that accident comparisons should desirably be made on the basis of fatality rates in proportion to volume of travel and population. Based on 1983 comparisons of this nature, which is the latest year for which the required statistics are available, the number of road deaths in Ireland in proportion to the volume of travel was the third lowest in the then ten EC countries. On the basis of road deaths in proportion to population, Ireland's rate per 10,000 population in 1983 was 1.5, about average for the EC.  The Irish rate has since dropped to 1.3 in 1984 and to 1.18 in 1985.</P>

      <P>While delays have occurred in relation to certain categories of grants, I do not accept that there is an overall delay of four months.  I have made arrangements to double the total number of inspectors engaged on grant inspection work.  Thirty-seven new temporary inspectors have already taken up duty and a further 27 are in course of being recruited.  The deployment of inspectors is kept under continuous review to take account of inspection requirements in various locations.</P>

      <P>Notification of completion of the works approved for grant purposes on 26 February 1986 has not been received by the Department.  Apart from this, the applicant has nominated a different contractor to execute the works than the one originally named on the application form and the new contractor's eligibility to participate in the house improvement grants scheme is at present being examined in the Department.

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the number of <Col N="699" /> houses built by each local authority for the years 1983, 1984 and 1985; the average cost for a three-bedroomed house in each local authority area for the year in question; the average cost for single rural county council house and the number provided in each area for the years in question; and the number of houses in each area for the years in question which were provided with ranges in their kitchens as against fireplaces with backboilers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to his Parliamentary Questions Nos. 64 and 65 of 13 November 1985 and the information subsequently sent to him which included details of the number of houses built by each local authority and the number of rural cottages built by each county council for the years 1983, 1984 and 1985. The information given in respect of 1985 related to completions up to 30 September which was then the latest available date for which figures were available. Accordingly, there follows a statement showing for 1985 house completions by each authority and the number of rural cottages built by each county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information for each local authority area on the average cost of a three-bedroomed house and single rural cottage and on the number of houses provided with ranges in their kitchens during the 1983-85 period is not available in my Department.  In relation to house costs, a statement showing the national average tender cost of a typical local authority dwelling (i.e. a two storey three-bed-room, five person house with a floor area of 81m²) broken down between urban and rural areas for the period from 1975 to 1984 was among the material forwarded to the Deputy in response to his earlier question.  The corresponding figures for 1985 are £28,900 and £21,800 for urban and rural areas respectively.  As with the previous material, these prices do not include land costs or costs arising from the operation of the price variation clause and may not include the cost of site development where this has been <Col N="700" /> carried out under a separate contract.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement referred to:</P>

However, a grant cannot be allowed for the provision of a bedroom as a previous grant was paid in November 1983 and, accordingly, the required waiting period of seven years under the scheme has not elapsed.</P>

      <P>While in general it is illegal under the provisions of the Forestry Act, 1946, to cut down trees without permission from my Department, there are exceptions.  For example, the law does not require that a licence be obtained to fell a tree standing within 100 feet of a building; or where a tree is standing in a county or other borough or an urban district; or to fell any ozier or certain fruit trees grown for the value of their fruit.  It will be appreciated, therefore, that not all trees felled without a licence are felled illegally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every incident of alleged illegal felling reported to my Department is investigated. In the five-year period 1981 to <Col N="709" /> 1985 73 such reports were investigated by my Department and the Garda.  The culprits were not identified in 16 of these cases; warning letters were issued in 43 cases, where the offence was not serious enough or the evidence was insufficient to warrant further action; four offenders were prosecuted; and ten cases are still under investigation.</P>

      <P>The Government has provided £855,000 in the 1986 Estimates for the expansion and promotion of private forestry. This represents a 300 per cent increase on last year's allocation and the bulk of this money will be spent on western package grants.</P>

      <P>It is understood that the EC Commission will be seeking in the near future a supplementary and amending budget for 1986. It is only when the request is made that the details will be available.  In the <Col N="719" /> absence of a supplementary budget it is likely that there would not be sufficient funds available to maintain programmes at existing levels.</P>

      <P>As regards the impact of enlargement of the Community, the Commission have indicated that they regard enlargement as a budgetary constraint in 1986 only in relation to the Regional Fund.  However, in relation to the effect of enlargement on Ireland's receipts from the Regional Fund, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the agreement that was reached in relation to national shares on 18 December 1985 when the fund regulation was being adapted to take account of enlargement.</P>
      <P>On that occasion the Commission guaranteed to the less prosperous member states that in 1986 they would be able to receive ERDF assistance at least equal to their guaranteed minimum percentage share of the fund for 1985.</P>

      <P>I have had inquiries made into this matter, and it appears that on each occasion the person in question was asked to ring the hospital before travelling to Dublin in order to ensure that a bed would be available for him.  This procedure is necessary since available beds may <Col N="726" /> be occupied by emergency admissions at little or no notice.  The patient in question did not ring the hospital prior to travelling to Dublin and unfortunately, as a result, no bed was available for him when he arrived on five occasions.  On the sixth occasion, the authorities tried to alert the patient not to travel but only succeeded in getting a message to him when he was already en route to Dublin.</P>
      <P>A further appointment has now been issued for the examination on 23 April and I trust that this will now be carried out to the patient's satisfaction.</P>

      <P>The following table sets out the distribution in 1981 of people suffering from Down's Syndrome by year of birth.  This is derived from a census of mental handicap carried out by the Medico-Social Research Board in 1981 and refers only to people who were being treated at that time.  A detailed analysis by county of birth is not available in my Department at present.  However, a study is in progress, one of the outcomes of which will be such an analysis.  I have asked my Department to keep the Deputies informed of developments in this matter.</P>

      <P>I have requested the Southern Health Board to make arrangements for the provision of consultant staffed obstetric out-patient clinics at Bantry General Hospital. The health board initiated discussions with the consultant obstetricians, gynaecologists based at Erinville Hospital and St. Finbarr's Hospital, Cork, with a view to the establishment of out-patient clinics at the hospital which would be conducted by these consultants.  The consultants concerned were opposed to the establishment of these clinics.  They maintained that under the terms of the common contract for consultant medical staff they could not be required by the health board to provide out-patient clinics at Bantry. The health board did not agree with this interpretation of the common contract and the matter was then regarded as being in dispute.  The matter was then put before the interpretations committee of the common contract.  The interpretations committee decided that the board's directive to the consultants to hold out-patient clinics at Bantry should be implemented. The health board are at present having discussions with the consultants in relation to the implementation of this decision.  I am keeping the matter under review.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment benefit until 28 December 1985, when he had drawn the maximum entitlement of 390 days benefit.  He then claimed unemployment assistance and, pending a fresh investigation of his means, his claim was put into payment immediately as he held a qualification certificate, with recorded means of £15.35 weekly, issued to him in connection with a previous claim.  He was, accordingly, in receipt of unemployment assistance of £18.45 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £33.80, less means of £15.35.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On completion of the investigation by the social welfare officer, the means of the person concerned were assessed at £28 weekly, derived from the value of <Col N="735" /> board and lodging on his brother's holding. The method of calculation of the value of board and lodging, where the household income is derived from farming, is to estimate the yearly profit from the farm and to divide that amount between the members of the household, including the applicant, on a weighted basis.  The profit from the farm in this case was estimated at £5,100 per annum and the person concerned was deemed to enjoy two-sevenths of that income, that is £1,457 per annum, or £28 weekly.  He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at £5.80 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £33.80, less means of £28. The person concerned appealed against the means assessment on 9 April 1986 and arrangements are being made to refer his papers to an appeals officer for determination, at the earliest available opportunity.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is dependent on a claimant being the holder of a qualification certificate and to obtain a qualification certificate a claimant must satisfy certain conditions including an assessment of means.  The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance on 4 February 1986 and his papers were referred to a social welfare officer for investigation of means.  These inquiries which are protracted, will be completed as soon as possible, and the papers will then be submitted to a deciding officer for assessment of means.  The person concerned will be informed of the decision on his entitlement to unemployment assistance as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>A claim to dental benefit was received from the person concerned on 8 January 1986.  One of the statutory contribution conditions for receipt of dental benefit requires the claimant to have had not less than 26 reckonable contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.  The governing contribution year for claims made in 1986 is the 1984-85 year from 6 April 1984 to 5 April 1985.</P>
      <P>According to the available records no employment contributions had been received and only 19 contributions had been credited in respect of that period. On 21 January 1986 he was informed of the position and asked to submit details of any employment in the relevant period.</P>
      <P>On 17 February 1986 he informed the Department that he had been insurably employed for 31 weeks during the relevant period and had asked his employers to forward the necessary details.  This information has not been received to date and the matter is being investigated.  His correct insurance record has now been established however following examination of an income tax form P45 held in the local employment office in connection with his claim to unemployment benefit.  His claim to dental benefit has now been approved and both he and his dentist notified accordingly.</P>

      <P>The person concerned submitted a claim for contributory old age pension on 4 June 1984.  He reached old age pension age of 66 years on 9 May 1974.</P>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of this pension requires a person to have a yearly average of at least 20 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from his year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.  The Department's records showed that the person concerned has no record of insurance in the relevant period which, in his case, is from 5 January 1953 to 31 December 1973.  Neither does he have an entitlement to a <i>pro-rata</i> pension under EC regulations as this could only be based on the number of Irish contributions in proportion to the combined British and Irish total, subject to his having a combined yearly average of at least 20 in the relevant period.</P>
      <P>He is in receipt of a non-contributory old age pension at the rate of £15.10 per week, and is also in receipt of a British retirement pension.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a claimant must be available for full time employment.  The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 23 October 1985 and on the basis of the information available, his claim was disallowed by a deciding officer on the grounds that he was not available for full time employment.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the disallowance and following an oral hearing of his case on 13 January 1986, the appeals officer also decided that he was not available for employment.  He was notified of this decision on 15 January 1986.  The person concerned ceased to sign as unemployed after 15 January 1986.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 3 March 1986 and payment was made at the weekly rate of £74.50, being the maximum flat rate unemployment benefit payable to a married man with one child dependant.  The 85 per cent limit applicable in his case was calculated at £69.55 weekly, and as the rate of flat rate unemployment benefit exceeded this figure, no pay-related benefit was payable.  Further weekly payments of unemployment benefit at £74.50, will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>The person concerned submitted a claim for retirement pension to the Department on 11 September 1985.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires a person to have retired from insurable employment.  The Department were informed by his employer that he would not retire from employment until December 1986.  The claim was withdrawn and he was notified accordingly.  There was no further communication from him.</P>
      <P>On receipt of the Deputy's question the employer was contacted and said that the claimant was now unemployed.  The work was of a seasonal nature only.  In the circumstances he has been awarded retirement pension with effect from 26 December 1985, that is the Thursday following his 65th birthday.  The pension will continue to be paid to him while he does not engage in insurable employment up to the age 66.  The retirement from employment condition ceases to apply at that age.</P>
      <P>A retirement pension book containing orders payable at the appropriate rate from 17 April 1986 is being issued to the designated post office for collection by him and he has been notified accordingly.</P>
      <P>Arrears of retirement pension from 26 December 1985 to 16 April 1986, less unemployment assistance paid in that period, will be issued to him by payable order as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Total imports of butter to the EC during 1983 and 1984 were 104.9 thousand tonnes and 88.7 thousand tonnes respectively. The estimated value of this butter was £200 million in 1983 and £160 million in 1984.  The final 1985 figure is not yet available but the quantity will not differ greatly from the 1984 level.  Almost all of the butter was imported by the United Kingdom under the special quota arrangements for New Zealand butter. During the period 1983 to 1985 a total of 1.6 million tonnes of butter was bought into intervention in the Community and the holding and disposal costs for the same period were £1,650 million.</P>
      <P>Special arrangements governing imports of butter to the Community from New Zealand were originally provided for under Protocol 18 of the Treaty of Accession.  The reason given for these special arrangements, which have been renewed at reduced quantities on three occasions, was the overriding importance to the New Zealand economy of its traditional access to the United Kingdom and in return New Zealand's co-operation in the orderly development of world markets.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will make a statement on the imports of cereal substitutes into the different EC member states each year for the past three years, with particular reference to the type, quantity and value of cereal substitutes from the different countries involved; if he will comment on the fact that the cereal imports into the Community practically equal the amount of the Community member states grain placed in intervention last year; and on the costs of these intervention measures for the years involved for the different member states using this <Col N="765" /> mechanism for dealing with cereal surpluses; and the reasons offered by the Commission as to why these cereal substitutes are allowed, having regard to the problems now being faced by Irish cereal growers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Imports of cereal substitutes into the EC in the last three years were: 1983 &mdash; 13.2 million tonnes; 1984, 13.1 million tonnes; 1985, 12 million tonnes (provisional).  A detailed breakdown is not readily available but will be supplied to the Deputy in due course.</P>
      <P>The imports of cereal substitutes in the years mentioned roughtly equalled the quantity of cereals taken into intervention in the various member states.  The imports have, of course, contributed significantly to the cereal surpluses within the Community and have added enormously to the cost of the cereals support arrangements.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured of my concern at the extent of these imports.  In the Council of Ministers I have, in fact, repeatedly advocated measures aimed at curbing them.  However, in the case of most of the substitutes the rates of import protection are bound in GATT.  Commitments in these respects were made in the context of the Community gaining international acceptance of its cereals support system and &mdash; or obtaining advantages for Community agricultural and industrial exports in the markets of its GATT partners.</P>

      <P>The current relevant regulations are the Factories (Asbestos Processes) Regulations, 1975, which are made under the Safety in Industry Acts, 1955, and 1980.  These regulations apply to workplaces within the scope of the Acts where asbestos goods are manufactured as well as places such as construction sites where asbestos cement sheets and pipes are used.  They also relate to the application or removal of asbestos insulation in relevant premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their time the regulations provided a standard of safety that accorded with <Col N="777" /> the general level of protection provided in other countries in accordance with the current knowledge of the subject.  In the area of occupational safety and health, the statutory provisions are kept under regular review to meet the requirements that come to light as a result of research and the on-going development of scientific knowledge.</P>
    <P>As part of this process, the EC Council adopted a Directive 83/477/EEC on 19 September 1983, on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos at work.  The directive, which must be implemented by member states by 1 January 1987, will apply to all activities, other than air and sea transport, in which workers are or may be exposed in the course of their work to asbestos dust.  Regulations are being drafted by my Department to give effect to the provisions of the directive.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that the European Communities (Dangerous Substances and Preparations) (Marketing and Use) Regulations, 1986, which give effect to Council Directive 83/478/EEC of 19 September 1983, prohibit, with certain qualifications and exemptions, the use of crocidolite (blue asbestos) or products containing crocidolite.</P>

      <P>The determination of the Employment Appeals Tribunal dated 14 January 1986, in respect of the two persons concerned and one other person was on the basis of an agreement between the parties, the employer and the three workers.  The determination does not, however, break down the compensation awarded between awards under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, and the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1984.  Such a breakdown is necessary in order to enable the question of payments under the individual Acts to be pursued.</P>
      <P>As the company by which these persons were formerly employed is in liquidation, the question of payment of their entitlements under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, arises.  One of the workers named by the Deputy has applied for payment under that Act and I propose to refer his case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for clarification of the details of his award.  If the other workers make similar applications through the liquidator, I will consider referring their cases also to the tribunal.</P>
