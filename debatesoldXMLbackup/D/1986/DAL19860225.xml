      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West)</i> asked the Minister for Health the estimated cost of including patients suffering from chronic renal failure in the long term illness scheme; and if he will grant them this facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been estimated that the additional <Col N="2" /> costs which would result from the inclusion of chronic renal failure among the list of prescribed illness covered by the long term illness scheme would be approximately £100,000.  This particular condition is one of a number of illnesses which have been the subject of representations over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of extending the scheme to encompass these conditions has been the subject of ongoing review by successive Ministers for Health.  It has not been found possible to contemplate any extension of the scheme at the present time. About 50 per cent of patients with chronic renal failure have full medical <Col N="3" /> card cover, which entitles them to free general practitioner services and free medication under the GMS scheme.  The remaining 50 per cent comprises persons in the higher income groups who have access to the refund of costs of drugs scheme which ensures that their net unrefunded expenditure on prescribed drugs does not exceed £28 per month.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied, therefore, that the present arrangements for the issue of medical cards, and the availablility of the benefits of the refund of cost of drugs scheme, are such as to ensure that no hardship should arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that persons who have to pay for their drugs and claim £28 a month back suffer hardship?  In this particular condition the cost would be in the region of £100,000.  In previous answers to questions relating to other illnesses the cost was in millions of pounds.  Would the Minister not accept that we should include this illness in the long term illness scheme?  Also, has he any intention of reviewing that scheme with a view to including other illnesses where persons are not able to afford the costs of their medication?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that there have been many representations for the inclusion of a large number of chronic conditions under the scheme and it has not been found possible to provide the very substantial extra millions of pounds which will be necessary if they are all to be included.  The health boards give very sympathetic consideration to applications for medical cards from such persons who have chronic renal failure.  As I indicated, about half of all those patients own medical cards.  In circumstances where there is substantial ongoing expenditure in GP fees and the purchase of prescribed drugs the health boards generally are very sympathetic to such patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the reported correspondence from the Minister's <Col N="4" /> Department to the various health boards last year suggesting that the guidelines for the allocation of medical cards must be applied rigidly, surely it is not possible to give them consideration on the basis of long term illness any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  For their general benefit I have not changed this year the £28 expenditure under the refund of drugs scheme.  I have been keeping it at £28.  To that extent there has been some alleviation of the expenses involved. Overall I have received many representations but they range from anything from chronic renal failure to asthma, to multiple conditions.  If we were to agree on an extension in one individual case, all other cases would have a similar claim and the cost would be very substantial.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the North-Western Health Board's budget provision for 1986; and if he will make a statement on the effects on the health services in that region if a reduction is proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The non-capital allocation which has been approved for the North-Western Health Board for 1986 for their direct expenditure, including their share of the expenses of the General Medical Services (Payments) Board, is £75.11 million.  The board's net budget provision must be aligned with that figure.  The detailed arrangements that require to be made to contain 1986 expenditure within the approved allocation level are being considered at health board level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the tremendous difficulty that the North-Western Health Board are going to experience this year, so much so that it was suggested at a meeting of the North-Western Health Board two days ago that it might be necessary to close down Sligo hospital as one means of living within the allocation, as the Minister has stated <Col N="5" /> clearly here they must during the current year?  They estimate that they are £3.6 million short this year, having already lived with a reduced allocation for the last three years since the Minister came to power.  Will he accept that the time has now come when he must give sufficient allocation to each of the health boards, including the North-Western Health Board, to ensure that they will be able to provide the proper level of service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The £3.6 million is an estimate at this stage; it is a projected estimate.  We must look at the figure for 1985.  Last year the overrun was £400,000 in that health board area and the year before it was £1,070,000.  I will be meeting a deputation from the health board next Friday morning and I will be discussing the situation with the health board. I regard the reference to Sligo General Hospital as being only a preliminary skirmish at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that if you continue reducing the allocation each year and the health boards try to provide a proper level of service, at some time some major institution must close down or there must be some major reduction in the level of service if any health board are to live within the allocation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That particular health board have not closed down anything and have no plans to close down anything.  As the Deputy knows, that board opened up the renal dialysis unit in Letterkenny and they are running quite well in Sligo also, particularly on the orthopaedic side.  Therefore, overall where they have an overrun in one year we have been able to stagger it over the succeeding three years on average.  The total overrun for last year and the year before was £1.5 million and, of course, that arises where people project substantial overruns which do not take place.  I agree with the Deputy that budgets this year are very tight and will require great control on the part of the health boards. I will be meeting that health board next <Col N="6" /> Friday to go down through the measures which they feel are necessary to stay within budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister has said that there was an overrun of £1 million in 1984 for that health board and £0.5 million for 1985, it is not true to say that the £3.3 million is a projected figure.  Those two figures of £1 million and £1.5 million will be the first charges on the 1986 budget; that figure must be reflected again in 1986. Therefore, is it not a fact that, irrespective of any projections, they must have at least an overrun of £3 million for 1986?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Let me point out to the Deputy that the figure I mentioned was £1 million in 1984 and £0.5 million in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>And those two figures must be reflected again in 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case we have spread the overrun over the next three years, which is fair and reasonable.  The Deputy must remember that when we talk about £0.5 million it is out of £75 million.  Nevertheless, the budget situation in that health board is very tight and we must keep controls on it.</P>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the increasing difficulties felt by many middle income families in meeting dental bills; if he will consider proposing to the VHI that they might operate a scheme in this area; and if he has any other proposals to assist these families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Voluntary Health Insurance Board already cover dental and orosurgical operations.  The possibility of a broader scheme is under review.  However, the board do not consider it appropriate to extend cover to routine dental care at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that many persons in the middle income group are insured <Col N="7" /> workers and are, therefore, entitled to dental services under the Department of Social Welfare's dental treatment benefit scheme.  The pregnant wives of insured workers are also entitled to avail of dental treatment under this scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition under the provisions of the Health Acts, all pre-school children and children attending national schools, which would include the great majority of children under 12 years of age, are entitled to free dental treatment in respect of defects discovered in the course of pre-school and national school examinations, irrespective of the means of their parents.  A very substantial portion of the middle income group is, therefore, eligible for State-funded dental services.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to extend eligibility for health board dental services at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any plans to change the ridiculous regulation which says at the moment that only pregnant women can avail of the dental service on their husbands' insurance?  Is that not quite a discriminatory regulation? Would the Minister consider expanding that section of the code as soon as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be great difficulty in extending it on an insured basis, for example, to all spouses of insured workers.  I ran into great difficulty in extending the scheme to cover pregnant spouses of insured persons.  A general extension would require a total recosting of the scheme and an integration of the social welfare scheme with a general scheme being run for the public at large by the dental profession.  It would cost a great deal of money and is not regarded as an immediate priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not concerned that dental bills today, particularly for the women at home, can be as expensive as any medical bill and indeed more so?  That is a serious situation which should be looked at.  I am aware of the cost element and I am not unmindful of the pressures on the <Col N="8" /> Exchequer, but does it not seem ridiculous to extend the scheme only to pregnant women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment about one million people are entitled to dental treatment under the social welfare dental benefit scheme.  The great majority of these would be in the middle income group.  The treatment of the wives or spouses of insured persons other than those who are pregnant is being done on a private basis.  Even on the most tentative inquiry &mdash; and this applies equally to previous Ministers for Health &mdash; I met with total opposition from the dental profession to an expansion of the scheme into that area.  This would affect their private practice.  If we were to expand the scheme in that manner, the cost would be enormous.  I have yet to meet an insured worker who is prepared to say that he would favour an increase in his PRSI contribution to enable his wife to have that benefit.  We all want the services but none of us wants to pay for them.  That would require an extra £15 million per year.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to recommend an increase in the PRSI rate and social insurance under the proposed Social Welfare Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the Minister defending the interests of the dental profession.  He stated that one million persons were entitled to benefit under the social welfare scheme.  However, the dependents of those persons, as Deputy Brennan has pointed out, are not entitled to benefit.  The Minister also stated earlier that those with medical cards and children of pre-school and primary school age are entitled to free dental services.  He must accept that, in reality, there is no dental service available to many of these people.  We have established that fact.  There are no <Col N="9" /> dental services for the dependants of social welfare recipients and there are 40,000 children on the waiting list who are eligible for and entitled to these services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are 40,000 children awaiting dental service?  Is he also aware that there are community care areas where no adult, irrespective of eligibility &mdash; medical card holder or not &mdash; will get the free service he or she is entitled to because the service is not available to the health boards because of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite in favour of providing a scheme, but the parallel requirement is that people are prepared to pay for it.  On the basis of the existing social insurance schemes it just is not possible to pay out another £15 million unless people are prepared to pay through their social insurance contributions.</P>
      <P>Every side of the House wants this scheme and the Minister for Health would be undyingly popular with every woman in the country if that were agreed and I would be totally in favour of it. Simultaneously, the uproar which greets any increase in PRSI contribution rates to pay for this, as the Opposition well knows, is a matter about which the Opposition would not want to get on the band wagon.  These are the facts of life.  I am quite in favour of extending the scheme, but we must be prepared to pay for it.</P>

      <P>Regarding the vacant replacement posts in the south east, of the placement posts vacant since December 1972 the post of anaesthetist in Clonmel has now been filled on a temporary basis.  Similarly, an anaesthetist position in Wexford has been filled on a temporary basis.  A chief psychiatrist post is vacant in St. Otteran's.  The local appointments committee were not able to recommend a candidate there.  Regarding the post of chief psychiatrist to St. Luke's Hospital, a candidate was recommended in May 1985.  Finally, with regard St. Dympna's <Col N="12" /> Hospital, the LAC recommended a candidate for a psychiatrist post in January 1986 and a chief psychiatrist&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be quite sympathetic to that.  I have tried very hard to facilitate the south east.  For example, recently we asked that health board for their updated proposals regarding the appointment of a paediatrician for the area, particularly with regard to the demand in Wexford which was understandable because there is a definite need.  I would be quite prepared to discuss the matter with the Deputy and the South Eastern Health Board.  At present it is mostly on the psychiatric and the anaesthetist side that the vacancies are.  There are six vacancies &mdash; two anaesthetists and four psychiatrists.</P>

      <P>The figures for 1983 are not available on a health board basis yet and are awaiting finalisation of the 1983 children in care survey.  I have also included in the table details of children taken into care during the course of 1982, the latest year for which such details are currently available.  It is hoped to have similar details for 1983 sometime next month as part of the results of the 1983 children in care survey.  I will arrange to have a copy of these results sent to the Deputy as soon as they have been collated.  The 1984 survey will be ready later this year.</P>

      <P>Directors of community care and medical officers of health of health boards may perform duties on an agency basis for local authorities in connection with the administration of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Acts, 1878 to 1962, the Factories Act, 1955, the Milk and Dairies Acts, 1935 to 1956, the Slaughter of Animals Acts, 1935 to 1956, the Housing Acts, 1966 to 1970, and the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966.</P>
      <P>Environmental health officers of health boards frequently carry out environmental work on an agency basis for local authorities also.  Their basic duties are in respect of services for which the health boards are responsible.  There are certain advantages in their dual function from the point of view of the coordination of public health activities at local levels.  I am satisfied with these arrangements provided adequate time is available for achievement of work targets in respect of the health boards' own responsibilities.

      <P>I am committed to the development of a comprehensive, community based psychiatric service. The report, <i>Psychiatric Services &mdash; Planning for the Future,</i> outlines the steps needed in order to achieve this.  The health boards are now working on implementation plans based on the report's recommendations.  New community services will in many instances replace existing hospital services.  This means that the build up of community services and the scaling down of institutional services will occur simultaneously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community psychiatric facilities do not necessarily need to be purpose-built. Many hostels for the mentally ill are provided by the local authorities and existing buildings can be adapted for use as day centres.  The health board's plans will include their requirements for new community psychiatric services.  The detailed proposals will be examined in the context <Col N="16" /> of the health board's overall plan and a decision as to funding will then be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down this question because of the widespread concern about the closure of two psychiatric hospitals.  What exactly is meant by &ldquo;community based care&rdquo;?  Does the Minister accept that the experience in other countries indicates that simply the closure of hospitals and failure to provide adequate community based care has resulted in a demand for the re-opening of these institutions and that we should avoid that at all costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of contributing to such a situation.  We will and we can avoid it.  There is no comparison whatsoever between the position here and, for example, in the US and Italy which we hear cited so frequently. I have met the Italian Minister for Health and I know that the position there is totally different from ours.  It is possible to provide community services which would not be additional to existing institutional services but, as far as possible, replacements for them.  We are doing that in consultation, in particular, with the two health boards concerned. We will work unceasingly this year to bring that about.</P>

      <P>In relation to his plans for Clonmel, the Minister will be aware that there are many patients in Clonmel from the Eastern Health Board area and that the health board have indicated they have nowhere in which to place those patients in institutional or community care.  Is this not the danger most people fear, that the closure of large institutions will result in numbers of people being thrown on to inadequately developed and funded community based care?  Indeed, they would be thrown on communities who would be unprepared to deal with psychiatric cases.  On that basis is there not an immediate need for a review of how he will proceed with the implementation of his plans?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will approach those <Col N="17" /> problems on a positive basis.  At any time in Ireland one will receive most articulate and comprehensive reasons for not doing something.  I am sure the Deputy was referring to Carlow rather than Clonmel. In relation to Carlow, I have given approval for immediate design work for the 30-bed acute psychiatric unit in Naas General Hospital.  Phase 2 has been brought forward to the middle of this year.  That, to an extent, will take care of the catchment area of Kildare with its approximate 70,000 population.  I am reviewing admissions to Carlow and the provision of resources there for supervised and unsupervised hostels in Kildare and Carlow. I am examining the possible provision of day care facilities in the area.  The Deputy will share my view that a number of mentally handicapped patients in Carlow and in the other hospitals should be taken out as quickly as possible and put into alternative care.  I am not including in my references the prospect of the immediate opening of a 50-bed psychiatric unit in Beaumont Hospital, adjacent to the Deptuy's constituency.  A great deal of work can be done during 1986 but it will be done in a sensitive basis.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister familiar with <i>Planning for the Future</i> which states that no psychiatric unit would be closed without the provision of facilities in the community?  In relation to the proposed closure of Castlerea psychiatric hospital in Roscommon, has the Minister made any real finance available for the provision of facilities in the community for the 250 patients who will be dislodged in 1986 if he has his way?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have directed officers of my Department to visit, for example, Roscommon General Hospital this week and I look forward to receiving their report.  We have several ideas, notably the prospect of building a 30-bed acute psychiatric unit in Roscommon County Hospital using existing facilities or constructing the unit within the framework of that hospital, so that nobody &mdash; and I repeat nobody &mdash; goes into Castlerea unless they have gone through <Col N="18" /> the acute general hospital psychiatric assessment unit.  That is of critical importance whether it be in respect of Carlow or Castlerea.  In Roscommon town there is an unopened mental handicap workshop day care centre.  I am examining these matters and we are having discussion with the health board with a view to developing all these structures.  The work is going ahead quite rapidly and I will be in consultation with the Deputy and his colleagues in that regard.  My only request is that we approach this in an orderly way, having concentrated our minds on these very important matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not recommend that the Minister have consultations with me or with my colleagues because we are opposed to the closure of Castlerea. There is no way 250 patients from Castlerea can be accommodated in a unit provided for 30 patients in Roscommon town.  The Minister has made no financial provisions in 1986 for the community care of the 250 patients in the Castlerea hospital.</P>

      <P>My question concerns the allocation of resources to the development of community-based psychiatric facilities.  Would the Minister accept that there will be a need for greater resources in the psychiatric area because of the need to maintain a level of institutional care while the community-based care is being developed?  Would the Minister confirm that he does not see the scaling down of institutional care as simply a cost cutting exercise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced of that.  In relation to Carlow, there is a provision of £3.8 million for psychiatric resources for 1986 and £4 million for Roscommon.  Within the framework of that money an alternative treatment model can be provided &mdash; and God knows it should be provided in many other parts of the country as well.  I agree that there may be a need for additional capital <Col N="19" /> resources but in terms of the number of persons working, they must come from behind the institutional structures and into the community and the nursing and ancillary staff must work within that framework.  On that basis there is no great need for additional revenue moneys.  Capital moneys for buying hostels and buildings, using alternative facilities and so on, are readily available. They are once-off capital moneys.  I am convinced this can be made to work with the support in particular of the Eastern Health Board, and I hope, the responsible support of some senior psychiatric consultants although I despair of some of the statements they have made, with due respect to the profession.  I hope we will make considerable progress in that regard.</P>

      <P>The Minister must accept that it makes good economic sense and that it would be cost effective to have a CAT scanner in operation in Galway. This would mean that people in the west would no longer have to travel to Dublin or Cork for a CAT scan which is a very important and essential part of modern medical investigation.  It is illogical for the Minister to suggest that this CAT scanner was bought for political reasons. Surely he will accept that this scanner should be operative and that it would be cost effective if it were?  It is because he has not allocated funds for its operation that it is not now in use.</P>

      <P>I must confess that if I had to look at the matter on an objective basis I am not sure I would agree with the Deputy.  The Deputy knows that to fully utilise a CAT scanner would cost the best part of £750,000.  To utilise this equipment and to staff it every day of the week it would need to cover a population of 700,000 people and that catchment area is extraordinary in that regard. There are now four CAT scanners in this country &mdash; one at St. Laurence's Hospital, one at St. Vincent's Hospital, one at the Mater Hospital and one at the Cork Regional Hospital.  Are we to have CAT scanners all over the country&mdash;one in Letterkenny, another in Limerick, and so <Col N="21" /> on, all working at 20 to 25 per cent of capacity?  The reality is that there is a CAT scanner in Galway and it was put there for political reasons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No disrespect to the health board, but it was a typical mess. The total cost of the scanner in August 1981 when we gave approval, which as I said was given largely on political grounds and nothing to do with medical priority for the hospital, was £608,000 exclusive of VAT.  At the time we also gave a grant of £50,000 to provide the necessary accommodation for the hospital to house the CAT scanner.  However, the board decided, rather than build a new building for the scanner, that they would provide a new accident and emergency department to accommodate it and went away and spent £78,000.  The additional cost was met from European Social Fund moneys.  It is one of those typical messes but we are straightening it out now.</P>

      <P>The structure and methodology of the leukaemia study were decided upon in consultation with the department of community medicine and epidemiology at UCD.  The aim of the study, which commenced in October 1984, is to determine whether or not there has been an increased incidence of leukaemia along the east coast.  The data from the study are now being analysed and I have been promised a report by early April.</P>
      <P>The Down's Syndrome study involves an examination of the prevalence of this condition on the east coast as compared with the west coast.

Is it not clear in view of the total unreliability of the information we receive from British Nuclear Fuels Limited in relation to various leaks &mdash; when they say it was a small leak, that nobody suffered any radiation effects and then come along at a later stage, or sometimes only when under pressure from another group, and announce that a leak has been much more serious, as happened on two occasions recently &mdash; that more pressure needs to be brought to bear?</P>

Equally, when I met my counterpart in Northern Ireland, my serious concern was also conveyed to him.  The study which I set in train in October has taken 17 months to complete &mdash; it is a very detailed study &mdash; and will indicate the particular impact or incidence of leukaemia on the east coast, as compared with the west coast.  That report will be published in early April.  I have been pressing for it, but I am sure the Deputy will agree that, when it comes to analysing data of that nature, it cannot be rushed.</P>

I can assure the Deputy that particular care will be taken regarding those who are psycho-geriatric, very elderly and, as the Deputy knows, 109 of those patients are over 65 years of age. But the long and the short of it is that this year we can do a great deal with the 213 staff in the hospital.  We can change the whole situation there.  We are now setting about doing so.  Of course the first step is to build up the new unit for admissions in Naas General Hospital.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the way in which the present organisation of the health services leads to unnecessary and unworkable conflicts in the loyalties of local managements in their reporting relationships to their board members and to the Minister for Health and his Department as stated by him on 30 January; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the penultimate paragraph of the text which I circulated to Deputies on 30 January 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The comment reflected what I see as a growing dilemma for the chief executive officers of health boards.  They are understandably torn between loyalty to their employers, the health boards, and their duty, under section 31 of the Health Act, <Col N="30" /> 1970, to manage the services within the resources made available by the Minister to the boards.  The Deputy will note that, in the paragraph to which he refers, I acknowledge that the problem had become acute because of constraints on resources forcing a concentration upon agreeing priorities.  It is obviously difficult for the management of health boards in those circumstances to deal with the serious conflicts which arise from the differing views of representatives of various political parties, nominated professional interests, and persons appointed by local authorities who now make no financial contribution to these boards.</P>
    <P>I see this as one of the major problems in the present arrangements.  The proposals on the future structures for the planning and delivery of health services, which I will submit soon to the Government, will seek to overcome the present difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that this statement constitutes a slur on the executives and indeed members of the various health boards &mdash; people who have been endeavouring to provide a level of service with greatly reduced allocations from the Minister over the past three years?  Is the key to the problem not contained in the last part of his reply where he says they are making no financial contribution to the health services in their areas?  Is this merely a ploy by the Minister to bring control into his Department, where there will be no decentralised administration of the health services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is a matter of control or of any wish on the part of the departmental officers or myself to centralise control.  Rather is it an effort, admittedly for the first time in 15 years, to bring some degree of control into what is happening to the health services for the common good, in the national interest and in the interests of developing our health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our health board system is not working despite the fact that in this House in 1970 I spoke warmly in favour of the <Col N="31" /> establishment of the health boards by the late Erskine Childers.  I gave him my full support because the system prior to that was manifestly incapable of working, namely the local health authorities.  They were totally diffused and in total chaos. We now have to look at what is going on and try to bring about a better system.  It is not a matter of centralisation.  Basically, it is a matter of trying to establish priorities in our health services.  We are spending £1,276 million a year to the best possible advantage of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>The Deputy would agree that there is a very mixed bag.  The relationship between the health boards and the voluntary hospitals where we have funding arrangements gives rise to a good deal of confusion.  Some voluntary hospitals are quite outstanding in their work.  Some of them do not relate to the health boards in their areas.  There is great difficulty in organising the health services &mdash; for example, with regard to <Col N="32" /> some of the specialities in the Eastern Health Board area where a predominant number of the voluntary hospitals reside. I am anxious to build a better working relationship between the voluntary hospitals and the health boards.  It is for that purpose that I want to develop a relationship in the reorganisation of the services.</P>

The budgetary strategy for 1986 must be determined in the context of the available level of funds. I have advised health boards to secure reductions in expenditure as far as possible in payroll costs associated with institutional services and to protect community care programmes including services for the old and the housebound and child care services.  I am aware of the problems facing health boards in achieving both budgetary and services objectives in 1986.

Ireland's Ambassador to the Philippines, who is <Col N="34" /> normally resident in Beijing, is now in Manila looking after the safety of the Irish community and our interests.  We have had no reports of Irish citizens being in danger.  Our concerns about human rights in the Philippines have been previously expressed at the UN Commission on Human Rights.

      <P>With regard to the first part of the Deputy's question, there are of the order of 500 Irish citizens in the Phillippines of whom perhaps half or slightly more are missionaries, mainly members of the Columban Fathers, the Kiltegans, the Jesuits and the Redemptorists.  With regard to our concern on human rights, our attitude has been expressed very forcibly during the period in office of President Marcos.  It has been put in very trenchant terms by our representative in Geneva, Mr. Hayes, when addressing the Convention on Human Rights.

With regard to the specific question raised by Deputy Lenihan, he will be aware by some previous answers given in the House by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of our concern. That concern has been expressed through the Philippine Embassy in London, through our missions in Australia and in the United States.  It was the intention of our ambassador in Manila to raise the matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Philippines this week.  That was one of the reasons for his visit to Manila.

Our concerns for democratic rights were evident, first of all, in the statement in advance of the election when we expressed our hope, determination and desire that the elections would be carried out in a fair manner and be above board.  Our subsequent expression was in partnership with our collegues in the Community when we expressed dismay that that was not so.  Clearly, we will be anxious that any new administration which may emerge will adhere to the principles of democratic and human rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am very pleased as Minister for Social Welfare to introduce in this House the Bill to establish the Combat Poverty Agency.  As the House is aware, the Bill was introduced in Seanad Éireann by my predecessor and passed all Stages in that House after a detailed and thorough debate.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there has been a lengthy debate going back over a number of years on the question of combating poverty in Ireland.  I do not pretend to be fully <i>au fait,</i> as yet, with the background to that debate and therefore I will be listening with great interest to the contributions of Deputies during the discussion of this Bill.  All of us have, from our experience as public representatives, our own views on the question of poverty and its extent and there are a number of Deputies who have had very direct involvement in previous initiatives in the area of poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention in particular in this context Deputy Frank Cluskey who, in his period as Parliamentary Secretary in the Department of Social Welfare from 1973 onwards, was instrumental in the setting up of the Combat Poverty Committee in Ireland and in the campaign leading up to the adoption of the first European poverty programme.  A considerable amount of preparatory work in connection with the setting up of a permanent Combat Poverty Agency was also done by Deputy Mary Flaherty during her period in the Department of Social Welfare in 1981-82.  In effect, we are now building on the work which was done during those years and re-establishing on a more formal basis the structures <Col N="158" /> which previously existed and which were responsible for a very wide range of initiatives in the poverty field.  Essentially it is experience gained in the operation of the first poverty programme and the recommendations made by the national committee in their final report that form the basis for the Government's decision to restore the combat poverty programme to its central place in Government policy.</P>
    <P>As a prelude to setting up a new Combat Poverty Agency, the Interim Board of the Combat Poverty Organisation were established in March 1984 to submit recommendations with regard to the structure, membership, staffing etc. of such an agency and its detailed terms of reference, bearing in mind, <i>inter alia,</i> what role the agency should have with regard to drawing up in accordance with the Government's programme an anti-poverty plan within the context of national economic and social planning. The interim board submitted a report to the then Minister containing detailed recommendations for the new agency and the proposals now before the House are based essentially on the board's proposals.</P>
    <P>One of the board's primary concerns was the need for anti-poverty policy to be an intergral part of national economic and social planning and they recommended that the new agency should have a direct involvement in the planning process so as to help in determining priorities for effective action in the fight against poverty.</P>
    <P>This function of policy advice is one of the four main functions proposed for the new agency as outlined in section 4 (1) of the Bill now before the House, namely</P>
    <P>advising and making recommendations to the Minister on all aspects of economic and social planning in the State.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes said that in Government concerns and interests of social policy come second to economic policy. It is impossible, however, to draw a clear distinction between what is economic policy and what is social policy.  For example, the biggest problem facing this <Col N="159" /> country at present is the level of unemployment which is a major social and an economic problem.  If we are to devise adequate policies to tackle poverty on an overall basis we must address all aspects of Government activity to see where Government policies and programmes impact on poor people and how these policies and programmes might be revised the more effectively to address the problem of poverty.</P>
    <P>One of the main advantages in setting up the Combat Poverty Agency is that they will provide a forum for the examination of Government policies and the policies of other agencies and organisations and make available a co-ordinated input into the policy-making process.  I believe that the legislation before the House will enable the new agency to carry out adequately their functions in this area and I, as the responsible Minister, will do whatever I can to see that the agency have an effective voice in the policy-making process.</P>
    <P>Closely related to the task of policy advice which is given to the new agency is that of research into poverty.  This could be said to be a necessary prerequisite to policy advice and accordingly another of the main functions of the agency is:</P>
    <P>the examination of the nature, causes and extent of poverty in the State and for that purpose the promotion, commission and interpretation of research</P>
    <P>This is in itself a difficult area and one in which it is often not possible to reach agreement on even the most basic concepts. For example, surveys have shown that a sizeable number of people believe that there is no real poverty in Ireland anymore.  If poverty is defined in purely financial terms, there is no doubt that people on social welfare payments, for example, are receiving more money in real terms now than they were years ago. It is very difficult to say, however, what is a reasonable or acceptable level of <Col N="160" /> income to aim at in our social welfare system.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the views of the Commission on Social Welfare who have had to address this fundamental question in the context of their deliberations. There is no doubt, however, that while rates of payments have increased appreciably in real terms over the years, nevertheless many people find it difficult to cope with their commitments and there is an increasing amount of what might be called customer dissatisfaction with the system.  I would be concerned about such dissatisfaction and that there should be adequate mechanisms for independent assessment of the effectiveness of the system, particularly as it affects people in the greatest need.  I see the Combat Poverty Agency as having a central role here.</P>
    <P>Poverty, of course, is not related to lack of income alone but also to low levels of education, poor health conditions, poor nutritional standards, insufficient housing, job insecurity, poor environment, social isolation and so on.  Despite the advances that have been made in many areas of State policy we all know that there are many people in our society who are deprived in one way or another. We are all aware of this and of the concerns voiced by persons who are involved in this area &mdash; people representing voluntary organisations, the Churches, statutory bodies, academic institutions and so on.  There is a need, however, for detailed research into the different aspects of poverty before any final conclusions can be drawn as to its causes.</P>
    <P>I know that some people would say that there has been too much research into poverty and that what is needed now is action and not further research.  When one looks at it, however, there is still a lack of basic information, of statistical data and of knowledge in general of many aspects of poverty.  One of the primary functions of the new agency will be to increase public understanding of why people are poor and the consequences for individuals and for society as a whole. Without public understanding and support change will be difficult to achieve. <Col N="161" /> The more the characteristics of the poor are identified, the more light can be thrown on the process by which people end up in poverty.  This is not an easy task but in order to decide what we need to do to combat poverty we must first of all have adequate information on the causes, characteristics and extent of poverty and we must attempt to convince society in general of the need for the policies which we intend to pursue and that they will be effective.  Therefore, we need a body of information which is clear, understandable and publicly acceptable.</P>
    <P>The third main function of the new agency as set out in section 4 (1) of the Bill is what might be called the action role of the agency, namely:</P>
    <P>the initiation of measures aimed at overcoming poverty in the State and the evaluation of such measures.</P>
    <P>This was, perhaps, the main role carried out by the first poverty committee 1974-1980. What strikes one immediately looking back at that period is the very large number of projects and schemes which were undertaken by the national Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty, as known.  Some of these projects were very successful, some were not so successful and many ran into problems and difficulties.  The final report of the national committee gives a very interesting resumé of the various activities which were undertaken and information can also be gleaned from other sources.  The committee organised and operated a number of projects directly while others were contracted out to different organisations and that fact together with the large number of projects which were involved makes it difficult to draw overall conclusions from the projects as a whole. As far as the new agency are concerned, the interim board's view on this occasion was that they should, as far as possible, avoid becoming involved in directly running projects but should assist in the establishment of action projects by other appropriate groups.  Any projects which the agency run should be in the nature of demonstration projects which would be experimental and which would be so <Col N="162" /> structured as to enable the agency to withdraw from direct involvement after a certain period.</P>
    <P>I agree with this general approach. Obviously the agency will have to draw up their priorities in terms of the amount of their overall resources which they can devote to initiating or assisting action projects.  It is very important, however, that the agency should not become just another source of funds for local projects. The difficulty in many respects for local projects is the variety of possible funding sources which already exist and the addition of another one to the list would not serve any useful purpose in the long run. The agency are being viewed in this way in many quarters.  The agency will have to be selective in regard to direct funding of action projects and not lose sight of their other functions in response to the pressure which will undoubtedly be put on them by groups and projects to provide immediate funding for their particular area of activity.</P>
    <P>The interim board stressed that whatever actions are engaged in by the agency, and I take this to include activities of other groups which are funded by the agency as well as the agency's activities, arrangements should be made for the evaluation of these activities on an ongoing basis.  I strongly support this, as only in this way will it be possible for the correct conclusions to be drawn from these activities to the benefit of similar activities and of policy in this area.</P>
    <P>I see the agency, therefore, as having to be selective in regard to the sorts of projects in which they become involved and ensuring that the resources available for this purpose are channelled in the most effective way.  Already there are a number of projects which will become the responsibility of the agency when they are established.  These are the eight projects from this country which have been selected for participation in the second European Community Poverty Programme.  The first European programme covered more or less the same period as the former national committee in this country &mdash; 1974 to 1980 &mdash; and indeed the Irish Government were <Col N="163" /> instrumental in having that European programme adopted.  It is gratifying to note that the Irish Government on this occasion also were instrumental in having the second programme adopted and that the council decision on the programme was taken during the Irish Presidency of the Council in December 1984.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about the European programme.  The programme is backed by a Community budget of 25 million ECU, around £17.5 million, over four years, the bulk of which will be devoted to supporting actionresearch projects in favour of deprived groups or deprived areas.  A total of 61 projects have been selected across the Community and some 18 million ECU, £12.5 million, has been earmarked for direct subventions to these projects. Community support is at the level of 50 per cent of the cost of projects in most cases, 55 per cent in exceptional cases.</P>
    <P>The eight Irish projects included in the programme are being financed to the extent of 55 per cent by the Community, the remaining 45 per cent being met largely by the Government with, in some cases, a contribution by projects themselves. Over the four years of the programme the total amount of Community funding to the Irish projects will be approximately £1.3 million, while the Irish Government will provide approximately £1 million.</P>
    <P>The programme is a relatively small one in financial terms but it has the potential to be of major significance in the impact which it will have on Government policies in the member states of Europe. Before being selected for inclusion in the EC programme, projects went through a rigorous selection process both at the national level and the European level.  In this connection I would like to pay tribute to the work of the Interim Board of the Combat Poverty Organisation under their chairperson, Noreen Kearney, who performed the initial selection and did so very successfully.  The fact that eight Irish projects were finally selected by the Commission is a tribute to the high quality of all the Irish projects and I am <Col N="164" /> satisfied that we have eight excellent projects which will make a major contribution to the overall programme.</P>
    <P>The Government are co-financing the projects with the Community and will be taking a very direct interest in the projects.  It is very important that the results of the programme at an Irish level should be closely monitored so that whatever lessons can be drawn from the experience of the programme are made available in such a way that they can be absorbed into and become part of anti-poverty policy generally.  The Combat Poverty Agency will have a central role in this area and pending the establishment of the agency the interim board will continue to have responsibility.  The board have already done a considerable amount of work to ensure the smooth introduction of the programme and I am sure that over the next four years there will be an excellent working relationship between the projects and the agency and a relationship which will have major benefits for both sides.</P>
    <P>The Irish projects which have been selected for the European programme all involve local communities and groups trying to address problems which they have identified in their own areas and doing something about these problems. There is a very significant community development component in these projects. Community development in the sense of a planned programme of activities whereby people combine with their fellow citizens to establish community needs and solve them through action is an aspect of anti-poverty policy which is identified in the interim board's report as being of major importance.  The need for a significant and well planned community development component is given explicit recognition in the Bill, where it is envisaged that the new agency would be a resource centre for community development in relation to poverty.  As such the agency would encourage facilities for training in community development, stimulate evaluation and research and promote initiatives and experiment in community work.</P>
    <P>A resource agency of this kind could <Col N="165" /> provide a worthwhile service to voluntary organisations and communities and also to central and local authorities and statutory bodies.  The agency in any event will need to develop a close working relationship with local authorities, health boards and other relevant statutory bodies and ensure that the efforts of the agency, the statutory authorities and the local organisations were welded together to provide an integrated response to the needs of the poor.</P>
    <P>The fourth main function of the Combat Poverty Agency as outlined in section 4 (a) of the Bill is &ldquo;the promotion of greater public understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty in the State and the measures necessary to overcome such poverty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I mentioned already the need for research into the causes and extent of poverty in Ireland and the need for the results of such research to be made available in an understandable way.  The notion of poverty itself is, I feel, a somewhat vague one to many people and it will be important for the new agency to &ldquo;operationalise&rdquo; the concept and make it meaningful in concrete terms.  It is important also that the facts in relation to poverty emerging from research etc. are got across in an effective way.  There will be a need to make use of all the techniques which are now available in the communications field to ensure that the results of the anti-poverty programme are made available to the public.</P>
    <P>These are the main thoughts which I want to express in introducing this debate.  There will be an opportunity on Committee Stage to discuss in more detail the individual provisions of the Bill.  The proposals in the Bill endeavour to take account of all that has happened in this area over the past decade.  There have been different approaches reflected in different policies adopted by successive Governments.  The approach now put forward seeks to draw on the most positive features of all of these different views and approaches.  To be effective the new agency will have to have a wide degree of support in the community and I hope that it will be possible to achieve a wide <Col N="166" /> measure of agreement in relation to the proposals now put forward.  I look forward to the contributions to the debate from all sides and I have pleasure in recommending the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on her most recent appointment and I assure her of my full co-operation from this side of the House.  I will do my best to keep her going in the right direction, as it were, without in any way obstructing her.</P>
      <P>It is only fair to say that poverty as such is a subject which is discussed too infrequently in this House.  Its existence in our midst is a reflection on all of us as public representatives.  Unfortunately, it appears that it has been forgotten almost completely over the past number of years.  The limited information available to us &mdash; unfortunately, there is a dearth of information on the subject &mdash; is an indication of the lack of interest in the problem which has been shown by various groups.</P>
      <P>It is important to reflect on and refer back to the paper read by Séamus Ó Cinnéide to the famous Kilkenny conference in 1971.  From analysis which he had carried out at that time, he concluded that one in every four people in this State experienced poverty in their daily lives. At that time more than a million people were severely deprived and quite clearly that figure has escalated since then.  The increasing numbers availing of social welfare payments particularly over the last two or three years indicate clearly that many more families are now suffering from the effects of poverty.  Between 1976 and 1980 an EC programme for the investigation of the extent of poverty in the various member states was undertaken and it is important for us to reflect on what assessments that EC programme produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as evaluating the degree of poverty there was also an evaluation into the causation and the effects it produced. The report showed quite distressing statistics. For example, taking a poverty line of 50 per cent of average net income in each country, the report disclosed that 23.1 per cent of households in Ireland <Col N="167" /> were below the poverty line.  This was by far the highest in the EC.  It was followed by Italy with 21.8 per cent and France and Luxembourg both with 14 per cent. This was an evaluation of the relative poverty in each country and these figures confirmed clearly that not only was Ireland the poorest country in the EC then but the proportion of the population in Ireland who were poor in relative terms was the largest in the Community.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's decision, belated as it is, to make some attempt to remedy the problem of poverty in our country, but I am afraid it is an indictment of this Government's performance that they have been in office now for over three years and, despite all their pious platitudes prior to the last election in their Programme for Government, it is only now that they are appearing to make a genuine gesture towards dealing with our problem of poverty.  However, belated as this effort is, I assure the Minister that we will do everything we can to help to produce a Bill which will encompass all the capacities and abilities that can be provided to alleviate the problem.</P>
    <P>I have gone through the Bill and one thing that concerns me is that an interminable length of time should not be spent in compiling reports and details, that the whole object of the Bill should not be just to have groups of researchers and consultants compiling reports with no action.  I accept that, whilst one must have research, reports and advisers, it is important that their work is directed to a rapid solution of the problem and I hope the Minister will ensure that this takes place.  I am slightly worried that there appears to be no definitive provision in the Bill for finances, but we can discuss that later.  The members of my party, Fianna Fáil, have always been proud of their achievements in combating poverty, particularly in the area of social justice.</P>
    <P>It is only right that we should remind the House of the total expenditure, outside social welfare payments, in which we involved ourselves in combating poverty. The Coalition Government committed <Col N="168" /> themselves to a total expenditure of £2.7 million between the years 1974 and 1977. Out of this £880,000 was contributed by the EC so, effectively, the Government's contribution was £1.8 million.  In 1982, when Fianna Fáil were in office for a relatively short time, they formed the National Development Corporation and £2 million was provided in the budget of that year for the work of that corporation. Also, in the past going back to 1967, Fianna Fáil introduced imaginative and innovative schemes in the social welfare and health areas.  We introduced the free electricity and free travel schemes, retirement pensions, invalidity pensions, death grants, deserted wife's allowances and pay related insurance schemes.  We improved and extended the fuel scheme to the entire country.  We brought in the new maternity allowance scheme for women in employment which was particularly beneficial to women on lower incomes.  In 1980, for the first time in the history of the State, we introduced a double payment at Christmas for those on long term social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>In relation to health areas, we introduced the choice of doctor and general medical services scheme, the refund of drugs scheme, the constant care of the handicapped children scheme, the mobility allowance scheme.  In terms of social welfare payments alone, in the years 1980 to 1982 when we had authority to do so, we granted a 25 per cent increase in social welfare payments from April in each of those years to social welfare recipients. This far exceeded the inflation figure of the day.  Unfortunately, in the past three years the Government have resorted to a tactic about which I have spoken on many occasions in this House and which I have debated at length with the former Minister for Social Welfare.  It is that the meagre payments and increases now being granted to social welfare recipients do not operate until the following July.</P>
    <P>In 1983 the operative date was the first week in July; in 1984 it was the second week; and now it has gone to the third week in July.  That means these increases, which supposedly are in line with inflation, in effect are not because of the delay <Col N="169" /> in payment.  Almost one quarter of the year elapses before they become operative, yet those who receive them have had to bear the increased cost of essential goods imposed as a result of indirect taxation. The unfortunate welfare recipients have been relatively worse off, having had less disposable money.</P>
    <P>Poverty may be defined in absolute or in real terms.  An absolute definition sees it primarily in terms of a lack of resources to meet some basic minimum level of physical need.  A minimum income level necessary for subsistence on a poverty line is established.  This is primarily based on research such as nutritional surveys, or on Government legislation on minimum income levels and any person or family having an income below the established poverty line is deemed to be in poverty. Relative definitions of poverty, on the other hand, define persons as poor in relation to others in society.  The poor are therefore those whose incomes and opportunities are so far removed from the rest of societies that they cannot attain a standard of living which is deemed acceptable in society.</P>
    <P>A relative approach focuses more on inequality.  The EC has defined poverty in its social action programme as follows: &ldquo;Individuals and families may be considered in general to be in poverty when they have a command of resources so deficient that they are excluded from ordinary living patterns, customs and activities of the member states in which they live.&rdquo;  This is obviously a relative definition since it defines the poor as being those who are least well off in relation to the rest of society.</P>
    <P>For many reasons poverty runs at a very high level in Ireland and there is no doubt, from that European report, that we are the poorest nation within the European Community.  That may be because we came rather late into the Community to achieve the economic growth and development enjoyed by the rest of the Community.  The historical fact that we were under British rule until 1922 also had a major effect in hindering our economic growth and development.</P>
    <P>Our increasing population trends now <Col N="170" /> tend to place a heavy demand on services and resources.  Fortunately, during the past 20 years or so there has been a considerable State investment in social services and benefits.  We have clearly attempted to follow the example of the United Kingdom welfare state system. To some extent this has been a positive and definite contributory factor in alleviating the problems in some sections of our community.  At present, trends towards poverty development in Irish community life are due primarily to a number of different unrelated factors.  We have our increasing population structure which places an increasing demand on services which are restricted by the limited resources available.  Progressive health care programmes and the expansion and development of our health services have ensured that longevity is now clearly established as the normal pattern.  Probably this trend will continue and, from all the evidence available to us, our older population will increase by a further 10 per cent over the next ten years.  This is obviously an advantageous and welcome development and we all hope to reach a ripe old age.</P>
    <P>Since we have an increasing population of older people, many of whom live alone, they have to live within the very limited resources of the State-supplied pension system.  Despite the fact that commendable efforts were made by various Governments, particularly by the Fianna Fáil Governments in the years 1980, 1981 and 1982, where very substantial increases were given to old age pensioners, it is only right and fair to say that with modern high costings the present payments are inadequate.  So future Governments must ensure not just that annual increases match the annual inflation rate but outreach inflation so that in real terms such increases provide old people with better standards of living.  No one is more entitled to that than people who have given lives of hard work to the country.</P>
    <P>Another serious problem affecting us is the scourge of increasing unemployment which has had a major impact on poverty development.  The world recession was <Col N="171" /> primarily to blame, and as in all small open economies it was only natural that Ireland would become seriously involved because of a fall-off in world demand for goods and services which severely eroded our industrial base and caused loss of employment opportunities.  However, I do not think all the blame for our high unemployment then could be levelled at world recession.  Government policies tended to have a contracting effect on industrial development and job creation. Particularly since this Government came to office there has been a total obsession with bookkeeping and getting the figures right, which has had a markedly damaging effect on industrial development and consequent job creation.  Our system of taxation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the creation of poverty, its causes.  Our present tax system is causing major deprivation. Poverty does not fall from the sky into our laps: it must be created.  I am not trying to be insulting or difficult.  You seem to be misinterpreting what I am trying to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get back to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an obsession with the theory that employers have a duty, an obligation to create jobs for the sake of providing jobs.  That is fallacious. We must restructure our taxation codes to provide incentives for would-be employers and to provide hard working employees with more take home pay. There is now a new poor in Ireland, the large group of people in the lower middle <Col N="172" /> class whose incomes place them just above eligibility for any State benefits, such as medical cards.  That group are trying to provide the best educational standards they can for their children, which they probably have to pay for. Those people probably have mortgages on their houses and hire purchase payments due on their cars.  They are taxed to death by Government policies.  That group are growing in numbers.  Most people do not realise they exist.  Only they, in the privacy of their homes, know how badly off they are.  The State must identify that group and deal with the awful uphill struggle the new poor have to try to cope with.  The eligibility limits for the provision of basic health care should be extended as a primary consideration for Governments.  Many of those people cannot afford to get sick and if they get sick they cannot afford to buy the medicines which would cure them. The medical card system is a major improvement on the old dispensary system, a relic of the poor laws, but it still needs improvement.</P>
      <P>Poverty can be clearly identified among the elderly and the unemployed. In 1981 there were 369,000 elderly people in this State, those above 65 years of age. They represented 10.7 per cent of the population.  In the decade between 1971 and 1981 the elderly population increased by 12 per cent.  It is projected that in the next ten years there will be an increase of 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those aged 75 years and over represent a 4 per cent of the entire population and 36 per cent of all elderly people in the population.  There is a tendency for the elderly to be more heavily represented in rural Ireland than in urban areas.  This tendency is quite marked in some western counties &mdash; Leitrim, Mayo and Roscommon. There are a number of differences between the housing circumstances of the elderly compared with the rest of the population.  One might ask what housing has to do with poverty but it is part and parcel of a person's standard of living. The elderly are much more likely to be owner/occupiers and they are also likely to live in considerably older housing <Col N="173" /> units.  The older houses tend to be less well equipped with basic amenities than newer houses.  Some years ago a group of medical practitioners carried out a medico-social survey of the elderly in an urban general practice.  They concluded that in many cases housing was substandard and unsuitable.  They found that 5 per cent of the elderly attending at a centre city medical practice had no indoor toilets or hot water.  They also concluded that there were substantial indicators of deprivation among the elderly in terms of their standard of living and general life style.  As politicians, we must have a positive commitment to help the elderly because we owe it to them for what they have contributed to this country.</P>
    <P>In an article published by Brittan in 1981 he reckoned that the economic cost of unemployment to the individual was a halving of his disposable income without any reduction in the peer and advertising pressure to consume.  One can only hypothesise about the effects of unemployment in general in terms of deprivation socially, in monetary terms and the psychology of being unemployed.  All these factors have to be considered very seriously.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there is a severe breach between the conditioned exceptions of the young and the social economic realities to which they must adapt if, after a full and comprehensive ecucation they are to find a job.  This can be the basis for many problems.  Frustration leads to aggressive behaviour of one kind or another and this disruptive behaviour often reflects itself through crime.</P>
    <P>The plight of families particularly those on long term unemployment assistance is something we are inclined to undermine. The fact that these families are so deprived is evident but there is some confusion about their financial deprivation and this is sometimes ignored.  Some people say that financially people are better off unemployed than employed.  That is not true.  The people who say this are always those who are better off and such ideas should not be bandied about.  If anyone <Col N="174" /> hears this said, he should contradict it because the facts are there for all to see.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to maintain an ordinary standard of living if a family is in receipt of long term unemployment assistance only.  Out of our 240,000 unemployed 166,000 are on unemployment assistance. This clearly indicates that all these families are suffering great stress and strain. There is no point expounding an enormous amount of rhetoric about this subject if the levels of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit remain inadequate.  I hope this Government and future Governments will take cognisance of this fact.  All the research workers and all the consultants on poverty in the world will not alter the fact that these people are receiving inadequate incomes.</P>
    <P>Among a certain section of the community there is a hostility towards the unemployed and a lack of sympathy for their needs and demands.  Not too long ago a Fine Gael Member of the European Parliament suggested on a number of occasions that the unemployed should be conscripted, and this view was echoed by some of the wealthier members of society.  All I can say about people who express these views is that for some reason they despise the unemployed and the poor.  Obviously they know nothing about how these people live; they have never seen the inside of an employment exchange, or had to stand on a dole queue; they were never subjected to the humiliation of having no job and waking up each morning with nothing to do. Many thousands of our unemployed would give their eyes for a job.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago Fianna Fáil introduced the supplementary welfare scheme as a replacement for home assistance contributions.  This was a marked improvement.  However, despite the fact that the supplementary welfare allowance scheme has improved the situation, there are still many inadequacies in it and there is room for great improvement in its administration.  There should be more publicity about the benefits to be gained under this scheme.  On the other hand, I <Col N="175" /> believe there should be better accommodation and privacy for those who wish to obtain payments of this kind from community welfare officers.  I believe the community welfare officers should be given greater flexibility so that they can take account of increasing demands at particular times and provide extra special payments when they are needed.  I hope that those who are employed by the Combat Poverty Agency will take a look at this.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a problem which is almost ignored throughout the country. I refer to the so called poverty trap.  I have made various comments on this. The term &ldquo;poverty trap&rdquo; was introduced in the early seventies to describe the situation whereby people at work could find themselves unable to increase their income after tax, even if their gross earnings pre-tax increased.  A person's take home pay after tax despite the fact that the particular person got an increase would actually be less than before that person got an increase.  I believe this problem is caused by the way our taxation is imposed.  The poverty trap really results from the lack of co-ordination of the way in which benefits are withdrawn and taxes are imposed.  Anomalies can arise easily when things are run in a disjointed fashion.  Poverty traps are much more likely to exist in Ireland than in the UK.</P>
    <P>Our main means-tested schemes are spread around four Government Departments. Those Government Departments are involved in administering the income related taxes and benefits for families. The Department of Health regulate how eligibility limits for medical cards are decided.  The Department of Social Welfare decide on child benefits and unemployment benefits.  The Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners deal with income tax and pay-related insurance and the Department of the Environment deal with local authority dwelling rents.  By contrast, in the UK medical services are universally available and local authority rents are linked to social security through the housing <Col N="176" /> benefit scheme.  It is quite clear from the way we have it spread around those four Departments that there is much more scope for anomalies and poor co-ordination than in the UK.</P>
    <P>Another factor related to the poverty trap outside a diminution in the final income is that as a consequence of an increase in pay, which can ultimately end up as a reduced final income after tax, a loss of benefit in kind may also be involved. If a person is just on the borderline limit and is just barely under the eligibility limit for medical card eligibility, then if that person gets an apparent increase in income that will result in him being deemed ineligible for medical card eligibility he will lose his medical card.  It is very hard to quantify that loss.  It can only be quantified when a person becomes ill.  Many of those people live in local authority dwellings and since they make their payments on a differential rent basis the differential rents also increase so that they can end up with quite substantial losses in terms of loss of income on the one hand and loss of benefits in kind, such as medical card eligibility, on the other hand, and having to pay increased rents.  I hope the Minister and the Combat Poverty Agency will look very seriously at how this type of poverty trap can be eliminated.  At a later stage I hope to give every co-operation to the Minister in helping her to produce an excellent Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AliceGlenn" hpid="Mrs. Glenn Mrs. Glenn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and wish it a speedy passage through the House so that it may come into operation without any undue delay because there is a great need for it.  The Combat Poverty Agency should become a national forum whose central role should be to identify the causes and extent of poverty in this State and initiate measures to combat them.  I hope the Government will give a commitment to put into effect the economic and social policies necessary to address the problems in a meaningful way once they are identified.  I believe for the effective operation of this agency there must be harmony between the Minister <Col N="177" /> and the committee, working in co-operation with each other in order to deliver the service they were appointed to deliver to those who need it.</P>
      <P>We have been extremely fortunate in Ireland in always having a multiplicity of charitable voluntary organisations who work tirelessly to alleviate the worst effects of poverty on many of our people. I hope when the time comes to set up the committee that the Minister will keep in mind the vast reservoir of experience of the people in those organisations and that many of them will be included on the committee which will be appointed to deal with this service.  If we neglect to incorporate that we will be cutting off a source of great wisdom and experience.</P>
      <P>I will take the St. Vincent de Paul Society as an example, although there are many others, of the dedication of these organisations. In dealing with the relief of people suffering from the great effects of poverty the St. Vincent de Paul Society undertook a systematic study of the needs of those people and they produced a book entitled <i>Old and Alone</i> which gave their policy makers a valuable insight into the causes of deprivation and how they should go about tackling the problem.  I believe the Combat Poverty Agency could have a very significant role to play in this area as an investigative body gathering and analysing data and bringing it to the attention of the Government. The effect of some Government policies, economic and social, can sometimes have opposite effect to that envisaged when they were created.  This is why I think that body would have an important role to play, in that they would then be carrying out a duty that nobody at present in this State has the capacity to do, that is to analyse the effects of some of the legislation we pass through this House, which while meaning to do what is right, good and beneficial very often turns out to have an adverse effect on those we are trying to assist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anti-family taxation has been the policy of successive Governments since 1955 when the tax free allowance for a child was £100.  Had that allowance kept <Col N="178" /> pace with inflation the tax free allowance for a child today would be £1,200.  Instead in the recent budget there was a total abolition of the tax free allowance for children of families based on marriage. Much of the poverty obtaining today has arisen through Government policies denying families their capability of taking care of children and the household.  It is easy for people to smirk at this kind of thing &mdash; I have said it repeatedly &mdash; nevertheless it is a fact and the statistics are there to prove it.  If we are to attempt to combat poverty we must first analyse its cause and the effect of legislation passed through this House.</P>
    <P>While removing the tax free allowance from the breadwinner we gave unmarried persons with one child a £2,000 per annum tax free allowance &mdash; that included an increase of £100 in the 1986 budget &mdash; making up for the abolition of the ordinary child tax free allowance. This constitutes positive discrimination against families.  It is an example of where I believe the Combat Poverty Agency could play a positive role, that is if the Government of the day are prepared to allow them do so and to publish their findings.</P>
    <P>At present we are seeing the feminisation of poverty.  For example, in 1985 there were 900 applicants on Dublin Corporation housing lists.  They were single parents, mainly women with children; there are very few men single parents. That constitutes almost three-quarters of the entire applications for housing in Dublin Corporation.  Therein I see the feminisation of poverty.  While we may give such people units of accommodation they are continuing to live in stressful circumstances.  This is an area that must be examined for several reasons.  Because there is no alternative to putting such people into one area of our housing stock we are now creating other problems where there is already massive poverty and deprivation.  As I said yesterday at a meeting of the city council, we have had to demolish the entire inner city.  Because of all of those in need being put into the inner city at one stage, the inner city became a no-go area <i>vis-á-vis</i> the forces <Col N="179" /> of law and order.  There was no alternative to taking them from that area and rebuilding.  We are recreating that position by placing so many of these young women in that kind of situation, all together in one identifiable area.  That is poverty at its worst, they being identified as a deprived section of the community, when their's and their children's chances of ever taking a step up the rung of that ladder are remote.  Those are the kinds of problems I would hope that Combat Poverty Agency would take account of.</P>
    <P>Another matter in need of urgent attention is the overlap at health board level with regard to social welfare assistance. This has been the bane in the life of officers of the health boards endeavouring to deliver that service.  Unfortunately the most recent figures I have in this respect refer to 1983.  One can visualise the increases that would have taken place since then.  According to the officers where such social welfare assistance was paid, within the Eastern Health Board region, there were 8,718 recipients. In addition 800 such people needed assistance in the payment of rent, 600 in regard to the payment of electricity and gas and 500 in regard to clothing, all very basic needs.  Such people have to travel from Billy to Jack, adopting a begging bowl mentality, leading to a feeling of rejection.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the Combat Poverty Agency have been established.  I hope we will be able to request them to grapple with that problem, analyse it and establish what such families need in order to subsist without having to run around several different agencies begging for the bare necessities of life.  Rather we should be able to co-ordinate our efforts in such a way that they would not have to do that.  I am hoping the Minister will take account of that matter.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister refer to some grants available for projects from European sources.  I hope one of those projects will be an analysis of the extent and depth of poverty in this State, establishing the totality of the problem and how best it can be coped with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" /> In yesterday's <i>The Irish Times</i> there was a headline to the effect that deserted wives and single parents were costing the State £60 million.  I deal with the inner city.  I know from my clinics, from my meetings with people, with the parents of some of these unfortunate unmarried mothers, that they do not thank us at all for what we are doing to them.  I have been told that we are rendering it attractive for young girls to become unmarried mothers.  I believe the reason for that is that young girls leaving school at 16 have no status at all in this State, they are non-persons, they do not qualify for anything. Many of them of whom I have knowledge come from homes in which there is already much unemployment.  Therefore, having no source of income whatever, they are driven to desperation.</P>
    <P>I visited a boy's school in the inner city just before Christmas.  The principal of that school told me that he was aware of young men in that area being earmarked to become fathers of children of these young girls who were deliberately taking the decision they would have a child because it would set them up and give them a status.  The problems for the State inherent in that concept, for the future of the family and stability of the State, are horrendous for those who take the trouble to analyse it.  We are told there are 11,300 unmarried mothers and 9,000 deserted wives.  The problem of the unmarried mother could be alleviated if we gave these young girls some kind of recognition some type of support, rather than leaving them penniless.  Because the State, through its policies, has militated against the family, many families are now pretending desertion because that puts them on to a handy £80 or £90 a week.  I know, and every other public representative in this House knows, that there is great fraud taking place in that area, that the so-called deserted wife is not entirely alone, though she may be for part of the day.  Other Deputies must have the same knowledge as I have garnered from my clinics with regard to what is taking place in this respect.</P>
    <P>It is true to say, as Deputy McCarthy already said, that ignorance is the poverty <Col N="181" /> trap.  That applies on a personal level, at community level and, indeed, because of legislation we have seen in the recent past at State level.  If it is as simple as that, then the agency should not have much difficulty in coming to terms with it.  They should approach it from the point of trying to educate.</P>
    <P>There are a few things in the Bill which cause me some concern.  I raise these because of the effects of the recent retention tax which was introduced in the last budget upon the voluntary agencies who have done such tremendous work over the years.  We are setting up an agency to combat poverty.  I should like the Minister to indicate what his intentions are regarding taxation.  Will this agency be liable to income tax or corporation tax in respect of their income or resources?  Will gifts to the agency be liable for capital gains tax?  Could there be a tax benefit for a donor of funds to the agency?  It is essential that these questions are answered during the course of the passage of this Bill through the House.  From the volume of correspondence I have had, I am aware, that dire consequences will be the end result in the delivery of services from many worthy charitable organisations.  So much of the resources on which they depend will now be denied them and they will be taken into the tax net.  As I said at the outset, I wish the Bill a speedy passage through the House. I hope the Minister will take account of the role which I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I had previously and still have a great interest in the area covered by this Bill, the Combat Poverty Agency Bill.  In the first instance I criticised the Government and the Minister for the enormous delay in bringing this Bill into the House.  One of the first steps taken by this Government when they assumed office was to abolish the National Community Development Agency.  If we go through the two Bills we will find they are the same all the way through, line for line, with a few things jumbled up here and there.  We have had to wait three and a half years to have a poverty agency Bill before the House.  Obviously, before it <Col N="182" /> is enacted another long time will have passed.</P>
      <P>There is nothing new in this Bill.  It has dropped the National Social Services Board.  That has gone out on its own.  The Government could have continued with the National Community Development Agency if they were genuinely interested in the work of the agency.  One must ask the question: was it a genuine interest which the Government had in this area or was it a hypocritical exercise or a delaying tactic which denied the poor both the development agency and four years of funding at £2 million a year?</P>
      <P>In 1982 £2 million was allocated by the then Fianna Fáil Government.  As soon as this Government came into office they wiped out that £2 million and started to talk about agencies and alternatives. They brought back a small proportion in grants which they gave to voluntary agencies.  The National Community Development Agency, now called the Combat Poverty Agency, lost four years of funding.  The Government set aside £8 million.  I do not know how keen the Minister for Social Welfare was on that proposition, but I do know that between himself, the Minister for Finance and the Cabinet as a whole, they set aside the funding that was available and continued to do so for four years.  I accuse the Government of playing politics with poverty.  That has been the case for the past three and a half years.</P>
      <P>The Minister was very careful to mention the early days of the combat poverty pilot studies, up to the time Deputy Cluskey and Deputy Mary Flaherty were involved in them.  Deputy Hussey now says she will build on the work done in that period.  What happened in between?  Was the Minister not aware that in the House on 1 June 1982, as the then Minister for Health and Social Welfare, I introduced the Second Stage of the National Community Development Agency Bill of which this Bill is almost an exact replica.  That can be seen in more detail on Committee Stage.  As reported in the Official Report, volume 335, column 653 I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="183" /> The need for the Bill arises out of the Government's commitment to establish a National Community Development Agency on a statutory basis.  The agency will have wide-ranging powers to promote and support community development, self-help and community activity.</P>
    <P>In addition, as indicated by the Taoiseach in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 23 March last, the agency will carry out the work which was to have been performed by the &ldquo;agency to combat poverty&rdquo; proposed by the previous administration.</P>
    <P>That agency to combat poverty existed in the period between two administrations. That very short-lived Government of 1981 got together the work that had been done previously by myself and my predecessors. They came up with the idea of the Combat Poverty Agency.  It had not been approved at Cabinet level but was not far away from that stage.  I then brought forward a comprehensive Bill. As reported in volume 335, column 654, of the Official Report of 1 June 1982, on second stage of the National Community Development Agency Bill, 1982, I said:</P>
    <P>Our Government have already demonstrated their commitment to the success of the agency by making available a sum of £2 million to it in 1982.</P>
    <P>Deputies are saying the same things now about the need for community development, about poverty in society, about poverty traps, poverty lines and so on. Let us be honest with the public.  That is what is happening here today.  That is the result of political parties playing politics with policy and not delivering the goods. We are back to the classical situation we have had over the past three and a half years in which a Government come into office with a high public relations profile and sell public relations but not do the work on the ground.  This is an example of that.  The people who lost out were the poor and presumably the Labour Party. The Labour Party would have regarded <Col N="184" /> themselves as having a particular interest in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>They were whistling past a very long graveyard.  The public realise the reality of what is happening.  I sympathise with the Labour Party.  I realise that their colleagues in Government are fairly right wing in their approach.  The Labour Party must have had difficulty in bringing back this legislation.  They still have not succeeded in getting back to the level of funding that was available.  What sort of funding is available this year?  There is no £2 million even in 1986 for this agency. That is the reality.  That is where it happens; that is what it is all about.  Can you get the actual funding?  That is being left aside.  However, we are glad to see this Bill for the second time come through the House with minor amendments and being presented in a different way.  The Minister spoke about the question of poverty &mdash; and I would be very worried about this myself or if I were a member of the Labour Party sharing in the Government &mdash; and she said:</P>
      <P>For example, surveys have shown that a sizeable number of people believe that there is no real poverty in Ireland anymore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know how the Government believe in polls.  If you mention a poll they will jump over a fence straightaway.  They believe there is no real poverty in Ireland <Col N="185" /> any more.  If poverty is defined in purely financial terms &mdash; I am quoting what the Minister has stated this afternoon &mdash; there is no doubt that people on social welfare payments, for example, are receiving more money in real terms than they were years ago.  Years ago?  How many years ago are we talking about?</P>
    <P>If you go back over this Coalition period of office and talk about real terms, they are receiving less, but if you take in what was given in the few years before that when there were real increases then, yes, you could say it is real compared to 1980.  That is what the Taoiseach does. This sleight of hand, this deliberate misleading of people about what is actually happening, is what the Taoiseach and the Minister do.  If you go back over the last three years &mdash; there is no question about this in my mind &mdash; the figures will show quite clearly that the poor have lost out. One trick which has been introduced is to use the next year's inflation rate rather than that of the previous one.  The public at large do not realise what sleight of hand that is.  That is sleight of hand, as anyone who is on the job knows, if you use the previous year's inflation, because the poor are only catching up with it.  At least if this agency gets going they will stop that sleight of hand which this Government have engaged in and which everybody, particularly Members on the other side of the House, have been accepting.</P>
    <P>Going back to the Minister's speech this afternoon she said that surveys have shown that a sizeable number of people believe there is no real poverty.  Many of the unemployed, the elderly, widows and the disadvantaged do not believe that. Neither do their families.  The 1.3 million who are on medical cards hardly believe it.  Where is the Minister finding all these people?  What surveys is the Minister carrying out?  The Minister goes on to say:</P>
    <P>There is no doubt, however, that while rates of payment have increased appreciably in real terms over the years, nevertheless many people find it <Col N="186" /> difficult to cope with their commitments ...</P>
    <P>God bless and help them.  They have been given 4 per cent in the budget to come some time near the end of the year and they are supposed to cope with all the problems in between.  Nevertheless, they find it difficult to cope with their commitments and there is an increasing amount of what might be called customer dissatisfaction. What kind of language is that and where did it come from?  These people do not have the money to be customers. Would the members of the Labour Party please convey to the Minister that the people we are talking about here do not have the basic money to be customers or clients?  There is not much need to do research at present although ongoing research would be very valuable.  Any TD who has his or her nose to the ground will tell you where the poor are and who are most affected at present.  However, customer dissatisfaction exists.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say &mdash; this is the basic and fundamental point and the Labour Party should have a word with the Minister on this &mdash; that &ldquo;poverty, of course, is not related to lack of income alone ...&rdquo;  That is a very dangerous phrase.  I was Minister for Social Welfare for a period and that is the line you are repeatedly given by the right wing people.  Do not get too tied up in money, it costs too much.  Talk instead about the educational and general needs.  Then turn around and say, &ldquo;Is not everybody getting primary education anyway?&rdquo; The poor kids who are dropping out do not have enough teachers to help them break the trap they are in.  It will be a long time before they will come back and put money into that situation.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote to the Minister the Oxford Dictionary, as I was annoyed when I saw the Minister putting this line into her speech at this point in time.  To me, that is a danger signal which is not going to go out in the newspapers, the fancy programmes on television or with the people who are talking about these things and who are wrapped up in comfort in talking about poverty.  I know, as <Col N="187" /> I have seen the people who have been there.  That is an indication right away. When the Minister for Social Welfare comes to the table at the end of the year do not look for hard cash, find your solution somewhere else.</P>
    <P>Poverty is described in the Oxford Dictionary as a state of being poor.  The Oxford Dictionary is not confused about it.  What is poor?  Poor is lacking adequate money or means to live comfortably.  It is all about having the basic requirements to live and subsist.  That is the basic level of poverty.  What is the poverty line? The Oxford Dictionary tells us that the poverty line is the minimum income needed to secure the necessities of life. That is the reality.  The Oxford Dictionary does not get confused over what poverty is about.  We have poverty in Ireland on a massive scale.  It goes on to the poverty trap, where increases in incomes brings loss of State benefits making real improvement impossible.  I can see people in that situation.  Last Saturday at one of my clinics two elderly people told me that they had £600 in a bank that they had declared and because of that they took away a miserable £10 a week non-contribution pension &mdash; £10 to the husband and £10 to the wife, the man was 84 and the woman 78.  They cannot live from week to week.  But what happened? They had this small amount of money which they were trying to save up as funeral money and which at the end of their lives is all they will have left.  They are chasing every penny they have nowadays and trying to dig it out.  They found this.  So they lose £10 each.  They are taken off the non-contributory pension and what did they lose as a consequence? They lose the ESB fuel vouchers and the other benefits they were getting.  Therefore it is not just a question of the little difference.  Even the Oxford Dictionary saw it all &mdash; the Minister cannot see it &mdash; and went so far as to spell it out, where increase in income brings loss of State benefits making real improvement impossible.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the 35 per cent tax rate that the Government are bringing in on old <Col N="188" /> age pensions and on children's allowance will reduce the benefit they are getting and we might be able to get them marginally back into a couple of pounds so that they can get back their fuel vouchers and ESB allowance.  These are the kind of things poverty is about.  We could go on for months talking about this as Deputies on both sides of the House know the practical examples that are there.  If we want an agency, we want it to highlight these things and show the reality of this side of poverty.  What I would like to say to the Minister is, give people in the first instance the basic money for the necessities.  The Minister must do that and this body should try to establish what is the basic level.</P>
    <P>We have tried every so often to establish on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis the basic subsistence level for a family with up to five children.  Nowadays the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance stop at two children. However, the poverty trap includes families with up to five children.  The Government should give these families the support they are committed to giving under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In talking about poverty the Minister should set her sights straight.  We all agree that health conditions, low levels of education, low levels of nutrition, job insecurity and so on are contributory factors, but the basic subsistence level relates to a family having enough money to buy essentials only.  If we as a community cannot provide a basic subsistence level including a reasonably balanced diet for our disadvantaged citizens, we are going nowhere.  There is a trend nowadays to follow right wing policies, but that trend will have adverse effects on those caught in the poverty trap because they will be told it is all their own fault, to go and get work and get on with the job and, in many cases, that is not possible given their circumstances.</P>
    <P>The record of the Government is particularly bad in relation to poverty.  Not alone did the Government do away with the National Community Development Agency but their record in other areas is bad.  I invite anyone to compare the two Bills.  They are practically similar, with a <Col N="189" /> few changes in the wordings, and in the end the National Social Services Board is not subsumed into this body.  The Government could have made the decision to leave the National Social Services Board separate within a few days of coming into office and, if that were the case, we would respect their decision. This was debated in the House before they came to office and they accepted our Bill but pointed to the reservation they felt that the National Social Services Board should remain separate.  Why did the Government not give effect to that reservation on coming into office?  On foot of the passage of the National Community Development Agency Bill, 1982, a body was set up to run it and funding was provided.  It was disgraceful and shoddy politicking by the Minister and the Government to abolish that board which had a wide representation including very distinguished members of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and various other organisations.  Heading this board was Mr. Joe McGough, a man with enormous management experience.  We felt that having this type of person on a body like this would bring a whole new dimension of management into this area of community development.  I pay tribute to Mr. Joe McGough who was very keen to do this job.  However, the Government wiped out the whole board and saved themselves £8 million for four years.</P>
    <P>We set up a Council for the Aged under the chairmanship of the late Michael Killeen. This brought a new dimension to this area.  While up to then a great amount of goodwill had been evident in voluntary agencies, there was a lack of professional management and we felt that professional management would be invaluable. We found that top class management in industry were prepared to put their backs to the wheel in this area.  That has not been widely recognised.  In this case the effort was made and it was set aside straight away by the incoming Government. This was a disgrace.  Basically speaking the two Bills are the same. Because it was put through the Seanad first one is printed on a different coloured <Col N="190" /> paper but that is probably the only real difference.</P>
    <P>In keeping with their record in relation to poverty this Government brought about massive unprecedented unemployment which is now running at 240,000, and massive emigration.  We are now seeing something which I thought we would never see again.  We are getting emigration on a similar scale to what happened in the fifties when emigration was at an average of 40,000 per annum. Around the year 1955 it went to a peak of almost 60,000.  Already Central Statistics Office figures show a difference of 30,000 in the movement in and out of the country. The Government claim the figure is less, but that is an argument that is always used.  It is interesting that applications for visas to the US this year are up by 9,000. I know scores of young people who are going to America to work.</P>
    <P>The US allow only about 1,200 legal immigrants per annum from Ireland under the various categories.  However, many more than that are going on temporary visas.  One of their difficulties is that they cannot come home to visit parents, friends and relations in Ireland because they might be caught and refused re-entry to America.  Recently a number were caught over the Christmas period and were not allowed to return.  All we can offer those people is poverty.  Apart from those emigrating to America there are reports of large numbers of Irish people turning up in England.  The Minister said that poverty is a question of social and economic policies.  One does not need much research to know that the economic policies of the Government are resulting in massive unemployment and emigration.  That was obvious from the time the Government set this target. They intended to let unemployment rise. Therefore, it was inevitable that emigration would rise also.  We have massive unemploymnet, massive emigration and extensive poverty in the community.</P>
    <P>We had recently the allocation in the budget of 4 per cent for the social welfare recipients and that is to come about the third week in July.  Surely that is not a Labour Party measure.  The Labour Party <Col N="191" /> cannot be happy with that.  I do not know how they have turned on their heads if they are happy with that, because I remember bringing in 25 per cent three years in succession and being criticised for that by Members who are now on that side of the House.  It was not enough, and now they sit silent in the House while the social welfare recipients get 4 per cent and, for the first time in history, nothing for the children.  If you have one child you get once nothing, if you have two children you get twice nothing, five children five times nothing, but you have five times the bill to pay with five children. As we all know from our early days in school, five times nothing is still nothing, so it is zero for five, seven or nine, depending on the family's size.  We do not need much research to see that the Government at present are systematically reducing the position of those on social welfare benefits and when they like to try to show that it is not being reduced they want to go back to 1980 because they know that in going back to 1980 they will take in some of those 25 per cents and that will make the figures look all right.  Usually the people they are talking to are not sufficiently aware of the facts to be able to point out right away, &ldquo;Yes, but you are taking the figures back over a longer period.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach likes to make comparisons with the EC and to say that in the EC they are having only little percentage increases like these, but if you have a little percentage on a big income it is not so bad.  When you have a little percentage on nothing it means nothing.  Therefore, whenever someone puts matters in that way, as the Taoiseach did recently to the House, he insults the intelligence of the people, certainly on this side of the House.  I do not know about that side and whether the people there have listened to so much of this that they are dumb struck and do not hear it any more, but I become very annoyed when I see the Taoiseach standing up in this House or on television and saying that.  I feel inclined to get up and say &ldquo;Liar, it is not true&rdquo;, but I know that that is unparliamentary and I would not do it, of course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  It still boils down to the same thing: that the people are being led astray and the position is misrepresented.  I boil up and I have to take a walk or a breath of fresh air or a drink of cold water or something because it is very aggravating when you go out on the street and see people who are really on subsistence level and then come in here and have to listen to this kind of rubbish, which is not related to reality, and when you see the money being clawed back.  Even Deputies on that side of the House are pointing to the clawing back of the child allowance.  A sum of £30 million has been clawed back by knocking out the £100 tax allowance.  Goodness knows that allowance was small enough and should have been considerably more, but to wipe it out altogether was to claw back in a full year £30 million.  They have clawed back £9 million on not giving the 4 per cent to the children.  It is sizeable money when put together.  That shows where the real poverty comes from.  You are pulling back real transfers of money. The question for this House is whether we are going to transfer real money to people who are really in need.  There is no difference between us on chasing the sponger, the scoundrel, the waster or whoever else.  We are just as anxious as Members on that side of the House are to deal with that problem.  We might have a more compassionate way of doing it than some of the right wing people who speak in the House from time to time have, nevertheless we do not differ on that.  However, when we are talking about people who are genuinely disadvantaged, this House must be concerned about real transfers of money and that is <Col N="193" /> when we talk about the millions of pounds that are transferred.  Here is a real transfer, but it is away from families by knocking out that £100 tax allowance and taking £30 million as a result of that.</P>
      <P>I know that I am leading with my chin for some of the right wing developments in this House recently when I talk about the three 25 per cents in a row that we gave.  People say that is what is wrong with the country, that we are giving away too much money.  But when you found that people were on a miserable old age pension, so low that they could not exist, the only way to get that up was with the three 25 per cents.  It annoys me to see that being pulled back at present and those people being pulled back towards poverty as has been happening over the last three and a half years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, an unprecedented number of people are on medical cards now. Criteria for medical cards have been tightened up, there is very strict control on them and many people have had the medical card taken away from them.  The medical card each year is adjusted in line with the figure given for inflation, so we are talking again about the 4 per cent. The band to cover the financial circumstances is extremely narrow and there is very little improvement widening of it. That in the first instance, plus a tightening of the criteria, would lead one to expect to see a drop in the number of medical cards; but in fact the number of people holding medical cards has increased to 1.3 million.  If you qualify for a medical card you are on subsistence level and probably under it.  There is no question about that with the criteria that apply. Of course, that is excepting cases where people might misrepresent their case, defraud or whatever.  That is a different situation.  But the vast number of people on medical cards are under subsistence level of income and that is an index of how much poverty there is today.  In addition to that on this coming Saturday 2 per cent will go on to the supermarket trolley because this coming Saturday is 1 March. That will push up from 23 per cent to 25 per cent the VAT charged for the vast bulk of items purchased at the weekend <Col N="194" /> to maintain the family and keep them in basic food.  We know that will happen this coming weekend.  At the same time we know that food subsidies are being halved and that the child benefit scheme is not coming due to administrative difficulties.</P>

      <P>I am dealing only with aspects of the budget which relate to poverty.  I take it that the purpose of this agency is to find poverty, measure it, establish where it exists and propose measures to deal with it.  Only in that respect, am I mentioning it.  For instance, of the schemes which this body would examine &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The child benefit scheme is one that could come from this body and they will now probably have to examine how it will work or how it might work. The Government promised the child benefit scheme and subsequently discovered that administratively as far as they were concerned it will not work and they could not introduce it.  The allowance of approximately £30, as mentioned in <i>Building on Reality</i>, should now be £30 plus, instead of which it is only going from £12 to £15, which is a 25 per cent increase.  There was no increase last year, only 7 per cent increase the year before and no increase the year before that again and this latest increase will not improve the situation.  Also, the 35 per cent retention tax referred to earlier will be a blow to old age pensioners and have a disastrous effect on those living on, or just above or below the poverty line.  I hope that attention will be paid to this and an indication given as to how the position might be dealt with.  When the Finance Bill comes into the House it will fall to us to make proposals in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The voluntary agencies play a very <Col N="195" /> important role &mdash; we visualise it as a central role &mdash; in combating poverty, which is the purpose of this Bill.  However, their role will be diminished by this 35 per cent retention tax which will reduce the funds at their disposal.  The supplementary welfare criteria should be looked at by this agency.  People have been severely hit in recent times and instructions have been given to officers working in the health boards to exclude particular allowances and thereby exclude particular people.  This is the reality of what is happening as regards Government support in combating poverty.</P>
    <P>There are those who are very close to subsistence level, working but with very low incomes and trying to cater for a family.  Increased direct and indirect taxes have hit these particularly severely. People talk about increasing indirect tax rates as a means of reducing direct taxes, but we must take care that those on low incomes who are paying taxes and PRSI contributions will not be further disadvantaged. At the moment they are particularly badly hit and this matter should be the subject of research on the part of this agency.</P>
    <P>There is the second group who have been referred to as the new poor &mdash; those in the middle income group.  They could now be referred to as &ldquo;the new poorer&rdquo; because they are poorer than they ever were before.  They are being badly hit by taxation and their income increases have been held down.  This is particularly hard when they have families to support. Whatever benefits they had accumulated through their industry have been taken away from them.</P>
    <P>The position of the family in society must be urgently looked into.  The effect of Government measures, particularly in the last three and a half years, or following the last four successive budgets, has been felt by families because in these cases four, five or six individuals are being supported usually on the one income. Alternative measures must be proposed to support the family in line with the requirement in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> Another area very much in need of research is that of the elderly, especially those on non-contributory old age pensions. Because of the means test, their position is one which should be examined and highlighted.  Very small changes in their means can result in their losing, not just a <i>pro rata</i> benefit, but a whole series of benefits.  That surely is not something which the Government would intend, but that is what is happening at present.  It is incumbent on the new agency to research this problem and come up with suggestions for solving it.</P>
    <P>In my time in the Department of Social Welfare before the budget we would bring a long list of amendments to the Cabinet and bargain for them.  We would always meet with fair success and one would be happy having got 13 or 15 adjustments.  These might cost £1 million, £½ million, or £3 million or £4 million, but they were important adjustments for those concerned and saved people from falling into the poverty trap as the Oxford Dictionary has defined it.  That did not happen this year or, if the Minister brought such amendments forward, he did not succeed in bringing them through the Cabinet.  That feature of budgets has been lost sight of and it was a very important feature because one would learn from groups like the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the representatives of the rural community bodies, those representing the disabled and so on and the voluntary agencies what measures were required. These could have an important effect on groups of people like the elderly, widows or the disabled.  In terms of the total budget they did not cost very much, but they gave much relief.  We are finding that more elderly people are being dropped into the poverty trap.</P>
    <P>I was talking to some people last week about the proposals of the Government in regard to money in the bank.  They took their money out.  They had £1,800, and decided to do a number of things.  They put in natural gas heating because they were so elderly they had become afraid of ordinary fires.  That cost £800 to install, leaving them with £1,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" /> That came in for assessment, and as a result they lost their non-contributory pensions.  In turn, they lost their fuel vouchers. Now they have a gas heating system but they cannot use it.  That is the poverty trap.  If this Bill is not about that sort of thing, we are wasting our time here.  These are the problems that matter.</P>
    <P>The long term unemployed deserve attention from the new agency.  Their position is becoming particularly desperate because of their long accumulation of debt and their loss of friends and credit. We must also consider the relationship between poverty and crime, and I hope the agency will look at that.  As we know from prison statistics, many of the prison population are drawn from the lower income group, and there is a major connection between unemployment and hardship.  It would never be our intention to use our prisons or our criminal law generally in a repressive way, so the agency should look carefully at the connection between crime and poverty.</P>
    <P>The body to be set up should also consider the itinerant community.  There are examples of where positive work has been done in this direction, but more can be done and the agency could help.</P>
    <P>We have many community schemes such as meals on wheels, public health nursing, home help.  These things must be kept in mind.  They are basically part of local community effort.  We called one such body the National Community Development Agency and emphasised the need for community based services like those I have been speaking about. The important thing about community services is that they should be provided where there is genuine need.</P>
    <P>The cost of administration of welfare services and the provision of ways in which the administration can be simplified and brought down to local level are matters which the new agency can look at.  We must look at the local effects of factories being closed, left, right and centre, with people becoming unemployed with consequent hardship on members of local communities, resulting sometimes in the breakdown of those communities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> There is much work to be done here and we must get our priorities right so that the transfer of moneys will be to the people most in need.  There is an onus on the Opposition as well as on the Government to support measures which will deal with those who are defrauding or abusing the system, but that does not mean we should take our minds away from the essential purpose of welfare services which is to help those in need.  Our most important job is to see that there are transfers of real money in a socially balanced way.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's record is quite clear.  We can list the many improvements we brought about during our period in office, starting with the double week's benefit at Christmas, free travel and a proper means test.  At one time for every £1 income a non-contributory pensioner had he lost £1.40 in benefit.  That was savage and unfair and it cost substantially to reverse it.  Eventually we brought it down to £1.20, £1.10 and ultimately to £1 per £1.  That was a very big step forward though it does not look so big.  Of course it does not provide a great topic at a conference.</P>
    <P>Our main aim should be to give old people reasonable amounts in pensions, particularly widows and old age pensioners. As Deputy McCarthy has said, we will support any measure aimed at that.  We supported the combat poverty pilot schemes and when the final reports came through we put in a great deal of effort.  I was Minister for Health when the EC Social Affairs Council were about to close off those pilot schemes.  That is a matter of record in the Department of Social Welfare and in the EC Social Affairs Council.  Of course members of this Government do not speak about it very often.</P>
    <P>The EC Social Affairs Council were very anxious to do away with the combat poverty schemes.  As a result of representations I made, with the support of the officials from the Department of Social Welfare, the Council agreed to prepare a report bringing together the most positive moves which had occurred in the combat poverty programme.  There was <Col N="199" /> a lot of argument at this particular meeting. It was pointed out that some moves were good and others were bad, but the bad things were highlighted and the good ones forgotten.  We pointed to the valuable work which had been done and the positive results which had emerged.  The Council agreed to put all the good points in a report and said that at a subsequent meeting they would look at a reduced but continuing programme.  What we said was right.  In each country positive results had emerged and they had to be recognised. As I said, the Council then decided to continue with the scheme.  Having kept the door open, it would be possible to promote the work to combat poverty in EC countries in the coming years.  Some of the EC countries were in favour of stopping EC funding for the schemes but we won out on the day.  This means that EC contributions are now available.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to some of the grants that are available.  She said that the programme was backed by a Community budget of 25 million ECUs, around £17.5 million over four years, the bulk of which would be devoted to supporting action research projects in favour of deprived groups or deprived areas.  Various projects were selected across the Community and eight Irish projects are being financed, 55 per cent by the EC and the remaining 45 per cent by the Government.</P>
    <P>I have to listen to people making remarks about the Fianna Fáil Party and trying to suggest that we were not committed to this area, but our record speaks for itself.  It shows the massive transfers we made in this area and will continue to make in line with our policy of social balance.  We have always believed in sponsoring enterprise, private and public, while at the same time maintaining a social balance.  What is done to help those who are genuinely poor shows a party's real commitment to social balance. Fianna Fáil have always had, and still have, such a commitment and we are very proud of that fact.</P>
    <P>The meeting to which I referred earlier was the key meeting and some of the <Col N="200" /> projects caused a great deal of argument and comment, but it was our objective to seek what was positive and good in the pilot studies and to build on that.  Virtually the same thing was happening in other EC countries and those who did not want money committed to this area pressed very hard to ensure that the scheme would not be permanent.  I was Minister at the time and we proposed that reports be prepared.  This led to the scheme getting under way once again, albeit on a reduced basis.  This meant that the present Minister, with advice from her Department, can go to future meetings of the EC Social Affairs Council and develop a positive and constructive programme to combat poverty.  She will have our support, notwithstanding the jibes that have been thrown at us from time to time.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill but I would prefer a different title.  I believe the National Community Development Agency Bill, 1982, was a better title because it specified very clearly that the first objective was to combat poverty.  Unless we bring community development into play, it will be very difficult to remove the trap into which so many people have fallen, or have been forced into, in recent times. As I said, I welcome this Bill because the bulk of it is exactly the same as the Bill I had the privilege of presenting here nearly four years ago, but my only regret is that this agency were not allowed to continue and get on with this work.  If the incoming Government wished to take away the National Social Services Board and leave it on its own, that was their choice, but they did not do that.  Instead they did not implement the legislation; they abolished the board.  That was very regrettable because it meant the board lost four years development.</P>
    <P>I will naturally be very interested in all the details because I went into detail before in the House in relation to all the sections.  That is a matter for the Committee Stage of the Bill.  With those reservations I have pleasure in welcoming the Bill, although I regret that the agency and the money which went with it of £2 million per year for four years, £8 million <Col N="201" /> altogether, were denied over that period. It has all happened before and is on the record of the House.  We are repeating the scene of 1 June 1982.  People reading about this in later years will be very confused because they will see the same things being said now about what in effect is the same Bill, although they might not notice that the National Social Services Board is being dropped out of this one. That is the only real difference in the Bill. If they look deeply into it they will find that a total of £8 million has been taken out of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>While we are here pontificating on poverty and the need to eliminate poverty in our society, could we bring ourselves to a more immediate situation where poverty is?  We are now going through the coldest winter since 1947 and under the free fuel scheme the people involved are allowed one bag of coal or whatever the equivalent of £5 of fuel is per week.  Is there any possibility that the Government might introduce some quick temporary expedient to help in this very cold weather, such as double vouchers?  The scheme runs from October to April.  Sometimes in April the weather is not so cold, but certainly the weather at the moment is very bad.  I mentioned a fortnight ago that I know of people I grew up with who are now queueing up for fuel and are ashamed to be seen doing this.  Would the Minister consider while we still have this cold weather, which is likely to be with us for the next ten days, doing something to help eliminate the immediate effects of the cold weather on the most deprived people in our society, the very old and the sick living alone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very interested in what Deputy Woods had to say and I could not help but reflect on what Ralph Waldo Emerson said on one occasion in America when he was speaking about somebody there as only he could.  He said about this gentleman that &ldquo;the louder he spoke of his honour the faster I counted the spoons.&rdquo;  I could not help feeling like that as I was listening to Deputy Woods regaling us with Fianna Fáil's record of <Col N="202" /> what they did for the poor.  Cecil Woodham Smith in her book <i>The Great Hunger</i>, in which she described the Famine in 1847, recounts one occasion when the tenants of Lord Sligo presented themselves at the castle in Sligo and were due to ask Lord Sligo if he would remit the rents due for that year if they paid on the double the following year when the crops were good and the situation improved.  Before they could speak to Lord Sligo, however, the gombeen of the agent went out on the steps and obliged the 2,000 tenants to kneel down on the ground before Lord Sligo came out to address them.  That was done for their own politically expedient reasons at the time.  I could not help but reflect, as a member of the Labour Party, that that basically, although in a more refined form, is what Fianna Fáil have been doing over approximately 40 years in office.  Let us be fair about it.  When they were a popular party they introduced measures. We must give them credit for that.  The cynical observer might be forgiven for thinking that this was done more for the advantage of Fianna Fáil than it was for the poor.  It is interesting to go back and examine at what periods in history these particular gimmicks were introduced, however welcome they were to the poor.</P>
    <P>I take pride in the fact that this Government are introducing this Bill.  I do so as a member of the Labour Party, which was founded by the poor for the poor. We are the only political party in the country who have our roots in the underprivileged and deprived section of society.  It is very important to remember at the moment, when there seems to be a new swing in Irish society, that we are mushrooms, we grew up from those conditions, we are not parachutists, like a lot of the Johnny-come-latelys who are dying to drop into the trade union movement and take it over or take over the political arena for reasons that have very little to do with the poor of the country.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to quote from page 36 of the book <i>One Million Poor?</i> edited by Sister Stanislaus Kennedy, in which no less a person than one of our most <Col N="203" /> eminent sociologists, Dr. Liam Ryan, says:</P>
    <P>Connolly's philosophy has been reechoed in more recent times in a 1973 report prepared by the Labour Party entitled <i>Poverty in Ireland</i>.  This report, which is significant in being the only policy document on poverty issued by any of the major political parties, concludes: &ldquo;Poverty is an indictment of our nation because we as a people have placed our trust in a social system which is inherently divisive and unjust. No amount of quantitative growth in the capitalist system will eradicate poverty.  Fifteen years of steady economic development since 1958 have not reduced the numbers of unemployed nor, indeed, increased the total number at work.  Capitalism &mdash; and its political proponents have failed the Irish people and the poor most of all.  The Labour Party asserts that political action can and, with the support of the people, will eradicate poverty by fundamental and total reform of the socio-economic system. Policies for people must replace policies for profit and property.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about the basic and fundamental truth of that particular Labour Party philosophy because we see the same thing not alone in Ireland, where poverty is directly attributable to structural injustices, but in countries throughout the Third World and even in America, the richest nation in the history of mankind, where millions of people are going to bed every night on the street because they cannot sleep in their homes. You see the distinction between the northern and southern hemispheres, the top and bottom half of the world, in spite of the fact that man has the capacity to produce more wealth than he ever had.</P>
    <P>I was a bit confused by the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Justice accusing the Government of playing politics with poverty because it is one of the major contradictions of our recent history that the poor are not a political constituency at all.  Their problem throughout the <Col N="204" /> world is that they cannot gather themselves into a political system.  If they could there would have been a revolution before now.  The first law of science is that everything has a cause and an effect. If we are to do away with the effects of poverty we must study the causes and eliminate them.</P>
    <P>Somebody once said that the ancients were very mean, that they stole all our best ideas.  If one goes back and listens to the political commentators of 2,000 years ago, one finds that Julius Caesar said that all the people want is bread and circuses.  One might contend that in the minds of some people the latter day equivalent is TV and the dole.  When I was going around canvassing last May in the local elections it was very interesting to note the huge number of people in working class housing estates who were sitting down watching TV programmes and videos.  That has a huge sociological import for us if we are serious about redistributing wealth in our society and eliminating poverty.  I believe &mdash; and more competent commentators than I would say &mdash; that it was the cinema which prevented social revolution in Europe and America in the 1930s at the time of the great depression, because it diverted people's minds away from the position then obtaining.</P>
    <P>We need a proper educational system. There is a distinct correlation between poverty and a lack of fair access to educational opportunities.  I might quote from this book, <i>One Million Poor?</i>, on how poverty is seen in this country:</P>
    <P>In a survey on poverty carried out by the EEC only 19 per cent of those interviewed in Ireland felt that poverty was due to injustice within the society, whereas 30 per cent felt that it was due to laziness while a further 25 per cent believed that it was due to misfortune. Although these views were expressed by a small random sample of the population, one thousand persons, they do represent the current views of Irish people.  They pose a serious challenge for anyone attempting to find long term solutions to the problem of poverty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" /> I listened to Deputy Woods speak on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I believe we should all stop playing politics, on however minimal a scale we have done to date.  There are issues in this country &mdash; unemployment, taxation and poverty &mdash; which are so big they should not be the subject of inter-party rivalry and bickering. We need a special <i>ad hoc</i> Oireachtas committee on poverty to come up with suggestions, to undertake a close, worthwhile study of the causes of poverty in all its manifestations in this country and establish whether something can be done about it.</P>
    <P>I might quote Tony Brown, the Labour Party sociologist and economist, who contributed a chapter to this book, <i>One Million Poor?</i>, called &ldquo;Poverty, Politics and Policies&rdquo;.  Naturally &mdash; because what he has to say reflects Labour Party policy &mdash; it must constitute the most perfect commentary.  He says:</P>
    <P>The existence of poverty on a considerable scale is a fact here in Ireland and in all of the countries of Western Europe.  A study published early in 1980 pointed to the existence of relative poverty at a level of 20 to 25 per cent of the population in Italy, Belgium and Ireland, 16 per cent in France, up to 10 per cent in the UK and between 3 and 5 per cent in Germany, Norway and Sweden.  These percentages add up to a total of many millions of men, women and children.  Yet, poverty has not been regarded as a central political issue in any of the countries mentioned. It has largely been left to committed pressure groups together with a few politicians to fight the battle of the poor.</P>
    <P>Quite simply, the poor have not become an issue because they do not constitute a recognisable and organised political constituency.  People afflicted by poverty are in the minority and they are not a homogenous group within society.  Séamus Ó Cinnéide, in his 1971 study, divided the poor in Ireland into five main categories: old people, widows; small farmers; certain groups of the self-employed, and low paid <Col N="206" /> employees.  To these may be added such groups as single-parent families, prisioners' dependants, isolated individuals and groups, and the long term unemployed and disabled.  Of these, only the unemployed &mdash; and even then to a very limited extent &mdash; have any real political muscle.  One hundred times as many marchers turned out.</P>
    <P>&mdash; I was a party to both of these marches, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Listen to this for a statistic which he quotes &mdash;</P>
    <P>for the 1980 PAYE protest as for the unemployment protest in the same year &mdash; and both marches were organised by the same trade union body.</P>
    <P>Is that not a terrible reflection on the lack of political awareness of the people? There is an even more horrifying statistic of something that happened this year of which I am aware, that in one of the buses hired to attend the marches on unemployment and taxation &mdash; a joint effort &mdash; one bus contained 12 people only and of those 12 one was a married woman with three children.  That is some reflection on the lack of awareness or lack of perception by the poor and the unemployed on the need to raise this to a political level in order to do something effective about their position.  What this needs is politics, policies and planning.</P>
    <P>I should now like to quote something Deputy Frank Cluskey said when Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare:</P>
    <P>The mere pursuit of goals spelled out in terms of economic advance &mdash; growth deficits, balance of payments, even employment or unemployment levels &mdash; simply cannot be looked to as the basis for the concerned national effort that is essential.  The very process of economic growth can be a selfdefeating exercise if it is in itself such as to maintain and reinforce injustice. There must be a clear commitment to the achievement of a balance between what is necessary to meet acceptable economic criteria and what relates specifically to the creation of a more just and equal society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="207" /> Again in that book entitled, <i>One Million Poor?</i> Tony Brown quotes Titmuss as having pointed out that social planning is the real answer to the problems we face in the context of this discussion.  Titmuss pointed out:</P>
    <P>Planning, if it means anything at all in relation to the social and economic needs of the particular groups in society, means the making of decisions about the allocation of resources and claims on resources in the future as well as the present.  If we are to plan for the aged to have a larger share of the national income then we are, in effect, planning for others to have less.</P>
    <P>That is a very true representation.  I would suggest it is more than opportune that all these sectors be involved in a massive campaign to eradicate poverty from our society.  It is a frightening statistic that over 700,000 people, or approximately one in four of the people of this country, are in receipt of social welfare benefits of one kind or another.  In regard to the cost of social welfare alone &mdash; I accept fully that there are anomalies within that system, that somebody is tricking the system here and there &mdash; we are talking of a rounded up figure of two and a half billion.</P>
    <P>I cannot help but go back and think, again in Cecil Woodham's book <i>The Great Hunger</i>, of what the Home Secretary, Sir John Trevelyan, said in 1847. He was speaking in the middle of the Famine and said that the Irish, as a people, if they ever learn that they can get something for nothing will provide a stampede such as the world has never witnessed.  I do not know of any nation in the world, whether stricken by famine or other disaster, which would not stampede for something for nothing if they got it; I think all of us would do that. Trevelyan was outlining the views of the British Liberal Government toward the Irish mentality and character.  There is much residual outlook of that type among some sectors of our society today under which they ascribe the misfortunes of the <Col N="208" /> poor to laziness, dishonesty and that kind of thing.</P>
    <P>While we can be cynical and take account of what these shortsighted and bigoted people would say about the poor and the unemployed.  Tony Brown sums up what should be our attitude when he says that there is a long and unhappy history of declarations of political concern for the commitment to the poor.  In many countries these declarations have been accompanied by misleading statistical claims about the numbers of those in need, the dimensions of the problem and so on.  What has been singularly absent in almost every case has been any deep political analysis of the causes of poverty and any clearly articulated long term policy to deal with those causes.  Unless there is a change in this essential area of political decision there can be no real progress in the fight against poverty.</P>
    <P>In the context of the broad subject of social policy against poverty the only way forward towards one or any of the long term goals of our society is through comprehensive and balanced economic and social planning.  This is especially so in respect of poverty which is a complex problem involving, in every instance, a mixture of economic and social elements and circumstances.  Since true planning relates to the definition and statement of objectives and the consequent evolution of policies and actions designed to achieve them, it is basic to any planned approach to poverty that the right objectives should be set and fully understood. If political leaders are not prepared to face up to the fact that poverty, as an evil in society which must be removed, can be tackled only by the application of policies which are necessarily radical and costly, then there can be no hope.  It would be better to stop the pretence of tackling the problem altogether than to continue with the charade.  To argue for generous alleviation is an honest policy approach.  To claim that this does anything to remove poverty from society without the addition of appropriate long term policies is totally dishonest.  That is a reflection of the Labour Party policy by our leading proponent on the whole question of justice <Col N="209" /> and poverty.  Mr. Tony Brown.  I will quote another Labour Party economist and sociologist, Councillor Eithne FitzGerald, who is identified in the public mind as one of the leading Labour Party spokespersons and somebody greatly motivated by a high sense of justice.  She says:</P>
    <P>The challenge of poverty in Ireland today is still substantial.  The latest comprehensive data suggests that more than one in four in Ireland experiences poverty in their daily lives.  The elderly, the unemployed, and the larger families, are those most likely to be poor. The most up-to-date information highlights the continued persistence of the problem of poverty among urban workers supporting a family, in depressed farming areas, among pensioners, and those out of work.  Nearly a million people receive a social welfare payment each week.</P>
    <P>About 700,000 &mdash; about 20 per cent of the population &mdash; depend on social welfare for their principal long term source of income.  One in six of all children is in a family which so depends on social welfare.  Many families lack amenities we now regard as basic. Three out of every five people living alone lack the basic water amenities of hot water, flush toilet and bath or shower.  Poverty shows its face in bad housing and in educational deprivation, as well as low income.  The problems faced by one-parent families, by travellers, by people living in long-stay institutions, all illustrate the different dimensions of poverty.  We are often complacent about poverty in our midst.  The argument is frequently put that with general growth and development in Western economies the rising tide will lift all boats.  The continued prevalence and persistence of poverty in Irish society illustrates that this is not the case.  We need a commitment to tackle not just its symptoms, but the fundamental causes.  We need a real commitment to redistribution of resources in Irish society.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody would disagree <Col N="210" /> with her statement.  In spite of all the professed technological advances and our greater capacity than ever before to produce wealth, it is manifestly true that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.  I said this ten years ago when the national wage agreement became a concept, where one sector of the workforce would not be a party to any national wage agreements or arrangements unless increases in salary were based on a percentage of their salaries. Facts exist to show what that principle has done.  We are closing hospitals and educational institutions and cutting back on recruitment of teachers, nurses and gardaí.  I have discussed this with economists and accountants.  It is that principle which is the Exocet in Irish society.</P>
    <P>If I never agreed with Deputy O'Malley in anything else he said, what he said this morning is manifestly true.  A ten year old child would agree with that.  If we continue the present system this country will be bankrupt in a few years.  I am not saying this in a gloomy or pessimistic way. I am the very opposite by nature; I would be regarded as an optimist.  The factual record of what has happened in the last 12 years will prove that what I am saying is true.  I gave evidence here and I got the figures from officials in the Government that the secretary of a Department under that principle, between January 1973 and January 1984, got an increase in salary under the mechanism of applying a percentage increase, of £27,800.  That figure can be up-dated now.  This problem is contributing to the poverty situation.  I hope the trade union movement and others will wake up to what is happening. That official is highly productive in economics and the science of economics, where the word &ldquo;productive&rdquo; means to fulfil a want.  Like many other people they fulfil the want but they do not generate much extra disposable income which keeps hospitals open, which keeps educational institutions open and which allows for the recruitment of extra people. Money pays wages.  If there are four people living in a virgin economy on an island in the Pacific and they have only <Col N="211" /> one pint of milk, they either get a quarter of a pint each or two take half a pint and the other two do without.  It is simple, basic, factual scientific arithmetic.</P>
    <P>Economics is not an exact science.  I have long ago dismissed economists.  I saw four of them on television, all graduates of the London School of Economics, who could not agree among themselves on what caused inflation.  The situation will be worse next year if we carry on as we are.  The person who receives the huge percentage increase, for example, somebody on £20,000 a year of whom there are many, is over-generously compensated for the increase in the cost of living index.  The cost of living index is measured scientifically four times a year in February, May, August and November.  It is based on a fairly scientific system, on a family with a husband, wife and four children, what it costs to clothe, feed, educate, shelter and give them a holiday.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with the Taoiseach or anybody else going on television and stating that the cost of living over the last year has gone up by X pounds, not percentage? The person who gets the £2,000 a year increase as against what the lowest person on the scale might get, say £300, is not paying anything extra for a pint of milk, a loaf of bread or a pound of sugar. Because of the crazy system we have at present and the cost push effect on inflation by paying the higher paid person over-generously, we are making it more difficult for the person at the bottom of the heap.  We are widening the gap and the lower paid worker is being done to death by this system.  The quicker we as a society stand up and tackle these issues on a broad basis the better.  We owe it to ourselves to analyse where the fault lies in Irish society.</P>
    <P>In certain areas at present farmers are being compensated for the bad summer they had last year.  I know of cases where, on the one hand, they get vouchers to compensate for the loss of hay that could have been saved and, on the other hand, they were actually selling bales of hay for £4 a bale.  That is an injustice and in itself <Col N="212" /> is a contribution to the poverty we are all trying to eradicate.  We could write 40 books on the injustices that are prevalent in our society.  It is too big a problem for one party.  I suggested to Dr. Martin O'Donoghue when he was a Minister in 1978 that it should be dealt with by an all-party committee who would not play politics with such a supremely important issue but would make recommendations for the ultimate good of this nation.  We would have an equal and fair distribution and a proportionate redistribution of wealth to those who need it most.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by quoting Tony Brown, the Labour Party spokesman on the international committees dealing with poverty and injustice, who quoted from the book by Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy, page 162:</P>
    <P>Finding the lasting solutions to poverty, which are necessary for the social cohesion of Irish society and for the peace of the world, must be seen as a political task.  An appropriate mixture of principle, detailed analysis and leadership is what is required.  To wait for the emergence of a consensus on the issue would be to wait forever. No great change, no great social or political advances ever grew out of a consensus.  Change must be brought about by courageous political leadership allied to hard and patient political and technical work.  Above all it must be brought about by harmonising the skills and insights of people themselves especially of poor and deprived people.  Policies for people, rather than policies for administrators and institutions, must be developed.  For us in Ireland, such policies &mdash; and such politics &mdash; will demand a break from all that has gone before.  But then, what has gone before has made our society what it is.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Labour Party who are under attack at present I want to say that our sole commitment is to the poor, the underprivileged and the deprived in our society.  There is no shame in that.  It was J. L. Garvan, editor of <i>The Observer</i>, who said that opinions are feee, but facts <Col N="213" /> are sacred.  I was very disturbed to hear Deputy Woods.  I understand he has to do his job as an Opposition spokesman. The first act of somebody who is not a gentleman is to distort the truth.  The facts are there to prove that this Government alone of all the Governments in the EC have ensured that the poor and the social welfare recipients in this country stayed ahead of the cost of living increase.

      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Minister Desmond, our mutual colleague and friend.  Whatever else may be said of him, nobody can ever say he is not factual and truthful when it comes to statistics.  He has shown us &mdash; you have seen them, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the tables which prove the truth of what I am saying.  I am right in saying that this attempt by the Government to introduce the Combat Proverty Agency is part of our input into the Joint Programme for Government.  We make no apologies for that.  In fact, we take legitimate pride in it.  For that reason I commend the Bill to the House and support it fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that this will be what is called a sunset committee and that it will not be put into limbo of forgotten things.  I have not read through the terms of the Bill fully, but let me put it to the Minister that we should agreee on a definite date, say, not longer than six months.  I know that is a very hefty job to be done within a period like that.  I am anxious that before they leave office this Government will have shown their commitment.  I think of Declan Costello and people like him in Fine Gael, the authors of the just society. Much as I would like to corner all the market on virtue and concern for the Labour Party, people in Fine Gael were motivated in the past and still are with concern for the poor.  This agency will be set up for the sake of the poor and not for the sake of politics.  It should not be set up as a political expedient or gimmick <Col N="214" /> but because there is genuine and wholehearted concern on the part of those of us represented in Government.  That is not meant to reflect on any of the other parties where people are highly motivated on issues of social justice.  If we are to do something, let us do it quickly and let us do something that will show results in the fairly immediate future.  Molaim an Bille don Teach.</P>

Insufficient income and insufficient means are the root of poverty.  There is no doubt that factors other than money are contributing to poverty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Wednesday I talked about the short and happy history of the attempt to introduce this form of legislation into the House and mentioned that divorce in its effect on society is so far reaching that as full a consultation as possible should take place.  I pointed out the attitudes of the parties to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="215" /> The Progressive Democrats felt that even though the Bill was seriously defective and substantively and technically unsound, the electorate have the right to decide on any legislation providing for divorce and they said they would shortly publish substantive divorce Bill proposals designed to protect the institution of marriage by recognising the reality of breakdown.</P>
    <P>In 1980 a motion was introduced in the House seeking to establish a committee to report on an appropriate form of amendment to Article 41 of the Constitution. During the course of the debate on that motion the House was reminded that in 1967 a committee reported and made some recommendations, even though in 1980 the Fianna Fáil Government refused to consider the matter at all.  In the Official Report of 29 October 1980, at column 1115, a Deputy dealing with the report of the 1967 committee stated:</P>
    <P>I will read paragraph 123, page 43, in describing Article 41.3.2, which provides that no law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage.</P>
    <P>This universal prohibition has been criticised mainly on the ground that it takes no heed of the wishes of a certain minority of the population who would wish to have divorce facilities and who are not prevented from securing divorce by the tenets of the religious denominations to which they belong.  It also argued that the Constitution was intended for the whole of Ireland and that the percentage of the population of the entire island made up of persons who are Roman Catholics though large is not overwhelming.  The prohibition is a source of embarrassment to those seeking to bring about better relations between North and South since the majority of the Northern population have divorce rights under the law applicable to that area.  It has also been pointed out that there are other predominantly Catholic <Col N="216" /> countries which do not, in their Constitutions, absolutely prohibit the enactment of laws relating to the dissolution of marriage.  Finally, attention is sometimes drawn in discussing this subject to the more liberal attitude now prevailing in Catholic circles in regard to the rites and practices of other religious denominations, particularly since the second Vatican Council.</P>
    <P>Twenty years ago the report of an all-party committee of the House was quoted in the Official Report of 29 October 1980, at column 1116, as follows:</P>
    <P>It can be argued, therefore, that the existing Constitutional provision is coercive in relation to all persons. Catholic and non-Catholic, whose religious rules do not absolutely prohibit divorce in all circumstances.  It is unnecessarily harsh and rigid and could, in our view, be regarded as being at variance with the accepted principles of religious liberty as declared at the Vatican Council and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It would seem, therefore, that there could be no objection from any quarter to an amendment of the Constitution on the lines which we have indicated in paragraph 124 and we unanimously recommend that such an amendment be made.</P>
    <P>During that debate Deputy Noel Browne said that Deputy Keating had pointed out that we had advanced further, although we never seemed to get around to making a decision.  The quotation continued:</P>
    <P>... we have advanced further now and we could simply agree on the case of known facts that we recognise the ending of marriage in the temporary and permanent barring orders, in private and judicial separations, the ending of marriage in the High Court <i>mensa et thora</i>.  We recognise that marriages can end, but no law can keep people together if the marriage has broken down.</P>

      <P>I am referring to the Dáil debate of 29 October 1980 at column 1117.</P>
      <P>We recognise that marriages can end, but no law can keep people together if the marriage is broken down....  There is no law which can stop people forming new relationships; there is no law, where a marriage has broken down and people are living in isolation, that will prevent them from forming new relationships and cohabiting outside marriage.  This has gone on in every country and it is going on here. We are no better and no worse, we are just the same as the rest of them, to use the biblical phrase and it is about time we accepted the need to recognise that marriages break down and that the only way in which we can help people is to accept the recommendation of our own all-party committee.</P>
      <P>These words were spoken by Deputy Noel Browne.  When this issue comes up we have frequently taken refuge in finding another reason for not making a decision.  This Bill to change the constitutional ban on divorce is the sixth Bill in five years to come into the House to get the Members to recognise that marriages are breaking down.  We are now running behind the Hierarchy to gain time and we are shirking the necessity to introduce legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A democracy is judged on how it treats its minorities.  If we were to apply the majority rule all the time it would be a very unfair country.  This rule can be applied in reverse.  There are many cases where minorities are very badly off and the majority would not want to keep them in the same circumstances, an example is strip searching in prisons.  We need not concern ourselves about the size of the minority, but about the validity of their rights.  The full consultation that is desirable does not stand up as a case for delay.  There is an opportunity for discussions with the Hierarchy.  I hope the Taoiseach will not make the same <Col N="218" /> mistake as Dr. Noel Browne when consulting the Hierarchy about the Mother and Child Scheme, and that he will bring witnesses.  There is no doubt that because of the presentations the Hierarchy made to the Forum, and publicly, they will give their best advice in the coming months in relation to the form and circumstances in which broken marriages can be recognised. There are major recognised flaws in the laws of nullity.  One obvious thing is that we must legislate.</P>
    <P>We in our party have been given the opportunity to exercise a free vote, a rare thing, in order to exercise our prerogative as legislators.  This would be an interesting House if we were all allowed exercise free votes on other topics as well, so that people could stand up and be counted and could represent the people who sent them into the House because to a great extent that is not done.  If this matter goes to a referendum and is passed I do not think that the Hierarchy, for example, can act like the Unionists and keep saying, &ldquo;No, no, no&rdquo;.  The Hierarchy were the last into the Forum and I was present when their presentation was made and when a member of Fianna Fáil at that time for and behalf of the Hierarchy pointed out to us that we were the legislators and that it was not up to them to tell us what laws to bring in but they reserved the right to comment on them. Many of us thought that a little less than honest because it led to the famous occasion when Deputy John Kelly accused the Hierarchy of having to think on their feet for the first time since the arrival of St. Patrick in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell may get his wish on the last night that he will not be alone going through those lobbies.  Often in the past he has pointed out that his party came through when they need not have done but they did so in the interest of the country.  They did not act like sleeveen legislators whom I can think of who frequently hide behind something, mainly the Whip or whatever else is opportune at the moment.  I wonder when the people of Ireland are going to see through this finally and cut such people dead at an election and say that they want no more <Col N="219" /> of this kind of hypocrisy; they elect representatives to legislate on their behalf and want them to do so with honesty and courage.  If on the basis of their action these representatives are returned to Government people cannot look forward to any form of honest representation because they will put themselves first instead of the country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Labour Party's new found courage in putting this Bill forward and it will give me great pleasure to support Deputy Mervyn Taylor's Bill in this House when it comes to a vote.  Many times with a heavy heart he has had to do things for the country that probably he would not be inclined to do if he was putting himself and his party first.  If they find it OK to vote on this Bill with its known defects I cannot understand why they did not find themselves able to vote for the first of Deputy Michael O'Leary's Bills.  The second of his Bills would have allowed people to decide what kind of legislation would be brought in.  Really he was giving the Hierarchy an opportunity to make their views known because they would have done that by informing the people in their usual way and in the same way as the consultations that are to take place shortly with the Hierarchy would have done.</P>
    <P>My experience of legislation in this House has not been happy and it would caution me in many instances about allowing the House to make laws, but there are safeguards on this matter.  I have had the unhappy experience of Ministers using the numbers game in this House, for example on the Criminal Justice Act, the recent gaming Act, the lotteries Bill which is coming up and in the removal of civil juries.  To use numbers to pass any legislation without the fullest consideration is a derogation from democracy.  I welcome any other Fine Gael people who will this time, by virtue of the fact that more than just one person will be standing up tonight, make this free vote more credible.  The last time we had a free vote I was collared after exercising my free choice and when I pointed out that we had a free vote I <Col N="220" /> was told that we more or less agreed to abstain, even though we had a free vote. That means that we were free but not really free.  This is more or less the same, but people are standing up to do the job they were elected to do, and that is good. This time I suppose, not standing alone, I will not be Skelly the rebel, the maverick, or a bushwhacker as one Minister called me on other legislation.</P>
    <P>We are making progress and the pace is being forced.  I am glad to see the pace being forced.  I know that a huge body of legislation is to come in here, but we have had an opportunity &mdash; certainly from the type of Deputies that we have on this side of the House in Fine Gael and Labour, who can bring forward progressive legislation like this &mdash; with a bit of encouragement to make great strides towards relieving society of the injustices that are predominant in it.  I accept that there is a very significant demand that the people be given a chance to express their views on whether divorce legislation is needed. The joint committee in their submission made a significant contribution to our knowledge of marriage breakdown and ways of preventing it.  In that sense it is a step forward to have gone from the 1967 committee to the 1980 motion and then to the committee which dragged on for a couple of years.</P>
    <P>It is significant that, even though small in number, the Labour Party have brought in this Bill.  Fine Gael have an opportunity of a free vote, it has been emphasised that it is a free vote, and the gauntlet has been thrown down in many respects to those who have professed themselves to be social-democratic or liberal in their point of view, to be caring and to want a just and caring society.  We will see how they respond to this.  None of us sees any major obstacle in the defects that may be in this Bill &mdash; they have even been acknowledged by the Labour Party &mdash; because we know that the fullest consultation and public debate will take place and that on Committee Stage the Bill will be most carefully and deeply examined.  It will not be legislation passed through on the nod.  We spent a <Col N="221" /> year in this House examining the Criminal Justice Act before it went through and we will spend &mdash; I hope not a year &mdash; as much time as necessary and give it much deep and careful thought before we pass this legislation.  We shall do so with full consultation with the majority religion outside, and all will be able to make their input.  I am not worried that the wrong decision will be made.  We will come up with legislation that will not be classed &ldquo;divorce Irish style&rdquo; or like the first abortive attempt at the contraceptives Bill but will be a fair and compassionate measure which as far as possible will work if we put our minds down to it.</P>
    <P>It is not possible in this short debate to go into the Bill in any great depth, but let us recognise that it is a response to marriage breakdown that we are asking for.  There are three main ways in which we can provide support for marriage and we intend doing that, namely by education, providing better material support and better conciliation and counselling services.  With regard to some of those measures, I must applaud Deputy O'Leary for his research and his own carefully considered Bill.  We will be able to add supporting measures from other people's legislation.  For example, last week the Minister for Women's Affairs introduced the National Marriage Counselling Service which I mentioned in my contribution on the marriage breakdown committee.</P>
    <P>Even after we have provided better preparation for marriage and better material support for marriage and family life, there will still be those whose marriages have broken down.  We will have that problem to an even greater extent and it is wrong to ignore this issue.  We are being asked if we wish to allow the people of this country to express their view on whether they believe that the constitutional ban on divorce should remain.  We could continue to put off that decision until an opinion poll was conducted showing that 70 per cent or 80 per cent of the people wanted some form of divorce legislation.  This is an undemocratic, misguided and wrong motion. It is the type of conduct that should be left <Col N="222" /> to the members of the main Opposition party who are always the first to jump once they are absolutely certain of which way the wind is blowing.  In the matter of slavery, there were very few people initially in favour of the abolition of slavery. Senator Higgins referred to this movement in the Seanad.  After a horrific bombing in England there is usually an outcry in support of hanging but when things die down, perhaps a few months later, a referendum would result in a call for the abolition of hanging.  In that short time there would be calls for contradictory forms of legislation.  The educated process should proceed, even if this Bill is defeated.  We have a duty as legislators to lead.  We cannot lead from behind, saying, &ldquo;There go the mob.  I am their leader, therefore I must follow&rdquo;.  The reality is that we cannot stop people's marriages from breaking down.  We could continue to deny them the right to remarry and that is what this whole debate is about.  We should allow the people to express their views.  Let us offer the people a choice.</P>
    <P>We heard from Deputy Woods about responsibility, care and concern on this issue, but we can see how responsible his party are in depriving their members of a free vote, making them abstain on the issue.  I hope all the so-called free voters and the new PDs and others are watching this performance.  The answer that Fianna Fáil have been begging for over the last number of years will, I hope, be finally given to them because of their attitude towards this legislation and legislation which has put our people on the rack, causing suffering, pain, anguish, mental torture, physical depravity and torment.  Fianna Fáil are playing politics with emotions, with people's lives and, above all, with the lives of innocent children who in their tens of thousands are affected by the lack of courage and integrity of the members of that party who beg to be allowed to hide behind a Whip. Any time urgent legislation comes into this House they have not the guts to make a decision.  That is the kind of representation that they are offering the people.  I shall definitely support this Bill.</P>

      <P>In speaking to this Bill, it is necessary to repeat what Deputy Taylor said last week when moving the Bill on behalf of the Labour Party.  It seems that people who have spoken on the Opposition benches took little notice of what he said.  The main points that he made were that the purpose of the Bill was to give people a choice and that in asking the House to support this Bill he would not preclude or prevent consultation.  Despite this, suggestions have been made, particularly by Deputy Woods, that the Labour Party were trying to ram through this legislation to give divorce on demand.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor said that if the Bill passed Second Stage it would be referred to a special or select committee, or a committee of the whole House.  That should allay the fears of anybody who has reservations about the intentions of the Labour Party.  Despite that, we were subjected to a litany of abuse from Deputy Woods.  Deputy Taylor also said that he was prepared to accept that some Deputies would like to see further safeguards written into the legislation.  That should allay the fears expressed by Deputy O'Malley who, while saying that his party would support the Second Reading of the Bill, said that they would be coming forward with some amendments.  This is quite in order and legitimate and we welcome this indication of support from that Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods in particular, who was spokesman on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, did everything possible to malign the Labour Party and their intentions regarding this Bill.  It is worth referring to some of his comments because it appears to be a total cop-out on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They have said that they would produce a Bill &mdash; but when?  They have been saying that for many years.  Some of the more damaging things which Deputy Woods said need to be corrected.  He said that the Labour Party Bill would provide divorce on demand &mdash; nothing could be further from the truth &mdash; and that there was only a <Col N="224" /> token gesture towards the dependent children.  The Labour Party were accused of outrageous behaviour and of abusing the system of Private Members' time. Minister Dukes said that this procedure was quite legitimate and everybody here who has experience of parliamentary procedure should know that this is enshrined in the Standing Orders of the House. Private Members' time is a device whereby people can, if they so desire, table motions for discussion.  I fail to see how Deputy Woods reached his conclusion. He accused the Labour Party of presenting a cynical picture and of using backroom tactics.  He also accused us of not having the legal backup.  How can he say that?  We did not make known what type of legal advice we had received.  He compared the advice of the Labour Party with that of the Government and said that the Government would have the best advice.  However, it is fair to say that the Government do not always have the correct advice.</P>
    <P>Regarding the accusation of opportunism, the record will have to be put straight.  In the mid-seventies the Labour Party, not capriciously but after a great deal of consideration, decided overwhelmingly at their annual conference in favour of the removal of the constitutional ban on divorce.  More than a decade has since passed and the social, economic and basically human problems associated with family breakdown have become far too pressing to be ignored any longer.  The bringing forward of a Bill a decade or more later can hardly be described as opportunism.  In fairness, we took a decision on divorce in the mid-seventies when the issue was politically controversial and we have not claimed a strong position since then.  That issue is equally controversial today but, nonetheless, we have taken a courageous stance on this matter and our record to date will stand up to examination.</P>
    <P>Today's opinion polls indicate that more than 70 per cent of the electorate would be in favour of divorce in very limited circumstances and that more than 50 per cent would support a referendum on the constitutional prohibition.  These <Col N="225" /> figures have given the larger parties enough courage to address themselves to the problem, or at least to recognise that we have a major problem that will have to be addressed.  I am sorry to have to highlight this point, but it is important that the records show that the Labour Party did not at any time look upon this as a means of securing cheap publicity.</P>
    <P>Having made clear the Labour Party's position on divorce I should like to come to another important point.  This is a historical Bill for the Labour Party and I have been assured my colleagues will give it their full support.  We have taken courageous action of which I am very proud. Most recent statistics show that more than 70,000 Irish families now face marital breakdown.  This is a colossal human tragedy.  More important is the fact that a large number of families, whose numbers are not known, are facing marital break up but these figures have not been registered. It is fair to say that since Labour made clear their position on marital breakdown and divorce there has been a major change in society.  There has been a dramatic change in recent years during which we have been subjected to stresses and strains never experienced by previous generations.  In Cork we have suffered the greatest ever number of job losses with accompanying problems which have put a strain on family units.</P>
    <P>I will give some statistics which need deep consideration.  In December 1984, 3,653 payments were made of deserted wives' allowances and 4,403 payments were made of deserted wives' benefits. One year later, in December 1985, the figure for deserted wives' allowances had increased to 3,965 and to 5,165 for deserted wives' benefit.</P>
    <P>Not included in these figures are deserted husbands.  They have been largely ignored, men who have lost their wives and are charged with having to cope with young families.  While canvassing in the last three general elections I met some of the men who had to go through the humiliating experience &mdash; I do not suggest that it is not humiliating for deserted women &mdash; of having to give up their jobs to try to bring up their children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="226" /> It is traumatic, something that many men are finding it difficult to come to grips with.</P>
    <P>Of course, the greatest victims are the children.  It has been suggested that the Labour Party have not made provision in the Bill for the care of such children or of children following divorce.  That is not true.  Deserted wives cannot provide adequately through maintenance allowances for adequate education for their children.  Indeed, in some cases they cannot clothe or feed them.  Are we still to continue to ignore this major social problem?  Are we to ignore the fact that people who are not married must suffer a certain guilt complex about their union? Many Catholics have been deprived of the sacraments because they cohabit with people to whom they are not legally married. As I said earlier, our primary concern must be for the children of these broken homes, and the Labour Party are anxious that due recognition should be given to their plight.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Legislation.  On one occasion we had representatives from the Commission on Alcoholism.  From the statistics they produced we were left in no doubt about the effect alcoholism has on families and on marital breakdown. Deputy Taylor, as chairman of that committee, is probably more aware than anybody of the extent of the problem arising from alcohol abuse.</P>
    <P>I again express a welcome for the Bill and ask the House to give it its full support. I was heartened by Deputy Skelly's courageous stance on this very serious problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I do not think anybody inside or outside the House can suggest that we have not had debate, discussion, consultation and a full exchange of information on marriage breakdown.  Up to now we had been reluctant even to recognise its existence, much less to speak on it or seek a redress for it.  I have covered many aspects of the problem in the many debates we have had, and tonight I will highlight a point that should have become more obvious <Col N="227" /> to us.  One of the problems one has when discussing this outside the House is the perception and the fears that have been raised regarding the introduction of legislation to put a referendum to the people, one of the most democratic moves we could make.</P>
      <P>This is an area that for too long has needed legal acknowledgment of its existence. Until recently there was a sense of hysteria attached to it.  People did not recognise the responsibility legislators have about it.  We have not been separating the responsibility of the Churches and the State in this regard &mdash; the civil and the sacramental ceremonies.  This has given rise to a sense of confusion among many people who have not been made aware by legislators of the responsibility the Oireachtas has with regard to the introduction of legislation of this kind.  Indeed, I suggest that we have not been able to divide the responsibilities of Church and State in regard to marriage because here, unlike other countries, we have not separated the two ceremonies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first line of the report of the Committee on Marriage Breakdown says that marriage is a legal contract.  We do not tell our young people just how serious this legal contract is.  Unfortunately, it is only when the marriage breaks down that the legal aspect comes to the fore. Women with young children often ask themselves at that stage why they were not in possession of the facts up to then. When putting a referendum before the people we should stress the need to separate Church and State and the legality of the contract of marriage.  In this country there is usually just one ceremony in the church, but in other countries there is the legal ceremony, and the sacramental marriage takes place in the church.  This is clearly seen as a religious ceremony with all it entails and at the legal ceremony the terms of the contract become very clear.  When I explain to people our role as legislators in this area they lose their sense of confusion, and they no longer see legislation as an attack on the Church's perception of what marriage should be.  It is very important that in <Col N="228" /> this debate, and in the campaign which hopefully will follow, this is clearly noted. Too often we have allowed our young people to enter into marriage without pointing out the fact that they are entering into a legal contract.</P>
    <P>In a business partnership, the partners are not obliged to make a lifelong commitment. There has to be an option so that they can get out of that legal partnership. We are constantly told to read the fine print.  Who tells our young people to look at the fine print of the legal contract they are entering when they marry?  It is up to us as legislators not alone to point to the fine print but to separate the legal contract from the church ceremony.  We should legislate for that type of legal acknowledgement.  The only way we can start to tackle the irretrievable breakdown of marriage is to hold a referendum, put the full facts to the people and, with the approval of the people, introduce legislation for divorce.</P>
    <P>One of the problems in this House is that there is so much repetition.  I wish more Opposition Members would put their views on record because that would mean many Government speakers would not have to repeat the same views.  We acknowledge that there is a problem with marriage breakdown in this country, but we have not introduced legislation to enable us to put a referendum on divorce to the electorate.  As legislators we should be ashamed of the fact that we have not tackled this problem.  We have allowed this situation to go unacknowledged legally.</P>
    <P>Many couples are suffering great hardship because of marriage breakdown, but we do not allow them the right to remarry because we refuse to allow them divorce.  What do we do to these people when we deny them that right? Let us take the example of a young, immature couple.  After four or five years the marriage breaks down because of the husband's brutality.  The wife knows nothing of a loving relationship.  She looks on a husband as somebody who treats her violently.  How do their children see marriage?  They do not see family <Col N="229" /> life as a loving relationship.  In their formative years they see the father figure as an image of fear.  We tell people that even if they separate, we will not allow them to enter into a loving relationship.  There is no way we will allow the wife to enter into a legal loving union with a loving and caring husband.  We tell these young children that the only model of fatherhood we will legally allow them is the one where their father was unloving, uncaring and violent.  I do not want to be considered a chauvinist because I could turn that example around, although violence and brutality apply more to mens' treatment of women than <i>vice versa</i>.  But there are young men whose marriages break down and there is no way we will allow them legally to have a loving relationship or to have children in a legal and loving relationship.  Nobody can tell me that should be the real concept of marriage.</P>
    <P>Nobody can tell me that, whatever God one believes in, that God is destructive enough to acknowledge human frailties in all areas of life, to forgive and urge others to forgive, but when it comes to marriage and a mistake is made, He draws the line there.  In other words, He urges tolerance and forgiveness in every area but as the God of love, He decides that if a marriage breaks down the husband or wife is not entitled to a legal loving relationship.  As long as we refuse people the right to vote for divorce legislation that is what we are doing.  I do not believe that we as legislators can allow that kind of tragic, uncaring, almost sadistic attitude to obtain or to say: &ldquo;It is not our affair&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Let us wait until the people rise in unison when we will have to give in, &ldquo;or&rdquo; We have no way of losing the referendum or losing political votes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>How can we condemn the thousands of couples and their children throughout the country not just to the type of limbo we put them into &mdash; legally that is where they are &mdash; but hell with regard to the future and their present realities?  I believe, if we are to be mature &mdash; after all that is what we urge our marriages should be about &mdash; we should point out the legal contractual side of marriage as well.  There is the ceremony in the sacristy <Col N="230" /> of couples signing the book.  I know if I went out and asked people what they believed they were doing in the sacristy when signing that book most of them would think that it was getting another attractive photograph with the priest standing beside them.  Very few of them would realise they were actually signing on behalf of the State and the State's recognition of their marriage, whereas, of now, we will not allow any way out whatsoever.  I believe there is a great amount of ignorance with regard to the responsibility to the State.</P>
    <P>I urge that we have the sacramental marriage ceremony in the Church of one's belief but as well as that, in order to show the seriousness of the matter and the State's responsibility within marriage with all its consequences, we should have a separate ceremony where that is recognised. I also believe, in order to concentrate the minds of our young people on the seriousness of the commitment they are making not only to one another but to the children they have and to society, because we are constantly reminded about how the common good relies on fundamental good family units, that some model of marriage contract should be drawn up as well where the legal consequences, negative and positive, are enshrined and where they would actually know and be aware of what they were taking on when they took on this lifelong commitment.</P>
    <P>It is very unfair of us to have people entering into such a serious relationship, particularly in this country where we do not even allow them a way out, without pointing out that this is the dimension which will become crucial in an irretrievable breakdown situation.  I reiterate what Deputy O'Sullivan said about a comment which Deputy Taylor made last week in introducing this Bill and which is absolutely the bedrock of democracy.  I wish it were a Government Bill not just a Labour Bill.  I will not be optimistic or made enough to think that it would be an all-party Bill because, unfortunately, in the lack of response from the other side of the House, I would be a fool to believe that would happen.  Deputy Taylor said <Col N="231" /> something very fundamental.  He said it was a matter of giving choice to the people.  I do not believe anybody on any side of the House has the right to deny that to people.</P>
    <P>Something else came out of this debate which I would like to reiterate, that was in Deputy Eileen Desmond's moving contribution last week in which she put a lie to a campaign that has been going on for some years by people opposed to the introduction of divorce legislation in Ireland. They raise fears among women that the victims of divorce legislation in Ireland would be women and children. Deputy Desmond and I know as well as every Deputy in the House who is in touch with his constituents that women and children are already the victims. Deputy Desmond said last week and I repeat it now that it was only after the debate last Wednesday night that we introduced a Bill which will do away with discrimination &mdash; the Domicile and Recognition of Divorces Bill &mdash; whereby not alone were women denied the same rights with regard to having recognition of divorce or obtaining divorce or having recognition of it but it was alleged that women were safe and protected now and it would be only with the oncoming of divorce legislation that somehow these poor fragile dependent creatures would be left open to irresponsible men who now, having the freedom to choose, would rush off and dump their first wives. We do a great insult to women and to men when we allege that that is the kind of caper we would believe of them and it does not say much for the kind of integrity we believe obtains in this country.</P>
    <P>There is another point I would like to highlight.  Labour colleagues have referred to the fact that it has been the policy of the Labour Party for some time to uphold, work for and campaign for a referendum on the introduction of divorce legislation in Ireland.  I would like to remind my Fine Gael colleagues that it has been the policy of this party for some years as well.  I can quote from Ard Fheiseanna since 1978 where our members, our grassroots supporters, <Col N="232" /> have consistently voted for Fine Gael in this House and the Seanad to take the leadership and the initiative and put to the country a referendum for the reintroduction of divorce.  It is because of that that I welcome the Taoiseach's statement that a free vote must operate within our party and within the vote tomorrow night.  He is quite right to do this on a matter of conscience like this and considering the number of Fine Gael supporters throughout the country who have shown again and again that they wish that such a referendum be supported.</P>
    <P>I appeal to my Fine Gael colleagues to remember tomorrow night the expectations of our supporters also with regard to supporting a campaign and legislation to allow a referendum on divorce.  We would be selling them short and adding a tremendous amount of disappointment to many of our supporters who swell the ranks of Fine Gael and perceive it as a progressive liberal party who would help and work to bring about a sense of justice, a sense of pluralism and a sense of civil rights in this country which are so acceptable in other countries that they are not even questioned.  The only question we should ask tonight is why has it taken us so long?  Do we honestly believe we live in a morally superior country where marriage breakdown does not occur, where we do not need legal remedies for the problems that breakdown brings about? I am reminded very often of one of the parables from my childhood days of learning what was then termed Christian doctrine.  While I had to struggle theologically with problems of a rich man finding it as hard to enter Heaven as a camel through the eye of a needle, there is one parable that made absolute sense to me even in my young years.  That is the one of the Publican and the Pharisee who visited their place of worship.  the Pharisee, full of moral superiority, believing that he and his behaviour were better than the rest of men, strode right up and thanked his God that he was, fortunately, not like the rest of men.  The Publican came in, remained at the bottom of the place of worship, humbly addressed his God, acknowledged his <Col N="233" /> frailty, sins and failures and asked for forgiveness.  I am paraphrasing, but the parable ended by posing the question: which, in your mind, was the person nearer God and who would get salvation? I often think that we in this country parade around like the Pharisee saying: &ldquo;Thank you, God, we are not like the rest of men, we do not have marriage breakdown, we do not need legal adjustments as to our system because we are better than others&rdquo;.  The greatest truth, maturity and justice we can achieve here is to recognise our frailties, support totally people who are going through such frailties, forgive and tolerate them, work to remove such frailties but, above all, have the honesty to acknowledge them. As legislators, the way we acknowledge them is by introducing instruments into this House that will allow people a legal, decent acknowledgment of an irretrievable breakdown of a marriage with which they have struggled.  There is nobody in this House alleging or suggesting that we should have easy divorce.</P>
    <P>Above all else &mdash; and I shall repeat this every time I talk about divorce or its introduction &mdash; we must remove the myth that goes abroad and which adds to the fear of right, decent-minded people who want to do the right thing, that somehow Ireland will find itself in some kind of a free Reno-style, jumped-into type divorce position, that as one walks down the aisle having been married one is thinking about where one will go to get a divorce.  There is nobody in this House who would not agree with me on this, but it warrants repeating to give the lie to that kind of myth and fear.  Nobody entering into marriage does so but with the highest level of trust, of wanting it to succeed, of wanting love to continue, of wanting the success and protection of a long-term relationship.  When breakdown occurs the experience is filled with pain, trauma, a sense of failure and of guilt.  As long as we in society do not recognise that breakdown, or refuse to give it legal acknowledgement, we add something else &mdash; a sense of failure, of non-acceptance in society.  We alienate and isolate people.  We make them feel they are beyond the pale of civil rights, of <Col N="234" /> legal acknowledgement in this country.</P>
    <P>I might appeal again to my colleagues in Fine Gael to support this Bill.  Nobody in Labour is suggesting that it is perfect, but it constitutes a beginning.  It is the principle we are after.  Even at this late hour &mdash; perhaps my madness has overcome me &mdash; I will yet again make an appeal to Fianna Fáil not to sit and abstain.  Abstention in a situation like this is a total negation of everything for which we were elected, a total lack of acknowledgement of the pain, failure and breakdown of marriage that we know exist outside this House, and even among Members of this House.  Once again I would appeal for leadership.  It is not just good enough to hold a referendum within the lifetime of this Government, but if and when such a referendum is held I again hope that we do not once again sit on the fence and say: &ldquo;Now, we will leave it to the electorate.  Let them make up their minds.  We withdraw.  Politicians have no place in this any longer&rdquo;.  I want responsible, positive, caring legislators to go out and campaign for such a referendum. Only then will we be able to feel that we have a right to be in this House, that we have worked for society, for a justice expected by the people &mdash; and the polls are showing this &mdash; but on which they will reject us massively if we fail them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party, with some courage, have put forward this Bill to allow for the introduction of civil divorce. The party have done so because they are not prepared to behave like an ostrich before one of the most serious social issues of the day.  I and my colleagues believe that the problem caused by marriage breakdown must be faced up to and resolved in a responsible way.  This Bill has helped to concentrate the mind of this House and of public opinion on the need for action.  In my view it has contributed to the growing consensus about the need to amend the Constitution to allow for civil divorce on certain conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not &mdash; nor I am sure does any Member of this House &mdash; advocate <Col N="235" /> divorce for its own sake but because it offers the most reasonable solution to the increasing problems caused by marriage breakdown.  No one with eyes to see can argue that the absence of divorce is preventing Irish marriages from breaking down.  We may find it difficult to quantify the problem precisely, but anyone in contact with a broad cross-section of Irish people knows that breakdown is widespread and increasing.  The fact that the number of women in receipt of deserted wives' allowances and benefit alone has doubled in the ten years since 1976 from 4,800 to 9,700 is, I suggest, an indication of a much wider social trend.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to the legal limbo. so eloquently dealt with by my colleagues, Deputies Taylor and Shatter, on a legal basis.  I must refer to it particularly taking account of my experience over the past three years in the Departments of Health and Social Welfare, when there was an extraordinary cross-section of correspondence coming into those Departments relating to the position of women in particular who found themselves in that position.  We know that the parties to a failed marriage find themselves in an extraordinary legal limbo.  Take the example of a deserted wife who forms a new liaison and has a second family.  She has no right to support from her new partner while he lives nor to succeed to his estate when he dies.  She has no rights under the Family Home Protection Act and cannot obtain a barring order in the event of violence to her or to the children. If deserted, she is not entitled to the deserted wife's benefit or allowance and, if he dies, she is not eligible for a widow's pension.  Her children by the second union are illegitimate with no succession rights to their father's property.  The legal rights of the male partner to such a union are also severely limited.  He has no right to inherit his partner's estate.  He is not his children's legal guardian and cannot have his name on their birth certificates. I can bring anybody who wants to see the heartbreak that that can cause to meet the Ard-Chláraitheoir, who is Secretary of the Department of Health, when they <Col N="236" /> can have vivid proof of that kind of situation. Such a person, in the event of a second liaison, cannot establish his paternity of his children nor prevent his partner from placing them for adoption. His children are only entitled to maintenance if a court can prove the paternity of their father.</P>
    <P>The State, by refusing to allow civil divorce is forcing such people into a legal cul-de-sac from which there is no escape for them or their children.  The absence of divorce is not preventing marriages breaking down but it is creating serious discrimination against some families in this country.  These may not be the families founded on marriage which the Constitution is pledged to uphold but they are families, nonetheless.  A wise political scientist once said that politics does not solve problems, it only settles them. Legislation for civil divorce will not solve the problem of marital breakdown.  What it will do is to settle the problems caused by the growing number of broken marriages.</P>
    <P>Those who argue against divorce warn that the introduction of civil divorce will seriously weaken the commitment to marriage and to the family based on marriage. I do not find this argument convincing. No one has yet been able to identify any causal link between divorce and increased marriage breakdown.  There is no question that many more marriages in the western world break down than they did a generation ago.  However, this is the result of a complex interaction of social, economic, strongly educative and demographic factors which have fundamentally altered the role of marriage and the family in society.  It is without question an aspect of the emancipation of women in society who have been in a framework of impossibility in terms of marital breakdown.  Therefore legislation for civil divorce will not solve the problem of marital breakdown.  These changes may have affected Ireland later in time but that they are with us now is without doubt.  Divorce has followed these changes rather than initiated them.</P>
    <P>The law on marriage, as is in so many other areas of Irish life, is out of step with <Col N="237" /> reality.  The retarded nature of marriage law is inadequate to the situation.  If we pass by this opportunity to amend it, what will happen is that the law on marriage will become increasingly irrelevant to a significant number of married people. Would we be happy about large numbers of people simply deciding to live together &mdash; producing children in many instances &mdash; without any legal status whatsoever?</P>
    <P>I have sufficient confidence in the strength of marriage and family life in this country to argue that divorce will never be a remedy for more than a minority of Ireland's half a million marriages. We should take courage from the experience of Spain which shares with Ireland a firm attachment to Roman Catholic teaching on marriage and the family.</P>
    <P>I met the Minister for Health in Spain and we argued about this point.  When divorce was introduced in Spain three years ago there were widescale predictions that in the year following Spain would have about half a million divorces overnight.  In the three years since divorce was introduced in Spain, some 50,000 couples have split up, well short of the 500,000 or so predicted by many.</P>
    <P>What opponents of divorce also forget is that the majority of divorcees remarry. In other words, the attraction of marriage as an institution remains as strong as ever. The emphasis, however, is changing from an indissoluble union with one person for the rest of one's life to a union with one or more partners.  In denying those whose marriages have irretrievably broken down the right of dissolution and remarriage, the State is imposing a grave injustice on a minority of Irish people.  By failing to rectify this injustice the State is, in my view, actually weakening the institution of marriage by forcing those whose marriages have broken down into illegal, informal arrangements and by bringing the law into contempt.</P>
    <P>The way we face this question of civil divorce has wider implications for our democracy.  Divorce is a remedy of benefit to a minority whose marriages have irretrievably broken down.  The minority Churches are in favour of civil divorce and considered the prohibition <Col N="238" /> in the Constitution discriminates against them.  If we lift our heads and look northwards, there is a substantial minority on this island who live in a jurisdiction which permits divorce.  We have the choice of continuing to enshrine the teaching of the majority faith in our Constitution or coming to terms with the rights and legitimate interests of the minority in this island.</P>
    <P>Against the wishes and rights of the minority in respect of divorce are those of the majority faith shaped by the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church. Everyone accepts that the area of marriage and the family is of vital concern to the Catholic Church and indeed to all other Churches.  I agree with the Taoiseach that the Catholic Hierarchy should be consulted about any changes proposed in marriage law.  What I cannot accept is that the Catholic Church should hold a veto over the introduction of civil divorce to this country.</P>
    <P>The anomalies caused by Church law on annulment &mdash; another name for the dissolution of marriage &mdash; cry out for a remedy.  Since 1976 there have been, on average, between 95 and 100 Church annulments each year.  These marriages are dissolved.  In most cases the parties are free to marry again and the children of these marriages that never existed become illegitimate.  Some of those whose marriages have been annulled have attempted to marry bigamously.  We have already had the unseemly spectacle of a parish priest being convicted by a Circuit Court for officiating at a bigamous marriage.  The conflict between canon and civil law cries out for resolution.</P>
    <P>The Catholic Church has come to terms with divorce in every other country in Europe.  It has come to terms with civil divorce in Northern Ireland.  Is it too much to expect that it would come to terms with civil divorce in this jurisdiction? How long can the Church continue to insist that the State maintains an attitude to marriage that the Church itself does not even try to maintain?</P>
    <P>This Bill, the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, proposes to modify the existing provision of the Constitution <Col N="239" /> which prohibits the Oireachtas from considering legislation on divorce.  Under this Bill, the Oireachtas would be enabled to provide for civil divorce subject to three conditions, that the divorce could only be granted by a court, that the grounds for divorce would be irretrievable breakdown of the marriage and that the needs of a dependent spouse and children were met.  These are important safeguards but I accept that more may be required.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy Taylor, that the drafting of a Bill on which the people would be asked to vote in a constitutional referendum is a matter for a select committee of this House or these Houses.</P>
    <P>Personally I would not like to see divorce permitted within the first two years of marriage.  Divorce should not be an option to a couple in sorting out their initial marital difficulties.  Nor do I think that a divorce should be granted until the parties to a marriage have been formally separated for at least five years.  It is at the stage of formal separation that the often difficult and acrimonious arrangements about the maintenance of dependent spouses, the custody of the children and the division of property should be settled.  It is at this difficult time that I see the mediation service recommended by the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown playing a vital role in helping couples sort out the details of separation with as little bitterness and reproach as possible.  Accordingly, I welcome the recent initiative of the Minister of State with responsibility for Women's Affairs, Deputy Fennell, in launching such a service on a pilot basis.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I hope after some years of separation &mdash; what might be called a cooling off period &mdash; it would be open to a couple to seek a civil divorce from a matrimonial court on the grounds that their marriage has irretrievably broken down.  The court would have the experience of the separation period to draw upon in determining whether or not a dependent spouse or children are adequately looked after.  Where only one party seeks a divorce after the separation <Col N="240" /> period the court may also determine whether or not the marriage has irretrievably broken down.  It will be important to ensure that the procedure for applying for and granting divorce is as free from rancour as possible.  Accordingly, the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown are particularly valuable in this regard.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that Deputy Coveney wishes to speak at this stage.  I will conclude by simply making the point that in all this work &mdash; in the Departments of Health and Social Welfare I have met it every day, particularly in the past three years &mdash; we have to spend money in providing those basic services.  Equally, this House has to face up to its responsibilities. I have no doubt that in the months ahead, irrespective of the outcome of the vote tomorrow night, we will face up to the appalling situation which exists.  I am very pleased that Dáil Éireann is giving a lead on this matter and that the people of the country should be entitled to sign yes or no in a referendum.  If this House gives the leadership, which we must give, the people will support reasonable proposals for civil divorce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for giving me some time.  I find myself in a difficult dilemma in relation to the Second Stage of this Bill.  In principle, a referendum should be held to determine whether or not the people wish to have divorce legislation enacted and in what circumstances and with what safeguards. The Fine Gael party hold the same view. I would prefer if the Government introduced such important legislation rather than have it brought forward in Private Members' time.  However, the Taoiseach has stated that he first wishes to enter into consultations with the Churches on the whole question of marriage breakdown, of which divorce is an important although certainly not the only element. At the conclusion of that process the Taoiseach will decide what legislation to present the Government and to this House.  In the meantime he has agreed that Fine Gael Deputies should have a free vote on the Second Stage of this Bill <Col N="241" /> while at the same time recommending that we vote against it on the grounds that it is premature pending completion of the consultative process with the Churches.</P>
      <P>Let me say, first of all, that I entirely accept the sincerity of the Taoiseach's position as well as his motivation.  Nevertheless, I have to say that I am distinctly uneasy about the implications of voting against this Bill on Second Stage.  It is right that wide consultations should take place with the Churches on this issue.  I do not see, however, that there is anything to consult about in relation to the broad principle of holding a referendum on the subject of divorce, which is what the Second Stage debate is primarily about.  The type of question to be put to the people in a referendum, the circumstances on which divorce might be granted, the safeguards to be built in and some other related matters are all areas of deep concern to the Churches as they are to all of us in this House and many outside of it.  The passage of Second Stage would not seem to me to impinge in any way on this consultative process.  In effect, the passing of Second Stage would simply signify a decision of this House, in principle, to give the people the right to choose in a referendum.  If Second Stage is passed, the Bill will then move on to Committee Stage at some point, where every detail would have to be considered including points arising from the consultative process with the Churches and other groups.  The resultant Bill will vary considerably from what is contained in it at this Stage.  Greater safeguards should be built in and the circumstances in which divorce can and cannot be granted would need to be spelt out in much more detail.  These are all matters proper to an in-depth, mature and rational debate on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context and in view of the importance of the subject matter Committee Stage would be better dealt with by a committee of the whole House rather than by a special or select committee, because no Deputy should be denied a full say on Committee Stage of such an important Bill.  Given the very <Col N="242" /> large number of important Bills at present before this House as well as the length of time necessary for Committee Stage itself, it is inconceivable that the Committee Stage could be completed for many months.  In fact, effectively it cannot be started for several months.  We have never had in the pipeline so much legislation, although that is probably normal in the third and fourth years of the life of a Parliament.  That is the position we are in.  There is no question of this Committee Stage starting or concluding quickly.  The Taoiseach is extremely anxious to proceed quickly with the consultations already referred to.  The likely time frame for a full committee debate does not seem incompatible with the timing of the Taoiseach's consultations with the Churches.  In any case, this House would not agree to the completion of Committee Stage until after the fullest consultations with the Churches and others had ended and the results had been fully considered.</P>
    <P>In summary, my position is that, while ideally I would prefer to wait the Government's own legislation, and I respect the Taoiseach's recommendation, the fact that we have a free vote, with the obligations that that places on individual Deputies, and that I do not believe that the consultative process would be adversely affected by a decision in principle of this House to putting the question of divorce to the people in a referendum compels me, in logic and in conscience, to support the Bill and I shall be doing that.</P>

      <P>I realise that I will not be able to get into the substantial part of what I would like to say on this Bill this evening.  Suffice it for me to put down a benchmark this evening that I would like to contribute to this debate.  Many Deputies have said that this is not perhaps the best forum in which to discuss a subject as serious as this.  In many ways that is true.  On the other hand, I have tried to listen to as much of the debate as possible so far and I have to say that the manner in which the debate is proceeding is helped by the fact that it is taking place in <Col N="243" /> Private Members' time when the strong party political pressures are lifted from Deputies who are freer and less encumbered in what they might say.  Deputy O'Malley when he spoke &mdash; I notice he has not been around very much since to listen to the debate, although he is probably following it in the Official Report &mdash; warned that the Ireland of 50 years ago or indeed 20 years ago cannot be brought <Col N="244" /> back.  That is a statement, quite frankly, that any of us could make, and it goes without saying that we cannot bring back the position of 50 or 20 years ago.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 26 February 1986.</P>

      <P>I am concerned that the new linear accelerator at St Luke's Hospital which was provided by way of a capital grant from my Department has not been brought into use.  Since its installation in October 1984 several efforts have been made to reach agreement with the radiographers on bringing the machine into operation. To date these efforts have not succeeded. A further conciliation conference is taking place in the Labour Court today <Col N="37" /> and I am hopeful that a satisfactory outcome will be arrived at.  In view of the significant capital cost of the machine and its role in the treatment of cancer patients I am determined that the existing situation will not be allowed to continue and that the machine will be put into operation. Alternative options on how this might be brought about will have to be considered if a satisfactory solution is not arrived at quickly in St. Luke's Hospital.</P>

      <P>Persons, who it was claimed, were permanently damaged by whooping cough vaccination were examined by the independent expert medical group on whooping cough vaccination which is composed of three medical experts.  The expert group examined the person and also all the relevant medical records on the case and consulted those doctors, including the family doctor, who had a knowledge of the case, before making their decision. Having carried out this comprehensive examination the group concluded that the person's disability was not caused by whooping cough vaccination.  In the circumstances I am satisfied that it would not be appropriate for me to ask for a second opinion on this case.</P>

      <P>Officials of my Department have had a number of meetings in recent months <Col N="38" /> with voluntary organisations for the disabled to see how the various recommendations in the Green Paper on Services for Disabled People might best be implemented. Further meetings have been arranged for the coming months.</P>
      <P>In the meantime a number of major developments in relation to the care of the physically disabled have taken place. New children's residences are being provided for St. Mary's girls school and St. Joseph's boys school, Cabra for Deaf and Hearing Impaired Children.  Work has started on the St. Joseph's project while the tenders for St. Mary's have been approved.  The provision of a new children's residence at St. Mary's home and school for the blind and sight impaired, Merrion, is in the final stages of planning, and work is expected to start later this year.  Plans for the replacement of the adult accommodation at the home, and the building of a National Blind Centre at Rathmines, Dublin, are being prepared.</P>
      <P>I have made funds available to the Cheshire Foundation to enable it to carry out major schemes of improvements to the Barrett Cheshire Home in Dublin and the Glanmire Cheshire Home in Cork. I have also agreed to make funds available to the foundation in 1987 to enable it to proceed with the building of a new Cheshire Home in Monkstown, County Dublin.  The estimated total cost of all those developments is £18.02 million.</P>
      <P>In addition I have made funds available in the period 1984 to-date to a number of organisations to enable them to carry out minor repairs and improvements to their premises.  The cost of those works come to around £195,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national plan, <i>Building on Reality,</i> provides for funds to be made available for the development of services in the community care area.  Among the projects for the physically disabled I have been able to assist from those development funds are the &ldquo;Abode&rdquo; hostel and day-care centre in Cork, domicilary physiotherapy services in the Eastern Health Board area, a day care centre in Ardee and a home care attendants scheme in the Midland Health Board <Col N="39" /> area.  All of these developments are fully in line with the thrust of the Green Paper which is to develop community care facilities for the disabled.</P>

Decisions on the filling of posts are made by the management of the health boards in the context of the delivery of health services and all the relevant information at their disposal.  This includes factors such as demographic influences, seasonal reasons, and the demand for particular types of services and staff.  In addition the commissioning of new units and facilities meant that health boards redeployed a number of their staff to secure the optimum operational efficiency.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the number of staff employed by health boards at 31 December 1985 totalled 40,265 broken down by boards as follows:</P>

      <P>All but one of the health boards have submitted plans to my Department for the development of family planning services in their respective areas.  The plan proposed by the board outstanding is expected very shortly.  I am satisfied with this progress bearing in mind that each board, before drawing up their plan, had to prepare in the first instance a detailed profile of the family planning services already available in their region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main points emerging from the boards' proposals are (i) that in the light of the amendment to the Health (Family Planing) Act, 1979, family planning services are considered to be readily available in most places and (ii) that it is regarded as a priority that the training of general practitioners in family planning <Col N="43" /> methods be developed so that expert advice is readily available.  Furthermore, some boards propose to establish on a pilot basis a limited number of family planning clinics at health centres-institutions in their areas.</P>
    <P>The plans which have been submitted by the health boards will be the subject of discussion between the boards and my Department.  I am hopeful that the plans will form the basis for a significant improvement in the level of family planning services available.  It would be premature for me to discuss hypothetical action on my part in response to a situation which has not developed.</P>

      <P>One of the objectives of this Government, in so far as the health services are concerned, is the continuous rationalisation of the services so that maximum benefit can be gained from modern developments and new approaches to health care.  Part of this rationalisation process is to identify and discontinue, on a continuing basis, those services and facilities which have been replaced or which must be discontinued in order to make way for new developments.  It was in this context that the Minister for Finance stated in his budget speech that unnecessary and obsolete institutions would be phased out.  The specific facilities and institutions he had in mind were the eight hospitals which I have since announced are to be closed.  The eight hospitals involved are: Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, St. Patrick's Infant Hospital, Blackrock, Eye, Ear &amp; Throat Hospital, Cork, Killarney Isolation Hospital, Castlerea Mental Hospital, Roscrea District Hospital, Longford County Hospital, St. Dympna's Mental Hospital, Carlow.</P>

      <P>Killarney Isolation Hospital is a general practitioner staffed isolation hospital and is the last remaining hospital of this type in the country.  All other infectious diseases units in the country are consultant staffed and function as part of or in association with major hospitals.  This is in line with all the expert medical advice which <Col N="47" /> indicates that isolation facilities are best located within a general hospital complex where the whole range of medical facilities would be available.  The infectious diseases patients treated in this hospital would therefore be more appropriately treated in other Southern Health Board general hospitals and I do not propose to reconsider the decision to close it as an isolation hospital.</P>

      <P>As I have previously indicated in this House, I consider that there is a need for a registration system for hospitals and nursing homes.  The Health (Homes for Incapacitated Persons) Act, which is the current legislation governing the operation of private nursing homes, does not provide for the registration of nursing homes but merely for the notification of the establishment of nursing homes to the relevant health authority.  The introduction of legislation for the registration of hospitals and nursing homes is being considered in the context of detailed proposals which I am currently preparing for submission to Government on the reorganisation of the health services.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have recently introduced new regulations under the 1964 Act which contain much stricter standards for private nursing homes and provide for frequent monitoring of these homes by the health boards. These regulations provide for:</P>
      <P>(i) the keeping of records in respect of patients, staff, fire precautions and equipment.</P>
      <P>(ii) the care of the dying, the making of mortuary arrangements and notification of deaths,</P>

      <P>The amounts of other grants and subsidies cannot be given in advance as payments are made on foot of certified claims from individual local authorities throughout the year.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, apart from the domestic rate support grant &mdash; details of which are as follows &mdash; it is not possible at this stage to give, in the case of each local authority, the total of all other grants and subsidies.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will make funds available to Dublin County Council to refurbish structurally defective prefabricated fireplaces which are a fire hazard in all tenant purchase houses in which prefabricated chimneys were installed with county council permission and approval, and with grants and sanction from his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>My Department recently indicated to Dublin County Council that the replacement of prefabricated chimneys in tenant purchase houses by masonry chimneys would normally qualify for improvement grants, provided that no previous solid fuel-chimney grants were paid in respect of the dwellings within seven years of the commencement of the new installation and that no other chimneys exist within the houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> A request for a capital allocation to finance the after-grant cost of replacing prefabricated chimneys in tenant-purchase houses was received from Dublin County Council on 18 February 1986. This request is under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 55 together.  I am aware of the road needs in this area as a result of examinations carried out by my Department, working in co-operation with local authorities and with the assistance of detailed studies of traffic patterns, road condition and road needs undertaken by An Foras Forbartha and of various traffic and transportation studies. I am satisfied, however, that local authorities in the north-east region have received a reasonable share of the State funds that have been available for road works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's road development policy for the country as a whole is set out in the road plan which was published in January 1985.  The strategy for implementation of this policy and the manner of financing of the policy are outlined in <Col N="58" /> chapter 3 of the plan.  The plan takes into account the foregoing studies and consultations.</P>
    <P>The programme of major projects listed in the plan to be commenced and/or completed during the period 1985-87 includes a proposed by-pass of Dunleer, County Louth, and improvements at Corlatt, County Monaghan, both of which are scheduled to commence this year, together with phase II of the Dundalk inner relief road which is currently under construction.  These three schemes involve a State expenditure of approximately £21 million.  The plan also contains a tentative list of major projects for the period after 1987 including, in the north-east region, major improvements between Balbriggan and Dunleer and between Dundalk and the Northern Ireland Border, together with proposed bypasses-inner relief routes at Cavan, Carrickmacross and Monaghan.</P>
    <P>The road grant allocations to the local authorities in the north-east region this year amount to £9.764 million, which represents an increase of 15 per cent to the level of grant payments to these authorities in 1985.</P>
    <P>Primary responsibility for the improvement and maintenance of regional roads, including the provision of the necessary finance, rests with the local authorities. The authorities may, however, at their own discretion, use the block grant for roads to supplement expenditure from their own resources for works on regional roads (as well as for works on county road improvements and traffic management measures).  The 1986 block grant allocations to the local authorities in the north-east region with responsibility for regional roads amount to £1.363 million, which represents an increase of 31 per cent compared with grant payments under this heading for 1985.  In addition, special grant commitments totalling £464,000 have been notified to these authorities in the current year for strengthening works on regional roads.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to allocate additional roads grants to any local authority, because the funds available in 1986 have been fully allocated.</P>

In addition, capital grants of up to 50 per cent of costs are available for co-disposal site development intended to cater for regional or special industrial waste disposal requirements.</P>

      <P>The primary responsibility for <Col N="64" /> the planning, execution and financing of improvement and maintenance works on county roads rests with local authorities Expenditure on these works is financed from local authorities' own resources and may, in the case of county road improvements be supplemented by the annual block grant for roads paid by my Department.  The manner in which the block grant is spent, including the extent to which it is to be applied to improvement works on county roads, is largely a matter for each local authority.</P>
      <P>The road grants notified to local authorities for 1986 include a sum of £20.4 million which has been allocated by way of block grant.  This is 21 per cent higher than the corresponding grant in 1985 which was in turn 10 per cent higher than the 1984 block grant.  In addition, grant commitments totalling £3 million have been notified to county councils this year to finance improvement works on county roads used mainly for agriculture or forestry, in those parts of the country coming within the scope of the EC western package.  This represents an increase of £1 million compared with 1985.  In May 1985 it was announced that grants of up to 75 per cent of the cost would be paid towards the cost of approved improvement works on county road bridges.</P>
      <P>In so far as local authority resources are concerned, the level of the 1986 rate support grant, when taken with the removal of supplementary welfare demands and the greater flexibility in the use of internal resources, is equivalent to an increase of 6¼ per cent relative to 1985.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is not available in my Department, which is not responsible for the detailed administration of sick leave schemes in the public services as a whole. A survey confined to the non-industrial civil service in respect of the year 1982 is almost completed and the indications are that the average number of working days lost through sick leave in that year was 7.6, which represents approximately 3.34 per cent of the average number of scheduled working days.</P>
      <P>In the absence of any firm estimates of absenteeism rates for the public service as a whole it is not possible to supply the annual cost figure requested by the Deputy.  Moreover, assessments of the cost of absenteeism may vary depending on what cost elements are taken into account and on factors such as the nature of the sick pay scheme.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the amount of money collected from farmers by way of health contributions in the years 1983, 1984 and 1985, excluding arrears; and the method of collection being used as a result of the passing of legislation on land tax.</P>

      <P>Health boards were responsible for the collection of health contributions from full time farmers up to 6 April 1984. Because of a High Court judgment in July, 1982 which involved a change from a notional (RV/Multiplier) to a factual basis of assessment no demands were issued by health boards in 1983.  Technically any demands issued by health boards in 1984 and in 1985 were in respect of arrears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> A total of £4,600,113 was collected by health boards in the years 1983 (£726,423), 1984 (£2,457,408) and 1985 (£1,416,282).</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners who were previously responsible for the collection of health contributions from farmers with other trades or professions were also assigned responsibility for the collection of these contributions from full time farmers with effect from 6 April 1984.  Their record of receipts do not allow the supply of information in the form requested by the Deputy.  However, the Collector General collected a total of £1.83 million from all farmers in the three years ended 31 December 1985.</P>
    <P>A breakdown of receipts collected in respect of each contribution year is as follows:</P>

    <P>With the introduction of the land tax the existing method of collecting health contributions from farmers needs to be reviewed.  The matter is at present under consideration but no decision has yet been taken.

      <P>In 1984 I informed the North Eastern Health Board that I was prepared to make capital funds available for the detailed planning of the extension to the day care centre at the Holy Family school, Cootehill, County Cavan.  In October 1985 my Department wrote to the North Eastern Health Board issuing approval to advance to constructional drawings, specifications and final cost plan stage.  My Department is awaiting this submission from the North Eastern Health Board.  Building of the proposed extension will be considered as sympathetically as possible in the light of the capital resources available to me and the competing position for finance.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any research that has been carried out in this country on the levels of noise in dance halls.  However a report on research carried out in the UK in 1985 by the Institute of Hearing Research reported that loud music in discos or at rock concerts is unlikely to affect the listeners' hearing except in extreme cases.  It is the general view that patrons of dance halls and discotheques, because of the relatively short and infrequent length of their exposure to loud mucic, are not in any great danger.</P>

    <P>The 1985 figure for the Eastern Health Board relates to seven of the ten community care areas.  I will arrange to have the total figure forwarded to the Deputy as soon as the details from the three outstanding community care areas are available.  Because of the format of my Department's annual survey of non-accidental injury, it is not possible to distinguish between the cases where injury was inflicted by parents and those cases where injury was inflicted by other residents in the family home.</P>

      <P>I am interpreting the word &ldquo;rehabilitation&rdquo;<Col N="99" /> as used in the Deputy's question to mean the general welfare of travellers.</P>
      <P>The information which the Deputy requests regarding grants and contributions paid to each health board and voluntary group in respect of the rehabilitation of travelling people in 1985 is not immediately available.  However, I have asked the health boards for the information and I will forward it to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available to me.</P>
      <P>However, information is available on grants made by health boards to voluntary organisations for the provision of pre-school services to traveller children. This information is set out in the following tabular statement.  The Deputy might wish to note that the pre-schools indicated in the table provide this service mainly if not exclusively to traveller children only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the report of the Task Force of Ministers of State on the Travelling People Review Body Report a Government Policy Statement on travellers was issued in July 1984 which gave overall responsibility for the general welfare of travelling people to me as Minister for Health.  It was under my aegis that the committee to monitor the implementation of that policy statement was established in September 1984.  A majority of the committee are either travellers or persons working on behalf of travellers; the remainder of the committee's membership <Col N="100" /> is made up of senior officials from the key Government Departments of Health, Environment, Labour and Education.</P>
    <P>Since its inception the committee has met 19 times and has produced its first report which was presented to me on 4 November 1985.  The report details the progress made in recent times in the provision of services to travellers in a number of areas of importance to the travelling people.  It notes with approval that many of the commitments in the Government policy statement of July 1984 on accommodation, health services, education and job training have been carried out.  For example, the rapid expansion of vocational training facilities for young travellers which exceeds even the recommendations of the review body report is noted with approval as is the publication of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1985.  The Bill is seen to contain certain provisions which are of importance to travellers, for example, in the provision of halting sites and the letting of dwellings.</P>
    <P>The report lists details of improvements in services for travellers including health services, for example, the introduction of the mobile clinic for travellers in the Eastern Health Board area.  I am sending a copy of the report, for his information, to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>In a letter dated 29 October 1985 I received a detailed submission from the North-Western Health Board regarding the provision of a purpose-built day centre for mentally handicapped adults at Carndonagh, County Donegal, I think this may be the proposal to which the Deputy refers.  It is being examined in my Department at present as part of a general review of services for mentally handicapped people in the North-Western Health Board area.  I expect to be in contact with the board on the matter during the coming weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the article referred to, and of the report prepared by the European Organisation of Consumers' Associations on which it was based.  That report showed that, for a representative range of drugs, Ireland and Great Britain occupied a medium position between low and <Col N="104" /> very high cost European countries.  Over 80 per cent of drugs consumed in Ireland are imported from Britain and price control arrangements here are based on the corresponding British domestic prices.  In fact, the report showed that for a selection of commonly used drugs the Irish prices were significantly lower than in Britain.  However, as the report points out, care must be taken in interpreting comparative prices because of differences in the volume and pattern of drug consumption in different countries.</P>
      <P>While the report forecasts a narrowing of price differences within Europe as drug markets are progressively harmonised, in the short term it envisages scope for cost reductions through Government control of manufacturer's prices and through promotion of generic drugs.  Both of these strategies are being pursued by my Department at present in the course of negotiations with the relevant interests.</P>

He appealed against the disallowance of his claim and arising from contentions made by him in support of the appeal the papers were returned to the social welfare officer for further inquiries.</P>
      <P>The inquiries were completed recently and the case was submitted to an appeals officer for determination of means.  The appeals officer decided to hold an oral hearing of the appeal and this was due to take place on 24 February 1986.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is dependent on an applicant being the holder of a qualification certificate and to obtain a qualification certificate an applicant must satisfy certain conditions, including an assessment of means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons in receipt of unemployment benefit are advised by their local offices to apply for a qualification certificate some months prior to the exhaustion of their entitlement to unemployment benefit to minimise the possibility of delay in determining subsequent entitlement to unemployment assistance.  A notification advising the person concerned to apply for a qualification certificate was issued to him on 28 November 1985 and a reminder was issued on 18 December 1985.  He did not, however, apply until 16 January 1986 <Col N="111" /> and the papers were referred to a social welfare officer for investigation of means.</P>

      <P>He is a postal applicant and a voucher for encashment at his local post office in respect of payment to week ending 18 February 1986, less the amount of supplementary welfare allowance which he received pending the outcome of his claim, issued to him on 20 February 1986.

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if she will consider amending the regulations relating to free telephone rental allowance as certain public sector pensioners are not entitled to this allowance on the grounds that many of them are in receipt of less income than eligible contributory or retirement pensioners from her Department who have additional superannuation pensions from their previous employment, and if she will give particular reference to such examples as a person (details supplied) in County Wexford who is in such a position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The free telephone rental allowance scheme was introduced as a measure of assistance for recipients of social welfare type pensions.  Of its very nature, therefore, it excludes persons who do not receive such a qualifying payment.  Any person, whose means are sufficiently low, may qualify for a non-contributory old age pension which will entitle him, subject to the other conditions of the scheme being satisfied, to a <Col N="115" /> free telephone rental allowance.  Inclusion of recipients of non-social welfare type pensions would have serious cost implications for this and other similar schemes administered by the Department and there are no proposals for such an extension in present circumstances.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is not in receipt of a qualifying payment for a free telephone rental allowance.  Neither are his means, from the information available, sufficiently low to qualify him for an old age non-contributory pension.  A free telephone rental allowance cannot, therefore, be granted to him.</P>

      <P>He is, accordingly, in receipt of unemployment assistance at the appropriate maximum weekly rate of £31.75.  The person concerned was in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance, pending the outcome of his claim.  Following verification of the amount due to be recouped to the health board, the person concerned was paid adjusting arrears of £41.30 last week, and adjusting arrears due for the period 9 September to 23 October 1985, amounting to £27.42 will be paid to him this week.  Further weekly payments of £31.75 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit to 17 October 1985 after which date payment was disallowed following an examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.  She appealed against the disallowance of benefit and was examined by a different medical referee on 17 December 1985 who also expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.</P>
      <P>Her appeal has been referred to an appeals officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing of her claim as soon as possible. It is not yet possible to supply a specific date for the hearing due to the large volume of appeals on hand.

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is subject to the condition that a person must be capable of work.  The person concerned exhausted his entitlement to disability benefit on 14 November 1985.  However, he continued to submit medical evidence of incapacity to 14 December 1985.  He furnished a <Col N="124" /> certificate of fitness on 16 December 1985 and simultaneously claimed unemployment assistance.  His claim was allowed from that date.</P>
      <P>He applied for retrospective payment of unemployment assistance for the period 15 November 1985 to 14 December 1985 but his application was not allowed, on the grounds that he did not satisfy the condition of being capable of work during that period.  He has been advised accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of contributory pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires the person concerned to have a yearly average of at least 20 reckonable contributions over the period from 4 January 1954 to 5 April 1985, i.e. the end of the last complete contribution year before he reached age 66.  He does not satisfy this condition as the Department's records show that he had a total of only 617 Irish contributions in the required period.  This is equal to a yearly average of 19.</P>
      <P>Where a person has been employed in another EC country his insurance in that country may be combined with his Irish record to enable him to qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> pension, calculated on the basis of the number of his Irish contributions in proportion to the combined total in the relevant period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned has 365 British contributions in addition to his 617 Irish contributions which gives a combined yearly average of 31.  This entitles him to a <i>pro rata</i> contributory pension at the current rate of £51.45 per week.  He would most probably qualify for a noncontributory old age pension at a higher weekly rate on the basis of the income figures supplied with the question.  He should complete and submit the appropriate application form for that pension <Col N="125" /> if he wishes to be considered for the noncontributory pension instead of his present <i>pro rata</i> old age contributory pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a claimant must be available for employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The availability for employment of any claimant is a question which is decided by deciding officers and appeals officers. The criteria which they use are broadly, whether a genuine desire and intention to obtain work is present, whether commitments exist which might limit the person's freedom to accept, or might prevent acceptance of, full time employment which would normally be suitable and whether restrictions are being imposed by the person on the kind, place or hours of employment acceptable, any of which would unreasonably diminish the person's prospects of obtaining work.  The decisions on availability are made through the interpretation and <Col N="126" /> application of any or all of these broad criteria in the light of, and in relation to, the facts and evidence available in each particular case.</P>
    <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 28 October 1985 but the claim was disallowed on the grounds that she was not available for employment.  The deciding officer took into consideration the fact that the person concerned had not made efforts to obtain work, except at one hospital.</P>
    <P>She appealed against the disallowance and arrangements are being made to have her case determined by an appeals officer at the earliest available opportunity.  Her entitlement to unemployment benefit will be reviewed in the light of the decision of the appeals officer.</P>

      <P>A person who has exhausted entitlement to unemployment benefit cannot requalify for benefit until she has a further 13 weeks of employment which is insurable at a contribution class which provides cover against unemployment. Any weeks of insurable employment after 156 days of benefit have been drawn are counted for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The person concerned exhausted her entitlement to 312 days unemployment benefit on 12 September 1985.  Contributions paid by her after the 157th day of benefit were in respect of employment of a casual nature and inquiries, which will be completed as soon as possible, are being made to establish whether her employment for that period was at a class which provides cover against unemployment. Her entitlement to unemployment benefit will be determined in the light of the outcome of the investigations.  The delay in this case is regretted.</P>

It is not my Department's practice to publish financial details of specific projects as these are regarded as confidential information as between the chairman of the board of management and my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department have been advised by one of the local officers of the Office of Public Works, who inspected works while in progress on a number of occasions, that he was not in a position to certify payments until vouchers of cost became available in December last.</P>

      <P>The funds received by my Department from the European Social Fund are in respect of expenditure incurred in the provision of vocational training programmes in accordance with the regulations and guidelines governing the operation of the European Social Fund.  In so far as the Department expends Exchequer funds on the provision of equipment for programmes of vocational preparation <Col N="153" /> and training in second level school centres, ESF aid is allowed on a depreciation basis only.  Thus any funds provided by the Exchequer towards the cost of providing equipment, be it general or high technology equipment, for school centres involved can only be recouped from the ESF on a depreciation basis over six years.  In the circumstances it will be appreciated that the information requested is not available in the form sought in the question.</P>
      <P>All secondary schools utilised as centres for the programme receive a special supplemental grant to assist in the production of the programme in addition to their normal grants from the Department in respect of the participants.

      <P>A total of £183,700 was allocated to seven projects in County Laois under my Department's Teamwork scheme in 1985.  Because by the large number of projects approved for assistance in 1985 which have continued into the present year, very heavy financial commitments under the scheme have been carried over to 1986.  It has been possible, therefore, to approve grants for only a limited number of new projects in 1986.  As the money available for new projects has now been allocated, it will not be possible to consider further applications under Teamwork this year.</P>
