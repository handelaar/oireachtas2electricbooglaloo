    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he has received a submission from Dublin County Council for a programme of works to up grade the storm water drainage system at Baldoyle in order to alleviate flooding which is very prevalent in that area every winter; if he has sanctioned the necessary funding for this programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no proposals in my Department from Dublin County Council to relieve flooding in the Baldoyle area.  However, Dublin Corporation did <Col N="1516" /> submit a loan application for £1.25 million to my Department in November 1984 in respect of a flood relief scheme for the Baldoyle area.  The application was not accompanied by any report which could be examined or evaluated.  The corporation were requested on a number of occasions to submit a detailed report setting out the problems involved at Baldoyle and their proposals to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It was difficult to hear the Minister.  Was he saying that, although an application for a report was submitted to Dublin Corporation, some necessary detail was absent so that an evaluation could not be carried out? Could he indicate what detail was absent from the application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Just about everything.  It was merely a preliminary indication of an interest on the part of the corporation and whilst they had been asked on a number of occasions, as I have said, to give the detailed information necessary for the proposal to be evaluated, they have not to date responded.  The Deputy would be aware that the area has since transferred to the responsibility of another local authority and there has been no request at all from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>A final question. Has there been any contact between the Minister's Department and Dublin County Council in relation to this problem since they took over administration of this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  In the normal way, proposals are made by the local authority to the Department and are then evaluated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 5 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware of my recent announcement that the SDA and HFA loan schemes were to be more closely aligned.  While all the detailed arrangements of this realignment have not been finalised, I have increased the loan and income limits which apply to SDA loans. The new ordinary loan has been increased to £21,000 and is, in fact, larger than the increase suggested in the questions, and the special category loan to £25,000, an increase of £5,000 in each case.  The income limit which applies to ordinary loans and to home improvement loans has been increased from £8,000 to £10,000.  These increases apply to houses, the contracts for the acquisition of which were entered into on or after 5 June or, in the case of persons building their own houses, where the foundations were completed on or after that date.  In the case of improvement loans, the new income limits will apply where improvement works commenced on or after 5 June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on this development.  It is a most welcome expansion of the SDA loan scheme which is a very popular scheme.  Would there be any possibility in the case of a large amount of overtime being paid, particularly if it occurs in just one year, that the Minister would consider using the gross income rather that the net income for consideration of the maximum income limit of £10,000? <Col N="1518" /> In particular, in the case of a single person who is working overtime, because of the very large amount of tax that would be paid, the gross income would be significantly reduced and it would be quite easy for that person to go over the £10,000 limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has suggested that the gross income might be taken, but would it not be the case in the example given by the Deputy that the gross income would then exceed the maximum allowable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, it was the net income I should have said.  The gross income is taken at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding was that where income could be shown to be unusual and non-recurring the local authority would have some discretion in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The only discretion the local authority have is that they can take the average over a three year period. That gives only a couple of hundred pounds for discretion because of the fact that, if the average for the year in question is any more than a couple of hundred pounds over the £10,000 limit, it will not be considered.  I ask the Minister to consider this question.  It would only arise where a person might be caught with a large amount of overtime in one year and therefore would be over the limit.  In that case his gross income should be looked at.  Where there was a large tax take the local authority should have discretion to give a loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is pushing his luck a little on this occasion.  I increased the income limits by £2,000, from £8,000 to £10,000.  To ask for a further increase in conjunction with that is asking for a little too much.  It is a very sizeable increase in the income limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would look at the problem of people faced with redundancies and where the <Col N="1519" /> local authorities are compelled to take over the house.  Would the Minister consider a joint system where the local authorities and the owner could make some arrangement, if only on a temporary basis, until the person gets employment and is able to pay for his loan again?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will consider an extra allocation of money to Kerry County Council for repairing and surface dressing of county roads as the council has 2,400 miles of county roads to repair and surface dress and the amount of one million pounds which was allocated this year is completely inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 19 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the practice, as established by successive Governments, that local authorities carry full responsibility for the maintenance of county roads and road grants have not, therefore, been provided for this purpose.  I am aware, however, that the condition of county roads is a <Col N="1520" /> matter of serious concern in a number of areas and that some county councils are experiencing difficulties in financing necessary works to these roads.  I have, therefore, asked my Department to examine the overall position urgently in the light of this situation.  I expect to be in a position to make an announcement about the matter in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>In Kerry there are 2,400 miles of county roads.  We have £1.5 million this year to repair the pot holes in those roads.  This is completely inadequate.  The Minister should have steps taken to rectify this very soon before those roads have deteriorated to such an extent that traffic will not be able to pass over them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated that I know some local authorities are experiencing some financing difficulties.  Block grants to local authorities were increased this year by 21 per cent.  That must be of assistance to the authorities.  In addition, since the local authorities prepared their estimates, there have been substantial reductions in the estimates of certain costs which the local authorities would have taken into account.  I am referring to the reduction in energy and oil costs, the reduction in the price of bitumen and the fact that inflation is now running at a much lower level that estimated by the local authorities when preparing their estimates at the turn of the year.  I suggest to local authorities that they should examine their internal estimates to see the extent of those savings on the original estimated figures.  That money should be devoted to county road maintenance.  I appreciate that there is a high mileage of county roads in Kerry.  I was there at the weekend and I thought most of them are being kept in an admirable condition. Perhaps it was just the part of the county I was in.  As I said, I know some authoriites are experiencing some difficulties.  I am examining the matter.  I hope to be able to make an announcement on the matter in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have <Col N="1521" /> brought the Minister on a conducted tour of some of the county roads I know.  He would have changed his mind about the condition of some of them.  I am sure he must accept that £1.5 million for the maintenance of 2,400 miles is completely inadequate.  Unless something is done in County Kerry in the very near future some of those roads will be impassable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that this is a matter of extreme urgency?  Some counties had a cycle of tarring, spraying and surface dressing once every ten years.  Now some counties are unable to repair one mile of their roads this year.  I suggest that under the western scheme, in which there is still an amount of money, funding is available for accommodation roads.  That funding which is subsidised by the EC should be made available in a once off effort to get the roads back into a reasonable condition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the inadequacy of the Minister's reply, unless the announcement in the near future will be very significant, is he aware that in County Galway the cycle between one surface dressing of a road and another is 46 years.  Is he aware of the very serious and dangerous nature of roads generally in the west?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1983, the maximum gross vehicle weight limit for goods vehicles was increased from 32 imperial tons to 38 metric tonnes.  This increase was necessary to bring Irish limits more into line with other European countries and to enable Irish hauliers to compete more effectively in the home and international markets.  In accordance with a 1984 EC directive on the weight and dimension of goods vehicles, Ireland must further increase the maximum gross vehicle weight limit to 40 tonnes after a transitional period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Britain and Ireland obtained a derogation from the directive. They had the agreement of the Community to impose a limit of 38 metric tonnes as opposed to the 40 metric tonnes which applies to the rest of the Community but that situation comes up for review early next year.</P>

      <P>Is it a fact, apart from the derogation, that an increase in the tonnage allowed on roads is being considered or has actually been passed <Col N="1524" /> by the EC?  If that is so, will we have to increase our tonnage accordingly?  Does the Minister not agree that the earlier questions put by Deputies in regard to the cost of repairing roads is a direct result of the enormous tonnage being carried in these trucks?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that under an EC directive of 1984, provision was made for gross vehicle weight of 40 tonnes.  In the case of Ireland and the UK there was a derogation which results in a limit of 38 tonnes.  The period during which the derogation will apply is to be reviewed by the Community early next year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 14 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently increased the fine-on-the-spot from £5 to £25 with effect from 1 July 1986.  Details have already been sent to local authorities and I have asked them to intensify their use of the fine-on-the-spot system.  I have no immediate proposals for an increase in the maximum fine of £800 under the Litter Act.  I am convinced, however, that there is a need for more extensive and effective enforcement of the Act and, in a recent circular, I have called on local authorities to take action accordingly.  I have arranged with my colleagues, the Ministers for Finance and Justice, that an order will be made providing that fines imposed by the courts under the Litter Act would be paid over <Col N="1527" /> to the local authorities concerned rather than into the Exchequer as at present.  I hope this will provide an incentive for local authorities to enforce the Act more widely in their areas.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the problem in this case is detection and that with the increase in indiscriminate dumping the local authorities have no option but to proceed against the landowners?  That is very unfair.  They are the sufferers and the local authorities have now to proceed against them to <Col N="1528" /> clear the dumps and to fence.  It is very unfair to landowners because they have no way of detection either.</P>

I am sending a letter to all of the elected members of local authorities asking for their support, help and co-operation.  We hope to conduct a national advertising campaign supplemented by action programmes in each of the local authority areas.  I would like to take this opportunity to ask those Members of the House who are also members of local authorities to lend their weight and support to that campaign.</P>

      <P>Monaghan County Council had a long discussion yesterday on the Minister's letter.  As I have said, it is very unfair that the sufferers will be innocent people.  Rubbish is thrown over hedges on to land, without either the knowledge or consent of the landowners concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Purely on a financial basis, it will be interesting to say the least from a local authority point of view, if they operate the twin provisions of the £25 on-the-spot litter fine they will come to realise that any court proceedings which they take under the Litter Act, and the fines which might be levied under the provisions of that Act, will in future be paid into the revenue of the local authorities whereas at present those fines are paid into the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has not been what one might describe as any great incentive to local authorities to pursue these cases more diligently in the courts because at present local authorities are responsible for the legal costs, which can be quite considerable, but they do not reap the benefit &mdash; if one could describe it as such &mdash; of <Col N="1529" /> any fines which might be imposed by the courts.  That position is now being changed and, in conjunction with the £25 on-the-spot fine, I hope will act as an incentive to local authorities to pursue the matter more vigorously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain to the Minister that, with the number of indiscriminate dumps there are in my county, we were told that it would cost the local authorities approximately £65,000 to carry out the work themselves to clear up those dumps.  Therefore, the £25 fine would not be of much benefit in those circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will make a statement on the operation of the grant scheme for the £5,000 grant to local authority tenants surrendering their dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme, announced in <i>Building on Reality, 1985-1987</i>, has proved very successful.  From its inception until 31 March 1986, 6,321 applications have been received by local authorities, 4,347 have been approved, and 2,790 have been paid.  As a direct result of the scheme 2,200 dwellings became available for letting to housing applicants in 1985 &mdash; a significant contribution to the housing of nearly 12,000 applicants by local authorities during the year.  So far this year an estimated 1,600 dwellings have similarly become available for letting and I am confident that the total number for the year will exceed the 1985 figures.  As over 40 per cent of the grant recipients have purchased new houses, the scheme is of considerable benefit to the building industry also.  I am also pleased at the way in which the scheme has widened the opportunities for home ownership for so many <Col N="1530" /> people and enabled them to house themselves in dwellings of their choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I might pose two questions arising out of the Minister's reply.  First, would he agree that the scheme, while having many desirable attributes, has one serious disadvantage in that its provisions are having the effect that only people who are in employment are in a position to avail of its benefits and that, consequently, many local authority housing estates are becoming more and more concentrated with people who are all unemployed; that there is an undesirable demographic imbalance taking place, concentrating all unemployed people within certain estates?  Second, does the Minister not regard it as strange that a person wishing to avail of the provisions of this scheme to buy a house can buy any other house that may be for sale except the one in which he is living?  Does the Minister have any plans to vary that system, or introduce a scheme under which a person could avail of the provisions and buy the acutal local authority dwelling in which he happens to be living at the time, if he is so minded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept what appears to be inherent in the first part of the Deputy's question &mdash; that tenants who remain in local authority estates are in some way inferior to those who might opt to avail of the provisions of this scheme.  Also we ought to avail of every opportunity to assist people who have the aspiration for home ownership, which is one of the very positive aspects of this scheme.  I know that in a small number of cases there have been complaints made in regard to certain estates in the Dublin area along the lines outlined by the Deputy.  But I am advised by Dublin Corporation, the main housing authority in the area concerned, that they feel these complaints have been grossly exaggerated. Of course, the question of the management of their estates is primarily one for the housing authority involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the second part of the Deputy's question, one of the main reasons it was possible to introduce this <Col N="1531" /> scheme was that the applicant availing of the grant and vacating his local authority house in order to purchase another, freed that house, making it available in turn to another applicant on the waiting list.  The comparative economics as between providing a new home or being able to offer that vacated unit makes the scheme very attractive as a supplement to the housing programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the view of the sisters and priests serving in the west Tallaght area, in the parishes of Brookfield, Fettercairn and Jobstown, is that the scheme as it operates at present has a totally unintended consequence in that it is producing a ghetto, with unemployment four times the national average and with very serious and unacceptable levels of poverty &mdash; their words, not mine &mdash; and that the danger of serious social unrest in such a context is very grave?  While the situation I have just outlined is true, in their view it can only get progressively worse as a very large population of young children grow into their teens.  Would the Minister accept that that is the view of the priests and nuns working in one araa which has seen a quite unintended side effect of the provisions of the scheme as they operate at present?  Furthermore, does the Minister not accept that it is time the scheme was altered because of this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, the local authority involved hold a somewhat different view.  They say that the reports of the extent of the perceived problem have been grossly exaggerated.  They feel it is manageable.  I am not clear from the Deputy's question whether he feels that the scheme ought to be abandoned.</P>

Is the Minister aware that in the Fettercairn parish, for example, with a population of 700 families, 177 families have left and have been replaced by 95 families who are unemployed?  In Brookfield, of 464 families &mdash; 100 of those being single-parent families &mdash; 55 families have left and the unemployment rate is now up to 65 per cent.  In Jobstown, out of 710 families 113 have left, where the unemployment rate is 61 per cent.  They are the actual figures.</P>

      <P>Donegal County Council suggested at a public inquiry that the traffic volume for that section of road would require that it be built as a dual-carriageway. The road was designed to cater for expected traffic volume in the year 2003, which is standard road design practice.  My Department asked the local authority to examine the economic implicaiton of phasing the construction of the dualled section and starting the road as a single leg at this stage.  As a result of the Deputy's question I have asked for a reexamination as to whether there is necessity for the road to be dualled.</P>

    <P>Cavan County Council.  Who have the statutory responsibility for water pollution in the area, are satisfied that the pig producers generally have been acting responsibly.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree because farmers in the area have been acting very responsibly and according to the terms agreed by all parties.  The water quality of the lake is at much the same level as has been the case for the last few years and steps taken by Cavan County Council last October which prohibited spreading between 15 November 1985 and 15 February 1986, and restricted spreading in the months immediately before and after that period, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, have minimised the pollution load entering the lake by way of run off from the land.  However, the consistently poor weather we have had since the beginning of the year has hindered the expected major improvement in the water quality.  The windy cold weather in the earlier months of the years caused the water to stir up thus affecting the clarity.  This had the knock-on effect of retarding the growth of the submerged vegetation needed for fish to feed.</P>
      <P>The wet weather of the more recent months has also led to an increased runoff from land, that is an increase in nutrient input causing greater algae growth. The latest report available on the condition of the lake shows that there has been a slight improvement in water clarity and that growth in the submerged vegetation has commenced again.  There is no need for any greater concern than heretofore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the improvement in conditions was due to the transporting of the slurry out of the area?  Will the Minister accept <Col N="1542" /> that there is a fear locally that the continued use of the slurry on land which is on a catchment down to the lake will result in more problems?  Those who are concerned about that have suggested that the transport subsidy system should be reintroduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that we should revert to the transport subsidy scheme.  The continuation of the subsidy scheme in 1984 was conditional on the pig producers giving an undertaking that they would assume full responsibility for the financing and administration of the slurry transport arrangements from 1 April 1985.  This undertaking was given and the Sheelin Farmers Association also agreed to participate in the new management committee who oversee the implementation of measures necessary for the preservation and protection of the lake. Basically, there is no reason producers in the Sheelin catchment should be treated differently from others engaged in agriculture or, indeed, industry in the rest of the country.  Effectively, that is what the transport subsidy was doing.  There is a legal obligation on all producers to dispose of waste in a manner which does not lead to water pollution and I am satisfied that the pig producers generally in the Sheelin area have recently been fulfilling this obligation.</P>

If such a facility was provided heating and cooking costs in <Col N="1545" /> those houses would be a lot less expensive and, from the point of view of saving energy, solid fuel should be used.  It is news to me that local authorities throughout the country do not install such ranges in their houses.

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will consider drawing up a scheme which will provide joint operation and funding between local authorities and the task force who operate housing aid for the elderly so <Col N="1546" /> as to provide in particular the essential services of water and sewerage.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 31 together.  The scheme of special housing aid for the elderly, is administered by a task force set up under the aegis of my Department and is operated at local level by the health boards.  The scheme was specially introduced to cater for the housing needs of elderly persons living alone in unfit or insanitary conditions who might not be in a position to contribute towards the cost of necessary repairs to their houses. The scheme has proved extremely popular and is operating very well.  The boards have considerable flexibility in operating the scheme and, within broad guidelines it is a matter for each board to determine how their annual allocation is to be spent. Heretofore, there has been considerable emphasis on repair work; however, the additional funding of £500,000 available this year will facilitate to a greater extent the provision of the basic amenities of a water supply and sewerage facilities where required.  I am not at present contemplating any further changes in the existing arrangements nor would it be appropriate that assistance under the scheme should be provided as a contribution towards the cost of works for which house improvement grants would also be payable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the discretion being given to health boards will allow them, instead of providing 100 per cent funding from the special repairs scheme for the elderly, to provide one-third of the cost if two-thirds has already been approved under the house improvements scheme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an excellent scheme but the Minister should examine how it could be tied in with the task force to provide basic facilities which are so necessary for many old people, but no <Col N="1547" /> available.  With the task force helping the local authorities to implement the house improvement scheme very good work could be done and old people could have their houses improved more quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy has housing grants in mind.  Generally speaking, in the period between approval of a grant and its actual payment the particular works have to be completed, my Department notified of such completion by the applicant, a final inspection carried out and the case processed for payment. It, accordingly, follows that it is not <Col N="1548" /> meaningful to speak of an average period between the approval and payment of a grant as the period involved in each case is primarily dependent on how long the applicant takes to have the work carried out and to claim payment of the grant</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the agency was set up it has advanced 13,100 loans to the total value of £279 million.  At present there are 3,600 applications to a value of over £80 million, of which 2,045 applications have been approved.  That indicates clearly that the agency has played a significant part in enabling many <Col N="1551" /> people of moderate means who could not otherwise hope to obtain housing finance the opportunity to purchase their own homes.  Great credit is due to the agency and its operations in that short period</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that if this scheme had been working as intended he would not have had to pump £7 million of taxpayers' money into it?  Has the theory of the scheme not totally collapsed and are we not now talking about the direct funding of the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  The agency ran into difficulties because its single borrowing instrument was inflation related. With the fall in the rate of inflation that type of arrangement was no longer attractive on the finance market.  The rate of demand by borrowers meant that the agency had to raise a certain amount of finance in the recent past &mdash; it had to resort to short-term borrowing to find the finance to fund the loans.  In effect, the agency was borrowing short and lending long.  We have now changed that to allow the agency to borrow by a range of instruments on both domestic and international markets.  We have continued the income-related loan arrangement and we have introduced a new provision whereby a borrower can borrow on an income-related basis for the first five years of the loan, convertible thereafter to an annuity. It was always the intention of the Government that SDA loans should be brought more closely into line with HFA loans as time went on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I announced earlier during Question Time before the Deputy came in that I had increased the size of SDA loans from £16,000 to £21,000 and from £20,000 to £25,000 in respect of normal and special category loans respectively and that the income limit has been increased from £8,000 to £10,000.  That means the income limit for an SDA loan is similar to the income limit applying for the HFA loan and the size of SDA loans is much nearer to that of HFA loans being offered, namely, £22,500 and £27,000 for <Col N="1552" /> the normal and special categories.  It is the intention of the Government that, over a period as the agency replace their short-term borrowing on the market through using the different instruments now available, they will also take on the funding requirement for SDA-type loans.  That means that three different types of loans are available through Government sources to people of modest income to enable them to purchase their homes.  The agency have done a commendable job and they deserve the gratitude of the House rather than this constant carping.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been a long way around to give the simple answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to my question.  Will the Minister not agree that the original intention of the agency was that they would be funded from pension funds and other sources that were not available and that were not tapped at that stage and will he agree that that structure has now collapsed?  We are back to direct funding by the Department of Finance.  It may be called indirect funding through the agency but the reality is it is funding by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is absolutely wrong.  The Deputy does not seem to understand the arrangements introduced by the Government.  In future the HFA will be enabled to borrow by way of a range of instruments on the financial markets, both domestic and foreign.  The reason the single type of instrument under which the agency were empowered to borrow up to now became unattractive was the singular success of the Government in reducing inflation.  The borrowing was inflation-related and once inflation fell that kind of loan became unattractive on the financial market.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there has been a drop of less than 5 per cent in the number of new house completions in the first five months of 1986 compared with the corresponding period in 1985.  While I am naturally concerned at this development, I am confident that activity in the new private house building sector of the construction industry will recover towards the end of 1986 and during 1987 as the success of the Government's economic policies in restoring a favourable climate for investment, in increasing real disposable incomes, in creating the conditions for declining interest rates and in improving the employment situation will all contribute to increasing demand for new private housing.</P>

      <P>The previous question related to the Housing Finance Agency and earlier questions related to the extraordinary range of incentives and grants made available by the Government. There has never been a wider or more generous range of grants by the Government to house purchasers and there has never been such availability of finance.  I should have mentioned in <Col N="1554" /> relation to arrangements regarding HFA and SDA loans that recently I was in a position to reduce the interest rate chargeable on SDA loans by 1½ per cent and that there has also been a fall in the mortgage rate.  All of those factors will have a significant effect in improving demand during the coming months and when they are taken together with the general improvement in the economic climate I am confident there will be an upswing in the numbers during the latter half of this year and the early part of 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire):</i> I move:</P>
      <P>That paragraph (1) of the Order of the Dáil of 28th May, 1985, which relates to Questions for oral answer appearing on the Order Paper, is hereby amended by the substitution of `and until 4 November, 1986' for `and for a period of one year'.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The motion before the House proposes the extension until 4 November 1986 of the experimental period for operation of the new system of answering oral questions in this House.  The original experimental period of one year ordered by this House on 28 May 1985 will conclude on 11 June 1986.  The extension has been agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges who are currently carrying out an assessment of the operation of the new system.  While it is generally accepted that the new system is successful, a number of points have been raised and suggestions made with regard to its operation and these will need to be taken into account in the course of the committee's assessment.</P>
      <P>The committee require additional time so that detailed technical consideration can be given to the operational aspects of the new system before the question of writing it into our Standing Orders comes before the House.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not opposing this motion.  We agree to the extension of the experimental period, although everyone will agree that, as we have had experience of the new arrangements, a number of difficulties and inconsistencies have arisen.  This extension motion gives us an opportunity to review the situation and possibly to come forward with improved arrangements.</P>
      <P>Putting this motion before the House gives me the opportunity to make some comments on the operation of Question Time.  I feel that, on behalf of this side of the House, I have to express considerable dissatisfaction with the manner in which Question Time has been conducted for some time.  I want to preface my remarks by saying that most parliamentarians will agree that the Parliamentary Question is one of the most important processes available to any Parliament, and to parliamentarians generally.  It is something which was developed by our neighbour across the water, in what is often known as the Mother of Parliaments, and it has been copied in different Parliaments around the world to the advantage of parliamentary procedure and to the working of parliamentary democracy.</P>
      <P>Our Parliament and other Parliaments have various mechanisms open to them to discuss matters, to ventilate subjects and to come to decisions, but none of them is more important than the proper full use of Parliamentary Questions. They enable Deputies on all sides to raise matters which are of particular importance, either nationally or to particular Deputies and their constituents.  They enable Parliament to have a constant investigative role over the Government's administration of our affairs and, in particular, of the operation of bureaucracy. I do not think anyone would disagree that Parliamentary Questions are one of the great safeguards available to people in a parliamentary democracy.  Therefore, it is very necessary that, consistent with good order, they should be given the greatest possible freedom to serve the parliamentary process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to say, a Cheann Comhairle, that in a number of matters your rulings <Col N="1635" /> have inhibited the full and proper use of Parliamentary Questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must intervene. Standing Orders relating to Question Time and the procedure at Question Time are of course proper subjects to raise or discuss in this debate but I have to rule firmly that the rulings of the Chair are not open for debate or for criticism on this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the reason, whether the Standing Orders or the interpretation of those Standing Orders which has grown up over the years, I believe there is a very real cause for complaint about the present position.  I also believe it is in the best interests of this House that the system of Parliamentary Questions should be operated as freely, as openly and with as little restraint as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most Deputies are aware of the fact that, in the media and among the general public, there are complaints about the relevance of this House.  It is often said in public that this House does not always deal with matters of urgent public importance and that sometimes our debates seem to be unrelated to what people would call the real world outside.  But if there is one way this House can make <Col N="1636" /> itself totally and completely relevant and serve the very best interests of the people in looking into every aspect of their national life and the administration of their affairs, it is through the proper use of the Parliamentary Question.  I believe it is the duty of the Chair to strain Standing Orders to try to give the greatest possible latitude and freedom in this regard.  That is of the essence of parliamentary democracy and it is essential for the proper administration of our affairs in this House.</P>
    <P>One thing that could make this House instantly relevant and enable it to deal topically and contemperaneously with matters of importance in the public mind, as they arise, is the full use of the Private Notice Question.  For some time we have consistently had question after question ruled out because it was stated that, apparently, the questions did not conform with the requirement of being either urgent or of public importance.  There is a real need to bring about a change in that regard.  When something happens of public interest, when something arises quickly, as happens very often today, that matter will be discussed in our newspapers, on radio programmes, and in interviews on radio and television right through the day but very often this House cannot discuss that particular issue.  We have to wait a certain period before we can come to grips with it if at all, and very often then it has been forgotten and the public mind has moved to another issue.</P>
    <P>I know from my experience on the other side of the House &mdash; I am sure the Taoiseach and Ministers often feel the same &mdash; that Ministers often wish to have an opportunity to reply to some Private Notice Questions because it would give them an opportunity to explain the Government's position and their reaction. But just as we are impeded, limited and inhibited from raising particular issues, so the Government are inhibited from being given the opportunity to put their point of view in regard to a particular issue.</P>
    <P>On a matter which has arisen recently, <Col N="1637" /> a matter of some very considerable public importance, there was a great deal of speculation, probably unfair speculation &mdash; maybe unfounded &mdash; in our newspapers, and we sought to have the matter dealt with authoritatively by the Taoiseach so that the record could be put straight.  The question was not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let me help the Deputy.  If the Deputy wishes to cite a certain question for the purpose of showing that Standing Orders need to be changed the Chair could not and would not object to that, but if the Deputy is citing a certain specific question for the purpose of showing that the Chair erred either innocently or wilfully then he would be grossly out of order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all concerned with saying that the Chair erred.  I am just outlining the position we find ourselves confronted with.  A matter of very great public importance was dealt with at large in the newspapers and as a result of the newspaper reporting a number of people were placed under suspicion and it was absolutely proper and necessary that the matter be dealt with here authoritatively by the Taoiseach at the earliest possible moment in everybody's interest.  The question that was put down by Deputy Michael may say it, put down by Deputy Michael Woods as a Private Notice Question because that might have led to its being ruled out of order because it was not of urgent public importance.  Deputy Michael Woods went the other way and exercised patience and restraint and put down a question in the normal way to the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The question was to ask the Taoiseach if he will give the Dáil an assurance that no Minister has been involved in matters which are the subject of an investigation by the Garda into fraudulent transactions. That is a very straightforward, reasonable and responsible approach by Deputy Michael Woods in regard to this matter.  He very carefully and rightly refrained from making any implications, imputations or accusations against anybody. He simply asked the Taoiseach to give, as is his duty as Taoiseach, a statement of what exactly the position is.  I think I can say for a number of people that, if the Taoiseach were in a position to give us a certain assurance on that, there would be great relief all round this House.  However, it seems that this question had to be ruled out under Standing Order No. 33 because, it was stated, it contained argument.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter written to Deputy Michael Woods says nothing about imputation.  I will read the letter which you sent to Deputy Michael Woods:</P>
      <P>Dear Deputy Woods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1639" /> I regret that I have had to disallow the question addressed by you to the Taoiseach asking him to give the Dáil an assurance that no Minister has been involved in matters which are the subject of an investigation by the Gardaí into fraudulent transactions and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>The letter goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The question contains argument.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>Tom Fitzpatrick, T.D., Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Deputy to bear with me for one second.  I must put on the record with the Deputy's consent that subsequent to that letter Deputy Vincent Brady called to my office.  I referred him to Standing Order No. 33 which reads:</P>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle shall examine every Question in order to ensure that its purpose is to elicit information upon or to elucidate matters of fact or of policy, that it is as brief as possible, and that it contains no argument or personal imputation.  The Ceann Comhairle, or the Clerk under his authority, may amend any Question, after consultation with the member responsible for the Question, to secure its compliance with Standing Orders.</P>
      <P>I told Deputy Brady I realised that &ldquo;imputation&rdquo; did not appear in the letter but that it was ruled out under Standing Order No. 33 and I referred specifically to imputation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that you had discussion with Deputy Vincent Brady but I can only take your letter to Deputy Woods as the authoritative statement by the Chair on this matter.  That letter is quite specific.  It contains one short, curt sentence: &ldquo;The question contains argument.&rdquo; In your rejection of Deputy Woods' question by letter to Deputy <Col N="1640" /> Woods there is no reference whatsoever to imputation.  I am very glad to say that in my view Deputy Woods made no imputation against anybody and, very rightly, simply asked for a statement by the Taoiseach.  I know from Deputy Woods that if the Taoiseach made a statement or gave us an assurance with the full authority of his office, as far as we are concerned that would end the matter and I think there would not even be a supplementary question.  However, I am concerned that a question of this kind is in the public interest and not because of anything that has happened, not because I am making any accusation or implication against anybody but because of stories that have been carried in the newspapers, it was absolutely essential that a statement be made in this House by way of reply to Deputy Woods' question.  If these Standing Orders and the interpretation of them are such that questions like that cannot be answered by the Taoiseach, much as he might wish to do so, then something will have to be changed. Let me direct your attention, Sir, to another matter in this regard.  You are relying, or you relied, or your office relied&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    <P>&ldquo;The Ceann Comhairle, or the Clerk under his authority, may amend any Question after consultation with the member responsible for the Question, <Col N="1641" /> to secure its compliance with Standing Orders&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have had occasion previously to raise that very aspect of Questions, that Deputies through no fault of their own but perhaps through inexperience or lack of knowledge of the niceties and subtleties of Standing Orders and precedent may put down a question in such a way that there is no alternative but to rule it out.  I remember in this House when if a Deputy put down such a question very often the staff or somebody deputed by the Ceann Comhairle's office would approach that Deputy pointing out that the question had to be ruled out because of this or that aspect of it but that if it were reframed in this way it could be allowed.  That did not happen in the case of Deputy Michael Woods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I must ask you, Sir, in the course of these few remarks of mine if you directed anybody to consult with Deputy Woods and make any suggestion to him because of the importance of this matter from many points of view; if anybody under your direction or guidance approached Deputy Michael Woods and suggested to him or consulted with him as is envisaged by the Standing Order as to how the question could be reframed within the ambit of Standing Orders. That is a reasonable question for me to ask in this context.  It is a major matter when a question of this kind is ruled out because it was suggested that it contained argument.  I cannot see for the life of me how, when you ask the Taoiseach to make a statement, that is argument, but perhaps we can leave that for another day.  If the question by Deputy Woods was incorrectly phrased, surely somebody <Col N="1642" /> should have indicated to Deputy Woods why it could not be admitted and in what way it might be reframed to enable it to come before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Standing Order says that the Ceann Comhairle may.  Further to that, I teased this out. We discussed the question with the Chief Whip of Fianna Fáil for nearly ten minutes and there was no question of amending it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>One way or another we have now arrived at the impossible position where serious matters are raised about Members of this House in the press and neither by way of Private Notice Question nor by way of normal question to the Taoiseach asking for a statement can the matter be raised in this House. Sir, you would have to acknowledge that that is putting Deputies in the House, particularly the Opposition in a straitjacket which makes it very difficult for them to discharge their responsibility to the parliamentary process because the Government have the primary responsibility in administering our affairs.  However, the Opposition too, have a responsibility to the parliamentay process and to the public to raise matters here &mdash; and to seek answers to them &mdash; which are of concern to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there are Standing Orders and if the burden of precedent in interpretation of those Standing Orders is such that a question of this kind cannot, within a reasonable period of time, be addressed to the Taoiseach then everybody in this House should be concerned, particularly you, Sir, whose responsibility it is to see that this House functions well and efficiently in discharging its duty to the people and that every Deputy in this House is given every possible opportunity to fully discharge his or her role as a public representative. An examination must be made of the whole matter of the admission of Private Notice Questions, whether the existing rules in regard to them, as interpreted over the years, are too stringent and whether there is some way in which the process of Private Notice Questions <Col N="1643" /> can be used to make this House more relevant, topical and of greater interest to the general public.</P>
    <P>In Standing Order No. 33 the concept that a question can be ruled out because it contains argument is one which if pushed to any distance, would rule out every question on the Order Paper.  I looked through the Order Paper very carefully today and I can hardly see a single question on it which could not be regarded as containing argument of some kind.  If the Standing Order forbids the putting down or the admission of questions which contain argument then the Standing Order should be changed.</P>
    <P>I also wish to make the point that the very way in which Standing Order No. 33 is constructed recognises the danger that if it were pushed too far it would become unrealistic.  That is why there is an addendum as it were, the last sentence in Standing Order No. 33, because the subtlety of whether a question contains argument is a fine one.  The people who framed these Standing Orders obviously put in this proviso that the Ceann Comhairle may, through his office, have that situation rectified.  Sir, I do not think you should place too much emphasis on the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; because as we all know, in parliamentary drafting &ldquo;may&rdquo; has a very significance which is different from the way it is used in ordinary parlance.  The fact that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used there is an invitation to you to use this power where necessary.  This is certainly a case when it was necessary for you to consult or send one of your staff to Deputy Michael Woods to advise him as to how this question on this matter of great public importance could be raised.</P>
    <P>Sir, I hope I have made my views fairly clear.  We agree to the extension of the experimental period for questions but the whole administration of the process of parliamentary questions should be examined with a view to its improvement so that, above all else, this House can deal contemporaneously and urgently with matters arising from time to time which are the subject of widespread comment in the media but which, because of the <Col N="1644" /> way things are in this House, cannot be discussed at the time when we think they should be discussed.</P>

      <P>I hope that if Deputies are not satisfied with Standing Orders that a proposal to amend them will be brought before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges before 4 November next when this matter is up for review again.  A concrete effort should be made to at least have it considered there and it is not the duty of the Chair to do that, as a matter of fact it would not be in order for the Chair to do so.</P>

      <P>I accept that the present operation of Standing Order No. 33 and the manner in which it has operated over many decades at times gives rise to a sense of frustration on the part of the Opposition.  I have vivid memories of my own sense of frustration in that regard and I suspect, a Cheann Comhairle, if you were to delve into your own memory you might find a similar sense of frustration in the past.  I understand and accept that and it is reasonable that the matter should be examined further by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges although there are obvious difficulties about departing from a well established precedent and difficulties in redefining the edges of boundaries if one does so.  I must add, however, that the selection of the example cited by the Leader of the Opposition was ill-judged and inappropriate. It would be quite improper for me to comment in the House, under any circumstances, on any incomplete police inquiries simply because Deputies of the House have been interviewed by the Garda, one of whom has issued a statement of denial in respect of certain imputations. This matter must be left to the Garda and, if appropriate, to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The principle purpose of the Bill is to provide for the further financing of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited by extending the limits in current legislation.</P>
      <P>Specifically, the Bill provides for</P>
      <P>(1)  an increase from £120 million to £130 million in the aggregate of the amounts which the Minister for Finance may subscribe in taking up shares in the company, and</P>
      <P>(2)  an increase from £60 million to £105 million in the aggregate amount of grant-in-aid, voted annually, which may be made to the company.</P>
      <P>It also provides that the level of remuneration, allowances and conditions of the officers and servants of the company shall be subject to my approval given with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Share capital subscribed to the company is used for capital expenditure on the Industrial Estate at Shannon and in the mid-west region and west and south west Offaly.  The main headings of expenditure are land acquisition, construction of factories and ancillary works.  A small <Col N="1646" /> proportion is expended on tourism projects of a capital nature.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid moneys are applied towards meeting the company's running expenses and providing financial assistance to companies on the Shannon Industrial Estate.  A substantial part of the company's running expenses relates to the administration of its small indigenous industry programme in the mid-west region where, however, grants for plant and equipment, training, R &amp; D and other programmes come from the IDA under full delegated grant giving authority to Shannon Development.  I should add here that the major proportion &mdash; 70 per cent &mdash; of their administration costs are generated by the company primarily from the rent on factory space.</P>
    <P>In relation to running expenses, it is also relevant to point out that the significant element of these arising from the company's tourism activities used to be met by a special grant-in-aid for which the Minister for Tourism was specifically accountable, notwithstanding the fact that the amount comes within the overall limit being amended by section 3 of this Bill.  Following reassignment of ministerial portfolios earlier this year, responsibility for this expenditure now belongs with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, which change will I hope facilitate a more coherent and integrated approach by my Department to their role in relation to the company.</P>
    <P>Accumulated expenditure by Shannon Development under the share capital and grant-in-aid headings as at 31 May 1986 amounted to £91.6 million and £60 million respectively.  In fact, the grant-in-aid limit has been reached and the company has been relying, in the meantime, on a combination of own resources income and bank borrowings to meet its obligations. It is, therefore, a matter of urgency that these limits now be increased.  It is estimated that the increases proposed will suffice until 1990.</P>
    <P>The type of control proposed in section 4 in relation to remuneration and conditions of the staff of the company is now being inserted in relevant statues governing the different State companies <Col N="1647" /> as the opportunity arises.</P>
    <P>The last occasion on which legislation increasing the company's financial limits was enacted was May 1983 and while the company, as has the rest of the country, found the intervening period to be difficult, I am pleased to be able to report steady progress in all of the company's activities, in particular in the nationally important activity of employment creation with a total net growth of 400 in employment on the Shannon free zone and in small indigenous industry in the mid-west region.  Today, employment on the free zone stands at 4,400 while small industry employment is now 5,300 in 700 firms.  It is worth noting that in 1978 when the programme commenced, there were 350 small industry firms employing 3,000 people in the region.  The increases since 1983 may seem small but must be looked at in the context of the declining trend for manufacturing employment on a national basis.  An even more significant indication of the impact of Shannon Development initiatives is that the number of small firm exporters in now over 100 compared to approximately 20 in 1978.</P>
    <P>One of the major developments affecting SFADCo which occurred since passage of the 1983 legislation has of course been the publication of the Government's White Paper on Industrial Policy in July 1984, the major provisions of which have been incorporated in the Industrial Development Act recently passed by the Oireachtas.  This has direct relevance for the company both in relation to the promotion of industry on the free zone and to its small indigenous industry programme under the terms of its delegated authority from the IDA.</P>
    <P>The objective of the new industrial policy will be to develop a strong and internationally competitive industrial sector made up of both Irish and foreign owned firms, creating and maintaining the maximum number of sustainable jobs, maximising value-added in Ireland, promoting more rapid development of our natural resource-based industries and promoting the integration of foreign <Col N="1648" /> owned industry into the Irish economy through greater linkages.</P>
    <P>Shannon Development will be implementing the new policies and in particular will be applying the new selectivity criteria in vetting projects both in terms of focusing on the need to develop and increase linkages between overseas and indigenous industry and in particular to the development of import substitution and export markets.  Employment creation, viability and technological content, will of course continue to be major factors in the assessment of projects.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the development of our natural resource-based sector is a major plank of the new industrial policy.  The Government have assigned to SFADCo the very important role of conducting a pilot project on the development of the food processing sector.  The priority areas for action by the company include:</P>
    <P>&mdash;increasing the number of highcalibre entrepreneurs operating well structured firms in the food processing industry;</P>
    <P>&mdash;stimulating the development of quality new products;</P>
    <P>&mdash;developing and testing initiatives and programmes which, if successful, will be applied on a national basis.</P>
    <P>The company's new food processing centre at the Raheen Industrial Estate, Limerick, which I recently had the pleasure of opening is a practical example of what is needed in terms of the physical ambience and support infrastructure for this sector and as the 43,000 sq. ft. centre is already fully occupied construction of a further 20,000 sq. ft. will start before the year end.</P>
    <P>The food processing and agri-business sector is one of the country's largest employers with approximately 20 per cent of the total workforce.  The industry is well diversified in processing techniques and products.  Additionally, it is well dispersed throughout the country giving it economic and social importance of national dimension.  However, compared to other food processing countries <Col N="1649" /> our efforts are mainly concentrated in commodity products.  As a consequence we miss out on price, profit and employment opportunities.  I strongly believe that to advance we need to produce high value-added process products for specific market niches.  To achieve this we need a major expansion of the population of creative food firms producing quality products for carefully researched markets both at home and abroad, but particularly abroad.</P>
    <P>The pilot task given to SFADCo is to find the ways to achieve this goal.  I should emphasise, however, my own belief in the dramatic potential which this sector has and my own impatience to see greater results.  I am currently having discussions with the company to see how these greater results can be achieved through an intensification of SFADCo's present activities.</P>
    <P>Another major development affecting SFADCo in recent times has been the exhaustive scrutiny of their affairs by the Dáil Committee on Public Expenditure which culminated in the recent comprehensive report on the company.  The Dáil will, of course, have another opportunity to discuss the contents of that report in detail, but I would like to take this opportunity to make a few brief comments. First of all I think it appropriate to thank the members of the committee and indeed the staff of the company whose willing co-operation was acknowledged in the report for their efforts in producing an informative document on the company's affairs.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, possible to take issue with some of the committee's specific recommendations but I feel this should only be done after mature reflection. What I think is relevant to our debate today is the primary conclusion that the company has been highly successful at its appointed tasks &mdash; in my view an accolade well deserved.  Moreover, it is a success story that is recognised internationally. The Shannon free zone is the acknowledged prototype for similar developments elsewhere and the company's advice is eagerly sought by developing countries and by the major multilateral <Col N="1650" /> aid agencies.  Indeed, so convinced are the committee of the validity of this conclusion that they feel the time has come to reorientate the company's work, in particular away from its traffic development and tourism roles.</P>
    <P>I want to state that I have no intention of recommending to the Government the committee's suggestion that the company's traffic development function would be assigned to Aer Rianta or to anybody else.  I feel in any event that this misapprehends the essential nature of the company, whose primary role is in fact to ensure the maintenance and development of the airport.  The fact that it has successfully taken on additional industrial development functions must be seen in this context, and it is important to emphasise, as I have already pointed out, that statutorily the company only acts on behalf of the IDA in the small indigenous industry sector.</P>
    <P>Possibly more important, certainly in the short term, in commenting on the suggestion that SFADCo's traffic development role be reassigned is the impact which recent international events have had on American foreign travel.  Any decline in such traffic will obviously have a significant impact on an airport which is dependent for more than 50 per cent of its terminal traffic on North Atlantic travel and I think Shannon would suffer badly if SFADCo were not able to assist with the type of work which has been decisions by Pan American Airways and Delta Airlines to begin scheduled service into Shannon from the US in 1986. Indeed, it is to be hoped that these developments will help to insulate Shannon from the worst of the downturn being felt by European countries in this respect.</P>
    <P>In commenting on this overall conclusion of the report, I must emphasise that I personally endorse the long established national policy, confirmed by successive Governments, that Shannon be developed as the national transatlantic airport, and that SFADCo have responsibility as the primary body for implementing that policy.  That responsibility involves developing <Col N="1651" /> trade, passenger and services activities in the Shannon region and incorporates by definition such diverse functions as tourism, working with airlines, promotion of business conferences, urban development and industrial use of the airport.</P>
    <P>In questioning the validity of SFADCo's involvement in some of these areas, the report is ignoring the major national benefits that have accrued from the company's ability to pioneer new developments, going as far back as the early sixties.  Examples are the concept of the industrial estates, advance factories, industrial training, charter programmes, specific projects like the historic castles, and the first package holidays into Ireland.</P>
    <P>Precisely because of its multi-functional role, Shannon Development is greater than the sum of its parts.  It brings industry, aviation, tourism and other aspects of development together under one co-ordinated programme, adding a new dimension to the development process which encourages enterprise and innovation.  Indeed, the benefits resulting from this were acknowledged in most positive terms in the OECD report &ldquo;Innovation in Irish Industry&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Reference to positive remarks about SFADCo's role in innovation reminds me to welcome the positive conclusion reached by the committee in relation to the activities of the Innovation Centre and the Micro-electronics Applications Centre.  This conclusion accords with my own view and that of my Department. As the report of the Committee outlines, certain structured changes have recently been made in the Micro-electronics Applications Centre with the objective of making it financially self-supporting by 1987.  I am hopeful that this objective can be realised.  The innovation centre is currently examining its future structure and funding and full account will be taken of the committee's recommendations in this examination.</P>
    <P>Much of what I have been saying is sufficient justification for advocating the <Col N="1652" /> increases in financial limits being provided for in this legislation.  This Bill is, in any event, merely an enabling measure which increases the funds which the Dáil may annually provide to the company, and Deputies would obviously have other opportunities in the context of Estimates debates to examine any activities of the company which they feel may not be producing worthwhile results.  I would further emphasise that Shannon Development is but one element of an industrial policy which was the subject of thorough and lengthy reviews by both Telesis and the National Economic and Social Council, leading to adoption of the White Paper to which I have already referred.  Not only did this overall review accept the validity of SFADCo's continued existence, it resulted as I have explained, in SFADCo's role in the food area being extended.  Given that we have the good fortune to be discussing this matter so soon after the Public Expenditure committee have also carried out a very specific review of the company's affairs and endorsed its overall results, I have no hesitation in commending this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill to increase the limits of the existing legislation in relation to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company area.  It provides us with an opportunity to review the operations of the Shannon Development Company.  Since their foundation in 1959, their contribution at regional and national level has been magnificent.  The company's record is a glowing testimonial to enterprise and innovation in the State commercial sector.  Indeed, their example is a shining one to both the public and the private sector.  The last time similar legislation came up for review was in 1983 and the most notable feature of the 1983 amendment of the Bill was to give statutory authority to the company's activities in the small industries sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This opportunity to review the record of SFADCo is essentially welcomed in the light of the findings of the recent examination of the company carried out by the Oireachtas Committee on Public <Col N="1653" /> Expenditure.  It was unfortunate that the publication of the committee's report, which had some useful things to say and which acknowledged the company's success in fulfilling the mandate given to them by Government, should have been marred by the accompanying highly selective press statement issued by the chairman of that committee.  Why such a highly subjective interpretation of the company's position should have accompanied publication of the report of the Dáil committee is, to say the least, a mystery.  Perhaps it may be attributed to the ideological inclinations, or perhaps the Pale mentality &mdash;and I do not mean pale in colour &mdash; of certain individuals. It was not representative of the report; neither was it representative of the views of the members of the committee.  Sufficient to note that the statement was speedily and summarily dismissed by the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Haughey.</P>
    <P>The objective assessment of the past record of the Shannon Development Company is what we may view as their long term objective to serve Irish industrial needs.  The Shannon Development Company's emphasis on quality and innovation since their inception in 1959 has ensured consistently high standards as they went about their appointed task of developing Shannon Airport with, as a corollary, the promotion of tourism and industry in the mid-west and, latterly, the development of small indigenous industries.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the previous amendment of the Act in 1983, the Minister of State at the then Department of Industry and Energy, Deputy Collins, referred to the company's very broad and vital national task in relation to small industries.  The company's mandate included &ldquo;developing and testing concepts and systems which will lead to dramatic growth of small indigenous industries in those areas and to do so in a manner which would pioneer future national programmes.&rdquo;  This signalled the importance of SFADCo within the overall national industrial strategy.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Industrial Policy <Col N="1654" /> pointed out in paragraph 5.3.6. that one of the more successful aspects of our industrial policies during the seventies was the extent to which manufacturing industry had been dispersed throughout the country.  It pledged that regional development will continue to be an important factor in our industrial development policies.  The same White Paper gave SFADCo a central role in its strategy to develop small industries and the food processing sector.  The recent opening of the SFADCo food processing centre in Limerick will encourage entrepreneurs in the food sector and new produce developers.</P>
    <P>All of us in this House give every support to the centre in its test initiatives and programmes to devise market oriented consumer food products so that they can be brought to a viable commercial stage and applied on a national basis.  The greatest possible need for import substitution is in the food processing sector. Exports are the life blood of our island country.  Meeting the exacting standards of continental and world consumer markets and supplying them with quality goods is how we will achieve more jobs and higher living standards.  At present we export a large percentage of our farm products.  We desperately need to move away from commodity type production and into new consumer products for which there is a demand on the international markets.  Concentrated development and integration of our considerable resources in the food sector is, therefore, a key component of the IDA strategy to double industrial output over the next decade.  The pilot projects undertaken by Shannon Development Company are central to the challenge of achieving the full potential of the Irish agri-food sector.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Industrial Policy notes in paragraph 7 that SFADCo's pilot project on food product development will be conducted in co-operation with the NDC in devising a framework for long term supply contracts between farmers and processors.  I should like the Minister to outline what progress, if any, has been made in drawing up guidelines to achieve this level of co-operation between <Col N="1655" /> SFADCo and the NDC in the food processing area.  In 1978 SFADCo were given a special role in the intensive promotion and development of small industrial industries in the mid-west.  Since then, a number of initiatives have been successfully tested by them and are now being applied nationally by the IDA.</P>
    <P>It is generally acknowledged that SFADCo have played a significant role in the IDA's small industries programme, have responsibility for the promotion of small industry in the mid-west and in west and south Offaly.  They will be required to intensify their efforts in this area as we seek to build up and expand the small industries sector in pursuit of increased output and jobs.  At present small enterprises employing fewer than 50 people represent 80 per cent of native Irish manufacturing companies.  It will be necessary to expand our efforts in this area to create new export orientated companies and to facilitate expansion in existing small firms.  SFADCo have a central role in encouraging the development of firms with a strong commitment to product development and marketing.  I am quite confident that they will meet this challenge with the same flair and expertise which has characterised their success in so many areas of endeavour.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas committee noted that the work of SFADCo had been internationally acknowledged as highly successful and presenting a useful development agency model.  Like the Minister, I want to reiterate that the introduction of this Bill to the House and the report of the committee are indeed very timely because it affords us all an opportunity to broaden the scope of the Bill and to include references to the report as we see fit.</P>
    <P>The success of SFADCo is due partly to the open, brief and comprehensive range of authorities assigned to SFADCo but more especially the innovative and enterprising approach pursued by their staff.  Among the commercial sector SFADCo stand out as a source of dynamism and innovation.  Their significance for the development of the mid-west <Col N="1656" /> cannot be under estimated.  The board's planning capacity and management have been proven as they consistently fulfilled their mandate.  Their freedom of manoeuvre in pursuit of their objectives and their freedom to act without excessive Government interference and control must be a factor in the success of the Shannon development.</P>
    <P>The review of the Oireachtas Committe on Public Expenditure questions whether the benefits of the company's small industry role should continue to be felt mainly in a comparatively well-developed region like the mid-west.  My response to that must be that for some time the company's small industry role has implications for industrial development on a nationwide basis.  In assigning responsibility for small native industry to SFADCo in 1978 the Government specifically directed that the company would adopt an intensive and innovative development approach.  In pursuit of this objective the company have become involved in activities which are not exclusively concerned with small industry and which have a national rather that a purely regional significance, such as the establishment of the innovation centre and the national micro-electronics application centre.</P>
    <P>Small industry in Ireland is hampered from reaching its full potential by many difficulties such as marketing deficiencies, management weakness, the high cost of research and development and the extraordinary high costs associated with manufacturing industry which are detrimental to expansion and the sort of promotion we need in manufacturing industry to create the jobs that are so badly needed at present.  The costs of maintaining employment and of keeping industry going are bearing too severely at present to have the overall effect that all of us wish &mdash; to provide jobs for more people.  Indigenous industry needs to become internationally competitive if it is to reverse the trend whereby competing imports now account for nearly 40 per cent of the Irish market compared with 20 per cent a decade ago: likewise, if the majority of Irish firms are to diversify <Col N="1657" /> their exports away from traditional markets and towards new markets.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Industrial Policy warned that:</P>
    <P>At present there are very few small firms which can consistently meet the quality standards laid down by large firms.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if that is the belief of the Government, and it obviously is in this instance, the tremendous potential for increased output and employment through Irish industry supplying large projects remains untapped.  This is something to which we will have to address ourselves if we are to have an expansion of our industrial base.  Small Irish companies must continue to receive the backup from State agencies such as SFADCo in developing the technical know-how to produce high technical components and in producing high quality products both domestically and internationally.</P>
    <P>The Government's national linkage programme depends on upgrading the quality and reliability of the products of small firms.  In this process the Shannon Free Airport Development Company will have an increasingly important role. The Oireachtas Committee on Public Expenditure states:</P>
    <P>For historical reasons, amongst others, SFADCo has been able to adopt a fairly liberal interpretation of industrial and tourism promotion.  This had led it into urban development and re-development and industrial training and promotion of higher education facilities and science and technology. SFADCo has been responsive to needs and innovative as it was required to be in the promotion of small indigenous industry.</P>
    <P>The report also acknowledges that questions about the company's role and performance in the future have arisen in part from the company's success in promoting development in the mid-west.  Thousands of jobs have been created in the Shannon free zone and countless thousands in the <Col N="1658" /> mid-west and beyond in tourism and industry.</P>
    <P>I concur with the Minister when he indicated in his opening address that despite the trends and the difficulties that many regions have encountered, we in the south west were the first to encounter those difficulties.  Now, those difficulties have spread to the remainder of the country, as I outlined recently.  Nevertheless, at least the mid-west held its own.  In fact the number of jobs in that area increased while the other regions were suffering the loss of jobs to the greatest extent that was ever experienced in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly endorse the Oireachtas committee's view that with emphasis on small industry in industrial promotion policy, SFADCo are ideally poised to pilot new approaches to industrial promotion and development with a view to providing the model for other regional development agencies in time. The committee suggest that it is on this basis that SFADCo's mandate be redefined and some of their functions, staff and assets re-assigned as appropriate. That reference and some of the other references to SFADCo in their report were outside their terms of reference. It has been suggested that SFADCo's promotional responsibility for the future development of Shannon Airport should be ended and this function extended to Aer Rianta.  I want a categorical assurance that there is no proposal to do so. I acknowledge the Minister's statement that he has no intention of recommending such a change to the Government or anybody else.  It is well to have the Minister make that point.  I want it said as often as is necessary to make it sink into the minds of those people who are thinking of breaking up a successful operation such as SFADCo as indicated in the report from the committee.</P>
    <P>Air traffic in passengers and cargo handling is projected to increase considerably worldwide over the next few decades.  The experience and expertise built up by the company in the past 27 years must be availed of.  The company must be allowed to continue their three main functions: traffic through Shannon, <Col N="1659" /> industrial development at Shannon and the development of small industries in the region.  They are the three basic aims of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  During the course of a similar debate in 1983 my colleague, Deputy Reynolds, referred to SFADCo's success in generating extra traffic through Shannon during an extremely difficult period in the aviation business and its spinoff effects in economic terms in the region.  The committee's assessment of the company's promotion of tourism/traffic suggests that their outlays on promotion do earn a return for the national economy by extending the average length of stay.</P>
    <P>As the report suggests, there is scope for streamlining the promotional and marketing activities of SFADCo, Aer Rianta and Bord Fáilte.  This has long been my party's approach to the development of tourism marketing as expounded recently by my colleague, Deputy Flynn. We see merit, therefore, in the company's recommendation that a formal agreement be devised with Bord Fáilte for the promotion of tourism in the mid-west. However, the importance of the Shannon Development Company in the economic life of the mid-west and their potential to spearhead regional development in the disadvantaged regions remain linked to the airport, a vital element in the infrastructure of that region.  Therefore, I am not convinced that the Shannon Development Company should relinquish their mandate to develop traffic at Shannon and, as the Minister said in his speech, give it to Aer Rianta or anybody else.  I concur with the Minister on that.</P>
    <P>I keep referring to the committee's report, the isolated outbursts and so forth.  The timing of the introduction of this Bill gives us an opportunity to reflect both on the report and the proposal in the Bill.  As the Minister has said, and I fully agree with him, this is enabling legislation.  The committee's report notes the close inter-relationships which exist between SFADCo and Aer Rianta.  This being the case, it should be possible for <Col N="1660" /> the two bodies to devise the necessary steps to eliminate any duplication and to provide cost effectiveness in the promotion of air traffic by the two bodies at Shannon without a drastic change in the position of the Shannon Development Company <i>vis-á-vis</i> the airport development.</P>
    <P>I fully support the intention of the Bill which is principally to raise the financial facility of taking up shares in the company from the present level of £120 million to £130 million and also the grant-in-aid, which partly pays for the company's administration costs and pays entirely for the grants to industry within the Shannon free zone, from the present level of £60 million to £105 million.  I accept that the cost of grants to small industries administered by SFADCo in the mid-west region outside the Shannon free zone is borne by the IDA.  When we come to Committee Stage we will have a discussion on section 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1986, and I agree with Deputy Lyons that the introduction of this Bill is timely, especially in view of the bad press which followed the report of the Committee on Public Expenditure on the activities of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited.  Since their inception, this company have proved to be of great benefit to the economies of Clare and Limerick in particular.  The company highlighted the major advantages to industrial companies who availed of them.  They came into the area.  There developed a syndrome of jealously in other areas.  In particular, this emanated from the Southern Republic, Cork, where they said that the mid-west region was getting too much largesse from the national coffers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For years we looked at the way in which the former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, brought all the new companies down to Cork and built up a major infrastructure there.  Cork people did not mind the major industries which they had.  When Fords started to crumble when the <Col N="1661" /> change was there after our entry into the EC, what did Cork people do?  They let them go out of the window.  Cork Deputies have come into this House continuously and moaned and groaned and cried about the position of industry in Cork. The IDA are now once more ploughing most of their funds into the Cork region. Yet, we still have Cork Deputies coming into this House and crying about disproportion. What I abhor most of all about the report on the Shannon Free Airport Development Company is the bias which it contains.  Membership of the committee included only one mid-west Deputy, Deputy O'Kennedy.  I would not blame the former Minister for Finance if he had to give way to this totally eastern bias which was evident in the report.  I accept that this report is not part of this Bill.  Therefore, I will get away from it.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the report in his Second Stage speech.  As a Clareman, I would like to acknowledge the role the development company have played in my county since their establishment.  I will give the development company credit for this: they stood up and were counted. One thing which made them hated figures to a certain extent in some parts of the country and in my own county was that they resisted political patronage.  No Minister for Industry and Commerce could use that company as a whipping boy.  I will say this much, they were independent. Their role has changed.  Perhaps they have now adopted a different attitude. Indeed economics demand that such changes be effected.  In fairness the Committee on Public Expenditure are entitled to criticise but, as the Minister has said, there were complementary roles laid down for the development company, to develop airport traffic, in conjunction with Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>I have a feeling that there has developed a rift between the Aer Rianta management and that of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  I might wish Mr. Tom Dunne well in his new role.  Now that the team has been shuffled somewhat the new era and opportunities presented to the management of the <Col N="1662" /> development company should be grasped. I know they have the requisite ability to respond to change.  I was concerned about the matter recently myself.  I contacted Deputies in the mid-west region, the management of the development company and Aer Rianta with a view to devising some type of united approach for the promotion of Shannon.  It should be remembered that the Shannon Free Airport Development Company were responsible for the creation of a new town with a population of 8,000.  There are now more young people, proportionately, in the town of Shannon than there are in any other part of the west, or south, perhaps with the exception of the town of Tallaght.  There is, therefore, a grave responsibility on the development company to be aware of the needs of that community alone on which half of the county of Clare and the town of Limerick are dependent.  I know that the new management team will fully examine their roles, especially since they are being afforded the opportunity &mdash; by way of introduction of this Bill &mdash; to increase from £120 million to £130 million the aggregate amounts which the Minister for Finance may subscribe in taking up shares in the company and an increase from £60 million to £105 million in the aggregate amount of grant-in-aid voted annually which may be made to the company. There is a particular need for the company to concentrate on the promotion of the industrial estate there.</P>
    <P>I was glad to note recently that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had opened a new factory in Shannon.  I know there has been much growth in the high technology area.  I must compliment the outgoing management team, in particular Mr. Paul Quigley, for having placed emphasis on the value of education, on the way he encouraged the establishment of the third level institute, NIHE in Limerick.  He organised superb people to run the institute and acknowledged the value of their work by attracting high technological industries into the industrial estate at Shannon.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the Shannon Free Airport Development <Col N="1663" /> Company have a social role to play. Indeed, in fulfilling that social role, they brought a new town into being.  The report of the Committee on Public Expenditure and the industrial policy enunciated by the Minister's predecessor clearly expected Clare County Council to take over this supervisory or developmental role undertaken by the company over a long period.  I would appeal that the progress be slow in this direction. Apart from its effect on the development company itself, I do not know that the inhabitants of the town are ready for this change.  I know that some progress has been made in talks between the Department of the Environment, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and Clare County Council.  The community would need to give this proposal wholehearted approval before finalisation.</P>
    <P>I am happy that I have spoken on behalf of the people of Clare and indeed the management of the development company.  I thank the Minister for his interest in the area and on the manner in which he expedited introduction of this Bill which I support fully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House affords Members an opportunity to comment on the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and their activities in the mid-west region.  I might pay tribute to their outgoing general manager, Mr. Paul Quigley, a man of ability and integrity, who played a major role in the overall development of the mid-west region at a time of rapid change in industrial development internationally.  Within his term of office he brought about a dismantling of the protectionism that had existed so that there was almost total free trading and that was in a time of crisis and recession.  Indeed the best tribute one can pay him is to have regard to the now thriving development company and industry throughout the mid-west region. Many of the difficulties experienced by other parts of the country during times of economic recession, depression, oil crises and so on have been minimised by <Col N="1664" /> the efforts of the development company in that region.  That is a tribute to the company, to the dedication and commitment of their personnel.  I might also congratulate Mr. Tom Dunne on his appointment as general manager of the company.  He is a man of ability, a dynamic executive, with wide experience in industrial development who has been involved in the company for quite a while. He is keenly aware of the difficulties of attracting industry to the region.  He fully understands the enormous problems of the region and also the opportunities obtaining there.  I have no doubt that, under his leadership, the company will go from strength to strength.  I wish him well in his new post and also all of the personnel of the company in their endeavours which become daily more difficult.</P>
      <P>We are aware that the company have experienced outstanding success in a number of areas.  I am doubtful that the provisions of the Bill will adequately meet the changing circumstances of industry at present.  Indeed it is a more two and a half years since similar legislation was before this House.  Would it not be more appropriate for the Minister to introduce legislation covering a period of, say, five years in order to enable the company to develop in a planned, proper way?  I believe that the amounts provided under the provisions of this Bill will not be adequate to meet the challenges facing the region in ensuing years.  I do not think it desirable that we should have to come back to this House almost every consecutive year seeking authority to increase the amounts payable by the Exchequer to companies like these.  I believe it is bad for the semi-State agencies and for the Oireachtas.  If we are to give them the necessary support to undertake the work that needs to be done in the mid-west region, they need to be able to plan much further ahead than, say, one, two or three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 is objectionable.  Hopefully on Committee Stage we will have an opportunity to deal with it.  We have seen in a number of measures which have come before the House provision being made to take over the management of <Col N="1665" /> staff in various companies.  Here we are dealing with two Ministers, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for the Public Service.  I am concerned that a trend might be developing in legislation like this for the Minister for the Public Service to control personnel in companies like the Shannon Development Company.  This might inhibit the company from attracting people of a sufficiently high calibre into the company. Such people are badly needed in industry. If we have restrictive pay and conditions of employment it will not be helpful in attracting this type of person.  I do not see that it is necessary to have section 4 at all and perhaps the Minister might deal with this point.</P>
    <P>We have had very sophisticated and highly successful industrial projects established in the estate over the past number of years.  We have internationally recognised companies such as Lana-Knit and SPS dealing with hard metals and in 1985 De Beers industrial diamonds celebrated their 25th year in the estate. We have seen multinational companies replace foreign personnel with Irish trained personnel and this development is to be welcomed.  In Westinghouse a direct policy commitment was given by the company management to replace their American personnel with suitably qualified Irish staff at the first available opportunity.  This development should be encouraged in industry generally where multinational and international companies are concerned.  We have many highly qualified young people who would be well able to take over the management of such companies but regrettably many of them are forced to seek employment abroad.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Development Company have undertaken to research agri-business pilot programmes.  There is great potential for development in this area. The company have already carried out research into mariculture.  Along the Shannon estuary sites have been identified which are suitable for the development of fish farming We could substitute home produced fish products for imports. Little has been done in this whole area in <Col N="1666" /> the past few years.  The Shannon Development Company, through one of the schemes they operate with the Youth Employment Agency, have organised with the help of local farmers and business people a co-operative to farm fish at Carrigaholt in west Clare.  This is an important development.  The experience gained there can be used in coastal communities to encourage people to invest in these projects.  There are many job possibilities in this area.</P>
    <P>The Company recognise the difficulties that exist in attracting industry to remote rural areas where there is a lack of infrastructure, telecommunications and so on. We will have to exploit our own natural resources in coastal areas.  That is the only way in which jobs will be provided which, in turn, will mean extra revenue for the State.  If we develop our own fish farming it will cut down on fish importation. We must do it for ourselves.  As we said in the debate on the Fisheries Estimate, it is completely insane to allow the Norwegians, Dutch, Danes and Spanish to come in and do what we could do for ourselves.  I support the development company and the Youth Employment Agency in their efforts to encourage local enterprise to become involved in the training of local people and to use local resources such as they have done in Carrigaholt. There is no hope of attracting any industrial project to this area without involving an enormous cost to the State.</P>
    <P>All that is needed in coastal areas is for people to become involved in pilot projects and to undertake the research and development work.  Companies like the Shannon Development Company could become involved in the management and secretarial end.  A number of projects could be organised along the Shannon estuary, but to date this has not been done.</P>
    <P>The Shannon estuary has been debated here on many occasions but it remains underdeveloped.  I accept that a few major projects are in operation but little has been done to attract more industries. The Harbours Bill which was introduced in the Seanad is totally inadequate and has been rejected by all County Clare <Col N="1667" /> public representatives.  The Bill to develop the Shannon estuary is not expected to be of much benefit to the area and we must look at SFADCo to get involved in the promotion and development of suitable sites for all types of industries.  The potential exists along the estuary.  When the Moneypoint station is in operation there will be potential for fish farming, vegetable growing and co-operatives. We should ask SDAFCo to move into the area and develop sites for industrial projects.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is one industrial site on the Clare side of the Shannon estuary, from Loop Head to Limerick City, that is owned by SFADCo or the IDA.  Many reports on the region have highlighted the potential of the estuary but little has been done about developing the area.  If an industrial concern expresses an interest in establishing an industry on the Clare side of the Shannon estuary we will not be able to offer them a suitable site.  Many companies are considering the Shannon estuary as a location for an industry but we do not have suitable sites.  Unlimited possibilities for the trans-shipment of coal from the site adjacent to the Moneypoint station exist. Many international companies have expressed an interest in trans-shipping from that area.  The ESB have sought planning permission from Clare County Council to transport coal from the site to other locations in the State.  However, a site suitable for any international company has not been purchased or earmarked. I hope the development company will pay attention to that matter in the coming years.  If we are waiting for the Harbours Bill to do anything in that regard we will be waiting for another ten or 20 years.</P>
    <P>Shannon has been promoted by the development company as an ideal location for international services.  Shannon should also be identified as an area for the decentralisation of Government offices. Under a former Fianna Fáil Government an environment section of a Department was transferred to Shannon and that proved very successful.  Shannon is an <Col N="1668" /> ideal location for further decentralisation. Some years ago the development company submitted a request for the decentralisation of Government Departments but, unfortunately, the decentralisation programme was scrapped by the Coalition.  We now have the same old story of all services being located in Dublin.  Dublin is top heavy and cannot cater for any further development of this nature.  Areas like Shannon should be used as a location for a Government Department.</P>
    <P>I note that the 1985 report of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company states that ten small factory units were built in that year.  There is concern that a number of such units, at Kilmihil, Kildysart, Ennistymon, Miltown Malbay and Kilrush, are unoccupied but there is a need for more factory bays.  For example, Ennis Urban District Council have requested that a number of units should be provided at the local industrial estate. Most of the units there have been filled and it is necessary to erect further units there to attract industries to the estate.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that 86 per cent of the factory buildings allocated are occupied.  A small number of units are available for occupation by new industrialists. I should like to urge the Government, and the development company, to continue to build advance factories, particularly in towns like Ennis.  There is a need for further expansion at Smithstown Industrial Estate.  The small industries programme has been very successful in that estate and almost all the units there are occupied.  The Minister should press ahead with the small industry building programme so that we will have factory space available for interested industrialists.</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised that the international recession is lifting and there are encouraging signs in Europe that an upturn is about to take place.  It is desirable that we should have sufficient vacant factory space to avail of any upturn in the economy.  There is an urgent need to develop small industries to link up with bigger concerns.  In the 1985 report the development company indicated that <Col N="1669" /> more than £3 million worth of business was generated by import substitutions in 28 small concerns in the Shannon region. Those companies manufactured small component parts for local industries.  The match-maker scheme operated by the development company has had unique success in this regard.  When the GAC company closed more than 200 people were made redundant and in Smithstown, and other areas of County Clare, a further 200 people lost their jobs.  Those people were employed by companies who were supplying component parts to that bus building plant but, unfortunately, the Government allowed the GAC plant to close.  We saw there the impact such a closure can have on smaller industries in an area.  The whole thing is very depressing and I am asking the Minister to make some effort to get the bus building plant re-opened.  We are all aware of the need for school, rural and city buses; and this year we will be importing about 25 buses which could have been built at Shannon if there had been any initiative by the Government.  Their inaction is tragic and I hope that at this late stage they will salvage the bus company.</P>
    <P>When the Burlington textile factory in Clonlara closed down hundreds of highly skilled people were let go, but there has been no effort to re-open the plant.  We know that because of its nature the textile industry has been receiving EC aid in Britain and Northern Ireland.  Why cannot we get it for industries such as Burlington, instead of allowing them to close down?  We have heard the story that because of their policy on textiles the EC have not been grant aiding companies in that business.  We are told there is over capacity in that industry.  Why are we different from Britain?  I hope the Minister will tell us what efforts he is making to get the Clonlara plant re-opened.</P>
    <P>We welcome the initiative by SFADCo to spread industries throughout County Clare.  We saw industries established in Ennistymon, Scarriff and Tuamgraney, but we are not satisfied that west Clare is being developed properly.  I ask SFADCo to pay special attention to the critical <Col N="1670" /> unemployment level in Kilrush and I direct the Minister's attention to the vacant factory space in the town.  There is a sizeable factory bay there which has been almost totally unoccupied except for an AnCO training course.  A number of units could be opened up there, particularly aimed at fish processing in connection with mariculture and aquaculture production in the Shannon Estuary.</P>
    <P>Some companies were interested in getting projects going at Cappagh.  I am thinking in particular of the vacant old ceramic unit there.  All these vacant units could be developed and supplied by some of the fishing co-operatives which have been established along the estuary.  There was an excellent timber plant in Kilrush but because of Government inactivity &mdash; they did not provide the necessary raw materials for wood processing &mdash; the factory was closed down.  A number of meetings were held and some representatives from the Department of Fisheries and Forestry visited the area and discussed it with local people.  Now the workers are redundant.  They have joined the dole queue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>People have been employed in that small timber mill in Kilrush which was in operation for between 40 and 100 years.  It was a successful small business and it was the duty of the Government to see that it was provided with raw materials. At one time they were in difficulties but the factory was re-opened and it <Col N="1671" /> became a fine little industry, but then this Government allowed it to be closed down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The factory might still be closed in Scarriff because the Government closed it down and the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry did nothing to help.  It is now open thanks to a Spanish firm of wood processors who came in to develop our timber resources which we could not do ourselves.  The Government allowed the Spaniards to exploit our fisheries and now we have the Spaniards exploiting our timber resources, but to good effect.  The Minister is walking away from this because he knows the Government did nothing to protect our timber industry.  Good luck to the Spaniards and I hope they will be successful where the Irish Government failed so miserably in Kilrush and elsewhere.  The picture of Government in action in relation to industry throughout County Clare has been a disaster.  That is why Deputy Taylor-Quinn is so embarrassed today.  She and all of the people of County Clare know the record of the Government in that county.  They are waiting for an election and then the Deputy will have to answer questions on platforms at Scarriff, Kilrush and many other places in Clare&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The record of her Government in relation to the development of <Col N="1672" /> industry in the mid-west region has been a total disaster and Deputies opposite know that quite well.  Were it not for the strenuous work of the development company things would be much worse.</P>
      <P>I should like to compliment the development company on the work they are doing.  They should be encouraged to continue with the work and to press ahead with the development of our own natural resources.  I welcome the attention they are now giving to the agri-business, to food products and to the mariculture area generally.  That must be encouraged.  If we are to succeed we will have to start with our natural resources which are abundant in the region and which have not been exploited to the full.</P>
      <P>I should like also to compliment the development company on their work in respect of the development of Shannon town.  I know the Government have made a decision to transfer the town management functions to Clare County Council. It is well known that every local authority are at their wits' end to manage their affairs and we do not want to see anything happening in Shannon town that will downgrade the services they have at the moment.  If Clare County Council are to be given the function of managing Shannon town, they should be compensated in a way that will ensure no downgrading of services in Shannon.  It is essential in the transfer of functions to Clare County Council that financial provision be made to enable the council to keep up the standards set by the company in Shannon.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of very important developments in the area.  It is important to note that home ownership in Shannon town is 60 per cent.  This has been achieved because of the progressive policies in operation by the company to enable people in the industrial estate and in the town to buy their own homes.  That ideal development must be welcomed.  I hope in any change-over with regard to management functions that care be taken to maintain that development to encourage people to purchase their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall, this legislation is welcome even though there are some points in the <Col N="1673" /> Bill we shall have to discuss on Committee Stage.  We wish to give every encouragement to the development company to press ahead with the overall development of the mid-west region.  We want more expansion in tourism and in the various amenities the company are providing and we want further extensions of the industrial base to other parts of the county.  We want more advance factories to be built where there is need for them so that there will be progressive development of the region in the next few years under a dynamic development company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill in relation to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  It is interesting to look at the report for 1985 which became available in the past few days and to see that the bulk of the activities and expenditure of the company seem to relate to the development of small indigenous industry.  This time eight years ago that was a matter in which they were not involved.  They have been very successful in what they have done in that regard in those eight years.  It has benefited the mid-western region considerably but it has also been beneficial for the country as a whole because much development in respect of small industry that has taken place would not have occurred but for the steps taken in 1978.</P>
      <P>I found it encouraging to hear the support voiced on all sides today for this area of activity of the company.  When I made that suggestion to the company in 1977-78, there was much opposition to the proposal.  I was told it was a foolish move and that it would not be of any value to the region or to the country.  I am glad to see that has proved entirely wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The value of a regional development company such as SFADCo lies to a great extent in their ability to meet changing circumstances and to adapt to those circumstances and needs.  They have done this in the area to which I have referred. The importance of that is understood by the company and the first sentence of the chairman's introduction to the annual <Col N="1674" /> report for 1985 underlines that concept. He said:</P>
    <P>In an environment of accelerated structural technological and market change and slower worldwide growth, a country and its individual enterprises must change faster and more effectively than the world around it if they are to survive and prosper.</P>
    <P>I know Mr. McCabe is a man who is well aware of the need for change and the need to respond to change.  I often wish that those who talk about these matters were equally responsive to that need for change.</P>
    <P>In terms of what the development company should do, a few years ago I suggested that by far the greatest potential for the mid-western region lay in the development of the Shannon estuary and as a clearly successful regional development organisation it seemed to me that SFADCo should become involved in the development of the estuary.  I recognised at that time &mdash; and unfortunately the problem still remains &mdash; the big stumbling block to a company like SFADCo becoming involved in the promotion of the estuary was jurisdictional disputes between Departments.  Because harbour matters were seen primarily as matters for the Department of Transport, as it then was, now the Department of Communications, everybody else had to keep off.  We see these jurisdictional disputes arising quite frequently in terms of potential development.  I regret very much that our public administration continues to be run in a way which allows worthwhile developments to be hindered simply because of jurisdictional disputes and because it would seem not to be appropriate to those concerned to have a regional development organisation, such as Shannon Development, involved in the promotion of something which primarily has to do with harbours.  We have to get over that sort of thinking.  It is not reflected in many other countries.  If some place like the Shannon estuary were identified in another country as being a place of great potential development, all the stops would be pulled out and there would be <Col N="1675" /> no question of jurisdictional disputes, or which Department were supposed to deal with it.  The best people and the best organisations would be put to work to develop it.  That is what should happen here.</P>
    <P>In the Bill produced in the Seanad within the last month on the Shannon estuary, it was disappointing to note that it simply envisages a bigger harbour authority rather than something innovative which would lead to the proper development of the estuary with great benefits to the region and to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>In my fairly considerable experience of them, I have always found the Shannon Development Company prepared to respond to change and to need as far as they could, but they are hidebound by legislation and by the sort of difficulties I have been describing.  It is appropriate to mention at a time like this the retirement of two of the major people associated with Shannon Development over the years, Dr. Brendan O'Regan retired last year.  For many years he was chairman of the company and made a contribution to the development of Shannon and the region which will never be parallelled. Mr. Paul Quigley, the general manager, retired within the last month after serving a very successful term of office during which he carried out his duties with great thoroughness, dedication and commitment.  I wish him well in his well deserved retirement.  I have no doubt that his successor, Mr. Tom Dunne, is a man of equal qualities and I think the company are fortunate that someone as able as he was appointed to that position.</P>
    <P>I want briefly to refer to the question of traffic development at Shannon an area in which the company are involved to a considerable extent.  It has been my experience that one of the great difficulties Shannon has in relation to traffic development is the lack of connections between Shannon and Britain and Shannon and continential Europe.  As is shown by the annual report, the amount of traffic between Shannon and continental Europe is a very small proportion of the <Col N="1676" /> overall traffic and, as far as I know, is entirely represented by charter traffic, and none by scheduled traffic.  The amount of traffic to Britain is much smaller than need be.  That is caused by the fact that for the best part of the year there are only two flights a day each way. They both leave around mid-day, within an hour of one another, and they both arrive within one hour of each.  This service is provided by airlines which are in a cartel on the Irish Sea.  They both charge exactly the same fares and decline to compete with each other.  They provide the connection between Shannon and London at the most inconvenient and useless time of day &mdash; the middle of the day &mdash; and they have consistently declined to provide access to Britain in the morning, returning in the evening.</P>
    <P>I hope that as a result of the recent <i>nouvelles frontieres</i> case at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg these cartels will be broken, that competition will be introduced, that normal competition rules under the Treaty of Rome will have to apply, that we will get a more satisfactory service at Shannon and that this disgraceful cartel arrangement will be brought to a speedy conclusion.  It is obvious that further carriers should be licensed if the existing cartel carriers are not prepared to provide a proper service. I understand that at least two Irish companies have applied for licences for flights between Shannon and London.  I suggest that they be granted at the earliest possible time and not be delayed or ignored as has been the practice of the Department of Communications for so long.</P>
    <P>The potential for flights between Shannon and continental Europe is very considerable. There are airlines which are prepared to provide those services at a reasonable level if they are allowed to do so.  I remember some years ago when unfortunately a service between Shannon and Amsterdam was closed by the Department because the airline concerned was not prepared to charge a high enough fare.  The potential traffic which would have been generated into Shannon and into the region was lost as a result. <Col N="1677" /> That was taken as normal and very little protest was made by anyone, except possibly myself.</P>
    <P>It is worth emphasising the difficulties that exist in terms of communications between Shannon and Britain and Shannon and continental Europe if one was to contrast them with the situation that happily exists today on the Atlantic as a result of competition.  We have four scheduled carriers flying from the United States to Shannon this summer, something we never had before but which I heartily welcome.  It is noticeable that this competition has grown in an area where there has been deregulation of the old IATA type restrictions on airline services. Hopefully this development will come about in Europe as a result of court cases and changing views of Governments.  It is very disappointing that we have to wait years for obvious things to happen, things which should happen without any delay.</P>
    <P>The most important potential and development hopefully which will take place in Shannon in the next six to nine months is the proposal by Guinness Peat Aviation to join with others in providing a transatlantic package service from Shannon throughout Europe.  If this comes about it will be one of the most beneficial developments that have ever taken place in Shannon, ideally suited to the airport and to the region and it will bring a tremendous amount of employment in its train.  I urge the development company to continue to do all they can to facilitate this operation.  Of course, Shannon will have a great deal of competition both in Britain and on the Continent for such development. Unfortunately, Shannon has already lost the first such development to Brussels, but if what Guinness Peat Aviation and their partners have in mind comes about, it will be the largest and most succesful operation of its kind in the decades to come.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that the most successful company this country has seen in the past ten or 15 years is the company based in Shannon.  Guinness Peat Aviation have <Col N="1678" /> brought tremendous credit and tremendous economic benefit to this country, and Mr. Ryan and the others associated with the company deserve our admiration for the almost incredible success they have achieved based in Shannon over the past ten years.</P>
    <P>Other companies of that kind in Shannon would be of tremendous assistance to the region and the country, and every effort should be made to encourage them whether they are Irish, as in the case of Guinness Peat Aviation, or foreign.  It is disappointing to find that, for example, there are only two offshore insurance companies based in Shannon, only one of them of any size, when Shannon is an ideal location, geographically and in terms of the legislation available, for activities of that kind.  It is very disappointing to find that there is no offshore banking in Shannon despite the development company's efforts over the years to encourage it.  Again, the location is ideal. It is not at all the fault of the development company.  They can do very little because they must promote Shannon within the overall climate in the country to date. You have only to look at the Finance Act 1986 and the ridiculous attitude taken in this country towards financial institutions, both banks and insurance companies, to realise why we have not been able to exploit the potential of Shannon in this regard.</P>
    <P>Many hundreds if not thousands of people could be engaged in offshore financial services at Shannon because that pattern is developing in many areas which are less suitable and have fewer suitable people available than in Shannon.  Very short term policy indeed is reflected in the Finance Act of this year which causes considerable loss of valuable and useful projects with very high grade, highly paid employment which we could have in Shannon but which we have not got as a result of the rather niggardly attitudes taken towards any organisation that can be described as a financial institution.</P>
    <P>Let me say a brief word on urban renewal in Limerick city which the development company undertook at my suggestion some years ago.  They encouraged <Col N="1679" /> private developers to restore 18th century buildings with great success architecturally and visually.  Unfortunately, the commercial success has not been as great as one would have wished because the restoration of these buildings coincided with the downturn in the property market.  Lest the development company and the developers concerned might feel that because some of the work done was not a great commercial success it should not be persisted in, I would like to say that we hope there will not always be a downturn in the property market and that the restoration work on many fine buildings which has been so successful at places like the Granary and Rutland Street in Limerick will continue to both the social and commercial benefit of the city.  The development company have helped the Limerick Civic Trust significantly in the work they are doing and the people concerned are to be commended highly.  If any city needs restoration it is Limerick which has some splendid old buildings of which, unfortunately, a large proportion has been allowed to go derelict over the years.</P>
    <P>In conclusion let me say that SFADCo are an excellent prototype for a regional development company in this country or anywhere else.  From fairly considerable experience with them I have found them open to suggestions.  They work closely with the region and the communities in which they operate and they have invariably retained a very good relationship with a great majority of people with whom they come into contact.  I am glad this Bill gives them money to continue their activities for another four years and I hope that, during the coming four years and the coming decades, SFADCo will be as successful and as useful to their region and to the country as they have been over the past 25 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is three years since a SFADCo Bill similar to the one presented before us today came before the House.  I take the opportunity to welcome this Bill.  Unlike many recent critics of SFADCo, I feel that they are doing <Col N="1680" /> an excellent job and any assistance this Government can give them to continue their development is very worth while. One must look at the wide and varied role that SFADCo adopted in the past. They have responsibility for Shannon town and all the services that go with it.  They have responsibility for industrial development in the Shannon free zone and in 1978-79 they were given additional responsibility for small industrial development in the mid west region.  They have responsibility for traffic development through Shannon.</P>
      <P>Overall their portfolio is very wide.  We will not find any other institution in the country carrying the same varied type of responsibilities.  On examining what they have done in all these areas and recognising how successful they have been, one cannot but be supportive of the very fine work they have been doing in Shannon. Of course, such work cannot be done without a very expert team of people and I take this opportunity to compliment the board and management of SFADCo on the tremendous work they have done in County Clare and for the mid-west region.  I compliment Frank McCabe who has been chairman of the board for a considerable number of years.</P>
      <P>In particular I compliment Paul Quigley who retired recently from SFADCo.  He worked there for many years and had a clear innovative mind which he was prepared to adapt to changing circumstances.  With him at the helm and with the very fine team of managers who worked with him, there has been a very successful outcome at Shannon and the region generally.  As a public representative dealing with Mr. Quigley in recent years, I always found him extremely helpful, efficient, co-operative and businesslike.  Many people in similar positions throughout the country could take a leaf from his book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>SFADCo in the future will have to adapt to changing times.  Negotiations are in progress for Clare County Council to take over the housing estate and the services that go with it in Shannon.  If that happens it will be a major change but, before Clare County Council take on the <Col N="1681" /> additional responsibility of Shannon town, the whole situation should be thoroughly examined to ensure that Shannon town continues to have the services which are provided by SFADCo at present and indeed are substantially improved on.  There is room for very serious negotiation between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of the Environment on this matter in conjunction with the management of the two bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>In relation to small industries development, Deputy Daly and other Opposition speakers should look at the figures and the success rate of that venture in recent years.  In 1978, when the small industries scheme was started, there were 350 small industry firms in the region employing about 3,000 people.  Today there are over 700 firms employing 5,300 people, a very substantial increase.  When one takes this into consideration, in view of the national trend in relation to employment in the manufacturing area, it is obvious that the scheme is very successful.  Indeed, since 1983, there has been an increase in jobs in the region of over 400, again a substantial number given the national trend, and one which all politicians should recognise.  Of course there have been job losses in the mid-west but, despite that, SFADCo have managed not alone to maintain the 1983 levels but to substantially increase them, which is no mean achievement given the type of climate in which they had to operate.</P>
    <P>Very successful ventures have been started in Ennistymon, Tuamgraney and Scarriff in particular.  There is a problem in so far as the closure of GAC seriously affected a number of small industries but I know that SFADCo are trying to tackle the problem at present.  While there may be difficulties, I am confident that they will overcome them, especially in the Shannon region.  South west Clare also has problems in regard to unemployment and if it were not for the development at Moneypoint things would be even worse, particularly in Kilrush.  I wish to add, for the benefit of Deputy Daly, that if Fianna Fáil had had their way there would have <Col N="1682" /> been no development at Moneypoint.  I urge the Minister and SFADCo to treat this is a disadvantaged area and to try to attract industry into the region because there could be a very serious problem in the Kilrush area in another year or so when Moneypoint is in operation and the site is complete.</P>
    <P>In relation to the future role of SFADCo, there is a tremendous opportunity and all Departments and State bodies concerned will have to recognise that SFADCo are capable of taking on many and varied responsibilities.  In this connection, I should like to refer to the Shannon Estuary, one of our finest national assets.  If it is properly developed and managed it would be of tremendous benefit to the mid-west region.  One must ask who is capable of developing and managing that project in a businesslike way.  We must look at existing bodies and examine their record over the years. SFADCo must have a major role in future development of the Shannon estuary. I urge the Minister to see that they are given specific responsibility in any future Bills in this House in relation to the management of the estuary because SFADCo are tailor made to take on responsibility in this area.  They have the expertise and experience and it would be irresponsible not to ensure that they can develop the area.</P>
    <P>SFADCo recently became involved in the mariculture and fish industries and in the Carrigaholt region a mariculture development has been ably assisted by personnel from Shannon Development. I hope that Shannon Development will see a greater future for that type of development, particularly around the coast of Clare, because there are indigenous products there and there is an onus on us to ensure that they are developed to their full potential.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased that the Minister for Industry and Commerce recently gave responsibility to SFADCo to do a pilot scheme in relation to the food processing industry and market research in relation to marketing food in a more presentable form than we have been doing in the past. There is also an opportunity for them to <Col N="1683" /> encourage people to grow more vegetables as recent statistics in relation to the importation of vegetables are appalling. They should tackle this problem immediately.  They could do very fine work in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are a number of very fine service industries based in the Shannon free zone and, like Deputy O'Malley, I should like to see greater emphasis on that industry in Shannon.  I hope that the Department, in conjunction with SFADCo, will see this as a priority and an area which should be given greater incentive so that international companies will base their services at Shannon.  It is an ideal location but somehow its attractions are not availed of as widely as one would hope for.</P>
    <P>I wish to compliment SFADCo on doing a very fine job.  Maybe some of their critics, particularly in this House, should have taken the opportunity of airing their criticisms today and coming face to face with those who have direct contact regularly with SFADCo.  As Deputy for the area all I can say is that they have been extremely helpful and responsible in the way they have always worked within the region.  They have a good rapport with the various local authorities, with local communities and with local politicians.  This indicates their genuine interest in the region.  The level of commitment given by most of their personnel in the region far exceeds the call of duty; they go to meetings all over the region at all hours of the day and night and are generous with their time. That is something that we, as public representatives for the area, appreciate.</P>
    <P>In regard to the recent committee report on SFADCo, it would probably be more appropriate to discuss it when it comes before the House.  But I would like to take the opportunity to refute a statement made by the Leader of the Opposition when he visited Limerick recently to preside at a Fianna Fáil convention. He implied that the report was the report of one particular Deputy.  The record shows that report was signed by all the members of the committee representing all parties within this House. <Col N="1684" /> No one party can take particular credit for anything in that report.  There are a number of items in the report that I would take issue with but I will deal with those when the report comes before the House.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to wish SFADCo well.  There is a challenging time ahead for them in the next few years but, given their record in the past, I have every confidence that they will meet the challenges and we can look forward to greater progress and greater development in the mid-west region in the next few years.  This has, indeed, been the hallmark of SFADCo over the past number of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to address the House on this important legislation.  Most of the ground has already been covered by other Deputies from the region so I will be brief. I will commence by congratulating Mr. Tom Dunne on his recent appointment. Mr. Dunne is a public servant noted for his achievements in other fields and I wish him the very best in his present onerous position.  For the sake of all in the mid-west I hope he makes a good job of it.  I also want to congratulate the other executives and the ordinary employees of SFADCo because they have made a monumental contribution in the mid-west since the inception of SFADCo. SFADCo have a number of tremendous achievements to their credit, many attained in the face of severe difficulties and despite opposition and sniping by Deputies from other constituencies who, in an attempt to gain short term political kudos for themselves in their own areas, criticised and tried to curtail the activities of SFADCo.  Some Fine Gael Deputies in the Cork region have suggested that SFADCo should be abolished altogether. It would be a sad day for the mid-west region if this agency were to disappear. The attitude taken by those Deputies is irresponsible and shallow, not recognising the achievements of SFADCo and the magnificent contribution SFADCo still have to make in this region if properly directed and controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Daly and others asked if the <Col N="1685" /> present legislation is sufficient.  It is a step in the right direction but it is not sufficient to attain what needs to be attained.  I have spoken on many occasions, of the need for a whole new direction for SFADCo.  New goals, new targets, a whole new spirit of adventure are needed if the present atmosphere of despondency, depression and despair is to be lifted and something positive and tangible done about creating employment and attracting employment opportunities to the region.  We are talking not about public relations exercises but something tangible, something positive.  That is the role we see for SFADCo, and that has been their traditional role.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a certain loss of momentum because of the lack of definite attainable targets.  Some of the original goals set for SFADCo have been achieved.  The change in the industrial structure, the change in the nature of industry has created new challenges and new opportunities.  But it has also created a need for new targets, new goals.  As somebody who is concerned about the welfare of the region and about the recent loss of employment in the region, I should like to see legislation brought in which would set those new targets and new goals and a definite sense of direction for SFADCo.  I regret this has not been done but I also welcome the commitment by at least some of the Government to maintaining the present status of SFADCo and the commitment of some of my colleagues on the opposite benches to an enhanced role for SFADCo in the future.</P>
    <P>Recently the Dáil Committee on Public Expenditure produced a report which dealt at length with the cost effectiveness of SFADCo.  I have read that report in detail and I interpret it as highly complimentary of SFADCo and its attainments and cost effectiveness.  The chairman of the committee, Deputy Keating, chose to issue a separate statement accompanying the report in which he put his own highly negative interpretation on how the Dáil Committee on Public Expenditure saw SFADCo.  I deplore that.  It is a very unwelcome development that the chairmen of these <Col N="1686" /> responsible committees are putting their own particular political bias and their own gloss on these detailed reports.  We can all read those reports for ourselves. Political commentators, financial analysts, financial commentators and those of the public who are interested can read those reports and draw their own conclusions.  We do not need Deputy Keating or anybody else to draw conclusions for us.</P>
    <P>I deplore Deputy Keating's hostility towards SFADCo which was clearly evident in the statement which he issued to accompany that report.  In the past I asked the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley, whether he agrees with Deputy Keating's attitude towards SFADCo as expressed in the statement which accompanied that report.  To date I have received no answer from Deputy O'Malley and I did not hear him answering that question tonight in his contribution.  I doubt that we will get an answer.  The Progressive Democrats can also differ amongst themselves; they are nothing out of the ordinary but very much like the rest of us in that regard. Deputy O'Malley made his reputation largely on his achievements in this field and many of the jobs Deputy O'Malley chose to take credit for were generated through SFADCo.</P>
    <P>When Deputy O'Malley was Minister for Industry in the year which was, in terms of job creation, the crowning jewel of his achievements, the local boss of SFADCo, Mr. Michael Daly, was given the award of Limerick man of the year, indicating that the local business people were well aware of SFADCo's role in creating those jobs.  It is regrettable that a member of Deputy O'Malley's new party should manifest an open hostility to SFADCo.  This is something which I, the people of the region generally and I am sure Deputy O'Malley must regret.  I am saddened not to hear that Deputy admit this.</P>
    <P>Deputies Daly and Lyons spoke about the potential for job creation generally and particularly in this region.  We are all aware of the difficulties experienced in attracting industry and creating sustainable, <Col N="1687" /> viable, long term jobs outside Dublin and particularly in isolated rural areas.  In that regard SFADCo have done a magnificent job in so far as they have been allowed by central agencies and Government Departments.  It is a fundamental part of the Fianna Fáil policy and, indeed, philosophy to decentralise industry as much as possible, both for economic and social reasons.  SFADCo were set up specifically with that goal in mind for a particular region.  In so far as they were allowed, they succeeded magnificently.  We want a re-emphasis and re-concentration on that role.  The past record will show that it can be done; to my way of thinking, it must be done. As regards employment creation in industry, the concentration must be on small industry.  If the history of the past five to ten years has taught us anything, surely it has taught us that.</P>
    <P>Agencies such as SFADCo have a fantastic new role to play in the development of the economy for the next 20 years, particularly in the field of job creation. International economists tell us that service industries will become increasingly important in this respect; I accept that. There will still, of course, be a role of job creation in manufacturing industry, but the service industries are assuming an increasing importance with regard to employment.  The new board of SFADCo must direct their attention to that matter, which has been proved beyond doubt or argument.  There is a need for concentration on smaller type operations, whether in the area of providing services, or in manufacturing industry.  SFADCo are a perfect mechanism for the creation of employment in that field.  That is why we need, not a reduction of their role or a scaling down of their operations, but rather an enhanced role for an agency of this sort.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil are fully committed to SFADCo and to an enhanced role for them.  My region owes a tremendous amount to that company.  Whether it be to the forefront of their consciousness or not, many of my constituents should be very grateful to SFADCo.  We in Fianna <Col N="1688" /> Fáil are committed to it because of our basic philosophy for industrial job creation, particularly decentralised industry, as against having all the services in Dublin as well as all the job creation activities. It is part of our philosophy to spread these activities out.  As Deputy Daly mentioned, there is also a role for decentralisation in this context.  We have suggested in the past that more of the operations of Aer Rianta should be carried on in Shannon.  There may also be room for moving some part of the Department of Communications to the Shannon region and I understand that some studies have been done on that question.  I urge the Minister to comment on his Government's policy concerning decentralisation and to explain why that process has not only slowed down but come to a full-stop over the past three years.  Because we are committed to decentralisation, we are committed to an enhanced role for agencies such as SFADCo.</P>
    <P>I conclude by complimenting the Shannon Free Airport Development Company on their achievements in the past. If they are given a proper role and appropriate freedom to carry it out, I am sure that their achievements in the future will be just as good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate.  It is clear from the contributions that there is a broad consensus among all major political parties in support of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and their development.  As I said in my opening contribution, the purpose of the Bill is essentially an enabling one, increasing the statutory limits on the moneys which may be annually voted to the company by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is apparent from what has been said today that there is a great deal of familiarity with the operations of SFADCo and accordingly I need hardly elaborate on my earlier contribution.  There are, however, one or two aspects of the company to which I have not yet alluded and I shall take this opportunity of doing so. <Col N="1689" /> Shannon Free Airport Development Company, as local Deputies are aware, have been very successfully involved in urban renewal projects in Limerick city, with the Granary being one very good example.  While the company have in recent years been less active in that area than previously, I am confident that the very attractive incentives for inner city development announced by the Government earlier this year will create a significant opportunity for SFADCo, in consultation with Limerick Corporation, to stimulate the development of commercial, trading and industrial activities and thereby ensure that historic areas of the city are revitalised.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Government decided, in the context of the White Paper on Industrial Policy, that the time had come for SFADCo to withdraw from their local authority type responsibilites for Shannon town, given that the latter had effectively reached a mature condition.  There was no good reason for that company's continued involvement.  I am aware that discussions are proceeding between the company and Clare County Council and while I am satisfied that the complex and unprecedented nature of the handover means that it cannot happen overnight, I am equaliy happy that there is no lack of commitment on the company's part in implementing Government policy in this regard.  It would be wrong of me to pretend that I am happy with the pace of developments.  In consultation with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, I shall be doing everything possible to encourage both SFADCo and Clare County Council to bring this matter to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>I should also like to take the opportunity of thanking Mr. Paul Quigley, who has been managing director of the company for many years, for his major contribution. I wish him good health and happiness in his retirement.  I should like to endorse what other Members of the House have said in giving every encouragement to the new chief executive, Mr. Tom Dunne.  We shall be back here shortly debating the report of the Dáil <Col N="1690" /> Committee on Public Expenditure on SFADCo, when we can have a more wide-ranging debate.  Suffice it to say that I am grateful for the contributions of Deputies on all sides of the House, which were so constructive and so supportive of the company.</P>

    <Title>Chester Beatty Library Bill, 1985 [Seanad]: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. A. Doyle) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. A. Doyle)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. A. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable the Commissioners of Public Works to carry out work on the maintenance, repair, upkeep, restoration and improvement of the Chester Beatty Library.  The Chester Beatty Library, situated at Shrewsbury Road, Dublin, is a private collection of <i>object d'art</i> bequeathed to a board of trustees for the use and enjoyment of the public by the late Sir Alfred Chester Beatty on his death in 1986.  The collection, which by international standards is unique, includes treasures from European, Islamic and Oriental civilisiations &mdash; ancient papyri and clay tablets, manuscripts, rare texts, minature Arabic paintings, Chinese jade books and many other items.</P>
      <P>Sir Alfred's legacy did not include any financial provision for the operating and maintenance costs of the library.  In view of the uniqueness of the collection the State has grant-aided the library since the establishment of the trust in 1968.  An amount representing between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of the operating and maintenance cost is annually grant-aided to the trust.  This came to £189,000 in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House can appreciate, the proper maintenance and upkeep of the buildings which house the collection pose many problems.  In order to ensure that <Col N="1691" /> many fragile and priceless objects do not depreciate, it is essential to maintain variations in temperature, humidity and light within strict limits.  Because of this and the need to maintain a high standard of upkeep of the buildings themselves, the Government decided to entrust the maintenance and upkeep of the library to the Office of Public Works who have experience in dealing with similar problems over the years in the National Museum and the National Gallery.  Since, however, the buildings that house the Chester Beatty collection are not public buildings, legislation is necessary to enable the Commissioners to incur expenditure on the library and the Bill provides for this.</P>
    <P>It also contains a clause enabling the Minister for Finance to recoup to the trustees costs already incurred on certain works at the premises.  These works, already undertaken by the Commissioners of Public Works and paid for by the trustees, include roof repairs and security measures.  The amount involved is approximately £50,000.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>In times of economic depression there is a feeling of hopelessness in the community.  In many instances there is a lack of employment and a lack of direction towards the elimination of unemployment.  We may come under some criticism for alocating £50,000 to carry out the necessary works at the Chester Beatty Library.  It would be a gross error if we were to abandon works of art of our own culture or of other cultures.  I see no difficulty in agreeing on the need to ensure that the treasures housed in this building are safeguarded. The Bill is principally about the condition of the building and to ensure that the proper temperature, humidity, lighting and whatever else are provided to maintain these treasures in the best possible condition.  Their safekeeping will enhance their quality and value.  In time to come other generations will give us credit for this.  In times of economic difficulty one might be permitted to say that our priorities have not been correct in <Col N="1692" /> many cases in the eighties and particularly in 1986.  If I were to list my priorities I would list unemployment, the creation of jobs, expanding our industrial base and the improvement of our agriculture. At the same time it would be incorrect of us not to agree with the Minister's proposal.</P>
      <P>I wish the new Minister well in her office.  I apologise for not saying that at the outset.  There is an old cliché that a new broom sweeps clean.  I hope the new Minister with responsibility for the Office of Public Works will endeavour to eradicate the undeserved slanted view that is taken of the Office of Public Works generally.  Each of us knows that the public perception of the Office of Public Works is not the best.  That is putting it mildly.  I regret to say that much of that is directed at the members in the public works section, the tradespeople and their assistants.  If there is some tightening up to be done, or if there is overlapping at supervisory or higher levels, I am sure the new Minister will ensure that it is done.  I would like the Minister to change the incorrect view taken of the Office of Public Works and their staff.</P>
      <P>I have been in the House for a good part of the evening and to the surprise of many Deputies I have not mentioned my native heath.  I am going to do it now.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to join with all Deputies in acknowledging the tremendous gifts which have been bequeathed to the State over the years. This particular collection in the Chester Beatty Library is one of the finest examples of how fortunate this country has been as a result of the good and kind thoughts of the many friends of Ireland, many of them foreigners.  I often wonder if we as a nation appreciate what these people have done for us.  We do not express our appreciation as fully as we should in areas of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, while it deals with specific aspects of the Chester Beatty Library, goes part of the way towards putting a very positive and definite onus of responsibility on the Office of Public Works.  One of the questions my colleague asked was whether we have sufficiently qualified people in the Office of Public Works to undertake this responsibility. We all know that there are some very special qualities and expertise <Col N="1694" /> required in maintaining various collections of art in their original and finest forms.  This expertise is not very large in most parts of the world.  Would the Minister of State in her reply indicate the type of expertise we have and how it will be focussed in regard to the Chester Beatty Library hall.</P>
    <P>I would point out also that the Office of Public Works have done very well in many other areas.  We have all seen the fine examples of the maintenance and restoration work they have carried out.  I would like to refer to one of those examples which is in my own constituency, the Casino in Marino.  This is a very fine example of restoration work carried out by the people employed by the board.  It has taken a long time but the finished work is something we can all be proud of.  Having asked the question originally of the Minister of State, I am sure that we do have the people because that restoration work is one of the finest I have seen.  It did involve considerable time.  We have been approaching this type of thing in a very irregular fashion through no fault of ours obviously because we have not had the opportunities. I hope that from now on we will become much more involved in the art world and come to appreciate the various collections that may be on display in our different cities.</P>
    <P>On this aspect, I would like to mention the question of promotion within schools and colleges.  This has not been embarked upon very widely.  I would like to see much more interest being generated within our schools where young people would be encouraged to visit in groups the various museums, art galleries and the Chester Beatty collection which is the subject of this Bill.  While tours are a very popular facet of school life there is an inclination nowadays to concentrate on other more popular areas of interest.  I would, therefore, hope that we will find some way of encouraging various groups, not only groups from colleges and schools but also residents groups and associations. People very often do not think about art.  I have heard on many occasions of people visiting collections in <Col N="1695" /> other countries and expressing amazement and wonder.  Quite often, they say, &ldquo;it is a pity we do not have something like that in our own country&rdquo;.  We have. That is why I would like to see a situation where promotion would be undertaken on a much wider scale.  This is something which the Minister of State's Department could look into.</P>
    <P>There is very little in this Bill that one can find fault with.  It is, as I say, the first step in what I hope will be an enlightened programme on the part of the Minister of State's Department to pursue much more cultural and artistic measures whether in museums or art galleries.  We support the Bill fully.</P>

      <P>I intend to stick strictly to the Bill.  In a way, this is a simple Bill. It is an enabling Bill so that the State can look after the building which houses the treasure which has been given to us by the Chester Beatty Library.  The discussion of the Bill will increase awareness generally in the minds of the public.  I agree that this is very necessary.  Hopefully, the collection will attract more school and resident groups, as Deputy Brady mentioned, to make better use of this beautiful treasure which has been bequeathed to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generaly, interpretative measures at centres such as this are on the increase. In any centre which is the responsibility of the Office of Public Works we are including audio visual material, literature, guides and displays of one kind or another to ensure that once people come and see our national monuments and our <Col N="1696" /> heritage generally they get full educational value from their visit.  The Chester Beatty Library is run by trustees and management on those terms will still be up to the trustees.  This Bill enables us to recoup the trustees on the one hand for money already expended on the building but also to spend on the library ourselves money that is necessary to protect the treasure which has been given to the State.  I thank the Deputies on the opposite side for their co-operation.</P>
    <P>I also thank the references to the fact that the Office of Public Works have hidden their laurels for far too long.  In this area of heritage preservation I could not agree more.  The Office of Public Works have done some magnificent work.  It is only latterly that people are beginning to realise we have immense expertise in this area.  We have had 150 years of experience in this type of undertaking. We have only to look at the Royal Hospital, the National Concert Hall and the National Gallery, where we have certain responsibilities, to see our architectural specialities and the fine work in this area which can be done.  We can all rest assured that the experts will be looking after this matter from here on.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann recognises the present disastrous state of Irish agriculture and calls on the Government to intervene immediately and effectively with a comprehensive package of emergency measures which will alleviate the difficulties of thousands of farmers who are facing bankruptcy because of the reduction in milk prices and output, the loss of livestock and the failure of crops.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister for Agriculture announce on Friday last, 6 June, an increase in the aid for silage making. From a reading of the fairly recent history of western Europe I felt that D-day, 6 June, had a certain significance from which happily this country was spared.  I might say to the Minister, in sorrow and anger, that for Irish agriculture in the year 1986, 6 June was long past D-day or Government-action-day as I would prefer to call it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish agriculture has been facing a major crisis for many months past.  Farmers foresaw that crisis over the wet months of last summer and autumn and throughout the long winter when fodder for their animals was of bad quality and scarce.  Hope that the spring would bring relief turned to fear when cold, wet weather meant very little grass grew. Throughout that period no encouragement was given on the part of the Government.  There was some emergency aid given in the autumn of 1985, some further help by way of early payments <Col N="1698" /> of moneys due anyway a month or two ago, some help for starving cattle in the west long after the time when that help should have been granted.  Nowhere has there been any genuine Government concern voiced about the state of agriculture. The Government have been too occupied with other non-economic issues.  It seems the Government have divorced themselves totally from agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Government may chose not to believe the extent of the crisis.  If members of the Government were to take some time off from their preoccupation with other matters to ask farmers how they feel about Government help in these bad times, they would be left in no doubt at all that they feel neglected and forgotten.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Fianna Fáil motion this evening is to bring the Government to their senses, to help them realise before it is too late, that it is not good enough to give a little help and hope that the problem will resolve itself or will simply go away, because neither will happen.  Over the past year agriculture has suffered as a result of a series of events which have caused damage of a kind unheard of in recent times.  The effects of the bad weather cannot be exaggerated.  Farmers can put up with a certain amount of bad weather, managing their business, perhaps with loss, and can survive, but last year was different; even city people should realise that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even in the most fortunate farming areas cattle were in poor condition at the commencement of this year.  A good spring would have made a difference but the spring of 1986 matched in its harshness the summer and autumn of 1985. This is no story or the farmer complaining about weather conditions.  This is no worn-out joke.  Rather is it a genuine story of disastrous weather conditions bringing many farmers to the brink of ruin.  Many of the rural and farming <Col N="1699" /> organisations are saying the same thing.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government now to give some hope and help to those thousands of farmers to prevent great numbers going over the brink into bankruptcy.  I am sure the Minister realised as well as I do that, in order to keep going over the past year, many farmers have been forced to incur greatly increased debt while farm incomes show no sign of increasing to meet this additional burden.  Milk yields are significantly below normal &mdash; small wonder considering the poor condition of cows and the weather conditions.  Farmers' costs have not been reduced.  Just to take one example, the price of diesel oil to farmers has not been reduced as much as one might have expected. Returns from farming show no hope of increase.  Because of the 1986-87 price agreements milk quotas are to be reduced by a further 3 per cent, in my view, quite wrongly.  Continuing support for the beef market is in doubt and cereal farmers risk heavy income losses.  All of this amounts to farmers having greatly increased debt burdens, with little relief from costs and little hope of increased returns from sales of their products.  All of this adds up to no hope of increased farm incomes.  The result is there for all to see &mdash; a fall in the price of land.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister realised that the security on which the farmer could rely for development or, in this year, for survival, is being reduced.  As a form of security farming is going down in the eyes of the financial institutions, and the Government are doing nothing to correct that position.  Of course some farmers will survive, those with holdings well above the average in size, not carrying large debts.  My concern is for the smaller farmer, the man and his family whom we hoped would be able to continue working and living as farmers throughout the length and breadth of the country.  These are the people whose continued existence is being put at risk following the disastrous year we have been through and of which we have not yet seen the end. For generations those farmers were <Col N="1700" /> looked on as the backbone of rural areas if not of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Government must take action quickly.  I should like the Minister to say what action they intend to take.  The Minister might be having difficulty bringing home to his colleagues in Government the state of the country's main industry.  Many of his colleagues, some in positions as Ministers of State, as is Deputy Connaughton and others representing country areas, are leaving him in no doubt as to what they think of the situation in agriculture today.  I am sure the Minister has in mind what should be done.</P>
    <P>Action should be taken in a number of areas using our own resources and with the help of the European Community. Fianna Fáil did not hesitate in putting our case to our European partners in 1981 when there was a crisis in agriculture which was not as intense as the present crisis.  Certain very valuable schemes were the result such as the AI subsidy scheme and the subsidy on fertiliser and ground limestone.  These schemes should be reintroduced and the amounts increased.  There was aid for farmers in disadvantaged areas.  It was galling to read recently in Germany that there was a major extension of the disadvantaged areas and that farmers in these areas were given increased aid from the State.</P>
    <P>These are some of the ways in which emergency aid could be given to farmers who are struggling for survival.  More than that could be done.  We are members of the EC which has a clearly stated objective &mdash; the development of economically weak areas of the Community. Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome clearly outlines the Community's commitment to a fair standard of living for all farmers taking into account the social structure and conditions in the various regions.  The Commission and the Council of Ministers have taken action in emergency cases on the basis of the Governments of the affected areas making a case to them.  We have every ground at this time for making such a case.  The Minister should tell the House that such an approach will be made to the Commission and that it will <Col N="1701" /> include the reintroduction of the special schemes I have outlined &mdash; an emergency extension of the disadvantaged areas, an increase in headage grants and a realistic increase in the moneys available through the Euro loan scheme.  The recent heavily publicised Euro loan scheme is inadequate for present day conditions in agriculture.  The Government should demand that representatives from the EC visit Ireland to see conditions for themselves. In this way the Commission could be assured that we are not exaggerating the position.</P>
    <P>We should demand EC intervention at this time of crisis.  Fianna Fáil have already announced their policy of drawing up a balance sheet showing the gains and losses of EC membership.  This is an important part of our policy.  We are not in any way casting doubt on Ireland's membership of the EC but feel, looking at the quarter of a million people who are unemployed, that the drawing up of a balance sheet would be a necessary beginning to an approach to the EC for a more determined and planned effort to put the economy on a healthy footing.  In his speech on 30 May the Minister for Foreign Affairs gave a weak indication to the House of some change in Government thinking about our methods of approach to the EC.  Something far more than weak thinking is needed at this stage.  We should not apologise for our existence in Europe.  We are full members with full rights and should not be diffident about demanding them.  The Government should make an approach to the EC about the present crisis in farming which is the subject of the motion before the House.</P>
    <P>One hears much talk about financial institutions and about great variations in their methods of approach to farmers. The worst case I heard of was where farmers were pressed to sell off stock to cover their bad debts.  Financial institutions should be more realistic in their approach to an industry which is the source of much of their profits.  Has the Minister had any discussions with the financial institutions?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1702" /> I would sum up the root cause of the agricultural crisis under three headings. First, an uncaring Government who have shown a disastrous lack of sympathy and understanding for our primary industry. Secondly, a determined effort by some elements within the EC to dismantle the Common Agricultural Policy without regard to the special position of Ireland. Thirdly, the weather, the effects of which have been made worse by Government and EC inaction.  Speaking as much as a farmer as Fianna Fáil spokesman on Agriculture, I say to the Government that they ignore the message of this debate at their peril.  They cannot dismiss what we say on this side of the House as they so arrogantly tend to do.  The farmers who approach us in deep despair, their families and the thousands of farm related workers will not forget these doleful days and the Government's responsibility for them.</P>

      <P>Agriculture in rural areas has not been so depressed since the thirties.  Many farmers are having nervous breakdowns.  They have no bread to put on the table.  There is total disarray in the industry due to lack of funding and weather conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Euro currency scheme being introduced by the Government is too little too late.  It is only the tip of the iceberg because there is a real financial problem in Irish agriculture.  Many areas of the deal need clarification.  Is the handling charge to be 3 per cent or 2 per cent?  If it is to be 3 per cent it will be an alarmingly high charge, a rip-off by the financial institutions once more and the Government should intervene in regard to it. The currency surcharge, because of a risk <Col N="1703" /> of a fluctuation in currencies within the Euro system, should also be explained. Will the Minister say if the borrowers will be refunded if the risk does not arise because there is a further 2 per cent for the risk involved?</P>
    <P>Another scandal is that the Government and the Minister for Finance delayed announcing the final details of this Euro loan package.  I understand that the first £4,000 will be at the Euro rate and that represents an insult when one considers the crisis that exists in Irish agriculture.  Only a few years ago Deputy MacSharry, as Minister for Finance, brought in £100 million of Euro currency, £50 million to be disposed of by the ACC and £50 million by the associated banks. That was a realistic input into agriculture. We need an injection of £200 million now.  When Deputy MacSharry was responsible the money was handed out in lots of £25,000 and a mechanism was found under which two people on a holding could qualify for £50,000 of that Euro currency.  That was a more realistic way to deal with the problem.  The Coalition failed to continue to borrow when that Euro loan had been repaid by the ACC and the associated banks.  The last Government were committed to getting further large amounts of Euro currency and had the Coalition continued with that policy agriculture would not be in the bad state it is in today.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance are again demonstrating their anti-farmer, anti-rural antics and their lack of commitment to the agricultural industry.  Many farmers have debts that will never be paid unless they shed assets.  We are all aware that the family farm is the basis of our society and our economy.  There is an obligation on the Government, and on all Members, to protect our family farms that are under the greatest threat since the days of the landlords.  Many merchants and co-operatives have given a lot of credit to farmers to purchase feedstuffs. An alarmingly big amount of feedstuff has been purchased this year.  I do not know what outlets small farmers will <Col N="1704" /> have for their produce this year.  A farmer with 30 dairy cows, milking 18,000 gallons of milk, will have feed costs well in excess of the value of that milk.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Euro currency scheme is that it cannot be used as working capital or to pay existing debts.  A big problem here is that the total borrowings of Irish farmers amount to £1,700 million, an alarmingly high figure by any standards. Much of that has been accummulated as a result of high interest rates in the last five or six years.  It is well known that 2,000 farmers have been identified as being on the brink or have gone forever. That is a sad reflection on Irish society. I understand that according to ACOT 10,000 farmers are in serious financial difficulty.</P>
    <P>The bad weather last year and this year has done untold harm to milk production. I understand that this year there will be a shortfall of between 40 million and 50 million gallons of milk, the equivalent of what the Minister gave away in Brussels in his negotiations on the 3 per cent.  On that occasion he ran home and let other EC countries do his business for him. That drop in milk production means fewer jobs for people in rural areas and greater inefficiency in our co-operative movement because of the over capacity in our dairy industry.  That will result in a further reduction in the income of Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>It is said that £40 million has been spent on the purchase of feed by Irish farmers, an alarmingly high figure.  Farm incomes are expected to fall this year by £50 million, irrespective of the views of the Central Bank in the course of their report issued in May.  Those who deal with agriculture in the Central Bank must be living in cloud cuckoo land.  It is serious when we have the Central Bank making the point that last year's shortfall of 12 per cent in farm incomes will be made up by an increase in cereal production this year. We are all aware that as a result of EC negotiations there will be a big drop in the intervention price paid for Irish cereals and that the acreage of barley sown this year has dropped because of weather conditions.  Many farmers were unable to <Col N="1705" /> get to their land to sow seeds because of weather conditions.  That land will not produce any crop this year, another indication of the real crisis in Irish agriculture. It is a insult to the farming community to produce such a report.</P>
    <P>The Minister has boasted that £900 million will be available for Irish agriculture but a mere 20 per cent of that figure will go to our farmers.  In real terms 80 per cent of that figure consists of FEOGA aid, intervention costs and other EC assistance.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that only 20 per cent of the £900 million will find its way into the pockets of the farming community. Stories to the contrary must be killed.  Irish farmers have lost £200 million since Minister Deasy took charge of the Department of Agriculture.  It is well known that the Minister has failed to make an input at Cabinet meetings because the Taoiseach is not concerned about what he has to say in regard to agriculture.  The Taoiseach is more concerned about Deputy Ruairí Quinn.  It is well known that Minister Deasy has run down the corridor from Cabinet meetings having been scaled by his Taoiseach who was prepared to listen to his Labour left-wingers rather than to him.  I am aware that the Minister is disappointed at the treatment he gets from the Taoiseach. Any person living in Donnybrook is not concerned about the farmers living in Waterford or in any other county.</P>

      <P>The pig industry has never been in such a crisis in the last 40 years and those involved are not getting much support from the Government.  If corrective action is not taken our pig and bacon industry will go in the same direction that our textile and footwear industries went.  That specialised area should get the Minister's attention.  He should be prepared to invest money in it to save it because its problems are short term.  If that industry fails thousands of jobs will be lost.  In the region of 3,000 people are employed in the processing side of that industry and many are employed in the services side, the farm side and in the feed supply sector.  It would not surprise me to hear 10,000 people are employed in that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agriculture is our basic industry and if there is not an input into it by the Government our economy will suffer.  It is worth noting that Fianna Fáil have only been in Government for four and a half years of the last 13 years.  They have presided over many major negotiations in that period and we have lost several of our rightful concessions.  In the 1973-77 period I remember Deputy Collins was spokesman for Agriculture and mark Clinton was Minister for Agriculture, and he was bringing back all sorts of euphoria from Europe.  We lost out during that time because all the Minister brought <Col N="1707" /> back were transitional benefits.  We had an enormous amount of nonsense about it at the time.  We now have another Minister who sells out every time he goes to Brussels.  He should take a lead from the German farmers.</P>

      <P>We are discussing this motion against a background of the recently published ACOT corporate plan, the most dismal document published on agriculture.  It states that dairying is the only agricultural enterprise generating sufficient cash for development. Many dairy farmers would question that statement.  The plan states that cattle, beef, sheep and tillage could not generate sufficient activity to pay off interest or to provide finance for development. This is another problem year, with late growth, and farmers are supplementing their feed with costly meal.  They have had to apply additional fertiliser with little advantage.  There is a serious fall off in income with a consequent drop in living standards.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Noonan's suggestion that there should be long term subsidised loans, not for just a year or so, but until farmers get back into profitability.  We must have an extension of the severely handicapped areas.  This applies more to the constituency I represent than to many others.  There is a serious imbalance there and we in that constituency were victimised because only about 40 per cent of the region is designated.  Only that small proportion qualifies for cattle headage grants.</P>
      <P>The Social and Economic Committee of the EC in an information report a few years ago stated that statistics indicate that Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Donegal are particularly handicapped, with special claims on Community assistance. It stated that farming is the lynchpin of the economy, particularly in the south of the region, and there is very little industrial employment, very low incomes, acute unemployment, emigration and a fall in population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That should be sufficient to ensure an extension immediately of the severely <Col N="1708" /> disadvantaged areas to the region I have referred to and I ask the Minister to apply for an extension to cover the entire 12 western countries.  In west Cavan, Leitrim and Donegal there is a serious problem, with many cattle deaths, serious loss of milk yields and cattle in very poor condition. Last Saturday a man came to my clinic who had lost 12 animals out of a herd of 40.  They died even after he, a good farmer, had bought in a substantial amount of feed when his own had run out in February.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister about the closure of the Monaghan bacon factory. It employs 103 people, producing completely for export.  In that area we need exports because there is too much free importation of bacon there.  We must go out to sell our produce if we are to compete.  From 1981 we exported 33 per cent of our production but by 1985 that had dropped to 28 per cent, at a time when we should be selling abroad.</P>
    <P>Recently I asked the Minister if he would carry out a survey on production, processing and marketing of bacon and bacon products.  He said there had been a number of such surveys and another would not be of any benefit.  In order to generate employment, I ask the Minister again to look seriously at this.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to an extension of the severely handicapped areas.  I would put particular importance on a reduction in fertiliser prices.  At a meeting recently I learned that imported fertilisers can be sold at £20 to £30 a ton less than the producers we have supported throughout the years, NET.  Their prices are exorbitant for nitrogenous fertilisers.</P>
    <P>This year we must concentrate on silage making.  The Minister recently announced a 5 per cent increase in silage subsidies.  That is welcome, but it is too late in the year.  Any farmer who wishes to go into silage will have to draw up a plan through ACOT; it will have to go from there to the FDS office and then application will have to be made for planning permission.  Planning permission is bound by severe conditions nowadays because of possible effluent.  A farmer who does the full rounds would not be in <Col N="1709" /> a position to lay down his concrete base for six weeks or two months.  He would have to wait another week or ten days before emptying silage into the pit.  That would mean that a farmer would be making silage in late autumn when the product would be of questionable value.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the anomalies in the farm improvement programme.  The reference income in the western counties is £7,600, in the east it is £8,835 and in Dublin £10,800.  Farmers with 31 cows averaging 1,000 gallons each would not qualify in the western counties but in Louth or Meath or any of the Leinster counties they could qualify.  This is a serious anomaly. In previous schemes advantage was given to the low income farmers.</P>
    <P>Another serious anomaly in that scheme is the connection of the reference income system to the man work days.  An interesting statistic recently pointed out that a farmer who had 44 cattle comprising eight suckler cows, 16 beasts from nought to one year and 20 from one to two years &mdash; the number of man days is 250 per year &mdash; and such a farmer, because he has a slatted house for his cattle would be allowed only 56.  The most such a man could hope to qualify for in regard to farm development, including drainage and cattle buildings, is £9,000. It is typical of what is happening at the moment.  Most of the schemes are designed by civil servants, at the least possible cost and for the least possible benefit to the farmers.</P>

      <P>I had hoped this debate would be harmonious and constructive because there is need for a constructive debate if this House is to have any relevance. If we are going to have this kind of catcalling and interrupting we will achieve nothing for the farming community. It is important that we have a constructive discussion on this matter.  I wish to make clear that real farm incomes in 1985 were down on 1984 but that was an exceptionally good year.  Real farm incomes were considerably better than in a number of previous years, including 1980, 1981 and 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody denies there is a serious problem and we would not be truthful if we were to say otherwise.  We had the worst summer in living memory in 1985 which caused many problems, particularly with regard to the salvaging of fodder and, if that was not bad enough, we had the worst spring in living memory in 1986.  The combination of winter and <Col N="1711" /> spring which lasted for four months meant sub-zero temperatures, wind, rain and cold.  Those conditions worsened an already difficult situation and we must face up to that fact and attempt to resolve the problems that have arisen as a result.</P>
    <P>The appalling weather last summer and early autumn created very serious problems for many farmers in this country, especially for those in the west and north west who were dependent on hay for winter feed and also for some tillage farmers, mainly cereal growers.  The Government, at my behest, agreed a wide range of measures designed to ease the difficulties faced by such farmers.  The House will recall the introduction last August of the winter fodder scheme comprising a subsidy for nitrogenous fertilisers and a subsidy for the first time silage makers.  Some 24,000 and 34,000 applicants respectively availed themselves of these subsidies.  These measures were followed by the Shannon valley flood scheme under which upwards of 2,000 applicants received grant aid.  Subsequently, the feed voucher scheme was launched with a cash grant plus EC grain at a reduced price.  This scheme attracted some 90,000 applicants, over 80,000 of whom proved eligible and received assistance.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of this year as a measure to help the tillage farmers who had been hard hit and also those farmers who had suffered severe crop losses as a result of the hailstorm in July last, I introduced a special working capital scheme under which loans were made available at rates of interest which were subsidised to the extent of 5 per cent.  The total cost to the Exchequer of all these special measures was over £22 million.  In addition, 125,00 tonnes of grain were provided by the EC at a reduced price.</P>
    <P>Each of these special measures was designed to meet a particular situation and in drawing them up I was anxious to ensure that aid provided from the limited Exchequer funds available was directed to those farmers who were most in need of help.  The objective of almost all the schemes was to help farmers who were <Col N="1712" /> short of winter feed for their livestock to purchase sufficient feed to tide them over until the time when it might be expected they would have the spring growth of grass.  Certainly the schemes helped in no small measure to prevent panic selling of stock last autumn and winter.  This in itself was indeed indicative of the success of the measures in achieving their objective.</P>
    <P>However, the bad weather continued into 1986 and delayed the arrival of the normal spring growth of grass by as much as four to six weeks in many areas.  The very cold conditions which occurred during the first four months of this year were particularly difficult for farming, not only because of the unusually persistent cold spell but also because such harsh conditions succeeded one of the wettest summers and autumns in recent memory. Following the very cold and dry February, the spring was cold and wet.  At many western and north western weather stations it was the wettest spring since records began.  It was also the coldest spring since the record-breaking 1979 with temperatures ranging from 0.7ºC to 1.5ºC below normal.  The scarcity and poor quality of much cattle fodder led to considerable stress on animals over the winter and spring, especially as the cold conditions continued throughout April and much of May.</P>
    <P>All of us share the anxiety experienced by farmers, particularly those living in wet land areas.  However, an important distinction must be drawn.  Most of the country is not too badly affected, although I accept that even non-farmers are depressed by the bad weather.  Farmers living in areas with good soil can make silage and they will get by, given reasonable weather.  However, where the land is wet by nature there is a real problem.  Last week in the south of the country silage-making was proceeding at a considerable rate.  In fact, I should think that more silage was made in recent weeks when the weather improved somewhat but there are parts of the country where machinery cannot be used because the land is so wet.  I witnessed this at first hand in a number of counties.  I reject <Col N="1713" /> any criticism or snide remarks to the effect that I was not around the country to see the situation at first hand.  In the last six to 12 months I have been in every county on numerous occasions and I have seen the state of the land and the plight of many farmers.  It is not a happy situation. It is a most distressing sight to see people in extreme difficulty.  We had this peculiar difficulty in areas where the land is very wet by nature.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to define the extent of that problem.  For example, above a line approximately from Drogheda to Tuam or Galway, the problem is at its greatest; but in other parts of the country there are pockets where there are serious problems. West Limerick is an area where there is such a difficulty, as has been pointed out to me by a number of my backbench Deputies.  It is not even possible to define the areas which have these difficulties by referring to the seriously disadvantaged areas for the whole country. There are areas in the south which are classified as seriously disadvantaged but where fodder can be saved at present. There are areas which may not even be classified as seriously disadvantaged where fodder cannot be saved at present. I was in one such area last week &mdash; along the north Meath-south Cavan border and in County Louth.  When somebody mentions County Meath they think of lush pastures fertile ground and no problems, but that is not the case &mdash; there are bad spots in virtually every county.  In that area it was obvious that machinery could not be brought onto the land.  If this type of weather were to continue even intermittently throughout the summer, there will be a very serious crisis in those areas. This is a problem we will have to face.</P>
    <P>We have all heard of people eating seed potatoes, thereby eliminating the possibility of having a crop the following year. What has happened this year is that people found themselves so short of fodder during the last four months of miserable weather that they had to put livestock into fields which normally would have been retained for the production of fodder, be it hay or silage.  These people have no prospect of saving hay or <Col N="1714" /> making silage for next winter unless there is a dramatic improvement in the weather.  We will have to hope that there is an improvement because a couple of months of reasonably good weather could work wonders, but at present things do not look very encouraging.</P>
    <P>I referred to the late growth due to the very harsh spring.  Because of this we paid advances under the ewe premium scheme, £4.90 per ewe, amounting to a total of £7.2 million.  I also arranged for the payment of an advance to cattle producers of £15 per suckler cow under the current headage scheme for disadvantaged areas.  This meant that £4 million were paid to some 45,000 farmers up to the end of April.  In addition, the Government agreed to make Army transportation available to bring fodder to particularly needy areas in the west and north-west from areas in the south and east where there was surplus fodder.  I want to put on the record my thanks, and the thanks of the Government, to the Army for the very helpful work they did in this respect.</P>
    <P>More recently I have strongly urged farmers, especially those in the west and north-west, to make immediate arrangements to make silage this year rather than risk haymaking.  I repeat that exhortation here and now.  I would also like to appeal to farmers in the south and east to make whatever surplus fodder they can this year in the form of hay which can be sold and transported to any areas where a fodder shortage may exist.  This would be in the interests of those farmers and the farm organisations should be in a good position to arrange for transportation if and when required.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard mentioned delays in getting planning permission from the various semi-State services where concrete slabs for silage were concerned.  I impressed upon the farm development service, together with ACOT, the necessity for clearing those applications.  I have told them that in areas where there is great difficulty in saving fodder those applications should be cleared within ten days.</P>

As we know, planning permission is a matter for individual local authorities, in this case each county council.  I implore the local authorities to see that planning permission is given without undue delay.  Of course the local authorities may have reservations in many cases because of pollution of waterways, but within reason I would expect the planning authorities to be very helpful and to grant these planning permission, not in the statutory two months but within a matter of days. Most Deputies are members of local authorities and they can make that point very forcibly as members of local authorities. I believe these applications should be processed within a week or two.</P>

      <P>I also referred to the utilisation of hay as a source of fodder.  Some people may say that I have already stated it was preferable to make silage rather than hay.  It is most likely that people in the south and east will have silage pits full within a reasonable period, but I hope there will be co-operation between farmers, the farming organisations and the co-operative societies to see that fodder in any form, particularly in a form which can be easily transported, will be provided for farmers in parts of the country where there is a real shortage and a real difficulty.  Hay is probably the form of fodder most easy to transport and because of that the making of hay by people who have already secured their own fodder supplies for next winter should be entertained.</P>
      <P>I would like the farming organisations and the co-operative societies to co-operate in such a scheme.  It involves a little imagination and probably some innovation, but most of all a deal of goodwill between the people concerned.  If the weather is to continue as difficult as it has been, we will have to consider a major movement of fodder from the better land areas in the south and east of the country to those difficult areas in the west and north-west.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy again for his co-operation.  We must organise the fodder supplies at this stage.  It is now only 10 June.  We can avoid the worst possible aspects of what may happen if we have a particularly bad summer by moving fodder from areas where it can be grown, cut and drawn, if we get the co-operation of the farmers and the farming organisations and the co-operative movement. Remember the Trojan work last autumn in moving fodder from the south to the north west and the west.  Now is the time to plan for that type of operation to take place again.  Enough fodder will be grown in this country in the current year to feed all the livestock no matter how bad the weather gets in the course of the next few months and next winter. There will be enough fodder if we can distribute it properly.  We need mobilisation and distribution, mobilisation of the forces at our disposal and distribution of the fodder.</P>
      <P>That is what I am suggesting here tonight and that is what I will be suggesting to the farming organisations.  I have already put that to ICOS, the organisation for the co-operative movement, and to ACOT, and we have a monitoring group between my Department, ACOT and ICOS set up already at this early stage.  We set it up three weeks ago, and that is the way to act.  However, we need a great deal of goodwill.  We do not want people to exploit those who are in difficulty and we do not want profiteering.</P>

      <P>We want a great deal of goodwill.  I am providing that and I am asking people down the line to put their shoulder to the wheel.  Deputies on all sides of the House can assist in doing that.</P>
      <P>I would also remind farmers that generous grants are available under the farm improvement programme for the provision of silage storage facilities.  As a special incentive I announced last week that, subject to EC clearance, such grants approved by the farm development service within the next 12 months are being further increased from 35 per cent to 45 per cent in disadvantaged areas and from 30 per cent to 35 per cent in other areas. Grants for silage storage facilities approved under the western package during the same period are also being increased to 45 per cent.  I hope this measure will have a good response.  Weather conditions last year demonstrated clearly that in our climate it just is not possible to rely on hay in many parts of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have referred to farm incomes.  As I pointed out, the figures can be distorted if you do not use all the relevant information available.  We get the type of distortions we see in the media today because account is not taken of the dropping numbers involved in agriculture.  Over the years you can get a continual drift out of agriculture.  It is a natural sequence and nothing can be done about it.  It is less now than it used to be, but it still occurs. The following figures are pertinent and they are not borne in mind by the people who jig these statistics.  In 1970 there were 240,000 people actively engaged in working on the land.  In 1985 that figure had fallen to 155,000.  The House can see how you can get an erroneous figure if you divide by 240,000 instead of 155,000. That is the explanation for the incorrect statistics.  We have a forecast of a further fall in farm incomes this year and with the particularly bad spring that prediction could be correct, unfortunately, but a good summer could see a tremendous improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the provision of Euro loans.  So that adequate finance at reasonable interest rates will be <Col N="1719" /> available to the farming community, it has already been announced that two new exchange rate guarantee schemes are to be introduced.  One scheme will cover borrowings up to £100 million in EMS currencies for a period of a year.  A contribution of 2 per cent will be required from the borrowers as a provision against possible exchange rate losses, and any additional exchange rate loss will be met by the Exchequer.  The loans must be issued for working capital purposes to cereal growers and winter beef producers with some funds also available for dairy farmers with milk quotas not exceeding 25,000 gallons.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe referred to this and made a number of erroneous statements. One was about the 3 per cent of the milk quota levels.  That is Community wide within the EC.  It does not apply this year. We will have 2 per cent of it next year and 1 per cent in the succeeding year, and it applies in every country.  To date in the current year &mdash; when I say &ldquo;year&rdquo; I mean marketing year starting 1 April &mdash; there has been a considerable drop in the amount of milk delivered to the creameries and co-operatives in comparison with 1985, but that is due almost entirely to the bad weather conditions. I have every confidence in the farmers making the quota figure by the end of the marketing year.  I think that will be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe talked about the Euro loans at £4,000.  I do not know what he meant by that.  The Euro loans will be up to £25,000 and there is no question of £4,000.  The maximum borrowing eligible in any one case will be £25,000.</P>

In the initial days when there was talk of a Euro loan the figure of £100 million was bandied about and then the farming organisations started to look for £150 million. At the end of the day I think £135 million is a considerably generous figure, and remember that each individual farmer has the right to request his own lending institution to get Euro money for him.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hillard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate.  I hope that contributions will assist the Minister in helping to relieve the serious problems confronting our farmers.  I am sure the Minister is fully aware of the crisis which exists at present in farming. The greatest problem facing farmers is the serious situation in relation to fodder which will arise next winter and the following spring if something is not done now.</P>
      <P>Reserve stocks of fodder, hay and straw have all been used up this year and many farmers have empty hay sheds and silage pits for the first time.  The harvesting of this year's fodder crop is four to six weeks behind time; growth was never as slow due to the weather.  It is most unlikely that even the minimum fodder requirements for 1986-87 will be harvested even though the Minister said he is quite satisfied that there will be ample fodder to feed all livestock.  The Minister will have to make a few more tours to get the information which he did not get on his first round of visits to farmers because the farmers to whom I speak will not be in a position to feed livestock in the autumn and early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to immediately <Col N="1722" /> introduce a new fertiliser and lime subsidy scheme with special assistance for farmers most in need.  This would be a simple way to encourage farmers most in need to provide extra feed for their livestock with the least administrative costs.  I stress this because the loans being made available now should reach the farmers' pockets in full, with the least red tape.  I am worried that a lot of this money will not go directly to the farmers and that a big percentage will be used in administration costs.</P>
    <P>More livestock will die next year from starvation unless something constructive is done now by the Minister and the Government.  Feed which is needed for the winter and early spring should be provided for at present and, therefore, subsidies for fertilisers and lime should be provided now.  The Minister must be aware of the drastic reductions in the purchase of fertilisers and lime over the last 12 months.  Every extra pound which the Government invest in this area now will save taxpayers' money in the future. I appeal to the Minister to implement a new fertiliser and lime subsidy scheme immediately.</P>
    <P>Livestock, especially young animals, will need extra feeding and it will cost much more money to bring them to beef in future.  Another aspect is the extra unemployment which will occur in beef processing plants because, if the pattern of beef production is allowed to decline, the factories at some stage will have a shortage of supply.  Our livestock export trade could also be seriously affected because our cattle will not be of the quality for which they are renowned and, as a result, we could lose export markets in this area.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has the full picture of the seriousness of what can happen in the future.  The best way to provide extra fodder is by encouraging farmers to use more fertiliser and lime now.  This is the only way that the extra fodder needed will be provided.  Crisis measures are needed to prevent another and more disastrous animal fodder shortfall next year.  I call on the Minister and the Government to act now and to launch <Col N="1723" /> a nationwide fodder campaign.  They should also give a cash injection to help farmers most in need.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement regarding the extra incentive to encourage farmers to produce more silage, as this scheme will certainly help to provide extra fodder.  With regard to the distribution of the new loans, the co-operative societies, financial and banking institutions all have a major role to play in assisting farmers.  I suggest that the 2 per cent handling charge should not be levied because the banks and financial institutions will only be securing repayments of existing loans, which farmers, in many cases, will find very difficult to do.  Banks and financial institutions should not look on this aid as a short term solution.</P>
    <P>The Government should also waive their 2 per cent charge, even for the first year, because it will be further recognition of the serious financial difficulties facing farmers and would give them more confidence and belief in themselves to continue in agriculture production, which is very important.  The Government must seek increased EC aid immediately to help the farming industry to get back on its feet and to get over the worst effects of the weather.</P>
    <P>Many farming families, through no fault of their own, are now in serious financial difficulties and they must receive extra aid.  Milk production output has been reduced by 10 per cent this year already and feed costs have increased by 25 per cent.  It is easy to understand why many farmers will end up with huge trading losses at the end of the year.  Even farmers who wish to sell some of their land to reduce borrowing now find that there are no buyers, except at a very low price.  Farmers' confidence was never as low as it is not just the farmer who is affected; his wife and children also suffer.</P>
    <P>I should also like to impress on the Minister that there is an urgent need for a new and revised national rescue package on the basis of existing records available to the Minister.  I am very disappointed that the Minister and the <Col N="1724" /> Government decided to abolish the scheme to expand our national breeding herd as the Estimates for 1986 clearly confirm.  A sum of £5 million was provided in 1985 but nothing has been provided in 1986.</P>
    <P>The Government have also more or less abolished the scheme for payment under exchange rate guaranteed loans because £10.6 million was provided in the Estimates for 1985 and only £0.6 million was provided in 1986, a reduction of £10 million.  Surely this amount can now be provided to assist our farmers.  This money was used specifically to encourage farmers to feed cattle to beef on grass over the summer months.  I criticise the EC farm package for its failure to help and encourage small farming families since it was the big EC producer who was causing most of the surpluses in Europe. I find it very difficult to understand why Ireland, which is still 40 per cent behind the Community average in development, should have been requested to comply with the freezing of agricultural production levels.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that the greatest problem facing farmers is the lack of confidence they have in the present Coalition Government.  It is the duty and responsibility of the Government to get out of office now and let in the Government the people want and will have confidence in and will work for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to give total unqualified support to this motion.  It is the most important motion this House has debated in my three and a half years here.  The present situation in agriculture in the west is the worst in the history of our country since the days of black '47. Livestock are dying; there is no fodder; farmers are flat broke and the financial institutions are exerting far too much pressure on all farmers, many of whom find themselves in financial difficulty.  As far as I am concerned, the Agricultural Credit Corporation are reneging on their obligations as a so-called farmers' bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in the west has reached catastrophic crisis proportions.  Every third farmer is in serious financial difficulty. <Col N="1725" /> Most lands are too wet to travel on with machinery.  There is a total shortage of fodder and little grass.  Only half of the beet crop is sown; two-thirds of cereals are sown; one tenth of the potato crop is sown and about one-twentieth of the silage crop is cut at the moment.  These are the stark figures that illustrate how serious the situation is in the west at this time.  Cattle, and even some sheep, are dying.  Farmers are totally frustrated with the inclement weather, with the losses of stock, with diminishing returns and the pressure of financial institutions.  There is a serious exodus of farm workers and farm people out of agriculture in the west.  The situation is so serious that farmers are leaving their wives and families overnight and emigrating to different parts of the world in the dark of night to try to make ends meet and put a few pounds together to ensure that their families have some subsistence available to them.  That is how serious the situation is.  Other farmers are contemplating more serious action than that.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Paul Connaughton, represents the west but he has failed miserably in his three and a half years as Minister of State to bring this serious situation to the notice of his co-Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, and ultimately to the notice of the Cabinet to ensure that measures are taken to alleviate the situation.  I ask the Minister to provide immediate aid.  I ask for a subsidy on the abnormally high cost of fertilisers as a matter of urgent priority. Farmers cannot even go on to land to spread fertiliser because it is too wet. This time last year they had their silage cut.  We have a short growing season and we must ensure that when the land dries farmers will be in a position to spread fertiliser to ensure sufficient production of grass and silage to carry stock over the forthcoming winter.  If we do not do that, not alone will the livestock industry be under threat, but the whole population. I ask the Minister also to restore the AI and lime subsidies so that we can preserve our stocking rates and make up for the serious losses that have eroded cattle numbers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1726" /> I also ask that the severely handicapped areas be extended to cover all of County Galway and all of the 12 western counties.  A small effort was made in the past few years to extend this.  But the farmers in the west, and particularly those in my constituency, are totally frustrated by the exclusion of some areas which, due to the topography of the area, the abnormally long winter, the poor soil and the small fragmented farms, should have been included.  The entire western area should be included in the handicaped areas.</P>
    <P>I also ask that the time available for the completion of all current projects sanctioned for work, or work which has started under the western drainage scheme and under the western package, be extended for at least 12 months because the land is too wet for farmers to complete the work which they have started.  I also ask that all current applications under both of these schemes be sanctioned to ensure that work can go ahead so that land in the western areas can be brought into some type of production.</P>
    <P>I specifically appeal to the Minister for Agriculture &mdash; because I believe he has not exerted the pressure that he could because of his position &mdash; to exert such pressure on the financial institutions.  We have a very serious situation.  I know serveral people who are in dire straits and the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, knows them better than I do because they have to deal with him.  Every third farmer in the western areas is in serious financial difficulty.  I know people with gross assets of £180,000 and current liabilities of £60,000 who owe money to four or five financial institutions &mdash; £20,000 to the ACC and up to £40,000 to various banks and possibly £7,000 to £10,000 to the local authority for a county council loan, and there seems to be nothing the Minister or the Minister of State can do to alleviate the situation.</P>
    <P>Farmers are being told nothing can be done.  There is no reason why these loans cannot be restructured into one long-term loan taking into account the age of a farmer and giving him up to the age <Col N="1727" /> of 66, a long term, to meet his current liabilities.  There is no reason why the ACC, as a semi-State body under the control of this State, should not take farmers out of the serious financial plight they are in at this time.  There is no reason why criteria could not be drawn up for restructuring so that there would be safeguards by way of mortgage protection insurance on both partners, husband and wife, on the family farm, so that if either spouse dies there is security for the lenders.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister before, and I ask him again tonight, to set up a particular section in his Department to deal with the many farmers who are in serious financial difficulty at the moment, to exert sufficient pressure on the banks and the other financial institutions so that this restructuring can be done.  There is no reason why it cannot be done.  The best collateral in the country is land and houses and they are readily available from Irish farmers who are in difficulty through no fault of their own.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Government to ensure that the £500,000 voted by this House for the Shannon flood scheme is spent because it has not been spent in 1985. The Taoiseach came down to Roscommon waving a big cheque of £1 million for the farmers who were in serious difficulty. I am suspicious and dubious about the large amount the people in County Roscommon got in grant aid under this system.  When one takes into account the large numbr of farmers in the other counties, it seems questionable that such a large number of applicants in Roscommon have been accommodated.  It would seem that it is for political reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take the opportunity of asking you to convey to the Ceann Comhairle my thanks for allowing me to raise this very important matter on the Adjournment, the subject matter of which is the administrator's report of last weekend following the collapse of ICI, the question of the administrator's workload and the results to date of his appointment.</P>
      <P>We are asking the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the very great public concern at the continued escalation of losses as announced by the administrator of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, which are very many times above the original estimate given by the Government last year, he will state, first, the final figure for the losses of ICI; secondly, how he proposes that they should be financed without recourse to the taxpayer and without imposing further burdens on insurance policy holders, who in recent years have paid large increases in premiums far in excess of the rate of inflation; thirdly, that he will reaffirm the Government's guarantee given in March last year that no financial burden would be placed on either the Exchequer or the taxpayer in support of these losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We regard the whole question of the ICI debacle as a major loss of Government credibility.  It seems that the Government are either unwilling or unable to assess the damage following the ICI collapse.  It is only when one takes a casual look at the Official Report of Dáil Éireann last year, when the matter was discussed on the introduction of the emergency legislation, that one realises how much out of touch the Government were at that time and perhaps still are with the real situation in ICI.  I refer to Minister Bruton's statement in the House on 27 March 1985 that it would take the administrator about six weeks to clarify matters in so far as the losses of ICI were concerned.  He also said that the 1984 losses would be at least £65 million, resulting in a minimum deficit of £25 million for the year in shareholders' funds. He also stated, at column 700 on the same date, that the losses would be in the <Col N="1730" /> region of £50 million and perhaps up to £120 million.  However, he was very careful to say that the £120 million was the absolute upper limit and that he did not in any way believe that that would be the most likely figure.  How mistaken the Minister was on that occasion.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance at the time, Deputy Dukes, speaking on 28 March 1985, gave an undertaking that the Government would assess the situation again not later than 31 December 1985. At column 1044 of the Official Report he stated that the Central Bank had considered the problem and decided to provide sufficient funding, in conjunction with the banking system, up to the figure as outlined by Minister Bruton.  It is in connection with that sentence that I must ask the Minister for some clarification. On that occasion Minister Dukes stated that the money that would be made available would accommodate only losses up to the maximum figure of £120 million as suggested the previous day by Minister Bruton.  Minister Dukes also explained at that time that the Exchequer would not now be involved in funding the administration of ICI.</P>
    <P>I now put it to Minister Noonan that if Minister Dukes was accurate on that occasion then surely somebody must have to find the extra money now necessary to meet the additional losses as announced by administrator McCann.  Minister Dukes on that occasion also stated that the £70 million, made up of £50 million of soft loans and the £20 million made available by AIB, would provide ample funds for the foreseeable funding requirements of the administrator.  I have to put it to the Minister that that £70 million does not meet the needs of the administrator at this time and somebody will have to clarify the source of the extra funding.</P>
    <P>My last reference puts the matter in perspective in so far as Minister Bruton was concerned on 27 March 1985, as reported at column 700.  He stated then that the administrator would be funded by the compensation fund, Allied Irish Banks, banking and insurance generally and, only as a last resort, the Exchequer. Since the moneys provided at that time <Col N="1731" /> do not now meet the requirements of the administrator in funding the losses as announced last weekend, I am of the opinion that it will fall back to Minister Bruton's statement that as a last resort the Exchequer would have to come to the rescue of ICI.  Certainly, that would be contrary to his firm guarantee to the country that taxpayers and the Exchequer would not be involved further.</P>
    <P>What we heard last weekend is just a further instalment of the shock treatment meted out to the general public in the past few years as far as ICI business is concerned.  One must agree that the general public were in some awe at the figure of £340 million for the losses accumulated. They find it extraordinary that these losses could come about in a few short years without somebody knowing what was going on, whether it was the accountancy firms, the involved banks or, more importantly, the monitoring and supervision of the Department that fell down on the job.  The general public do not understand how that could come about with all the experts involved over a long number of years.</P>
    <P>Does this loss figure of £340 million represent the final and absolute amount that will be involved in ICI losses?  Even if all the reinsurers who are talked about were to welch on their contracts, will that figure of £340 million still stand?  Is it true to say that that is not yet the realistic final figure as far as ICI losses are concerned? One must bear in mind the administrator's reference to the 1983 accounting figures.  He was not satisfied that they represented a true and accurate statement of the financial position of accounts for the year 1983.  If that is the case, there is certainly flexibility in the wording as used last weekend, which can only mean that, should it happen that the 1983 figures are proved not to be a true and accurate statement of the financial position at that date, then the £340 million will be breached and perhaps the £500 million spoken of here and in London might yet be the accurate figure.</P>
    <P>It can be fairly stated that the general public could be excused for being somewhat <Col N="1732" /> doubtful and sceptical about the figures now put forward by the administrator. He was appointed on 15 March 1985 and it has taken him some 15 months to unravel the mess in ICI.  The interim report stated quite clearly that the deficit would be perhaps £164 million up to December 1984.  Now we are told that the figure is £226 million at end of December 1985.  I take it that that latter figure is dependent on the accuracy of the balance sheet of December 1983, on which the administrator cast some doubt when answering questions on the matter last weekend.  What is the current involvement of the ICI in insurance underwriting in this country at this time?  Have they closed down the London office, which was to a large extent responsible for the major losses inflicted on the insurance industry?  Have the binding authorities and contracts been terminated in that London office, or are we still writing contracts in the London office?  How much of the total premium being written by the ICI now comes from the London source? Is it ICI's intention to finally close that London office?  We all know that ICI had and still have a significant portion of the public liability and the employer liability market in Ireland.  The Irish office of ICI was not a major lossmaker at the time of the collapse.  I hope we are not penalising those who are taking contracts under PL and EL with the ICI today in the hope that the poor Irish long-suffering employer and businessman is helping to restore the solvency more than he should have to.</P>
    <P>The question of reinsurers has again come under very close scrutiny.  It is obvious to everybody that many of the reinsurers with which ICI were involved are in a very weak financial position.  Are the ICI still using those reinsurers in their business efforts?  If they are, we can only presume that there will be very substantial losses many years from now.  It is quite laudable for the administrator to chase them through the courts.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate to them that there is not much point in chasing them through the courts just to get a pyrrhic victory if they do not have the resources <Col N="1733" /> to meet the claims by ICI.  A victory in those circumstances would be very poor consolation indeed.</P>
    <P>The new auditors of ICI have stated that the deficit will be about £226 million based on the probable financial outcome. I regard that kind of language as being indicative that they are not yet satisfied as to what the final result and losses of ICI will be.  Consequently, it must be assumed that they are unable to assess whether the company's provisions have in fact been understated or overstated. The Minister owes it to the general public to finally clear up this matter.  Is there still a grey area involved in so far as the final outcome of losses are concerned? The administrator went on record as saying that he is not satisfied with the 1983 accounts.  If that is the case, it will take some time to reflect all this in the true financial position.  That being the case it can only lead the general public to believe that this is no more than a further interim statement on behalf of the Government's appointed administrator.</P>
    <P>In so far as the funding of ICI is concerned, the £100 million that has been made available to it from the compensation fund has been borrowed at a very preferential rate of 2 per cent.  Can this position continue when one considers the strains and the demands being made on the compensation funds, not just by the ICI but also by the PMPA, the other lossmaker in so far as insurance is concerned and which was the subject of emergency legislation in this House? What resources has the fund available to it?  Who is going to give the guarantee that that fund will be maintained and that continued large injections of cash will be given to these ailing companies?  If the guarantee is being provided by the Government there must be some cost to the Exchequer.  That is contrary to the guarantee given by both the Minister for Finance and his predecessor in March last year.</P>
    <P>It is now stated that the outstanding claims of ICI are in the region of £440 million.  I would like to ask the Minister if he is satisfied that the administrator has enough cash flow and investment income <Col N="1734" /> to met this kind of demand?  If not, where will the extra money come from?  Has he a guarantee from the Central Bank and the other financial institutions that they are prepared to continue financing, whether by soft loans or commercial loans, all the necessary moneys that will be needed by the administrator to meet his obligations?</P>
    <P>There was no reference last weekend to two very important matters.  The Minister, as the guardian of the office which controls, monitors and supervises insurance companies, owes it to the country to answer those two questions this evening.  There is no talk about what the administrator's expense and costs will be. It is not adequate for the administrator to say that they are just lumped into the general expenses.  For the Minister to say that the administrator's expenses are irrelevant is not satisfactory as the expenditure of such moneys will eventually have to be met by the Exchequer or by the policyholders.  The Minister should at least give an indication as to the likely outcome of the administrator's costs and expenses.  There should be a costing done on the legal fees that will be involved. Following up reinsurers in international courts and taking court actions against thousands of people is a very expensive process.  We are at least entitled to know the legal costs and the administrator's costs.  Otherwise it is nonsense coming into this House and asking the Dáil to give permission to appoint administrators under emergency legislation without at least having some control over the cheque book which is being used on our behalf.</P>
    <P>We all want to see ICI, as a major insurer, return to solvency.  That is very important for business, for commercial interests and for all the policyholders concerned. We support the efforts being taken by the administrator to achieve the desired aim of returning this company to solvency.  There must be some accountability to this House following the emergency legislation of March 1985.  As of this date, there is no accountability on several crucial issues.  The Minister should remove our anxiety in so far as these matters are concerned.  The questions of <Col N="1735" /> administration costs, legal fees, the final figure, whether there is still a grey area and of whether the guarantee that the Irish taxpayer will be in no way involved in funding the losses of ICI should be addressed.  There is major public concern in so far as the whole debacle is concerned.  We want the Minister to give a categorical reassurance this evening that we have heard the last miserable statistic in so far as ICI are concerned and that the fears that have been generated by some of the ambiguous terms and phrases used in the weekend press reports do not have any substance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am surprised that the Deputy should deem it necessary to raise this issue in these circumstances, given that all the information he has sought was already provided in the Government Information Services statement issued on my behalf on Friday last, 6 June.  In that statement, I noted that the audited accounts for the Insurance Corporation of Ireland for the two years to 31 December 1985 showed a deficit of £226 million in the balance sheet at end 1985.  The figure is greater than was expected, but it is significantly below that predicted by many financial and political commentators.</P>
      <P>The initial estimate mentioned in March 1985 preceded the appointment of the administrator.  The figure announced in July 1985 was arrived at by the administrator after a short time within the company and was based on the best accounting, actuarial and legal advice available at that time.</P>
      <P>Since then the administrator has had a special project team examining individually all of the policies written by the company both at home and abroad.  The findings of this team were examined by independent actuarial and legal experts. The accounts for the two year period to 31 December 1985 prepared by the administrator on foot of those exercises were then subjected to close scrutiny by the auditors.  The result is the new deficit figure of £226 million announced by the administrator last Friday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1736" /> In my press release last Friday, I acknowledged the current profitable trading position of the company as a result of the steps taken by the administrator and the staff of the company, and the support given to them by the Government. I also stated that the deficit could be carried by the company until, as is noted by the administrator in his report, they attracted new capital following a track record of profitability.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Government decision to place the company in administration in 1985 was to avoid a direct and immediate threat to the stability of a leading bank and, by extension, the banking system as a whole and to protect jobs by continuing insurance cover.  That decision was subsequently supported by all parties in the House.</P>
    <P>The financing arrangements for the administration announced by the Central Bank on 4 October last made it clear that the cost of those arrangements would be borne by the banking sector.  In my statement of last Friday I made it clear that, if any further funds were required in the medium term to finance working capital, these would be arranged on the basis of commercial borrowing, the cost of which would be serviced by the company. Accordingly, no cost will fall on the taxpayer either from the earlier arrangements or from any such future arrangement that might be necessary and which would simply be a facility to meet any cash need if and when it arose.</P>
    <P>I would now like, for the record, to refer to my statement of 6 June 1986 on the publication of the Insurance Corporation's accounts for the two years to 31 December 1985.  In that statement, I mentioned that the report of the administrator published with the accounts indicated that the company are already trading more profitably than originally anticipated.  I noted that the audited accounts showed a deficit in the balance sheet at end 1985 of £226 million.  This deficit can be carried by the company until, as is noted by the administrator in his report, they attract new capital following a track record of profitability.</P>
    <P>I also noted that the balance sheet <Col N="1737" /> showed short term deposits and cash totalling £173 million at December 1985, an advance of £100 million having been received from the banking sector in 1985, and stated that if further funds were required in the medium term to finance working capital, these would be arranged on the basis of commercial borrowing, the cost of which would be serviced by the company.  I pointed out that no cost would fall on the taxpayer from such an arrangement which would simply be a facility to meet any cash need if and when it arises.</P>
    <P>I acknowledged the current profitable trading position of the company as a result of the steps taken by the administrator and staff of the company, and the support given to them by the Government. The Government decision to place the company in administration in 1985 was to avoid a direct and immediate threat to the stability of a leading bank and, by extension, the banking system as a whole, and to protect jobs by continuing insurance cover.</P>
    <P>The Insurance Corporation's continued trading should benefit from the generally improved underwriting environment now existing.  The combined effects of measures in relation to safety, the drop in inflation which will put a brake on claims costs, and the planned change in the jury system should improve the trading position of insurers generally and so benefit insurance policyholders.</P>
    <P>I would now like to summarise the background to the placing of ICI under administration, the reasons for the action taken by the Government, the main developments since March 1985 and the progress of the administration to date. As Deputies are aware, ICI were acquired for a nominal sum from AIB on 15 March 1985 by a company controlled by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  ICI were subsequently on the same day placed under administration by order of the High Court.  As Deputy Flynn knows, the administrator when it comes to expenses or costs will be approved by the High Court because he is an officer of the court.  The arrangements <Col N="1738" /> made by the Government in March 1985 prevented developments that would have been seriously disruptive in both the insurance and banking sectors, and potentially in an even wider national context.</P>
    <P>The collapse of ICI would have led to immediate job losses in commerce and in industry, because of lack of insurance cover.  The company were the biggest single underwriter in the country of employers liability insurance, accounting for up to 25 per cent including that of many commercial and semi-State bodies. Allowing the company to be liquidated would have removed all cover on policies issued by them, and transferred the Irish underwriting liabilities of the company to the insurance compensation fund, and hence to insurance policyholders, at a cost well in excess of £150 million alone, if the company had been liquidated on the insurance side.  In addition, the problems for policyholders of arranging new cover and the ensuing disruption of production would have placed a considerable strain on the economy.</P>
    <P>Above all, the fact that ICI were owned by the country's largest bank created gave dangers for the banking sector as well.  It was difficult for my predecessor in office to state it in categoric terms but the firm advice of the Central Bank was that it was imperative that ICI should not be put into liquidation, receivership or any form of special administration while in the ownership of AIB.  These developments threatened to destabilise the banking sector, the economy generally and, perhaps, even the standing of the national currency.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank's advice was that the collapse of ICI would have involved substantial dangers to the banking system since it would have been perceived internationally as a default by Ireland's major bank, which had by then suffered the loss of the £85 million which it had invested in the company.  There were also possibilities of these problems leading to a major run on Irish banks and calls on their depositors and customers.  It was unlikely that the damage could have been confined to <Col N="1739" /> that.  This, and the other factors mentioned earlier, could have meant hardship for literally every family in the country.</P>
    <P>The prompt and effective action by the Government maintained confidence in the financial and insurance sectors, and in the economy generally.  While it was possible at the time these events occurred to spell out in detail the effects of removing from cover 25 per cent of those covered in the country and the consequent loss of jobs, it was not possible at the time for obvious reasons to spell out the threat to the AIB and the banking system generally.  We are now in a position to spell it out.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> All Deputies in this House will realise that the prompt action which was taken by the Government with the support of the Opposition was one of the crucial decisions which was made in the economy in recent years and it protected the banking system from a very serious threat.  The initial assessment by the administrator quantified the balance sheet deficit of ICI at £164 million.  What he has now produced is £226 million.  The auditor's certificate raised no fundamental qualification or reservation about these estimates.  If as a result of this balance sheet deficit there is a cash flow problem as the year goes on or into next year, my advice is that the administrator will have no difficulty in raising a loan at a commercial rate to finance any cash flow problem which might arise.  In the meantime he has trimmed down the company, as everybody knows and it is in the statements. He has sold off the parts which were trading unprofitably.  For example, London is still doing business but the business is down from £200 million, as it was last year, to £10 million in 1986. Therefore, there is a huge drop in the amount of business which is being written in London.  As the Deputy knows, other offices have been closed down.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I understand that there have been claims in two of the cases and that this has given rise to problems.

If the Deputy has any further information on this perhaps he can contact my Department.</P>
      <P>I should point out that, while the cases will be investigated to see if the problems can be resolved, I cannot compel an insurer to take on any particular risk or to charge a particular premium.  This must be left to the insurer's commercial judgment.</P>

      <P>The only compulsory purchase order waiting determination by me in the area to which the Deputy refers, is the Dublin County Council Compulsory Purchase (Robinhood Road) Order, 1986. This order was made by Dublin County Council on 11 March 1986 and was submitted to me for confirmation on 24 March 1986.  The purpose of the order is the acquisition of lands for improving Robinhood Road from the Long Mile Road to the entrance to the Robinhood Industrial Estate, with ancillary improvements. <Col N="1571" /> Since valid objections to the order have been made to me within the statutory period, I must cause a public local inquiry to be held.  There will be no avoidable delay in making the necessary arrangements and in the final determination of the matter.</P>
      <P>Two motorway schemes, providing, <i>inter alia</i> for compulsory acquisition of lands in the Dublin Belgard area, have been submitted to me for approval under the Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974.  These are: (i) The Dublin County Council (Western Parkway, Galway Road-Navan Road) motorway scheme 1985 made by Dublin County Council on 20 December 1985 and submitted for approval on 23 December 1985.  The purpose of this scheme is to provide for the construction of a dual-carriageway motorway linking the N4 Galway Road to the N3 Navan Road, incorporating a high level bridge over the River Liffey at the Strawberry Beds.  A public local inquiry in relation to this scheme was held on 12 May 1986.</P>
      <P>(ii)  The Kildare County (Kilcock, Maynooth and Leixlip By-Pass) motorway scheme 1985 made by Kildare County Council on 18 December 1985 and submitted for approval on 7 February 1986.  The purpose of this scheme is to provide for the construction of a dual-carriageway motorway from the already improved section of the N4 road just west of Kilcock to the proposed by-pass of Lucan, by-passing the towns of Kilcock, Maynooth and Leixlip.  A portion of the scheme lies in the Dublin Belgard area. A public local inquiry in relation to this scheme was held from 19 to 22 May 1986.</P>
      <P>Before taking decisions on these schemes, it is necessary for me to give detailed consideration to the evidence given at the inquiries, the reports of the inspectors who conducted the inquiries and all objections to the schemes which have been lodged and which have not been withdrawn.  There will be no avoidable delay in determining the schemes.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the question of whether or not a repayment of tax is due in this case cannot be determined until such time as the tax affairs of the taxpayer's husband are resolved.  The couple are assessable to income tax on their combined income under the provisions of section 194 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and the records show that the husband has arrears of tax for the years 1980-81 to 1984-85.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The taxpayer was advised of the position by the inspector when she telephoned <Col N="1579" /> the tax office on 26 September 1985 and it was not intimated to her that any repayment was due.</P>
    <P>In an effort to resolve the matter the inspector will invite the taxpayer and her husband to call to the tax office for a discussion of their tax position.  If the matter cannot be dealt with satisfactorily in this manner, the case will be listed for hearing before the Appeal Commissioner.</P>

      <P>Details regarding the currency composition of the foreign debt are contained in the Finance Accounts which are presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas each year as prescribed by statute.

A development control plan is currently being prepared and is expected to be completed by Autumn 1986.  This plan will outline in detail the precise nature of the phasing for the total development.</P>
      <P>The provision of a psychiatric unit at Naas Hospital has been identified as a priority.  In parallel with the preparation of the development control plan, detailed planning of a 30 bed acute psychiatric unit together with a day hospital is proceeding so that it can be brought into operation as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The budget cost, based on 1984 prices, for the whole project is set at £13.75 million while the basic cost of the psychiatric unit is set at £1.009 million.

At present the school medical examination is provided at three yearly intervals and the aim is to reduce this to every two years. However, due to expansion of the developmental paediatric programme there is a staff shortage and it is not possible to achieve this at present.

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment <Col N="1591" /> assistance is subject to the condition that a claimant must be available for and genuinely seeking work.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance from 30 December 1985 and was paid at the weekly rate of £45.25, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £72.25, less means of £27.</P>
      <P>His claim was reviewed in April 1986 and on completion of inquiries by a social welfare officer his claim was disallowed from 30 December 1985 to 2 April 1986 on the grounds that he was not available for work during that period.  As a result of the disallowance an overpayment of £610.90 has been assessed against him.</P>
      <P>Following a reinvestigation of his means in connection with his claim he was assessed with nil means with effect from 4 April 1986.  He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at the maximum weekly rate appropriate in his case of £72.25 with effect from that date.  Arrears of unemployment assistance due for the period from 4 April 1986 to 3 June 1986 of £234 were offset against the overpayment of £610.90 leaving a balance to be recovered of £376.90.  This balance will be recovered in weekly instalments of £4 and weekly payments of £68.25 will be made to the person concerned, the first payment at that rate being made to him this week.</P>

      <P>The man concerned is being paid unemployment assistance since October 1985 on the basis of a qualification certificate showing means of £21 weekly, derived from benefit from his wife's earnings.  His weekly payment has been £35.40, that is the maximum short duration rate of £56.40 payable to a man with an adult dependant, less means of £21.</P>
      <P>It recently came to light that he should have been in receipt of the long duration rate of unemployment assistance since 19 February 1986 after he had been receiving unemployment assistance for 390 days.  Therefore, his correct unemployment assistance entitlement is £39.15 weekly, being the appropriate maximum long duration rate payable in his case of £60.15 less means of £21.  Payment of arrears due to him from 19 February 1986 will be made this week.</P>
      <P>He recently applied for a review of his means and his case was referred to a social welfare officer for inquiries.

      <P>The Department of Social Welfare issues in excess of four million cheques each year.  As only a very small proportion of them are incorrectly cashed, it is not correct to say that traders, banks, etc.  who are involved in the cashing of these cheques are undergoing substantial loss.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless the Department is concerned that all its cheques should be properly cashed for the benefit of claimants and over the past year there have been discussions with many of the leading retailers and representative groups to ensure that everyone engaged in cashing social welfare cheques takes proper precautions.</P>
      <P>The Department has also advertised on a number of occasions warning traders etc. of the need to be careful as to the identity of persons for whom they were cashing cheques.  Guidelines have been issued to assist traders and there is currently a distribution of these guidelines being organised through one of the relevant major representative bodies.</P>
      <P>Over the past year and a half the Department has greatly improved its administrative system for dealing with the improper encashment of its cheques and has recently introduced new computer aided procedure for dealing much more speedily with the problem.  Under the new procedure the time taken to identify, retrieve and return cheques wrongfully cashed has been substantially reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consideration has and is being given to the question of identification for claimant <Col N="1596" /> cashing social welfare cheques but the Deputy will appreciate that the development of a safe, secure yet cost-effective and efficient system is fraught with many problems and difficulties.</P>
    <P>However, in the final analysis the onus for taking due precautions in the matter of cashing social welfare cheques must, as with all cheque cashing, lie with the trader, bank etc.  It is hoped that the steps that the Department has taken to date, coupled with the ongoing co-operation of all who are involved in the area of cheque encashment, will significantly and progressively reduce the level of the problem.</P>

      <P>The person concerned last signed as unemployed on 7 January 1986. At that time he was in receipt of unemployment assistance at £13.40 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate of unemployment assistance payable in his case of £31.75 less means of £18.35, derived from the value of board and lodgings in his parents' home.</P>
      <P>He had earlier appealed against the means assessment, and the case was referred to an appeals officer for determination.  At the request of the appeals officer a letter was issued to him regarding how his means were assessed and he was advised that he was being afforded a further opportunity of submitting a written statement of the facts and contentions on which he relied in support of his appeal.</P>
      <P>When the relevant statement was submitted his case was referred to a social welfare officer for further inquiries. These inquiries were completed recently and his case has been resubmitted to the appeals officer for determination at the earliest available opportunity.</P>
      <P>The entitlement of the person concerned to a higher payment of unemployment assistance during the periods for which he proved unemployment from 23 October 1985 to 7 January 1986 will be reviewed in the light of the outcome of the appeal.</P>

      <P>The means of the person concerned were assessed with effect from 11 March 1985 at £38.20 weekly derived from the profit from his holding and from the value of capital.  In calculating the means, the deciding officer took into consideration the gross income of the farm at £5,345 per annum less expenses amounting to £3,560 per annum incurred in earning that income.  The net income from the farm was calculated, therefore, at £1,785 per annum and in addition the value of his capital calculated in accordance with the statutory provisions amounted to £203.74.

      <P>The family income supplement scheme was designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families.  In many cases such workers were only marginally better off than if they were claiming disability or unemployment benefit and the scheme was intended to reduce the extent of this poverty trap.  These considerations do not apply in the case of self-employed persons including farmers, who are not entitled to social insurance benefits and accordingly they were not included in the scheme.  It is not proposed to alter the terms of the scheme to include persons who are not employees.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of the need to stimulate the making of silage on a wider scale, particularly in the western region, and to this end, grant aid for silage storage facilities is available under the farm improvement programme (FIP) and in the west under the programme for western development (PWD).  In view of the adverse weather conditions, these grants are being increased to 45 per cent in disadvantaged areas and 35 per cent in other areas for silage storage facilities the construction of which is approved between 6 June 1986 and 31 May 1987.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 144 and 148 together.  The licensing and supervision of local slaughterhouses, including those slaughtering pigs, is the responsibility of local authorities.  These slaughterhouses do not have to conform to EC standards as they are not engaged in Intra-Community trade.  The charging of veterinary inspection fees in respect of animals slaughtered at such premises is a matter for individual local authorities.</P>
      <P>The Government have decided that legislation should be introduced to apply standards of veterinary control and hygiene at local slaughterhouses which will be on a par with the standards applying at meat export plants.  Preparatory work on this legislation is at an advanced stage. Detailed heads of a Bill have now been circulated to other Departments concerned and I hope to introduce the Bill in the next Dáil session.  Under the new proposals it is intended that all local slaughterhouses will be licensed by my Department and that local authorities will be required to apply strict veterinary inspection of all slaughterings and to charge fees to meet the cost of such inspection.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146, 147, 149 and 155 together.  I am aware of the current difficulties in the pig meat industry.  A major contributing cause is weak market demand which, coupled with an oversupply of pigs, is creating problems in many member states of the EC.  In order to ease pressure on the Community market the EC scheme of aids to private storage has recently been augmented by an increase in export refunds, which I pressed for at the recent meeting of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the Irish pigmeat industry, the greatest need is for rationalisation of slaughtering premises, involving the replacement of many inefficient old plants by a smaller number of larger scale plants which could be operated on a more efficient basis.  In addition, processing <Col N="1612" /> plants must be modernised so that with the latest equipment and technology more efficient use of resources would be possible.  Generous grant aid is available from the IDA and FEOGA to suitable applicants for this purpose.  I should also mention that at my request consideration is being given by the EC Commission to the possibility of increasing the level of FEOGA investment aid for pigmeat projects throughout Ireland to that at present available in the disadvantaged regions here.  At marketing level, a more aggressive approach to selling at home and abroad is required.  More resources need to be devoted to the areas of product quality and diversification into value-added production.</P>
    <P>At producer level the industry is well structured and impressive results have been obtained in increasing productivity. It is essential that production costs, particularly with regard to feed, are kept to a minimum and, in this regard, it is in the industry's interest to ensure that cost advantages are not given to competitors.</P>
    <P>On veterinary fees, I would remind Deputies that substantial relief has already been provided in this area over the last four years, both by reduction in the level of the fee itself and also by arrangements relating to arrears.</P>
    <P>As regards MCAs for the pigmeat sector, these will be the subject of further discussion in the Council of Ministers later this month with a view to determining future arrangements.  I will be endeavouring to ensure that our traders will not be disadvantaged by the new system.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, because of the serious financial state of the Irish port and bacon industry which is now in a serious loss-making situation, he will make 60,000 tons of intervention grain consisting of 40,000 tons of barley and 20,000 tons of wheat available to feed compounders from 10 June 1986 at £100 per ton; if this intervention grain will be sold from stores in this country at less than that price; if intervention grain was sold in 1985 out of stores in this country at the low price of £97 per ton; as it would be of enormous benefit to the livestock industry generally as the ingredients mentioned are of a high energy type and if he will grant this request which would <Col N="1617" /> cheapen compound feedstuffs which would help to alleviate some of the problem of livestock farmers because of bad weather conditions and a scarcity of feed generally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should first of all explain the position about grain in intervention.  Under EC regulations the selling price of grain from intervention on to the home market in June 1986 must be not less than £153.88 per tonne and I have no authority to make it available at a lower price.</P>
      <P>It would be inappropriate for me to disclose information about prices paid in 1985 by successful bidders for barley exintervention intended for export to countries outside the Community.  Following the exceptionally bad weather which prevailed during the summer and autumn of 1985, Ireland was authorised by the Council of Ministers as an exceptional measure to sell 125,000 tonnes of intervention wheat and barley at 75 per cent of the intervention price.  The sales were made under the feed voucher scheme between February and May this year at prices ranging from £109.62 to £115.41 per tonne.</P>
      <P>The current difficulties in the pig meat sector cannot be attributed entirely to the cost of cereal feedingstuffs.  On the one hand there is weak market demand at home and abroad exacerbated by an oversupply of pigs and on the other the need to rationalise and modernise slaughterhouses and processing plants as well as to adopt more aggression in the market place.  It is clearly in the interest of both the compounding industry and the pig meat industry to ensure that feedingstuffs for pigs are available at the most competitive prices to the user.</P>

      <P>I should state at the outset that I understand this person is now no longer in prison and that his imprisonment, in fact, related to a picketing offence in breach of a court injunction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned was convicted, in October 1983 and February 1984 for repeated refusals to allow his herd to be tested as required by the Department under the disease regulations and, in July 1984 it was considered necessary to urgently depopulate his herd in the interests of disease eradication.  The depopulation operation, which had to be carried out by the Department's officers, aided by the Garda, revealed general neglect of the animals concerned and conditions on the farm that constituted a threat to <Col N="1619" /> human as well as to animal health. Eighty-nine animals were removed to a meat factory for slaughter and the proceeds were paid into a bank account for the herdowner.  It would appear that any discrepancy between the number of animals slaughtered and those paid for may arise from the fact that the factory concerned did not put any value on some of the animals because of their poor condition.</P>

    <P>To date £136,610 has been allocated to County Kildare by the Youth Employment Agency under the community enterprise programme.</P>
    <P>Apart from the community enterprise programme most of the funding provided by the Youth Employment Agency is allocated to national programmes administered by other bodies.  Among these programmes are:</P>
    <P>&mdash;ACOT's certificate in farming on which there were 71 participants from County Kildare at the end of 1985;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the youth self-employment programme under which 18 young people from County Kildare had received guaranteed loans by the end of 1985;</P>
    <P>&mdash;specialist employment subsidy schemes in marketing, overseas marketing and science and technology under which seven young people were working with firms in County Kildare in 1985.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that at least £130,000 was provided in funding to County Kildare since the establishment of the Youth Employment Agency on these programmes, in addition to the funds allocated under the community enterprise programme.</P>

      <P>The employee concerned was paid a statutory redundancy lump sum of £643.70 by my Department from the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund on 9 October 1985.  This was the equivalent of five week's gross pay calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 1984, and based on the information supplied by the reciever of the company in which the person was employed concerning his age, service and normal weekly pay.  My Department is not aware of any balance of redundancy lump sum due in this case.</P>
      <P>So far as other payments to the employee are concerned, an application under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984 has been received from the receiver of the company for funds to pay minimum notice awards and holiday pay entitlements to former employees including the person named by the Deputy.  My Department has been in correspondence with the receiver for clarification of the application which is expected to be received within the next few days.  This should enable my Department to make an early payment to the receiver for disbursement to the former employees of the company in respect of their minimum notice awards and outstanding holiday pay.</P>

This increase took effect from 1 May 1986.  I am not contemplating making any further changes at the moment.  However, I will keep all aspects of the scheme, including the wages payable, under review.</P>
      <P>I might add that SES wages are in respect of a 40 hour fortnight.  They are higher than social welfare payments for many persons on the live register.  The scheme has already achieved its target of 10,000 participants for 1986.</P>

As, however, the tribunal, in its decision of 14 January 1986 had not broken down the amounts of the awards in respect of the two employees as between the Redundancy Payments Acts, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act and the Unfair Dismissals Act, which is necessary before any payment can be made from the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund, the two applications received were being referred to the tribunal for clarification of the details of the awards. These references have since been made and I understand that the tribunal will shortly be in touch with the parties to arrange a hearing of the cases.</P>
