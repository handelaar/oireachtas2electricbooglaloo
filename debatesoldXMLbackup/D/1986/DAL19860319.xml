      <P>I am anxious to raise the matter of some questions which I addressed to the Taoiseach today which have been ruled out of order.  I wish to ask if there is any way in which you can help me in my difficulty.  I think you will agree that it is the duty of an Opposition to question the Government, particularly the Taoiseach, on matters of current political importance.  In recent times the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has made a number of very significant statements and I had sought to raise these matters in the House by way of question to the Taoiseach.  Two of my questions have been transferred to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and will not come up for answer for four or five weeks.  I object to that transfer but I realise that, as you have stated on a number of occassions, you are not responsible for transfer and I accept that.  I just protest to the Government against what I see as a mechanism for postponing the discussion on important matters in the House.</P>
      <P>I want specifically to ask about the question I addressed to the Taoiseach which you ruled out of order on the basis that it contained argument.  I do not think it does contain argument.  Certainly it does not contain argument by me because it simply asks if the Taoiseach accepts something.  Whatever argument there may be in the question &mdash; and I do not think there is any &mdash; it is not argument by me.  Therefore, I cannot see how my question could have been ruled out.  If, Sir, you ruled out my question on the basis of argument, I would direct your attention to Question No. 10.</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey submitted three question in all. Two of those questions were allowed as in order and they were transferred in the usual, customary way when transfers take place.  My office was notified that they had been transfered to other Ministers and I so informed Deputy Haughey's office immediately that information came through.  Regarding the question which was ruled out of order, I am satisfied, having considered the matter very carefully and not after Deputy Haughey got in touch with me but before I ruled it out of order, that the question was clearly out of order under Standing Order 33.  I do not profess to be infallible but somebody must decide these things and that responsibility lies on me for the time being.  I so ruled and I am satisfied beyond doubt that my ruling is correct.  Deputy Haughey asks how he may raise a matter like this.  Naturally I will not discuss that in the House but I know that I and my officials will be helpful, as we always are, in advising Deputy Haughey or any other Deputy if there is a way out of the difficulty which they have.</P>

      <P>I hope you will appreciate that there is a difficulty.  I would ask you to understand that there is a responsibility on the Government but there is also a responsibility on this side of the House. Our electors expect us on this side to raise matters of current political significance and importance.  That is our duty.  I do not think parliamentary democracy can function unless the Opposition have ready opportunity to raise matters of significance and urgent importance.  My question was, &ldquo;To ask the Taoiseach if he accepts that it is now official Government policy that there will never be a united Ireland since the Anglo-Irish Agreement is, in the view of the British Government, <Col N="2034" /> a bulwark against a United Ireland&rdquo;.  I simply asked if the Taoiseach accepts that, and I cannot understand how you attribute an argumentative content&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are now getting into argument about my ruling, and if we were to have an argument about every ruling I make in the House the time of the House would be almost entirely taken up with arguments about me and my rulings.  That would not be acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but I am at a loss, and I appeal to you again to look at my question and then look at, for instance, Question No. 10, which I have picked at random.  It is a question by Deputy Skelly, and is:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for the Environment if he will make a special amenity area order for the Liffey Valley due to its outstanding natural beauty, its special recreation value and the encroachment of the dump.</P>
      <P>Deputy Skelly is quite rightly arguing that a special amenity order should be made because of certain matters.</P>

      <P>I accept that and I express my appreciation of your listening to my argument, which I do not intend to pursue further, except to draw your attention to the fact that your ruling, may be justified by precedent, maybe not, places this side of the House under very serious inhibitions in pursuing our proper and appropriate parliamentary duties.  If the question had been allowed during supplementary questions I might have entered into arguments with the Taoiseach, and I do not think that would be entirely detrimental as far as the House is concerned.  This question is gone now, but for future reference I wish to submit that the question in its terms certainly is not argumentative or intended to be so.</P>

      <P>I do not rule on something that might happen by way of supplementaries.  I ruled on the question as it appeared before me.  If Deputy Haughey or any other Deputies in the House find themselves in difficulty, such as Deputy Haughey is now &mdash; and as Deputy Haughey has said, it has been trotted out in the newspapers in the last 20 years that things cannot be raised on the day when they are hot &mdash; something should be done about Standing Orders, which should be changed.</P>

I respect the ruling and appreciate that Standing Orders preclude the Chair from allowing <Col N="2038" /> these amendments.  However, it is about time we changed Standing Orders.  If one every wishes to question things relating to social welfare or the Finance Bill, if an amendment even suggests increased charges on the Exchequer it is ruled out of order.  In relation to amendments Nos. 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 20 and 22 had the actual percentage increase been presented honestly, giving the true percentage increases from April rather than&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that every single amendment tabled in my name and in the name of Deputy Mac Giolla has been ruled out of order on the basis that they would involved a charge on the Exchequer.  It is difficult to comprehend this practice of the House.  This section relates to the dates on which payments will be made in relation to unemployment benefit, the deserted wife's allowance and so on, and it relates to the elimination of lower rates of payment to women.  The date fixed in May for the implementation of that reform is wrong.  Since 1983 the dates for the payment of increases given in the budget have been delayed later each year so that now increases are applied in the third week of July.  This date has moved from April to the third week in July.  Last year it was the second <Col N="2039" /> week in July and the year before it was the first week in July.</P>
      <P>This section eliminates the lower rates paid to women, starting from May.  Apart from cost, there is no reason why that could not have been done in April.  Will the Minister explain where is the money which was set aside in last year's budget which would give equal treatment to women in social welfare payments?  This equal treatment was to have been introduced last year.  A part of it is now being introduced in this Bill from May.  The Government seem to be trying to pull the wool over our eyes in this matter.  The Minister will say that it would cost more to introduce this equal treatment in April rather than in May, but can he say where is the money which was set aside last year under the equality legislation for women? For what has that money been used? Even though our amendments have been ruled out of order I would urge the Minister to accept our amendments Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that a large number of amendments which I tabled to many sections of the Bill have been ruled out of order because they involve a charge on the Exchequer.  Had the actual increases of 4 per cent for social welfare payments and 5 per cent for long term unemployment payments been granted from 1 April the Government could honestly say that they had done as the Minister for Finance in his budget speech said, that they kept payments in line with inflation.  Since there is a precedent set by this Government to delay increases of payments each year until July, the percentage increases are only operative for nine months of the year, so that the 4 per cent increase, which is apparent rather than real, is effectively little more than 3.7 per cent and the 5 per cent is little more than 3.4 per cent. It is estimated that inflation for the year will be something in the region of 4.5 per cent so it is obvious that social welfare recipients are being led astray by being given the impression that they are getting increases which compare favourably with <Col N="2040" /> the inflation rate.  I would appreciate the Minister's observations on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the point made by Deputy De Rossa about the whereabouts of the money provided last year for the implementation of equal treatment, as the Deputy is aware, only a few months ago I had to bring in a Supplementary Estimate to make provision for an additional £50 million to meet the total outgoings of the Department last year because the numbers of those claiming unemployment benefit and assistance were up and also to provide for the Christmas bonus.  All that money was used to pay benefits in 1985.</P>
      <P>Section 2 provides, first, for the implementation of the first phase of the equal treatment provisions with effect from mid May.  Secondly, it provides for the abolition of reduced rates of benefit for persons under 18 years of age.  Thirdly, it provides for the increases of 4 per cent in the weekly personal and adult dependent rates for social insurance benefits and occupational injury benefits from the third week in July.  About 390,000 claimants and their 110,000 adult dependants will benefit from the increases at a cost of over £20 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) is designed to implement the first phase of the equal treatment provisions for men and women in matters of social security with effect from mid May 1986.  It was not possible hitherto to introduce the equal treatment provisions because one of the staff unions concerned refused to implement the provisions pending agreement on certain staffing issues, as the Minister said during the Second Stage debate.  However agreement has now been reached with the staff union in question to implement on a phased basis from mid May next those measures which do not require additional staffing.  These are the abolition of reduced rates of benefit for married women which is provided for in subsection (1) and Schedule A of the Bill and the extension of the duration of unemployment benefit from 312 to 390 <Col N="2041" /> days for such women.  This will be effected by regulations which will be made separately.  It is expected that about 46,000 married women in total will benefit from these increases at a cost in 1986 of £10.5 million.  Some 2,300 women will benefit from the extended duration of unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>Hitherto reduced rates of benefit applied to married women and persons under the age of 18 years without dependants. The Bill provides for the abolition of the reduced rates for this category from mid May 1986.  In view of the fact that persons become insurable at age 16 and are liable for the same rates of PRSI as other contributors, it is considered that they should also be entitled to the same levels of benefit while sick and unemployed. Some 1,000 such persons will benefit from this increase.  The abolition of this rate involves an amendment to the schedule of rates.  There is a consequential amendment provided in section 21 for occupational injury benefit purposes. In future, persons under 18 years of age will receive the same rate of benefit as all other persons.</P>
    <P>The level of increases has been mentioned by Deputy McCarthy.  Subsection (2) provides for increases in the weekly personal and adult dependent rates of social insurance and occupational injury benefits.  The new rates of payment are set out in Schedule B.  These levels of increases are designed to ensure that the Government's commitment to protect the living standards of those dependent on social welfare will again be honoured this year.  If one looks back at the past three budgets of this Government, one will see that the level of increases given has exceeded the following year's increase in the cost of living and this gives real increases to recipients.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out during the Second Stage debate, since 1983 short term benefits have been increased by 30 per cent, long term payments by 33 per cent and the long term unemployed received the highest increase of all, 40 per cent.  In the period 1983 to 1987 the increase in the cost of living is expected to be of the order of 23 per cent and the <Col N="2042" /> indicators are that it will be reduced to its lowest level for many years by the end of 1986.</P>
    <P>The level of increases provided by the Government have been compared with those given in the years 1981 and 1982. What must be taken into account when making comparisons between different years is the level of inflation during those years.  Rates of increase in excess of 20 per cent are all very well and are necessary when inflation is also at that level, but comparisons between years are valid only when they are put into proper perspective. Since this Government took office they have succeeded in reducing the level of inflation to an expected rate of around 4 per cent for this year.  There are even recent predictions that the yearto-year rate of inflation could be between zero and 1 per cent by the year end.  With this drop in inflation the rate of increase which is necessary to protect the real value of such payments is also reduced.</P>
    <P>When one compares the rates of social welfare payments in 1983 with those which will apply from July next and with the rate of inflation from then until mid 1987, it emerges that there will be real increases of around 5.5 per cent for short term recipients, that is, disability and unemployment beneficiaries, about 80 per cent for the long term recipients, that is, pensioners, and over 13 per cent for the long term unemployed.  This can only be regarded as a significant improvement for people dependent on social welfare and represents a considerable achievement for the Government who are faced with the task of bringing order to the public finances.</P>
    <P>The effective date of the increase has also been mentioned by Deputies opposite. The increases will come into effect from the third week in July 1986.  This has been the practice since 1983.  Naturally the Government would have preferred to bring in these increases from an earlier date but this would have involved an additional cost.  The estimated cost in 1986 of the increases in both social insurance and social assistance will be £35 million.  The extra cost of bringing in these increases from April 1986 would be <Col N="2043" /> an extra £22 million; to have brought the 1985 increases into effect in April of that year would have cost an extra £32 million, and in 1984 it would have cost an extra £34 million.  In 1983 if increases had come into effect from April the additional cost would have been £39 million.  These are very significant figures.</P>
    <P>In deciding on the increases for social welfare in the budget the Government had to be mindful of the overall situation in the public finances for 1986.  At the end of the day the Government decided to apply the available resources in the most equitable and efficient way possible, in the best interest of those concerned. To provide the 1986 increase from April would have meant intolerable cutbacks in other areas of social welfare.  The resources available for increases in social welfare were extremely limited this year. Given this limitation, the choice was either to give a lower increase over a longer period of time or a higher weekly percentage increase from a slightly later date.  The second option was chosen which is clearly more to the advantage of recipients over the 1986-87 year as a whole and, indeed, in subsequent years. If a lower percentage increase was given from an earlier date, involving the same overall expenditure, this would have meant that social welfare recipients would have been less well off at the end of the period and in the years ahead.  This choice of higher rates increases from a later date was also in keeping with the Government's commitment to maintaining payments at least in line with prices. The increases given each year are intended to protect recipients against inflation over the following 12 months.</P>
    <P>Since 1983 the end of June or beginning of July has become the standard time for the implementation of rate increases. The 1985 increases matched inflation fully up to the middle of 1986.  The 1986 increases are expected to do the same up to mid-1987.  The increases in social insurance payments will be of benefit to some 387,000 recipients and 110,000 adult dependants.  Together with the <Col N="2044" /> social assistance payments being provided in section 3 this means that over 891,000 persons will benefit from the increases, that is 699,000 recipients and 192,000 adult dependants.  It should be noted that the increases resulting from the introduction of the child benefit scheme come into effect from April, which is provided for in section 17.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the Minister of State is doing his best to put a good face on what is a paltry increase for the old and least well off sections of our community.  I am glad he told us why these increases were put back to July, conceding that that saved the Government £22 million this year.  It appears that they saved £32 million in 1985, £34 million in 1984 and £39 million in 1983, again on account of delaying the implementation of these increases until July in those years.  It is clear that these enormous savings have been effected at the expenses of the less well off sections of our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite appalling that the Government should adopt this type of fiscal policy.  Some of us may have noted various aspects of the budget introduced in the United Kingdom yesterday.  When one hears of the paltry increases of the order of £1 per week there, one is reminded of how Thatcherism has affected their people.  Here the Government adopt a light type of fiscal policy. Indeed this Government, more than any of their predecessors, seem to be obsessed with following the British line in every way.  It would appear that there is no difference at all between Garretism here and Thatcherism in England in relation to fiscal policies.  One could even throw in Reaganomic's as well because the economic pattern in the United States is in serious trouble also.  Our economic problems are very serious because of the policies adopted and because the Government have avoided dealing with the root causes of much of the charges on our revenue.  The real basic increase the Exchequer has had to bear has been <Col N="2045" /> occasioned by the huge increase in numbers unemployed, which the Government have done nothing to arrest.  If anything they have ensured that the unemployment queues rose almost on a monthly basis.  With the exception of a paltry reduction last month &mdash; when I think there were something like 1,200 fewer unemployed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Like Deputy McCarthy, I too, would be happier if the increases granted this year had been higher.  But, when one takes into account those granted in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom, one realises that we are not doing too badly.  When I hear people on the opposite side of the House talk about how we look after our underprivileged I cannot but recollect that a Coalition Government came into power in the mid-seventies and Fianna Fáil had been in Government for 16 years during which time the old age pension eligibility limit was 70 years and in all that time there was not one day's reduction.  However, in four years the Coalition Government reduced the eligibility age to 66 years.  The Opposition talk as though nobody other than they had any interest in the underprivileged.  Indeed, I can recollect <Col N="2046" /> the days when there was the old half-crown increase&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Of course we must be careful in the unemployment area because often it is contended that one is as well off unemployed as working.  The Minister pointed out what was wrong.  He was not ashamed to say that it was not possible to grant higher increases because of the cost.  It can be contended that the Minister gave the maximum increase possible out of the limited resources available and for that I congratulate him.</P>

      <P>In replying to some points I raised, the Minister referred to the fact that the money set aside last year for the implementation of equality legislation, or part of it, had been utilised to pay for portion of a Supplementary Estimate he introduced late last year.  He made the point that portion of it had been used to pay the Christmas bonus.  For quite a number of years now the practice has been to pay a Christmas bonus. Despite that, that bonus was not included in the budget or the Estimates last year and is not included in the budget or the Estimates this year.  The question further arises, where is the Minister to get the money to pay the bonus this Christmas? Who is going to suffer loss in order that that payment will be made at Christmas? The Minister made the point that the bonus costs £20.4 million or £21 million, something in that area now.  I did a calculation when that debate was going on in this House last year in relation to the Supplementary Estimate, and it was clear that the real cost of the bonus last year was less than the real cost of it the previous year.  If the 5 per cent increase which had been applied during last year <Col N="2047" /> had been applied to the bonus it would have cost the Government in the region of £0.5 million more than they paid out in the Christmas bonus.  A certain amount of dallamullóg is going on here. The money which was set aside to implement equality legislation in relation to women under the social welfare code has been used simply to get the Minister off the hook in regard to the Christmas bonus.  I ask the Minister again, who is to be robbed this year in order to pay the Christmas bonus?  Where is the money to come from?  Are other allocation which have been make in this budget going to be hived off to pay for the Christmas bonus?</P>
      <P>I seek further information from the Minister.  He indicated that something like 3,000 women would benefit from the extension of the unemployment days they would be entitled to.  He went on to say that people between the ages of 16 and 18 would now get the same benefit, that theirs would no longer be a reduced benefit.  Will the Minister indicate how many young people will benefit as a result of this change?  Will he indicate the cost that that change will involve the Minister in?</P>

      <P>I would have thought that we would know at this stage why money was not included in the budget for the Christmas bonus.  The Minister read his brief on the budget and I noted that not one penny was included in the budget for that Christmas bonus.  Is the Minister prepared at this stage &mdash; rather than waiting for December when representations will be coming from all over the country asking public representatives to ask the Minister to include the Christmas bonus &mdash; to give some undertaking that the Christmas bonus will be introduced again this year?  We come in here year after year with social welfare amendments adding and deleting.  It is about time that the Government set about the formation of a whole new structure on social welfare. Things are becoming so confused now that I do not think the officials in the <Col N="2048" /> Department really understand the whole structure of social welfare.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I ask the Minister if he will speak on social assistance between the ages of 16 and 18?  That category at the moment suffer from widespread unemployment.  Many of those young people are anxious to continue their education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy De Rossa, I understand that about 1,000 young people will benefit.  The cost, again roughly, would be about £50,000.  The Christmas bonus which has been mentioned has never been a part of social welfare legislation or the Social Welfare Bill.  It has never been provided for in any budget.  Since it was first started it is always a decision made by the Government of the day in the weeks preceding Christmas.  We can only assume that this matter will be considered by the Government towards the end of the year and that a decision will be made on it then in accordance with established practice in relation to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said originally in relation to figures and what has been saved by implementing the increases from July, we could argue that the Government have saved £X million by not giving a 10 per cent or 5 per cent increase.  We could argue that they have saved so much by not giving it from 1 January.  That argument is endless. In any respect we are talking about the most effective way of paying out available resources to the recipients.  As <Col N="2049" /> I pointed out when I replied to this question a few minutes ago, it is far more beneficial for the recipients to get a higher increase from a later date than to get a lower increase from an earlier date because a higher increase is a higher rate and further percentage increase are, therefore, greater for having a higher base rate.  A good argument could be made that instead of the Government giving, say 4 per cent from mid-July if they gave 8 per cent from mid-September or October it would give &mdash; speaking very generally &mdash; about the same amount of money this year but the recipients would have a higher base rate and future percentage increase would be much better and yield a higher rate.  Therefore, the date of implementation and the rates are calculated in a way that will ensure that the rates of benefits will keep pace with price increases and inflation increases and these rates by the end of the year will exceed the rate of inflation.  There is really no saving by doing this; it is just the most effective way of doing it rather than by a lower percentage increase from an earlier date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, my intelligence bureau told me just now.  The Minister has been trying to convince us that the savings of £22 million this year, £32 million in 1985, £34 million in 1984 and £39 million in 1983, made at the expense of social welfare recipients by putting back the dates, has not affected their disposable income.  That is quite ridiculous because if such huge amounts of money are saved in any year those who should have benefited from them will be worse off.  Will the Minister tell the House the year the precedent of delaying the payment of the increases was established? Was it 1983?  Before that such increases operated from early April.  The new policy was adopted by the Coalition in order to make huge savings at the expense of the underprivileged.</P>
      <P>The Minister, and the Minister for Finance, have made a lot of play about how the percentage increases more than compensated for increases cost arising out of the increase in the rate of inflation.  This year the increase will amount to 5 per cent in general and 4 per cent for the long term unemployed, while last year the increases amounted to 6½ per cent and 6 per cent.  In 1984 the figures were 7 per cent and 8 per cent while in 1983 they were 10 per cent and 12 per cent.  In 1980, when Fianna Fáil were in power, the figures were 25 per cent for the long term and 20 per cent for all others, while in 1981 they were 25 per cent and 20 per cent.  In 1982 an increase of 25 per cent across the board was granted.  Inflation at that time was running at a high rate due to extraneous factors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>As a small open economy, we suffered in the same way that other countries did at the time of the <Col N="2051" /> world recession.  Nevertheless, the increases granted then more than compensated the underprivileged, the old, the sick and the unemployed.  We are all aware that there were not that many unemployed at that time.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to tell the House the exact number who are unemployed?  Is he in a position to tell us how the unemployment rates relate to the different age groups?  Those figures will enable us to compare the rates being paid now with those paid four or five years ago and one will then see that the number of young people unemployed has trebled.  I have no doubt that some of those people never had a job.  In the infamous document produced in 1984, <i>Building on Reality</i>&mdash; it would be better described as &ldquo;Building on Unreality&rdquo; because all the predictions turned out to be false &mdash; it was predicted that in 1986, 210,000 people would be unemployed but the correct figure is nearer to 240,000. Will the Minister tell us the number of people who are employed on temporary employment schemes and the number who emigrated in 1985?  If one adds up those figures I am sure one will discover that there are more than 300,000 people unemployed.  The work is not there for them because of the economic policies being pursued by the Government.</P>
      <P>The Government should realise that for every 1,000 people they put on the dole queues it will cost the State £2.7 million in 1986.  The figure for last year was £2.6 million.  If the Government are going to cry about the heavy cost on the one hand and on the other hand crow about what they are giving, despite the heavy charges on the Exchequer, they should have a look at their economic policies.  Will the Minister give us some idea of the predicted rate of unemployment for this year?  Is he satisfied that the amount allocated in the budget for unemployment assistance will be sufficient?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I will address the section in a similar vein to the manner in which the Deputy opposite addressed it.  I must <Col N="2052" /> say that the longer I am in this House the more nauseating I find the ritualistic debates that take place on this Stage of a Social Welfare Bill.  The offering of the Deputy opposite was a classic example of this parliamentary ritualism that we are subjected to, that we waste our time on in the House far too often.  The crocodile tears being shed by the Deputy opposite at the increases in social welfare payments in the budget and the comparisons he makes are ludicrous.  The fact that a national Parliament should have to spend time listening to an Opposition Deputy bemoaning the percentage increases in the area of social welfare payments in 1986, a year when inflation might be as low as 1½ or 2 per cent, is ludicrous.</P>
      <P>The percentage social welfare increases are clearly in excess of the projected inflation rate this year but the Deputy is bemoaning the fact that we are not offering a 20 or 25 per cent level of increase such as was offered by Fianna Fáil when in Government in 1979 but when inflation was in excess of 20 per cent.  That type of comment would be seen for the nonsense it is by even the most basically numerate child wet off the potty.  It is profoundly depressing that parliamentary time is taken up with this political ritualism when there are so many other matters we should be dealing with.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one interesting question that the Deputy opposite failed to put to the Minister of State.  Deputy McCarthy did not ask how much in interest payments this State will be making this year on loans entered into during the lifetime of the party who were in office between 1977 and 1981.  The money that is going out of the country to foreign bankers could be <Col N="2053" /> better utilised to create jobs but we have to pay off the debts incurred by an intellectually bankrupt party while in Government.</P>

      <P>I am addressing section 2 just as the Deputy opposite treated us to what I would describe as a general economic review and during which he sought statistics on various selective items of general interest with a view to taking up more of the time of the House and to score more ritual political points that he may regard as valuable.  The way the people opposite take up the time of this House reflects no credit on the way we do our business here.  We had the recitation that a Fianna Fáil Government in the past provided social welfare increases in excess of 20 per cent.  Let us cut through the nonsense of that type of discussion.  Is the Deputy opposite suggesting that social welfare payments this year should be increased by 20 or 25 per cent?  He has made the comparison for some reason and I am anxious to hear what that reason is.  Was it merely to fill up parliamentary time and to have attributed to him an extra few columns in the Official Report, or was there some intellectual policy or intent behind his suggestion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he is proposing that we increase social welfare payments by 20 per cent or more, can he tell us who is to foot the bill?  As one who is familiar with the difficulties experienced by people who are dependent on social welfare payments and as one who would very much like to be able to tell them that the Government might be in a position to grant the levels of increase sought by Deputy McCarthy, I know that that is not possible because we do not have the money to pay such increases.  The taxpayer <Col N="2054" /> must foot the bill for every £1 paid to social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that we increase taxation, that, for instance, the standard rate of income tax be increased from 35 to 40 per cent as would be required to meet the type of increase in social welfare payments which he is proposing, or is he suggesting that we borrow more money?  It is very easy for us to engage in a game of party political shuttlecock where someone throws the shuttlecock into the air, someone else bats if back over the net, while another hits it back from the other side and everyone is trying to bat the ball across the net in a way that leaves the other fellow floundering.  Politically this House is floundering by way of a ritualistic debate on a social welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>Anyone outside the House would regard this procedure not only as profoundly depressing but as totally irrelevant to their problems.  Can we not extricate ourselves from this type of approach to legislation?  This is an important Bill, one that will have an impact on the lives of a large number of people.  It will determine largely what their standard of living this year will be. Why must we engage day after day in this ritualistic nonsense of the Opposition saying something merely because they are in Opposition with a Government spokesman batting back the ball?  What is the point in making a comparison between the social welfare increases in 1980 when inflation was more than 20 per cent and the increases being granted this year?</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should not have disgressed into making a speech of this nature.  It was not my intention to do so.  However, perhaps we should agree that for the rest of the day we will deal with the specifics of the Bill.  It is a simple social welfare measure that proposes increases for social welfare recipients.  This will help these people to maintain their standard of living and perhaps allow for a very slight increase in that respect as a result of the inflation rate continuing to fall.  It has been falling to a greater extent than seemed possible when the budget figures <Col N="2055" /> were announced.  Let us not continue to engage in this nonsense of debating the Bill in ritualistic party political terms.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter talked of wasting the time of the House in discussing this Bill. The Deputy is fortunate in that he represents a nice constituency in which there are probably very few problems relating to social welfare.

      <P>As I represent these people in this House I am entitled to offer a word on their behalf and I am bitterly disappointed that they must wait until May and July for these small increases although the budget was introduced in early February.  If, as Deputy Shatter wishes, the Minister visits parts of Tallaght and Clondalkin, he will realise what the increases under this Social Welfare Bill mean to these people.  I am completely disappointed that the amendments tabled by Deputy McCarthy have not been accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put on record that many of these people who are now in receipt of demands for water rates, having received <Col N="2056" /> threatening letters in that regard, had been hoping that the increases would be sufficient to allow them to pay these demands, but they will not be sufficient. I repeated on many previous occasions that, in parts of my constituency, out of ten houses, seven or eight families have nobody working and in other parts nobody is working in the ten houses. What have these people to look forward to?  We are told by Deputy Shatter that we are wasting time discussing this Bill. We would not need to delay the House if Deputy Shatter made his contribution in the party rooms by ensuring a reasonable and just increase in the budget for social welfare recipients.  I am sorry to have taken up the time of the House but I consider it my duty to express my views on behalf of those whom I represent.  I urge the Minister, even at this late stage, to reconsider the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Government any proposals in mind with a view to introducing a complete new social welfare structure? I hope we can get through all sections of this Bill as quickly as possible to give us an opportunity to review the whole matter.  On every section the Minister will be mentioning the inflation rate.  I have done an exercise during the past three months and, while I applaud the fact that the inflation rate is on the decrease, I know of no food commodity or items such as clothing whose price has been reduced, even in the supermarkets. Who is benefiting from the lower inflation rate?  I hope that will be borne in mind when we are discussing each section of this Bill.  I suggest that the Minister should ask any old age pensioner or any social welfare recipient how much better off he or she is since the fall in inflation. Someone along the line is making money certainly, but not social welfare recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Deputy Wyse that the whole area of social welfare is under review at the moment, as the House in aware.  That review by the Commission on Social Welfare is almost complete and we expect their report very <Col N="2057" /> soon.  Work on consolidating the regulations under the social welfare code is also progressing and is at an advanced stage. The last time this work was done was nearly five years ago.  It is very complicated work, but it is being attended to carefully.</P>
      <P>I also wish to correct a rough calculation which I gave to Deputy De Rossa. We have had a few moments in which to make a more accurate calculation.  The cost of implementing the full rate of unemployment and disability benefit to the under 18 year olds would be around £200,000 in 1986 and for a full year period £340,000.  The amount provided this year for unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance, including smallholders, would be around £650.56 million. This is based on a live register of 237,000 persons.</P>
      <P>In regard to section 2 of this Bill, everybody would agree with having larger percentage increases implemented at an earlier date, but unfortunately it is not quite that simple.  The resources available have to be used in the best possible way to spread them over the various schemes under the social welfare code.  Let me repeat that the unemployed, particularly the long term unemployed, have received and continue to receive additional support. They continue to receive it under the provisions of this section.  For the first time ever, the long term unemployed got a Christmas bonus last Christmas.  This is an indication of the determination and commitment of this Government to do everything possible to help the long term unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The date of implementation has been referred to.  It is true that the date was brought back from April 1983 but it is also true to say that it was a Coalition Government of 1973-77 who introduced the April implementation date.  It is not relevant or useful in a discussion of this kind to go back that far, but I am answering the points which have been made. One will find that the date of implementation of social welfare increases under Fianna Fáil Governments prior to 1973 <Col N="2058" /> was in the autumn.  I commend section 2 of the 1986 Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given a projected unemployment figure for this year of 237,000 persons.  The figure at present is in excess of that amount and I am afraid what happened last year in that connection may happen again this year. The Government computed the costings of unemployment payments last year at a certain figure with which we disagreed at the time in the budget debate and the debate on the Social Welfare Bill.  Prior to the Christmas recess, the Government had to implement hurriedly a Supplementary Estimate for £50 million, £40 million of which represented unemployment payments which had to be made because the Government did not accurately assess the number of people who would be unemployed.  Whether that was done deliberately I do not know.  I hope they have their figures right this time.  I note that the Minister for Finance made an extra allocation in the budget for extra moneys for unemployment benefit compared with the provisional Estimates for 1986 but I sincerely hope that the numbers unemployed will not be in excess of the projected figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also suggested that the inflation rate is falling and he gave the impression that it was because of Government policies.  Let us be quite clear about this: the fall in inflation does not owe anything to Government policies. Indeed, their policies have ensured that inflation has been kept at a higher level than it should be.  Take, for example, the enormous addition to the consumer price index which resulted from the Government gobbling up the benefits of the reduction in oil prices, particularly in relation to petrol and diesel which are used by most people and by industries and companies who have to transport goods from one part of the country to another.  The reduction in the cost of oil has been quite extraordinary because the cost per barrel is now at the same level as it was before the crisis in the midseventies. The policy of taking more and more in taxation has meant that inflation <Col N="2059" /> has stayed at a much higher rate than it would have been otherwise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter made some asinine comments without saying anything of importance.  He attempted to criticise the Members of this side of the House, particularly me, but there was nothing worthwhile in his speech.  He attempted to suggest that I had said that social welfare increases should be of the order of 20 per cent.  I made no such suggestion, I said that social welfare increases should be paid from April and kept in line with inflation to compensate the recipients for the extra cost of many items.  Deputy Shatter also wandered into the realm of finance which we are not discussing in the Bill.  He showed appalling ignorance in asking how high our national debt and borrowings were in the years 1978, 1979 and 1980.  He obviously did not know that our national debt this year is £20.5 billion as against £12.8 billion in December 1982.  Effectively, the increase has been in the order of 66 per cent and if Deputy Shatter knew what he was talking about he would not have mentioned the subject. The Government are borrowing more and more with less and less to show for it.  At least when Fianna Fáil borrowed it was obvious where the money was spent. There were vast improvements in various infrastructural developments and in relation to schools, hospitals, advance factories and so on.  I am sorry that Deputy Shatter strayed from the Bill and I should like to correct him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect your ruling but I would not have strayed from the Bill were it not for the fact that Deputy Shatter went off on a tangent and attempted to mislead the House.  I wanted to set the record straight.  With regard to the provision in section 2 for the operation of the equal treatment legislation of the reduced rates of benefit payable to married women from midMay, the Minister said that 46,000 married women will benefit at a cost of £10.3 <Col N="2060" /> million.  If I misquoted the figure it was not intentional.  He also said that the cost of providing the increases for those under 18 years of age would cost £200,000 this year and £320,000 in a full year.  We welcome this development and I know that the Minister on Second Stage explained that there was a problem in relation to the implementation of the European Equality Directive in that regard.  However, that is a rather facile explanation for holding up the scheme in its entirety.</P>
      <P>This is the first attempt by the Government to implement the legislation passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas prior to the summer recess.  We had been given assurances that it would be fully implemented before the end of 1985.  Many women have been very upset that it has been delayed for so long.  Could the Minister say how many under the age of 18 will benefit from the increased rates? Perhaps he would tell us more precisely when it is intended to implement the rest of the equality directive, now that the inter-union problem has been resolved. Will it be implemented during the first half of this year, by the end of the year, during 1987 or will the Government shy away from its implementation?  When that legislation was going through the House I tried very hard to dissuade the Minister from implementing the directive without making allowances for the loss of dependency payments which will result and cause enormous hardship to many families.  There could be a loss of £40 or £50 per week in social welfare payments to many families.  Is this the real reason the directive has not been implemented and the Government are dragging their heels on it?  If that is so, it is a pity.  The Minister did not accede to my request to ensure that when implementing the directive no loss of money would result to any social welfare recipients.  Perhaps the Minister might provide us with some information on those points.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are quite confident that the projected live register of 237,000 is not an underestimate, bearing in mind the fact that the live register is falling and should continue to do so.  The figure for January was approximately 240,000 and the approximate figure for February was 238,600. Deputy McCarthy mentioned the implementation of the remaining aspects of equality and the long delay.  He referred to the Government shying away from the implementation of equality.  I would respectfully submit that nobody shied away from it more than his present Leader when Minister for Social Welfare, with the result that practically nothing was done about the implementation of this equality directive which Deputy Haughey signed in the EC in 1978.  Nothing was done about it, apart from the setting up of a working committee, until this Government came into office.  We have tackled this problem.  The Government are certainly not happy with progress. We have pointed out that there have been difficulties.  At least our record in this regard is infinitely better than the record of Deputy Haughey when he was Minister and subsequently leader of a Government which sat on this issue and did nothing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining aspects of equality are that married women will be admitted to the unemployment assistance scheme which at present is not open to them and the same conditions will apply to both men and women in the matter of increases for adult and child dependants. At present a married woman is almost always regarded as her husband's dependant and accordingly he qualifies for an increase in benefit in respect of her, regardless of her employment status.  A married woman, on the other hand, can only qualify for an increase for her husband if he is invalided.  The definition of dependency in the Act for both men and women is based on the principle that one <Col N="2062" /> spouse will be regarded as dependent on the other spouse only if he or she is being wholly or mainly maintained by that spouse.  This is a fairer definition but it will mean that certain persons who at present would be regarded as dependants will no longer be so regarded.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the dependency aspects of equal treatment entails a considerable amount of additional work in the Department.  Initially some 200,000 questionnaires will have to be issued and processed in order to clarify the dependency position of existing claimants and alter existing rates of payment where necessary.  The ongoing process of deciding on claims will also be generally made more complicated by the equal treatment measures.  There will be a permanent addition of extra work in processing claims, notably in the disability benefit unemployment payments branches.  A new range of cross-checks and control procedures will have to be developed to cater for the requirements of the new situation.  The admission of married women to unemployment assistance on the same basis as claimants generally will also involve additional work for the unemployment payments branch.  It is also linked with the change in the dependency rules because of the way in which entitlements will be calculated in the new situation.  These two aspects of equal treatment must therefore be introduced at the same time.  Agreement on the staffing issue has not yet been reached with the union.  In addition, the issues of staff training and accommodation arise.  It is not possible to say when these issues will be resolved.</P>
    <P>A small number of households &mdash; 20,000 out of 170,000 &mdash; will suffer a drop in income as a result of the new concept of adult dependant.  In recognition of the drop in household income to some families, the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act made provision for alleviating measures to be drawn up by the Minister in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  The measures were announced in the course of the debate on the equal treatment legislation and will be implemented by regulation in conjunction with the second phase.  They <Col N="2063" /> involve an earnings test in addition to employment to determine dependency. If the spouse is earning £50 per week or less he or she would continue to be regarded as an adult dependant.</P>
    <P>A special transitional payment of £10 a week will be made to families on the commencement of the Act if both spouses are independently entitled to social welfare payments.  Otherwise they would stand to lose approximately £20 per week.  EC Directive 79/7/EEC provides for the elimination of discrimination between men and women in regard to social security matters by December 1984.  The Bill before the House provides for the implementation of the first phase from May next.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the general question of equality was the subject of a High Court case and that the matter has been referred to the European Court of Justice.  Retrospection will have to be considered in the light of the European Court's decision.  It should be noted that, as well as providing increases for certain persons, namely married women, the equality provision involves a reduction of entitlements: a married man claiming benefit will no longer be entitled to an increase in his benefit in respect of his wife if she is working or drawing benefit. Consequently, when discussing the issue of retrospective payments to people who would be entitled to higher payments, we must take into account the fact that some other people have been overpaid, and the question arises as to whether we should set up overpayments in these cases and look for repayments of amounts overpaid. However, retrospection in some cases and not in others would be difficult to justify.  I am trying to illustrate that the issue of retrospection is not a simple one.  These things will be considered in the light of the decision of the European Court of Justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>For the first time to my knowledge the increase, which this year is 4 per cent, is not applicable to child dependants.  This is appalling and it must be regarded as our anti-family measure, <Col N="2064" /> something which will impose great hardship on families who have been deliberately and calculatedly excluded from the increase applying to children. This clearly epitomises the type of policies the Government have continued to pursue since coming to office.  I should like to know how much money will be saved this year and in a full year by the deprivation of families of this 4 per cent increase.  Will this policy be continued by the Government in the future?</P>
      <P>This is a matter of growing concern to many families.  One can look at a married couple with two children.  The increase they will get of £2.60 per week is miserly. A married man with two children gets only £87.60 in unemployment benefit which is quite appalling.  The fact that the 4 per cent increase has not been given in respect of children makes the increases more miserly than they were, bad and all as they were.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us how much is being saved and what is the rationale behind this decision to exclude child dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>There has not been any increase in the child dependant rates of social welfare weekly payments.  The reason is that the Government are introducing the new child benefit scheme under which an additional £3 per month per child will be paid to all families, representing a 25 per cent increase in the rates of allowances paid for each of the first five children in all families and an increase of 16 per cent for the sixth and subsequent children.  About 1.2 million children in 475,000 families will benefit under this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The child benefit scheme involves the abolition of the child tax allowance from 1 April next.  When fully implemented the scheme will involve the taxation of the benefit.  The fact that the benefit will be taxed will bring about a redistribution of resources from families in higher tax brackets to those at the lower end of the scale.  It is generally agreed that the child benefit scheme will represent a major improvement in and development of the <Col N="2065" /> social welfare system because it will provide a vehicle for channelling child support payments more effectively to families in the greatest need.  Child tax allowances obviously provide the greatest level of benefit to higher paid families and the least benefit to lower paid working families.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, direct payments to families are the best form of child support to all families in need, including those on social welfare payments and those who are working, including those on low earnings. It is an essential feature of the full child benefit scheme, however, that the benefit will be taxable.  There are major administrative difficulties associated with the introduction of a fully taxable child benefit scheme and such a scheme cannot be introduced this year.  The Government have decided to introduce the scheme, albeit in limited form, by abolishing child tax allowances, freezing the child dependant increases in social welfare payments and making available a significant increase in children's allowance rates. The Government have put aside for the child benefit scheme this year the resources made available by the abolition of the child tax allowances, £18 million.  The resources which would have been available for increasing social welfare child dependant rates, £4.2 million, and an additional £11.1 million from the Exchequer, are the total resources available this year for the child benefit scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>We can infer that it is the intention of the Government during the remainder of their term of office to continue not to grant the percentage increases for child dependants in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The new child benefit scheme, as I have said, is revolutionary. It will make more effective use of the moneys available.  It will discriminate in favour of low income families and those dependent on social welfare.  When it becomes fully implemented it will prove to be a more socially acceptable form of children's allowances.  The scheme in <Col N="2066" /> existence was never regarded as being quite fair in social justice, and this is a major step forward in bringing equity to child benefit schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the amendments are out of order, but it is not out of order to refer to the content of the amendments concerned.  The categories in section 3 include unemployment assistance, deserted wife's allowance, prisoner's wife's allowance, social assistance, single woman's allowances, old age pension, blind pension, widow's non-contributory pension and the supplementary welfare allowance.  In many ways these categories are the most needy in our society.  I was astounded to hear the Minister arguing on section 2, as he will probably argue on this section, that it is more beneficial for a person in receipt of social welfare payments to have the increases delayed, and that it would be even better for these people if the payments were delayed until September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is this the thinking of the Government and will they push back the payment of <Col N="2067" /> increases even further if they get the opportunity?  The logic behind this argument escapes me.  It could be argued that it would be beneficial if payment were deferred to the end of the year and then given in a single lump sum but that ignores the fact that people on social welfare live from day to day and that they cannot wait until July or September for an increase which will simply attempt to compensate them for increases in inflation and the cost of living.  Social Welfare recipients have to pay immediately increases in the cost of supermarket goods, incidentally goods on which the Government recently increased VAT. The Minister's argument is total nonsense.</P>
    <P>Earlier Deputy Shatter castigated us for being involved in a ritualistic debate. I agree it is an annual ritual, but that does not devalue the necessity for a debate. It was unfair of Deputy Shatter to castigate us and then leave the rest of us to continue the debate in the interests of those in receipt of social welfare.  Section 3 refers to supplementary welfare allowances.  Late last year the Minister introduced a Supplementary Estimate and I was angered to hear the Minister announce that they had made a saving of about £3.4 million in supplementary welfare allowances.  I was angry because at that time the Society of St. Vincent de Paul announced that they were broke and that they had paid out in that year more money than they had been able to take in.</P>
    <P>We must consider that the supplementary welfare allowance is the allowance of last resort.  When unemployment was at its height and in winter when expenses are at their greatest the Minister could announce a saving of £3.4 million in supplementary welfare allowances.  That indicates a lack of understanding as to how people have to beg or borrow in order to make ends meet.  The argument about bringing forward the dates for payment may be ritualistic from the point of view of Deputy Shatter, but it is very much á case of survival for hundreds of <Col N="2068" /> thousands of people who have to exist on these allowances from day to day.  The question of whether they get an extra £2 this week can mean the difference in having or not having meat on the table for an extra day a week.  That is important when considering this Bill.</P>
    <P>Unemployment assistance is also covered in this section.  I raise this matter every year particularly in relation to the single unemployed living at home.  My amendment to section 4 was ruled out of order and I do not propose to go into that now except to make the point that this assistance is for those who have run out of contributions or who have never had contributions.  It is a very low level of payment.  The date on which an increase in this assistance is paid is very important to those in receipt of it.  The benefit as a result of getting these increases later in the year is just theoretical.  They should be paid from April and not from July.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will give some consideration to one aspect of unemployment assistance.  In view of the appalling unemployment rate many young people take up part time education. By doing so they automatically disqualify themselves from unemployment assistance.  I mentioned this last year to the former Minister for Social Welfare who promised he would have the matter examined.  It is vitally important that young people should try to improve their standard of education, especially those who are unemployed for a long period and have little or no chance of getting employment.  If they take up a part time education course in the hope of improving their standard of education, they will improve their chances of gaining employment. The Minister said a person could become involved in community work, and once the organisation concerned confirmed this, he would be paid unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is wrong with a young person who has little chance of employment returning to a vocational school to enrol in a part time educational course?  I realise that there is a statutory provision involved here, but it should be possible <Col N="2069" /> for a young person to tell a social welfare officer he will be involved in a part time educational course while still being available for employment.  I ask the Minister to give this matter very serious consideration.  Many of our young people are walking our streets aimlessly but, if they are ambitious enough to do an educational course, they are deprived of social assistance.</P>
    <P>Many parents have told me of their young boys or girls sitting around the house who had been doing an educational course in the vocational schools but had to withdraw because their social welfare payments were withdrawn.  This is a very human problem.  As long as young persons continue in education &mdash; and they should be encouraged to do this &mdash; their prospects of gaining some kind of employment are improved.  I ask the Minister to give this aspect of unemployment assistance very careful consideration and to give young people a chance to improve their standard of education while still in receipt of unemployment assistance.  In my view they are legally entitled to these payments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that my amendments were ruled out of order, although I am disappointed.  The same problems arise here as in section 2, that is, the delay in the implementation of increases and the date from which they will become operative.  The time is rapidly approaching when this Government will tell us that, if the annual increases are given around Christmas or even the last day in December, they will have achieved their objective because these increases are being paid later each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are very many people in receipt of unemployment assistance &mdash; I think about 65 per cent of the total on the live register.  Most of these people are long term unemployed, and are no longer in benefit, and their chances of further employment are receding.  The outlook for these people is very gloomy.  Yet this Government are granting them paltry increases.  A married couple with two children will get an increase of £2.20, <Col N="2070" /> giving those living in a town a total of £76.10 and £74.40 for those living in the country.  It is ridiculous to expect any such family to exist on £74.40 a week. We have heard a lot lately about poverty and its causes, but when the State decides that a paltry £74.40 per week is sufficient for a married couple with two children, then they have set the ground rules for the causes of poverty.</P>
    <P>Among those on unemployment assistance there is a growing number under 20 years of age and 25 years of age.  This erodes the confidence young people have in the system and that is why many of them are critical of politicians.  This Government have had an appalling record in the area of creating employment and the consequence is that growing numbers of young people are unemployed and are paid paltry sums by way of social welfare benefit.</P>
    <P>The assessment of eligibility, particularly for young people, can be extremely difficult.  First there is an inordinate delay in processing their applications and they are put on what might be called a red tape merry-go-round.  They keep on signing and various forms are sent here, there and everywhere.  In the interim they try to draw supplementary welfare allowance but, if they reside with their families, they are deemed ineligible.  The Minister should ensure that the method of assessing and processing eligibility for unemployment assistance is improved and speeded up.  While there has be be a reasonably precise method of determining eligibility, unnecessary interrogation should be eliminated.</P>
    <P>There is also the growing problem of young people who live with their parents. Most of such young people who are not employed, who do not have a job at home, are excluded from receiving unemployment assistance or are receiving paltry, insulting sums.  It is contended that board and lodgings are provided for them which is a form of means.  There is nothing more insulting to the human dignity of young people to have no money with which to buy anything and who, because their parents appear on paper to have a moderate income, are precluded <Col N="2071" /> from receiving any payment.  It is very sad to have large numbers of young people without a penny to buy anything for themselves.  This means they can go nowhere.  Many parents, who may appear to have a moderate income, do not give pocket money to 19 year olds, probably because they are finding it sufficiently difficult to meet their cost of living expenses.  In the future the Minister might give more discretion to officers in employment exchanges to grant some form of payment to such young people.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy De Rossa that the saving effected on supplementary welfare allowances last year was an indictment of the system.  It should be remembered that generally one is at the end of the road before one applies for supplementary welfare allowance.  In an economic climate such as ours the fact that the State was able to effect substantial savings on supplementary welfare allowances is a reflection on the system.  There is no doubt that there were sufficient applicants. I am not casting any aspersions on the community welfare officers, they carry out their work conscientiously, but the guidelines laid down for the granting of supplementary welfare allowances are too stringent, ensuring that many people are excluded.  Certainly such guidelines ensure that many applicants do not receive sufficient payment.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a song and dance about the bonus given last Christmas to the long term unemployed.  We all welcome that; it was the least that could have been granted.  Indeed, last year I tried very hard to get the Minister to grant a double payment to the long term unemployed but he appeared to think I had gone mad.  Certainly he disagreed totally with me.  He did not appear to feel they were entitled to it.  I am glad that a year later he saw fit to do something.  I would remind the Minister of State that the bonus granted last Christmas constituted 75 per cent overall, meaning that there was a 25 per cent cutback because of the miserliness of this Government.  This Government appear to be incapable of dealing with people in a fair and honest <Col N="2072" /> manner.  In granting that 75 per cent bonus they cut back on what had been the accepted standard double payment to old age pensioners, the chronically ill and disabled.  Such people had budgeted on receiving a double payment.  Yet it transpired that an old age pensioner living alone was short £10 or £12 at Christmas or a married couple, both in receipt of the old age pension, suffered a loss of between £20 and £25.  I have no doubt that that policy of granting a bonus to the long term unemployed was effected at the expense of the old, the chronically ill and disabled, something which should be decried.</P>
    <P>I should like to know also why there has been such a reduction in the number of applicants for the prescribed relative allowance.  There appears to be new, more rigid rules being applied.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make one or two points on the section.  First, I would criticise the low level of increases being granted to the weakest section of our community.  Indeed, the increases are shabby and are an insult to the beneficiaries in these categories.</P>
      <P>It would be desirable to have some uniformity in the operative dates of payment of increases, especially under the provisions of this section.  I note that there are four different dates of payment &mdash; 9th, 17th, 18th and 14th.  I might refer also to the differential between persons under and over 80 years of age, for example, an increase of 15 pence per week being granted to those over 80, which is very shabby treatment.  I should have thought that the Minister would have availed of the opportunity to give substantially increased payments especially to those over 80.  Anybody in touch with the social services in his constituency will be aware of the hardship being experienced by many old people in these categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other aspects of the provisions of this section which need to be examined.  It is no longer desirable to have a differential obtain between people <Col N="2073" /> in receipt of unemployment assistance in urban and rural areas.  I contend there should be a uniform rate of unemployment assistance for people whether they are living in urban or rural areas.  I am not sure what type of expenditure would be involved in this.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate the additional expenditure required to bring rural payments to the same level as those in the urban areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be further aware that there is in some urban areas also, because of the development of urban areas, an overlapping into what were formerly rural districts.  Because of this people in what were formerly rural areas are now being paid at a lower rate than people living in adjoining housing estates.  This discriminates against people and causes disagreements and annoyance especially between neighbours, because rural areas have been superseded by urban areas and this overlap takes place and there is a differential between the amounts being paid in the urban area and the rural area even though all the people concerned are living in the same estate.  Can the Minister indicate what the additional cost will be?</P>

Does he realise that the definition of a community hall is that no profit is made, it is used for recreational and social purposes etc?  Will the Minister clarify, either by legislation or by whatever methods are available to him, that where a bar extension is in a community hall that should be regarded as a separate building for purposes of commercial rating instead of putting the commercial rate on the whole community hall, as some justices do, whereas others put it only on the position of the bar facility?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the changes needed on roads to cater for the change from 32 tons to 38 tonnes in the gross vehicle weight permitted in haulage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1983, regulations were made increasing the maximum gross vehicle weight of heavy goods vehicles from 32 imperial tons to 38 metric tonnes. The regulations provided for more detailed controls on axle spacings and axle weights.  The aim of these controls is to secure the distribution of heavy loads in such a way as to minimise damage to road pavements and bridges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2085" /> I am advised that because an extra axle gives better load distribution a 38 tonne truck causes roughly the same damage as a 32 ton truck.  However, the 38 tonne truck permitted by the 1983 regulations allows a given weight of road freight haulage to be carried on a smaller number of vehicles.  In this way the overall level of road damage by road haulage operations should be reduced.</P>
    <P>The 38 tonne limit is more in line with limits in other EC countries and enables Irish hauliers to compete more effectively in the home and international markets.</P>

      <P>This dreary grey book, <i>Building on Reality,</i> contains the specific projection that in 1986 £140 million would be invested in the roads programme.  The actual estimate is for a figure of £130 million.  In view of the crisis in the building industry and of the decrease in cement sales, is this not one area in which the Government should have concentrated funds this year? Instead, they have reduced their predicted figure by £10 million, though there was scope for an increase.  Having regard to the additional loads on the roads, would the Minister not agree that this was the wrong year to reduce capital spending on road construction?

      <P>The making of a special amenity area order is a matter for consideration in the first instance by the elected members of the planning authority and their advisers having regard to the provisions of the Planning Acts.  I understand that Dublin County Council have been engaged for some time in a detailed study of the Liffey Valley with a view to developing a plan for the protection and enhancement of its amenity and for its utilisation by the public.  As part of the study an assessment is being made of whether it would be appropriate to make a special amenity area order for all or part of the valley.  I understand that a report on the study will be available during the coming summer.  It will then be a matter for the elected members of the council to decide whether a special amenity area order should be made.  In these circumstances, I do not propose to intervene in relation to the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that Dublin County Council have been considering an order of this kind for the past couple of years and that it would <Col N="2088" /> seem that they are deliberately dragging their feet on the issue?  Would the Minister agree also that the Liffey Valley is of outstanding natural beauty?  It is situated in the midst of 250,000 people, and 6,000 canoeists use the area every week but the valley is being destroyed by dumping that takes place with the permission of the county council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated, the Minister has no power to make a special amenity area order.  However, he can direct the planning authority to make such an order but since a report on the matter is expected this summer it would be unreasonable to issue such a direction. This is a case in which the local authority concerned have engaged in the studies that are required to be undertaken before a special amenity area order could be made.  My advice is that we wait for the outcome of those studies.  I am confident that having regard to the area in question and to the population it serves the elected representatives will do what is right. There are times when we should direct local authorities but as far as possible, particularly where local authorities are making the effort, they should be left to proceed to do what they think right for their area.  It is not in the best interests of local democracy to have Ministers stepping in and out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Dublin County Council promised a study for last summer and have now promised it for this summer?  The local community spent £7,500 preparing a report which is before the Minister.  In view of the urgency of the problem and the history of the county council in relation to dumping, would the Minister not agree that it is essential that he should use his powers to intervene and direct the county council in the interests of a quarter of a million local people and of the population of Dublin?  This is the only waterway going into west County Dublin.  Given that this is the Year of the Environment, would the Minister step in, as a matter of urgency, seeing that the local authorities <Col N="2089" /> have dragged their feet for the past few years?

      <P>The making of a special amenity area involves a strict legal procedure and the Planning Acts enable the planning authority to make an order in respect of areas considered to be of outstanding natural beauty, special recreational value and where there is a need for nature conservation.  As I have indicated, the council have assured me that they are examining this matter and will have proposals for the coming summer. Then it will be a matter for the elected members of that local authority.  Given the assurance that something will happen, we should leave it to the elected representatives to do the running thereafter, rather than having Ministers stepping in, doing their big brother act and pointing the finger.

      <P>The final resolution adopted by the EC Transport Council in November 1985 on Road Safety Year 1986 called for programmes of action in each member state in the area of community awareness, legislation and research.  A general outline of Ireland's plans for Road Safety Year was given in a press statement issued by my predecessor on 5 February 1986.</P>
      <P>In so far as the community awareness aspect is concerned, the major role is being undertaken by the National Road Safety Association.  The association's overall programme for 1986, which was developed in consultation with and is funded mainly by my Department, will have a particular Road Safety Year dimension, including the use of the special EC Road Safety Year logo and the common poster.  National publicity will feature the themes selected by the EC as appropriate to the year&mdash;seat belts, drink/driving, speed, child safety and safety of two-wheeled vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specific programmes are being undertaken by the association to mark the year. The association's major undertaking in this respect is a community project scheme.  This scheme, which will operate in partnership with local authorities, will involve local community-based groups throughout the country in road safety projects from now right through to September. Full details of the NRSA community project scheme are incorporated in a special brochure produced by the association which has already been distributed to local authority road safety officers.  It is intended that the local projects will feature EC themes for Road Safety Year with special emphasis on seat belts.  I have arranged for a number of <Col N="2092" /> copies of the brochure to be placed in the Dáil Library for the information of Deputies.</P>
    <P>The European Commission, on the basis of information supplied by member states, is publishing a &ldquo;calendar of events&rdquo; updated from time to time, indicating the various programmes, with dates and locations, being undertaken by individual member states during the year. I propose to circulate in the Official Report details of Ireland's &ldquo;calendar of events&rdquo;, to the extent determined so far, which has been transmitted to the European Commission.  While the lead role is being played by the NRSA in the community awareness aspect of the year, the opportunity has been taken to include in the calendar known events sponsored by other organisations which have a Road Safety Year dimension.</P>
    <P>In the area of legislation, 1986 will also see developments.  Already in force since the beginning of the year are compulsory fitting of laminated windscreens in new cars, rear underrun devices, side guardrails and &ldquo;long vehicle&rdquo; signs for goods vehicles.  Later this year I will be bringing a Road Traffic Bill before the House which will provide, in particular, for the reduction of the present blood alcohol limit of 100 milligrammes to 80 milligrammes.</P>
    <P>In the area of road safety research, An Foras Forbartha will maintain their normal programme of road safety research.  In addition, however, they will produce an extensive version of their annual &ldquo;Road Accident Facts&rdquo; in December next to mark Road Safety Year.</P>
    <P>Following is the detailed &ldquo;calendar of events&rdquo;:</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the number of driving tests conducted on the northside of Dublin in 1985; the number of failures; the number of passes granted to those doing their test for the first time; and if he is satisfied with the criteria laid down for driver assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Information in the form requested by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department.</P>
      <P>Statistics on pass and failure rates for driving tests are compiled on a national basis and the pass-fail rates of individual driver testers is also monitored.  In 1985, the pass rate for the country as a whole was 51 per cent.  Normally, some 45 per cent of persons pass the driving test on their first attempt, while the pass rate for subsequent tests is about 55 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2097" /> I am satisfied that the criteria laid down for driver assessment through the driving test are adequate to ensure that its general purpose, as prescribed under the Road Traffic Acts, is fulfilled.  The general purpose is that an applicant has an adequate knowledge of the Rules of the Road, that he understands and can make proper use of the controls of his vehicle and that, by putting this knowledge and skill into practice, he can drive safely and competently without danger to, and with due regard for the safety and convenience of, other road users.  The test itself is conducted in accordance with uniform standards and procedures which are monitored on a regular basis.  The scope and content of the test satisfy the requirements of the EC Driver Licensing Directive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have information regarding qualifications for testers but obviously they must be competent, have years of experience and be insured. I will get the information in that regard and send it to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is laughable that a Minister should ask what inconsistency is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There are bound to be inconsistencies in relation to the test as testers may react differently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister does not have the information I seek as my question is very relevant in view of allegations made recently by drivers doing the test for the first time of an intimidating attitude by many testers. <Col N="2098" /> That is why I asked about the qualifications of testers.  Does the Minister accept that testers should have qualifications for dealing with people, especially in regard to making them feel at ease while doing their test because, from the information I received, that is not the case at present and those doing their test, particularly young people, are placed at a serious disadvantage from the word go?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel very strongly that anybody dealing with the public should have special qualifications.  Pressure should not be applied to anybody doing a test and I will have this matter raised and examined in my Department to see if there is a problem in this regard. Anybody doing a test is nervous and anxious and it would be intolerable if pressure were exerted by the tester.  I will certainly have the matter examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister said and I should also like him to say if testers are restricted to a quota of passes per day.  If so, what is the number involved?  Is there a quota in relation to passes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it has been reported to me on three different occasions by constituents that they were informed with regret that they had to be failed because the tester had already exceeded his quota for the day? That is an extraordinary situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Derelict Sites Act, 1961, is to secure the clearance and improvement of derelict sites and to ensure that they are rendered non-derelict. Under the Act, local authorities are empowered to take action in relation to land or buildings if they are likely to become injurious to health or to the amenities of the neighbourhood, or are in a dilapidated or ruinous condition.  The Act extends to derelict buildings and houses provided they are not being used as dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Act are particularly useful in dealing with small <Col N="2100" /> neglected sites in urban areas.  Information is not available in my Department on the extent to which local authorities generally avail of their powers under the Act but indications are that its application is uneven throughout the country.  I understand from Dublin Corporation that 56 sites were dealt with in each of the years 1984 and 1985, the corporation cleaning up 31, with the right to recover the cost from the owners, and the owners themselves carrying out the works on the remaining 81 sites.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Derelict Sites Act can be used effectively to deal with the problems for which it was intended. Apart from the land acquisition procedures which will be restated in a Bill to consolidate the law in relation to the acquisition, use and disposal of land by local authorities, I have no immediate proposals for the revision of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Housing Act, 1966, gives power to housing authorities to deal with houses which they regard as unfit for human habitation but capable of being rendered fit at reasonable expense.  In such circumstances, they are obliged under section 66 of the Act to serve a repairs notice requiring the owner to carry out such works as are necessary to make the house fit for human habitation.  Non-compliance with a repairs notice is an offence under section 69 of the Act and under that section the Authority may themselves carry out the works specified in a repairs notice, the expenses being recovered under section 71.  The 1966 Act also enables closing orders or demolition orders to be made.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have powers to deal with dangerous buildings under section 3 of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1964, by requiring the owners or occupiers to take measures to prevent the building from being dangerous by the carrying out of works specified by the local authority, including demolition, clearing and levelling.  In a case of emergency, the local authority may carry out the works themselves and in either case the full costs of the works have to be met by the owner.</P>
    <P>In the light of the various provisions to <Col N="2101" /> which I have referred, I consider that local authorities have sufficient power to deal with derelict sites, buildings and houses and I have no proposals to extend the law in relation to these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree either that the powers are inadequate or, if they are adequate, that the local authorities are in many cases not effectively using them?  In my own constituency in County Dublin there are dozens of abandoned sites left in an appalling condition and, despite pressures on the local authority, they seem quite incapable of dealing with them. Would the Minister not agree that much of this legislation is outdated and requires a much more vigorous approach to secure the reasonable maintenance of these sites before they are developed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authorities have sufficient legislation but there are indications that the application of the various sections of these Acts is very uneven.  The local authorities should examine the Acts and make them operate. Dublin Corporation dealt with 56 sites in each of the years 1984 and 1985. The corporation cleaned up 31 of those sites and the others were looked after by the owners.  Where the owners did not take action the corporation acted.  They secured co-operation in the case of 81 sites and they themselves had to clean only 31 sites.  There is sufficient legislation to enable the local authorities to take action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of these eyesore sites in the city and county are in the ownership of the local authority and in many cases the local authority are the worst offenders.  Can the Minister give any indication as to whether the existing legislation is adequate to deal with that kind of situation and whether his Department have, or ought to have, any role in dealing with this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but they have now a committee within the local authority looking at derelict sites.  The committee has been in operation for a few years and has in my view succeeded in doing a tremendous amount of work, which clearly indicates that, if the will is there on the part of elected members and officials of the local authority, something can be done.  All this work has resulted from the elected members taking the matter into their own hands and pursuing it.  The legislation is there and, where there is a will on the part of elected members and officials, the matter can be dealt with.  This has been shown in the Dublin Corporation area where in excess of 112 sites have been dealt with.</P>

      <P>I refer to a problem in County Dublin which probably affects other counties as well.  Where an adjoining local authority own land within the boundaries of a local authority and they are responsible for derelict sites &mdash; this is creating a major problem for us in County Dublin &mdash; would the Minister not think the law needs to be revised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>If the member of a particular local authority organised a committee of the type organised by Dublin Corporation, action could be taken against the neighbouring local authority or any other person or persons. If each local authority is not prepared to do anything about it, unfortunately the derelict sites remain.  If the elected members decide to get something done, it has been proved that something can be done.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply to Question No. 575 of 21 May 1985 on this matter.  Since then management, represented by the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board, and the staff interests have concluded a formal agreement, under the conciliation and arbitration process, incorporating a package of measures designed to achieve further significant rationalisation of local authority rate and revenue collection arrangements.  It is a matter for each local authority concerned to negotiate suitable rationalisation arrangements in line with this agreement.  I understand that such negotiations are being actively pursued.</P>

Could he indicate that there were suggestions during the negotiations that these people could be used for general revenue collection rather than just rate collection?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest date for which figures are available is 1984.  In 1978 there were 493 rate collectors and the latest figure is 328.  There is a significant drop.  An agreement which is not obligatory on rate collectors has been reached.  A package has been drawn up and they have until 31 May 1986 to accept or reject that package.  At least there is a genuine effort and attempt to resolve this problem, but it has to be resolved by way of negotiations.  That process has been continuing.  Suggestions have been brought before the bodies and they have a period in which they can accept or refuse.  Rate collectors may participate in the rationalisation scheme either by consenting to the abolition of their office, or accepting an early retirement offer, or becoming revenue collectors.  The aim is to get another grade of revenue collector into the local authority.  This is being done within the local authorities but it must be on the basis of agreement and negotiation.</P>

      <P>Generous assistance is available to persons wishing to repair or improve their dwellings by way of grants under the new house improvement grants scheme.  The grants can be supplemented <Col N="2105" /> by house improvement loans of up to £6,500 &mdash; or £1,000 in the case of unsecured loans &mdash; from local authorities.  Persons whose income did not exceed £8,000 in the preceding tax year are eligible for improvement loans which are at present advanced at a fixed interest rate of 11 per cent over periods of up to 15 years.</P>
      <P>County councils operate a scheme of grants for essential repairs which can cover up to the full cost of minimal repairs to house which have deteriorated to the extent that they cannot be made fit in all respects at a reasonable cost.  Generally this grant is paid for houses occupied by elderly people to allow them to remain in their present homes where rehousing would not be feasible or desirable.</P>
      <P>Another scheme of housing aid for the elderly is administered by a task force set up under the aegis of my Department and is operated at local level by the health boards.  The scheme can cover up to the full cost of necessary repairs to insanitary and unfit dwellings occupied by elderly people living alone who are not in a position to do the work themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>An accurate estimate of the number of new houses to be started this year is not available.  The overall level of housing output is determined largely by the level of private housing activity. This, in turn, is affected both by the general economic situation and, in <Col N="2106" /> particular, by the level of demand.  In these circumstances, a priority of the Government has been to maintain and expand the range of publicly financed incentives to stimulate private housing demand, notably by the introduction of the £5,000 grant to encourage local authority tenants and tenant purchasers to acquire private houses, by doubling the new house grant, by continuing the mortgage subsidy and by ensuring an adequate level of mortgage finance from public and commercial sources.</P>
      <P>In so far as local authority housing is concerned, the target set in <i>Building on Reality</i> of providing accommodation annually for 9,000 households on local authority waiting lists was well exceeded in 1985 and will be comfortably met in the current year bringing a significant reduction in the numbers on local authority waiting lists.</P>
      <P>Generally, it would seem that the level of demand existing at present for private and local authority housing does not require an annual output of new houses of the order of 30,000, but I am optimistic that, in so far as private housing is concerned, the current trends in inflation, interest rates and real incomes will soon have a favourable effect on the level of activity.</P>

      <P>For the first time in the history of the State people in most local authority areas, particularly the bigger ones, can now have houses on demand.  This is something I never thought I would see.  It is there as a result of prudent Government management which has encouraged people with grants to buy their own homes, thereby leaving a greater number of local authority houses available.  It is heartening to see the progress being made in regard to local authority housing.  Because of the grants, local authorities have a surplus number of houses.</P>

The responsibility of a Government is to provide adequate housing and adequate local authority housing is available.  For the first time in Dublin one-third of the allocations last year went to homeless people.  That is something we can be proud of.

    <P>Is the Minister aware that this is as good as useless to applicants, because if they start the work they do not know how much they will get at the end of the work?

      <P>I have to refute that. Because of the unprecedented demand for this grant, which is stimulating the building industry, in order to let work out and get movement we lifted the prior inspection requirement.  As the Deputy is aware, the application form specifically spells out the responsibilities of people applying for grants.  There is no commitment to any amount, but people can qualify for £5,000 with a £2,000 extension grant, and water and sewerage would bring it up to £8,600.  They can qualify for that depending on the work done. Inspectors go out, inspect the work and determine the amount of grant to be paid.</P>

      <P>How can the Minister of State say that this budget and the Estimates will enhance the financial situation of local authorities and will increase in real terms their allocation when the Book of Estimates says in relation to the grant to local authorities in relief of domestic rates, that the provisional outturn for 1985 is £169 million and the provisional outturn for 1986 is estimated to be £144.5 million&mdash;a decrease of 14 per cent?  Even taking into account the supplementary welfare allowance of £18,900,000, there will still be a decrease of about £3 million in last year's outturn, so how can the Minister say that, the position will be enhanced when every council member around the country is striving to adopt rates?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would reiterate what I have already said and ask the Minister to explain the points I raised in relation to the different payment dates.  What would be the total cost of bringing forward the payments to, for instance, 9 July, so that we can have some uniformity?  Could we have an indication from the Minister as to whether, even at this late stage, he proposes to make an additional increase to people in the over 80 category, where we have a derisory increase of 15p?  It is an insult to offer that kind of increase to people over 80 years of age.  What cost would be involved in having one rate of assistance for urban and rural areas to do away with the discrepancy which is causing annoyance and difficulties in many areas?  I deplore the miserly increases given in this section of the Social Welfare Bill.  In all my years in this House I have never seen anything so niggardly.  This is a disgraceful performance by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that where an adult is living with a family a system is worked out by the Department of Social Welfare made out in the form of units.  We are talking in terms of assets rather than money.  There may not be any money in that family and still the income is limited.  This is a disgrace.  This is a defect in the system in relation to an adult residing with his parents.  The fact that he is living with his parents is taken into consideration and a deduction will be made of anything up to £20.  This means he has £1.50 or £2 in his pocket. <Col N="2204" /> That is unreasonable.  It means the parents do not get even one penny because of this decision by the social welfare officer.</P>
      <P>The fact that this young man walks away with £1.50 in his pocket is, to my mind, an incentive to get involved in crime.  It is not possible for an adult to go around without any money in his pocket. I often wonder if there is enough cooperation and co-ordination between the Department of Justice and the Department of Social Welfare when such decisions are being made because many crimes are committed by people who do not have very much money.  This is something which will have to be reviewed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Another point which will have to be considered is the rural and urban differential. It is a joke that a man in an urban area gets more than a man in a rural area. I never learned why this was so but I can give good reasons why the position should be reversed.  I live seven or eight miles from the city and a number of social welfare recipients, under privileged people, and people with plenty of money, living outside the city, travel by bus or car to the city to shop in the supermarkets because they get better bargains there than in the country.  Yet, the man living in the rural area has a lower income.  That may have been all right 25 or 30 years ago when people had gardens and grew vegetables for their own use, but that does not apply any longer.  The Minister should look at this position because it is unreal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the urban and rural rates, I accept that the present position gives rise to anomalies and is very difficult to justify.  It would cost about £7 million to eliminate that differential, but all I can say is that it is under active consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies mentioned unemployment assistance and the application of the means test to young people living with their parents.  This is difficult to justify. Nonetheless, a rough estimate of the cost <Col N="2205" /> of abolishing the means test in those circumstances shows that it would involve an extra expenditure in excess of £30 million.  If one had £30 million available, one would then have to look at one's list of priorities.  Many Deputies made a strong case for back dating the increases to April, and this could cost £30 million. Should this £30 million, if we had it, be spent in this area?</P>
    <P>The means test has been in existence as long as the unemployment assistance scheme has been in existence.  The scheme of means testing was consolidated in the Consolidation Act 1981, by Fianna Fáil who were then in Government. It would have been much easier to abolish the means test in 1981 when the cost factor was less than half what it is today, because there were not as many people claiming unemployment assistance and the rates were much lower.  The appropriate time to abolish this scheme was in 1981.  Why was that not done then, if Deputies opposite felt so strongly about it?  This is an area which will continue to receive consideration.  This is one of the many aspects of social welfare which the Commission on Social Welfare are looking at and their report is due out very soon.  Some Deputies gave the impression that the means test for people living alone was new.  I want to put it on the record that it is not.  It is as old as the unemployment assistance scheme and, as I said, Fianna Fáil had an opportunity in 1981 to do something about it when the cost factor would have been comparatively insignificant, but nothing was done then.</P>
    <P>Deputies mentioned the differing dates of application.  Section 3 provides for increases in the rates of social assistance payments by inserting a new schedule of rates, Schedule C, for the Fourth Schedule to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  Social assistance payments are being increased by 4 per cent as follows: from 9 July for unemployment assistance, from 14 July for social welfare supplementary welfare allowances, from 17 July for deserted wives, prisoners' wives, social assistance and single women's pay allowances, and 18 July for old age pensions, blind pensions, widows <Col N="2206" /> and orphans and non-contributory pensions. The reason for the differing days and dates of implementation is that each scheme has its own weekly period &mdash; some being the week on Wednesday, others Thursday and others Friday.  Consequently the date of application cannot be synchronised.</P>
    <P>I should like to explain some basic concepts which underpin the system of unemployment payments. The various conditions governing these schemes are laid down in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  One of these conditions is that a claimant must be available for employment and, in order to determine whether a particular claimant is available for employment, the deciding officer must ascertain the facts of the case as far as possible and apply his judgment to the evidence.  He must decide whether an applicant is genuinely on the labour market and available to take up a job if offered one, what is his or her work rate, what are the hours of study required.</P>
    <P>I am taking this question, in the context in which Deputy Wyse posed it, of people who are availing of certain educational courses while at the same time claiming unemployment benefit or assistance. That deciding officer must take into account what are the hours of study required, would the student be likely to give up his or her studies and take a job if one were offered.  The answers to these questions will determine the position but it is obvious that each case must be decided on its merits.</P>
    <P>Full time attendance by day on a course of education generally speaking is not regarded as being consistent with the notion of being available for work during the academic year.  However, full time students can qualify for unemployment payments during the summer vacation if they are available for work and satisfy the other conditions of entitlement.  A student engaged in a programme of studies during the summer vacation as, for instance, in the case of a student sitting an examination in the autumn might not be entitled to payment.  There are no hard <Col N="2207" /> and fast rules in this matter.  It is almost a cliché at this stage to say so, but each case has to be considered on its merits.</P>
    <P>The question to be determined is whether the degree of commitment to his or her studies by a person following a course is such as to render him or her unavailable for employment.  Neither are there are any hard or fast rules for dealing with the situation of an adult claimant who has become unemployed and who decides to pursue his or her educational studies pending re-employment.  Within the limits of the present legislation there is considerable scope for unemployed people to engage in educational courses without affecting their entitlements. Generally, persons engaged in part time courses, who are trying to improve their prospects of employment, would fulfil the availability for work condition.</P>
    <P>While retaining the right of deciding officers to decide cases on their merits, my Department are always prepared to discuss with educational agencies and providers of educational courses whether given programmes would present difficulties from this point of view.  This, combined with greater flexibility on the part of course organisers &mdash; which is becoming an increasing feature of education provision &mdash; has considerable advantages in terms of giving the unemployed a greater range of options.  Generally that is the position in relation to people who are participating in certain educational courses and who, at the same time, want to claim unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa raised the matter of the original estimate for supplementary welfare allowances in 1985 not having been spent.  The reason for the saving was that the original figure was an overestimation. The scheme is administered by the health boards.  Up to the end of 1985 it was financed jointly by local authorities and the Exchequer.  The figure in our Estimate is the Exchequer contribution.  It is estimated at the beginning of the year based on estimated expenditure as supplied by the health boards and estimated contributions by <Col N="2208" /> local authorities.  The local authority contributions are fixed later by regulations. In that situation it was not easy to estimate accurately at the beginning of the year what would be the Exchequer contribution, unlike the scheme administered directly by the Department which makes more accurate estimation possible.</P>
    <P>The original estimate for 1985 was an over-estimate.  That did not mean any cutback in entitlement.  In fact, the Exchequer contribution to the scheme in 1984 was £22.6 million as against an estimated £28.3 million in 1985.  It will be seen, therefore, that there was no cutback effected in that area and no new guidelines issued as to how it should be administered.  It is interesting to note that the total estimated expenditure on supplementary welfare allowances rose from £37.3 million in 1984 to £42.4 million in 1985 to an estimated £48.7 million in 1986.  The method of financing the supplementary welfare allowance has been changed under the provisions of section 18 which we shall be discussing later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has conveniently ignored some of the points raised.  I might revert to the question of the dates of payment.  The Minister will be aware that the first two mentioned in the section involve a difference of over a week, that is between 9 and 17 July. Subsection (2) (b) relates to deserted wife's allowance, prisoner's wife allowance, social assistance allowance and single women's allowance and constitutes a blatant discrimination against women. We have seen already in the social welfare code a number of discriminations against women in the matter of payments and benefits.  Here is another blatant one. I should like to know if the Minister has consulted the Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs about this.  Surely she, in turn, has some responsibility in ensuring that this type of discrimination is ended.  Could we be given some indication of whether the Minister proposes to bring forward the date of payment to 10 July?  The excuse he has advanced about different dates <Col N="2209" /> of payment does not wash here because there is over a week in the difference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I should like to raise with the Minister the abolition of the means test.  He said it would cost £30 million, relative to young people who apply for social welfare assistance. The present position is not acceptable. I know many young people in my constituency who apply for social welfare assistance who, when means tested, are deemed to be ineligible.  I know that many of those young people have left home and gone into hostels.  Indeed I am aware that many young girls have become pregnant.  It should be remembered that, when their baby is born, the local authority are obliged by law to house them. Also, once their baby is born, the State must pay them the unmarried mother's allowance which has been increased but was £54 a week.  Then the relevant health board must provide furniture and bed clothing.  Additionally they must pay them social welfare assistance toward the cost of paying bills.  I do not agree with the moral implications of the law in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I wanted to make, one in relation to the supplementary welfare allowance and the other, unemployment assistance. Replying to my point concerning the saving of £3.4 million in the Supplementary Estimate of May last year the Minister said this arose because of an overestimation of the money required to fund the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been here for a number of years now and I do not recall any similar over-estimation by the Department or by the Minister in relation to this scheme.  It seems that, while the Minister argues that no guidelines were issued which would restrict payments under this scheme, the changes in the fuel allowance legislation, or regulations which the Minister brought in here last year have had an effect on the payments made by the health boards under this scheme.  It seems also regarding <Col N="2210" /> the number of people in receipt of clothing grants, particularly for children returning to school in September, that the guidelines which were issued in the middle of 1984, if my recollection is correct, certainly had an effect on the money paid out by health boards under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. After a long number of months I managed to get some figures for the appeals lodged in relation to clothing grants and discovered that something like 700 appeals were lodged in the Eastern Health Board area in 1984 when the new guidelines issued.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many of those appeals were successful, but these were people who prior to the new guidelines being issued were in receipt of clothing grants.  I know from personal contact with the people that those who were refused last year did not bother to apply this year because they felt it would be pointless. Those who had applied last year were refused, appealed, waited six months for a reply and were still refused.  It is fine for the Minister to say that there are no new guidelines or restrictions on this supplementary welfare allowance scheme when the practice on the ground is that it is very much restricted and the regulations are being applied much more strictly now than they were in the past.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister &mdash; not the present one &mdash; described the scheme as a net to catch those who were worse off in our society, but the scheme which is intended to provide that safety net is being restricted and this results in a saving.  It was not classified as an overestimation in the Minister's speech last December; it was classified as a saving of £3.4 million.  A scheme being administered as a safety net that can show a saving of £3.4 million, when the poor in our society are poorer than ever, seems a failure of common sense.  As another Deputy said here, if these schemes are administered in such a way that people are left with nothing in their pockets, then they have no option but to get the money somewhere.  There is no other way out of it.</P>
    <P>That applies also to the whole question <Col N="2211" /> of unemployment assistance.  I tabled an amendment to insert a new section before section 4, but the argument applies equally to section 3.  The kind of amendment that I was looking for to the Bill provided that in calculating the weekly rate for people living at home the element which would be ascribed to a person as being the value of his or her lodgings would not be taken into account.  While I do not go the whole way with Deputy Michael Barrett in relation to what he seemed to be implying, that young women become pregnant simply to get the unmarried mother's allowance, let me say that many young people are being forced out of the home through economic necessity.</P>
    <P>There must be some amendment which can be introduced to this scheme.  I have made a number of suggestions in recent months by way of Parliamentary Question to the Minister in relation to it.  There must be some way of amending this scheme whereby single people living at home &mdash; they are not all teenagers; some very mature people are living at home with their parents and have virtually no money in their pockets which they can call their own &mdash; can have an income in their own right while unemployed.  I have suggested a minimum income and various ways of altering the assessment procedure and so on.  I do not believe it is beyond the capacity or the wit of the Minister or his Department to devise a scheme whereby single people living at home could have a basic minimum income which they can call their own and where single men and women are not dependent on handouts from brothers, sisters or parents in order to get a bus into town even to look for a job.</P>
    <P>It is no longer acceptable for the Minister simply to trot out a global figure that it will cost £30 million to abolish the means test.  It may well cost so much if it is to be abolished, but I am not arguing here that we should go the whole hog this year. I am arguing that the Minister can come up with a scheme which eliminates a situation where people are walking the streets with nothing in their pockets.  If <Col N="2212" /> large numbers of young people are walking the streets with no money in their pockets, then there is little point in our throwing our hands up in horror when they get into trouble.  I make that point strongly to the Minister and I hope he will take it on board.</P>
    <P>We have been told time and time again that the Commission on Social Welfare are due to report.  I was told last year that they were due to report and, therefore, there was no point in doing anything in relation to this matter.  The Minister says now that he understands it is to be published shortly.  Even if the report of the commission is to be published tomorrow, how soon can we expect that legislation or regulations will be introduced to alter the situation to which I have referred at length?  I intend at every opportunity I get in this House to return to this question because it is a disgrace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to follow up my question regarding a young person returning to a course of education and at the same time being allowed to draw unemployment assistance.  I was somewhat surprised when the Minister said there is no hard and fast rule.  There is. As soon as a young person walks in to sign for unemployment assistance and informs the officer concerned that he is returning to school and taking up education and that he is available for work, he is automatically struck off the register. There is a hard and fast rule there.  In what I am talking about there is no additional cost to the Exchequer.  If a boy or girl did not take up a course he or she would still be in receipt of unemployment assistance.  However, others abuse the social welfare system.  After signing on they take up employment in the black economy but young boys or girls who tell the local officials that they intend pursuing a part time of full time education course while awaiting employment are victimised.  They will not receive any financial benefit for returning to full time or part time education in an effort to improve themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A young person who gives an undertaking to a local official that he or she <Col N="2213" /> is available for work, and until a job becomes available proposes to pursue an education course, should be paid an allowance.  We should be encouraging that.  At least such young people are not walking the streets aimlessly and getting involved in crime.  Young people should be encouraged to return to education while awaiting employment.  I am not asking the Exchequer to pay out any extra money but an injustice is being done to young people as far as unemployment assistance is concerned.  The Minister should give serious consideration to this. Young people should be given an opportunity to improve their standard of education in the hope that they will pick up some type of employment.</P>
    <P>For the last 12 months I have been appealing to the Government to give a fair break to young people, particularly those drawing unemployment assistance. Most of them are in the fortunate position that they are not told by their parents that they should stop going to school and sign for unemployment assistance because the income is needed.  We are depriving young people of an opportunity of further education while at the same time thousands abuse the social welfare system and make a lot of money in the black economy.  The Minister should give this matter serious consideration.  What I am proposing will not mean an extra burden on the Exchequer because such people are entitled to unemployment benefit.  They should be permitted to pursue full time or part time education courses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make reference to the delays that occur in regard to unemployment assistance claims.  It is not an unfair political comment to say that it takes an extraordinary amount of time to process claims. Unnecessary hardship results for those who are entitled to unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.  I am concerned about the technical reasons being advanced by the Department for nonpayment of benefits.  We are all aware that the standard reply sent to Members, and those claiming unemployment assistance, <Col N="2214" /> is to the effect that the Department are not satisfied that the individual is available for work.  On that pretext the Department get off the hook and many genuine claimants have to depend on the generosity of local organisations.</P>
      <P>At a time of high unemployment I wonder how a person can convince the Department that he or she is available for work.  In many cases those who are refused benefit must obtain a note from potential employers that there is no work available.  Those fortunate enough to be approved by the Department must wait between six and 12 weeks for a payment. I accuse the Department of concocting reasons for dragging out the process.  The Minister should be concerned to streamline the operation and make it easier for those who are genuinely unemployed to receive their benefit.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware from working in his constituency that this is happening and that Members must make representations daily on behalf of applicants. We are not caring for the unemployed in the way we should.  The Department appear anxious to drag out the process and inflict unnecessary hardship on the people who are unfortunate enough not to have a job.  Three or four weeks after claims are submitted applicants receive letters from the Department to the effect that they are not satisfied the person is looking for work.  Documentary evidence is requested but when that is submitted it takes the Department a long time to reach a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the unnecessary bureaucracy involved in the processing of claims.  Why is it necessary for an application for benefit from a person in Laois to be submitted to the Castlecomer or Carlow office for further investigation only to be returned to Laois before being forwarded to Dublin for a final decision? We have heard a lot of talk by the Government about the need to streamline the operations of the House and of Departments but I do not think anybody has heard of a more unwieldy, cumbersome <Col N="2215" /> and expensive system of Government administration than that.  In fairness to those who are genuinely unemployed, and in the interest of efficiency and saving public money, the Minister should have all applications dealt with at county level.</P>
    <P>In this way the applications could be submitted to the local district officers where they would be investigated and processed and if necessary the Minister could continue with centralised payments from the Department.  There is no justification, even in terms of economic considerations, for the present system being continued.  I am appealing to the Minister to put in train immediately a system that would centralise the Department and transfer the responsibility to local offices in each county so that all claims could be processed in each county by officers of the Department. That is the commonsense way to deal with social welfare especially at a time when we hear so much about attempts to streamline the bureaucracy in which all of us, both in this House and outside it, have been bogged down for many years.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer now to a matter that was brought to my notice only very recently and this relates to people wishing to offer their services in doing voluntary work for the community.  In the town of Portlaoise a number of groups are involved actively in providing voluntarily very worthwhile community schemes.  What concerns me is that I have heard that anyone who is in receipt of unemployment benefit or assistance but who is anxious to contribute in a voluntary capacity to work in the community, must first seek the approval of the Minister and of the Department.</P>
    <P>Who could have thought up such a regulation?  We are talking about people who are prepared voluntarily to make a valuable input into community work and who through no fault of their own are unemployed.  Are such people expected now, before they embark on any such work, to notify the Department that they intend becoming involved in some small voluntary community project and to ask for the approval of the Department?  That would be a disgraceful regulation on the <Col N="2216" /> part of the Department.  It would destroy one of the most outstanding characteristics remaining among our people and which exists in very few other countries. I am referring to the great interest in community development and to the desire on the part of people to contribute to community development.  Again because of bureaucracy are we to attempt to extinguish that great Irish instinct of commitment to overall national community development?  If what I am saying is true, the Minister should take action immediately to redress the position so that instead of victimising people who are prepared to serve the community in a voluntary capacity, every encouragement would be given to them.  Last evening I attended a meeting of a very important voluntary development group in my constituency at which I was asked to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to unemployment assistance for small farmers or the so-called small farmers' dole.  Many smallholders are being deprived of unemployment assistance for some technical bureaucratic reason whereby there is some kind of fictitious means of calculating an applicant's income.  I submit that some of those investigating claims for unemployment assistance are not qualified to assess accurately a farmer's income.  Small farmers are struggling to make ends meet.  The income from their holdings is very limited and in many cases they are being denied supplementary income.  This prevents them from being able to continue to operate their small farms.  The Minister should set up an effective system whereby the income of small farmers can be quantified credibly instead of having some kind of scale devised by civil servants which bears no relationship to real income and does not take account of the many expenses of small holders.</P>
    <P>Anyone who read in the Press today the report of yesterday's debate between the EC Agricultural Minister and the representatives of the various political parties, including the Minister for Agriculture, will realise what farm income is <Col N="2217" /> likely to be in 1986.  That is another reason for the Minister having a fresh look at the position of smallholders who have had to depend for a long time on State support to supplement their dwindling farm income.  Unless the situation is redressed many smallholders will have to emigrate or to dispose of their holdings. They are being deprived of their entitlement.</P>
    <P>These, then, are the anomalies as I perceive them in the operation of the social welfare code.  I was pleased to hear a Deputy from the other side of the House refer to the plight of single people living at home in so far as social welfare assistance is concerned.  I do not know whether it is by regulation or otherwise but the position is that whatever chance a young man living at home has of qualifying for some small amount of unemployment assistance, a girl has no chance of being given any such assistance.  I am hearing of cases all the time of girls who are living at home being deprived of unemployment assistance because of the Department interpreting the support they receive at home as adequate income. This is a serious form of discrimination against female applicants for unemployment assistance though there is discrimination in this respect, too, so far as male applicants are concerned.  I am appealing to the Minister to address himself to this problem.  Having regard to the many pressures on the family and to the effort and sacrifice that goes into rearing and educating children, are we not victimising parents by not paying unemployment assistance to young people merely on the basis that they live with their parents?  It is no fault of these young people that they cannot find work.  What is involved in this regard is discrimination against the family unit.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Minister will take note of the anomalies I have outlined especially as they affect people in rural Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>One can appreciate the limitations of the Minister in terms of the level of increases that is possible.  However, one would have hoped for greater increases especially in <Col N="2218" /> relation to unemployment assistance. The level of income at which a person may qualify for this assistance is extremely low.  In many cases it is below subsistence level.</P>
      <P>I am sure everyone in the House will be aware of the anomalies in the social welfare code.  We are all aware of the extraordinary anomalies in relation to the application of unemployment assistance. Perhaps the Department would do well to investigate the manner in which application are investigated.  It would seem that, depending on the personality and the attitude of the social welfare officers concerned, determination of eligibility varies from place to place.  A decision in one area may be very different from a decision in another area even when the circumstances in both cases are similar.  There is need for more agreement in investigating procedure.</P>
      <P>Many of the points which I wished to raise have been dealt with already. Deputy Wyse has mentioned those who decide to take up part time education. They have no other employment and hope to improve their position but are unfairly disqualified from unemployment assistance.  They then give up the part time education.  This matter should be closely examined.  In relation to rural unemployment assistance, a young married couple may be living with, for example, the wife's brother or the husband's father.  The assessments in these cases are made not just against the applicant but also against the householder.  If the wife's brother is a farmer, the local social welfare officer demands that his entire income be thoroughly investigated, which is most unfair.  It is claimed that lodgings are being provided by that relative, but it is only accommodation which is being provided, and it has to be until the council provide them with accommodation. There should be tougher control over the activities of some social welfare officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hyland has already raised the manner in which social welfare officers assess people for smallholder's assistance. <Col N="2219" /> Many of these assessors are incompetent, not being familiar enough with the agricultural scene to give a fair assessment. I know that within the past year or so there have been great strides to improve the situation and fairly good guidelines have been set down, but there are still many anomalies.  There is need for closer examination in this regard.  In many cases items which would be allowable with regard to smallholders are not taken into account initially by the investigating officers.  Many of these items are accepted only on appeal, particularly on oral appeal.  There has been talk about duplication and triplication of work, but if such matters were effectively dealt with initially there would be no need for a subsequent appeal.</P>
    <P>Most people who sign for unemployment assistance do so out of dire need, although there is a certain amount of abuse.  There can be an appalling delay between the date of signing and the date of actual payment.  In the meantime the applicants must go to the local community welfare officer and, after a certain amount of hassle and investigation, get supplementary welfare allowance.  This is soul destroying.  They must go from place to place and suffer great embarrassment. I hope that there will be an improvement in the manner in which investigations are carried out and that there will be more conformity with regard to decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the intervention of Deputy Hyland, not that I agree with everything he said.  He has certainly emphasised a point which needs emphasis. That is that the payment of social welfare benefits is not just a matter of form.  Certain newspapers have had a recent campaign giving the impression that payments of social welfare benefits of all kinds are made after the minimum of checking.  What Deputy Hyland has said underscores the point that too much care and attention are sometimes paid to applications and that it is not easy to succeed with a claim for unemployment benefit or assistance.  As the Deputy said, certain red tape and bureaucracy must be <Col N="2220" /> gone through.  Practically all of this is necessary, however.  I hope that those who criticise the Department and what they see as the ease with which people can get benefits will take note of contributions such as Deputy Hyland's.</P>
      <P>His contribution contrasts sharply with that of Deputy Wyse, who said it was very difficult for young people to get unemployment assistance, the not so young can sign on, get their money and go off to work in the black economy. These contradictions demonstrate my problem in trying to reply to this debate. Deputy Hyland would be nearer to the actual position in saying that there are undue delays, too much bureaucracy and so on.  Some delay is necessary to establish one's entitlements.  The main problem at present is the volume of applications, which has increased substantially. Yet the standard of investigation to ensure that people are entitled to what they are claiming has not dropped. The process has been streamlined and will continue to be streamlined to ensure the minimum of delay between a claim being made and payment being issued.  If Deputies know of any cases of undue delay, they should bring these to the notice of the Department or to me and we will look for the reason.  There must be explanations in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subject of the means test has been raised and I have dealt with this matter in detail during this debate.  I would like to see the means test abolished.  I mentioned a rough figure of £30 million and one must bear in mind that if the means test were abolished those who would benefit would not be the worst off.  I would ask all Deputies who raised this point, if they had the opportunity to make a gift of £20 with a choice of two people &mdash; one the unemployed son of a person on maximum rate of unemployment assistance and the other the son of a successful businessman or big farmer with no unemployment assistance because of a means test &mdash; to which would they give their gift?  I am sure that they would give it to the unemployed son of the man on maximum rate of unemployment assistance, rather than to the son or <Col N="2221" /> daughter of a big businessman or farmer. Similarly, on the question of abolishing the means test, you must remember that in the example I gave the son of the unemployed person has maximum rate unemployment assistance but the other &ldquo;poor&rdquo; person has nothing so he should get the money.  Abolishing the means test will mean that those who are perhaps better off than others will benefit more than those who are worse off because if their parents are unemployed they are in receipt of the maximum rate of unemployment assistance.  Therefore, providing an additional sum of £30 million to abolish the means test will not make any difference to those people.</P>
    <P>I should like to give a rough example of the application of the board and lodgings regulation which has been in existence since unemployment schemes were brought into being and was also consolidated in the 1981 Act.  To arrive at a sum for board and lodging we take the average earnings of £185 per week which, after tax, would be about £130 per week.  The parental allowance of £90 is deducted giving a net sum of £40 per week.  A son or daughter claiming unemployment assistance would be assessed with a maximum of 12½ per cent of £130 which is £16.20 per week.  They would, therefore, receive unemployment assistance at the rate of £36.70 less £16.20, giving them £20.50 per week.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wyse said that we should encourage young unemployed people to further their education but the problem is that the unemployment assistance scheme is not designed to cater for full time students.  We receive many representations in this regard and each case is judged on its merits.  Most young people at school, certainly at second and third level, could argue with some justification that they are only staying on at school because they do not have a job.  It might not be true, but it would be very hard to distinguish between those who wanted to further their education and those who would prefer to be working&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but entitlement arises from being available for work and actively seeking employment.  Quite a number of students could make the point that they were actively seeking employment and that they were available for employment.  However, as I said earlier, each case is judged on its merits and there is a degree of flexibility in this regard.  If a young person can prove to the satisfaction of a deciding officer that he or she is more committed to seeking employment than to furthering his or her education, it would be a very different situation. There is no discrimination in the treatment of males or females or in the assessment of their means for unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>I thought I had answered Deputy Daly's point but he was not satisfied with my reply regarding different dates.  All the payments are due to be paid in the same week but there are different days for the reasons I stated.  In the case of 9 July, if the Deputy looks at his diary he will realise that it falls on a Wednesday. Unemployment assistance is paid on a Friday so that will be paid on 18 July. Some payments are made in arrears, others are up to date and some are paid a day or two in advance.  All payment will date from 9 July although they may not be paid on that day.  This is not new&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and the care he gave to a number of points I raised in my initial contribution. When we are talking about unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit payments we are talking about money which has been extracted from the taxpayers and PRSI contributors. Therefore there is an obligation on the Government to get the best possible return from the money so extracted.  The Minister of State may be able to enlighten me on a question which has long puzzled me.  We have a number of short term employment projects like Teamwork and some of the AnCO projects, not to talk about the shortfall in the availability of money to the Department of the Environment and the various county councils.  On the other hand, we have the Department of Social Welfare who seem <Col N="2225" /> to have an almost bottomless resource as far as public money is concerned.  Why have we not devised a situation whereby the Minister for Social Welfare would enter into a dialogue with her colleague, the Minister for the Environment, with a view to transferring funds from Social Welfare to the Department of Labour for the continuation of employment under, for example, the Teamwork project or to the Department of the Environment to keep roadworkers in employment.</P>

Surely it should be possible for the Minister's Department to channel funds and transfer them from his Department into the productive areas of the economy.  I would regard the Teamwork project, the AnCO projects and the projects run by the Department of the Environment as being productive.  They are all financed from public funding.  All Government Departments are financed from public funding.  Surely it should be a simple exercise in organisation within Government Departments to reach an understanding and agreement in relation to the transfer of scarce financial resources. How is it that the Department of Social Welfare happen to be the Department who have an endless financial resource available to them, which other more desirable, more essential and more deserving sectors of the economy are deprived of the level of finance they require?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Hyland's point, it is not a simple matter of transferring funds from the Department of Social Welfare to the Department of the Environment.  Intense study and research have been done on suggestions of that kind over many years but it would take much more money in the sense that an administrative and supervisory structure would have to be provided to employ people, not to mention materials and machinery.  The latter take up a bigger slice of the budget than the wages paid to workers.  The social employment scheme is part of the answer, but nobody has ever claimed it as the full answer.  We would hope to encourage more people to avail of the social employment scheme over the next 12 months or so.  That is the nearest one can get to the suggestion Deputy Hyland has made.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hyland referred earlier to voluntary work.  Every encouragement is given to unemployed people to take part in voluntary work.  It is very hard to dodge the regulations governing the social welfare system.  The Government are now providing substantial sums of money to voluntary organisations.  For example, this year within the Department of Social Welfare we have £750,000 to allocate to voluntary organisations.  In order to curb abuses it is necessary to keep some check on those engaged in voluntary work.  If somebody is working and claiming benefit on the grounds that he is doing voluntary work, it would be impossible to keep track unless prior permission had been given.  If that is done there would be no hassle afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2227" /> Before the prior permission stipulation, people were caught working who were genuinely in voluntary work but they were disallowed benefit pending investigation and that caused problems. Therefore, before engaging in voluntary work people have to go through the necessary procedure and thereafter they have nothing to worry about &mdash; the officers know who have been cleared for voluntary work.  This is another example to show that the Department are not lax, that every caution will be taken and every encouragement given to voluntary workers and others.  The Government are well aware of and appreciate the work of such voluntary organisations.</P>

      <P>I regret that my amendments, providing that there should be a further increase in the rates of supplementary benefits from 33? per cent to 50 per cent, would have involved an extra charge on the Exchequer and were therefore disallowed.  It is a pity the Government did not make a realistic attempt to make the family income supplement more attractive.  If ever a scheme failed, this one has.  From the beginning it was a major con job.  When the Government introduced it in 1984 it was the anchor on which they would combat poverty among lower paid workers.  It would alleviate hardship resulting from the removal of 50 per cent of the food subsidies, and families affected by that would benefit to the tune of £5 or £6 per week to compensate for the increased prices of food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How much money was saved in 1985 on the original allocation for the FIS?  In <Col N="2228" /> 1984 the Government, with the greatest degree of triumphalism and trumpeting, introduced the scheme, and the Minister for Social Welfare spoke in ecstasy about how well it would work.  He assured us that more than 35,000 families would benefit.  The Government were confident that that number would benefit by £7 or £8 per week each.</P>
    <P>The stark reality is that it was a con job.  I have here an application form containing so many pages, each one filled with various questions, that you would think you were applying for an international work visa, something of great benefit, instead of the miserly amount you would get as a result of being deemed eligible for this scheme.  Since September 1984, when we were told that 35,000 would benefit, only 6,000 people have applied.  That may be because the scheme was so badly planned and the benefits so poor.  It has turned out to be a failure, although it was supposed to be a major instrument to be used by the Government to combat poverty among low paid workers.</P>
    <P>If the Government truly were interested in combating poverty among those people they would have considered seriously that only unemployed people should be eligible.  What did they do? They specifically excluded unemployed people from applying.  That alone has proved that the policy of the Government is to kick the unemployed into the gutter. One would think that the Government regard the unemployed as inferior, as a mass of human beings not worth treating properly.</P>
    <P>Not alone did the Government exclude the unemployed but they have made it nearly impossible for anyone to apply for this benefit.  One would have to be pretty good with a pen and need plenty of intelligence to be able to complete this document properly.  If one did not fill it in properly, it would be sent back, or it would get lost.  It seems to be the trend that half of these forms do not arrive where they should.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister say exactly how many people out of the 35,000 people who are supposed to be entitled to avail <Col N="2229" /> of the scheme are availing of it?  How many people do the Department project will take up the scheme before the end of this year as a result of the increase? Does the Minister think that there will be a major run on the scheme as a result of the increased upper limit?  I doubt it but I would be glad to hear the Minister's view.</P>

      <P>The family income supplement is a good idea as far as it goes.  In the absence of a statutory minimum wage it is the least we can do for those on very low pay.  This is really a subsidisation of bad employers who refuse to pay an adequate income.  It is interesting that this scheme does not apply to people working fewer than 30 hours a week even though they may work for five days.  It is also important to note that the number of people who it was expected would qualify under this scheme did not materialise.  The figure mentioned when the scheme was announced was 35,000 people.  Where did that figure come from?  Do the Department still feel that 35,000 people are entitled to qualify under the scheme or is the figure greater or lesser?  I would also like up-to-date figures as to the number who have applied not just since the scheme started, but in the last 12 months, and how many have qualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point raised by Deputy McCarthy about the application form for the scheme is important.  The advertising for the scheme is also important.  When aiming a scheme at the poorest amongst us we must be careful about the avenues we choose through which we advertise. The effect of advertising on television is not always all that it is made out to be. The experience with the measles immunisation scheme is a classic example of where a flashy, costly advertising scheme had virtually no impact on those who most needed immunisation.  It was only as a result of an appearance on the Late Late Show that the scheme actually took off.  People watching this show suddenly realised the risk they were running by not having their children immunised and that the scheme was available free of charge. <Col N="2230" /> To what extent have the Department examined the impact of the advertising of this scheme on the people it is intended to reach?  I suggested that a simple way of reaching the relevant people would be through the Revenue Commissioners. Everyone in paid employment is on the records of the Revenue Commissioners. Given computerisation and so on, it would be relatively easy to send out a notice to all people earning below a certain level, and a form with their tax free allowance form, encouraging them to apply for this scheme.  That is a very direct method of informing people of their entitlements.  The previous Minister gave me an undertaking last year that he would look into that possibility.  Has the suggestion been followed up, and what if any problems are there in pursuing that line of informing people of their entitlements under this scheme?</P>
    <P>Unfortunately we have a fairly high level of illiteracy which creates a problem in relation to the application form.  Even if one has gone through the educational system, right up to leaving certificate level, it is not a guarantee that one will understand many of the social welfare forms.  I am constantly surprised at the complexity of some social welfare forms. Indeed, the regulations and explanatory leaflets often leave one more in the dark than when one started.</P>
    <P>This leads to another point which relates not only to the question of the family income supplement but to a whole range of other benefits, that is information for social welfare claimants.  There was a social welfare claimants' rights week run recently when it was discovered that a considerable number of people were unaware of their rights under the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>I came across a significant number of people who were told at labour exchanges that they were not entitled to sign on and these people assumed that was the end of it.  I would not go so far as to say that the people in labour exchanges were deliberately misleading them, but perhaps they were ignorant of the regulations. An increased number of women are refused unemployment benefit and <Col N="2231" /> are then told that they no longer have the right to sign on.  That is totally untrue. The result is that the women concerned do not maintain the continuity of contributions or credits.  This area is not directly related to the section, but it is an example of the way in which social welfare claimants are unaware of their rights and are not particularly helped by the people in the various social welfare offices.  That is not to be interpreted as saying that every employee in the Department of Social Welfare is unhelpful. My experience is that they are very helpful.  Unfortunately, there are incidences where people are not given the help they need in the way which would make sense to them in order to pursue their rights.</P>
    <P>There are two areas arising from the family income supplement&mdash;first, the nature of the application form and how it might be simplified, and, secondly, a better way of reaching the people who are entitled to this supplement and who, if the first estimates of those entitled to it are correct, are not aware of what is available to them or do not know where to go to make inquiries about it.  The Minister and the Department have an obligation to ensure that everyone who is entitled to benefit under this scheme can avail of it.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that this scheme has not been more successful. When it was introduced it appeared to have great possibilities and it was sold by the Government as the answer to many problems.  Many of us felt it would be of great help to a number of families but it is disappointing to hear that very few families have availed of it or that few applications were approved.  Why are so few families availing of this scheme? Is it because of the complexity of the application forms?  Is it because of the delays in having the application forms processed?  Is it because it had become too difficult for people to answer the questions?  Did people decide not to pursue their claims?  As I said, it is most disappointing to hear that so few families have been approved for benefit under <Col N="2232" /> the scheme.  Perhaps the Minister would answer my questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of people who have availed of this scheme has been disappointing and I do not believe there is any one answer to this problem.  It was very difficult to assess the exact number of people who would qualify.  It was estimated that 35,000 families could be involved and this was based on a number of factors, including information from the Revenue Commissioners which was at least 18 months out of date.</P>
      <P>Prior to the introduction of the scheme there was a great deal of talk in this House to the effect that it did not pay people to work and that many of them would be better off unemployed.  I never agreed with that point of view.  The scheme was introduced to help people in low paid employment where their employers were not in a position to give them a better wage.  We were told many thousands of people were forced to give up their low paid jobs and to go on unemployment benefit because, it was claimed, they would be better off.  This scheme was introduced to try to remedy that situation. There was always the danger, as Deputy De Rossa stated, that this scheme would be abused by unscrupulous employers as a subsidy on wages, but this has not proved so because, if that had happened, many more people would have availed of the scheme.</P>
      <P>During 1985, 5,600 supplementary payments were made costing £2.3 million. Every effort was made, and will continue to be made, to advertise the scheme.  I agree that the people we are aiming at are the least accessible to advertising. They may not buy newspapers, have television to take notice of advertising because with no purchasing power they are not interested in what is advertised on posters and elsewhere.  Ways and means must be devised to reach these people.  We are all aware of the fact that there are people who should be getting these payments but are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application form has been mentioned. This form was devised to practically eliminate the necessity for officials <Col N="2233" /> of the Department calling on people for further information.  People should apply by sending in their application forms to be processed.  They would then get back the allowance if they were entitled to it and there would not be any necessity for investigations.  That is the problem about making the application form any simplier, or taking away some of the questions, because we should avoid as far as possible the necessity to have officials calling on these people.</P>
    <P>This is a temporary scheme which will continue in existence until the new child benefit scheme is fully implemented, and then it will go by the board.  In the meantime every effort will continue to be made to reach as many people as possible.  The statistics available were not very reliable for a number of reasons but they were the best available at the time.  I hope the adjustments provided in section 4 will increase the number of people availing of this scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for increases in the income limits up to which the family income supplement is payable.  It provides for an increase in the percentage rate of the supplement and increases in the maximum amount of supplements payable under the scheme.  One of the reasons underlying the introduction of the family income supplement scheme was to deal with the situation where people on low earnings might have a net income only marginally greater than what they would receive if they were in receipt of social welfare benefits.  The family income supplement calculation is therefore related to the net income which people on low earnings receive as compared with the net income of social welfare recipients.  The scheme is confined to families with children where one parent is or both parents are in the active labour force.</P>
    <P>The level of income up to which a supplement is payable at present is £100 for a one child family, increasing by £18 a week for each additional child up to the fifth.  The income level at which the maximum supplement is payable is £68 a week for a one child family, increasing by £8 for each additional child up to the <Col N="2234" /> fifth.  The maximum weekly supplement is £8 for a child family increasing by £2.50 for each additional child up to the fifth. The changes in the upper income limits are necessary because of the 1986 budget improvements in personal income taxation and the new rate of short term benefits provided in section 2 of this Bill. The £100 limit for a one child family will remain unchanged but subsection (1) provides that the increase in the limit for each additional child will be raised from £18 to £20 by amendment of section 232B of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (a) provides for a more favourable calculation of the amount of supplement.  The supplement was originally calculated at 25 per cent of the difference between gross family income and a prescribed upper income limit for the family size in question.  This is being increased to one-third of the difference between family income and the prescribed upper income limited.  Subsection (2) provides for an increase in the maximum amounts payable in respect of each family size.  As stated earlier, the upper income limits for family income supplement are fixed in relation to the level of short term benefits payable to an unemployed person.  At present the total amount of short term benefit, disability benefit, unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit are subject to certain limits by reference to the person's previous earnings. For unemployment benefit this is set at 85 per cent of a person's recent take-home pay.  These limits do not apply where flat rate benefit only is payable. Therefore, for low income workers with families the flat rate benefit alone could exceed 85 per cent of a worker's normal take-home pay.  The family income supplement upper limits were worked out to ensure that an employed person would not be left with a net income below what a person in receipt of unemployment benefit would receive.</P>
    <P>Subsections (2) (a) and (b) provide for an increase in the maximum amount of family income supplement payable to each family size.  The lower income limits on which these maximum amounts are based are set by reference to the levels of <Col N="2235" /> supplementary welfare allowance.  These limits also require to be changed because of increases in the maximum rates of supplementary welfare allowance payable from July.  The effect of the increase will mean that the maximum amount payable will increase by £2, from £8 to £10, for a one child family and by £4 instead of £2.50 for each additional child up to and including the fifth child in the family. Subsection (2) (d) provides for rounding up to the nearest £ when calculating the rates of supplement.  At present, in calculating the rate of family income supplement, family income is rounded to the nearest £ which with the 25 per cent increase gave increased rates of supplement in 25p steps.  The provision of subsection (2) (d) will reduce the number of rates and represents a major improvement in this regard.  Subsection (3) provides that these changes will take effect from 10 April 1986.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would respond to the query I raised with regard to using the Revenue Commissioners as a means of reaching those on low incomes who might be eligible under the provisions of the family income supplement scheme.  The answer might well indicate some of the reasons that the provisions of this scheme are not being applied for.  Could the Minister indicate whether income received under the provisions of this scheme is assessable for differential rents purposes and if the income is assessable also for medical card purposes?  In relation to unemployment assistance, if the mother or father is working and is receiving this family income supplement, would the Minister say whether that supplement would be taken into account in assessing the means of a dependent son or daughter who might apply for unemployment assistance? What I am trying to ascertain is whether this supplement is taken into account in relation to differential rents, medical cards or unemployment assistance. Perhaps the Minister would also indicate what has been the lowest single <Col N="2236" /> supplement paid to anybody under this scheme.</P>

      <P>What are the Minister's projected figures for increasing the takeup of this scheme by the end of this year in the light of the increase from 25 per cent to one-third?  An approximate takeup of 6,000 people out of a projected 35,000 leaves their projections 29,000 wrong.  That is an appallingly mistaken projected figure by any establishment.  I do not care whether the Department or the Revenue Commissioners were to blame.  To get their figures so twisted as to be only one-seventh correct is an appalling indictment of their vision.  The Minister did concede that the scheme had been a disappointment.  The Minister could concede that it has been a failure, a major con job, that what they have done in terms of fiddling between 25 per cent and one-third will not render this &ldquo;pennies from heaven&rdquo; scheme any more attractive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The lowest amount of supplementary welfare paid is £1.  The difficulty in basing estimates on information from the Revenue Commissioners is that one could well contend that the section of people in which the Revenue are least interested are those on very low incomes, people obviously outside the tax net.  Therefore we cannot criticise the Revenue Commissioners for devoting their resources to keeping tighter records of people with larger earnings.  The Revenue Commissioners would not constitute the best source of accurate information of people on low earnings because generally speaking those people would not come within the tax net.  What is required is accurate up-to-date information. There is a difficulty in that whole area.  Were we to insist that the Revenue Commissioners keep such records we would be diverting resources away from more important work in the sense that their task is to devote their resources to ascertaining the people with incomes and salaries subject to taxation, rather than people from whom they have no hope of getting a penny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2237" /> In reply to Deputy McCarthy, I might say that we are not unique in the shortfall of applications.  Experience has been similar &mdash; though perhaps not to the same extent &mdash; in Great Britain, in that the take-up of their family income supplement scheme fell far short of what had been anticipated.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa raised a point with regard to means testing.  Supplements would be taken into account in means testing.  Let us take the example of two people, one with an income of £120 a week and another, with similar family size, with an earned income of £100 and a supplement element of, say, £20, would have to be treated in the same way.  One could not discriminate against one applicant simply because his total income was derived from his job and another who had the same income made up of a family income supplement plus an income from his job.  I imagine they would have to be treated in the same way for the various schemes that demand means testing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not criticising the Revenue Commissioners at all for not dealing with this question of the family income supplement.  I am criticising the Minister and his Department for not using a State agency who are there and are in contact with every single person who is in paid employment and who once registered as an employee and with a PRSI number is automatically on the records of the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissiones now at this very minute are churning out hundreds of thousands of tax free allowance certificates. I received one just last week.  Every person in paid employment is or at least should be getting a tax free allowance certificate.  I take it they are churned out by computer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be a relatively simple matter to add a statement onto the tax free allowance certificate that the person may be entitled to family income supplement and should please contact the proper authority.  Some simple message on the tax free allowance certificate could go to everybody if the job of separating those <Col N="2238" /> on a particularly low income from those on high incomes is too great or too costly. There is no reason why the same message should not go out on every tax free allowance certificate.  As a result people who are not entitled to the supplement might apply for it, but at least a great many more who are entitled to it would be made aware of that fact.</P>
    <P>That is the only point I am making in relation to the Revenue Commissioners. The mechanism is there for reaching everybody who we believe is entitled to this income supplement and it is a shame that it has not been used.  I am not criticising the Revenue Commissioners.  I am criticising the Department who do not appear to have taken on board a suggestion I made on at least three other occasions in this House and so far they have not come up with any valid reason for not having pursued that line.  Having brought in this scheme, we have an obligation to make sure that those who are entitled to the allowance get it.  Presumably, it would not have been brought in if it was felt that people did not need it, so we must make every effort to ensure that those who are entitled to it and need it get it.</P>
    <P>In relation to income and means testing for rents, medical card and unemployment assistance, again I am not suggesting that people on the same income should be treated differently.  I raise the point simply to highlight the fact that one reason why people may be reluctant to apply is a fear, perhaps unreasonable, that receipt of the supplement may render them ineligible for a medical card. A couple with two, three, four or five children may fear that the receipt of £1, £2 or £3 per week would not be worth the loss of a medical card which would entitle them to free medical care for them and their children.  They may also fear that the supplement would result in an increase in their rent or deprive a son or daughter of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that any of these things would be lost as a result of the receipt of the supplement.  I am saying simply that the people who are entitled to it may fear that they will lose these <Col N="2239" /> things because their experience with various Departments in the past may have been that any possible way of depriving them of a benefit was used as a cost cutting exercise by the Government. Experience shows that people's fears in relation to this matter are well founded. I am making the point that people who are entitled to the supplement may be afraid to apply for it because they fear they may lose a medical card or that a son or daughter may lose either portion or all of his or her unemployment assistance or that their rent may be increased as a result.</P>
    <P>Those are the points I am making in relation to it.  More effort must be put into overcoming that kind of fear and making sure that every avenue available to us here &mdash; the Revenue Commissioners are an ideal avenue &mdash; must be used to reach those who are entitled to this supplement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me assure the Deputy that any suggestion about improving the method by which we can get a greater number of people to avail of the family income supplement will be examined.  Any suggestion he or any other Deputy makes will be taken up if it is found practicable and possible.  That is the aim of the Department.  There is a scheme there, the family income supplement, and we want to ensure that the people who want it get it.  Any suggestions will be examined and if practicable and possible they will be taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the means testing, I doubt whether the granting of the family income supplement would disentitle someone to the medical card.  I have not got the scale in front of me and I have not worked out the mathematics, but I doubt very much that the granting of the supplement would interfere with medical card entitlement.  The Deputy is aware that the health boards have discretion and that guidelines, not hard and fast lines, are there.  Bearing in mind that people must be on relatively low incomes in the first place to get a supplement and that, <Col N="2240" /> even with the supplement they are still not in receipt of what might be regarded as a very good income, they should still be safe enough within the guidelines.  If there are particular circumstances in any household, the health boards take those into account in determining whether the medical card should be granted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Once more I should like to read into the record of the House the first lines of the amendment which are:</P>
      <P>In page 17, to delete lines 5 to 15 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;28.&mdash;Notwithstanding any provision contained in any existing legislation, CIE shall operate public transport services within the Authority's administrative area, to such an extent, in such a manner, and at such fare levels as the Authority may from time to time determine.</P>
      <P>That substantive amendment is in keeping with the philosophy I have been trying to promote since we started the debate on the Bill.  The essence of the amendment is that the new Dublin Transport Authority would be one which had real powers.  That has been my belief all the time.  The substance of the Bill I wanted to see, and which I would have welcomed, was one which provided for a plan elaborated in the way I mentioned on the last occasion and in course of the Second Stage debate.  Arising out of that, budgetary and financial powers were necessary for the Dublin Transport Authority.</P>
      <P>From the way the debate developed I gathered from the Fine Gael and Labour benches, in the persons of Deputies Richard Bruton and Taylor, that that type of Authority would find favour with them also.  I said that I was not challenging the provisions in the Bill which give real powers in certain areas which are not, in my opinion, the nucleus of the problem with regard to Dublin transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the lines of the amendment I have quoted we have the proposal that the Authority would really direct transport in its own area of competence, the Dublin area.  In so doing it would in fact be using CIE as an agent.  Since the debate on the Bill commenced the new proposals for CIE were announced with some modification. What has been announced could have been worked into my idea about the Dublin Transport Authority.  What is happening is that a new Dublin city services company are being set up.  There is no strict tie in to the Dublin Transport <Col N="2244" /> Authority so that even if the DTA advise, admonish, instruct or give this counsel to the Minister, or CIE, there is not anything in the Bill of sufficient strength to enable the Authority to see to it that CIE carry out instructions in the area.</P>
    <P>One ray of hope emerged in an earlier section when it was indicated that, perhaps, such provisions as the traffic and budgetary plans at some future date might, under a section of the Bill, be brought into effect by the Minister.  I admit that it is a suggestion of a major change but it is the only ray of hope I can see in it.  I reiterate that I foresaw an optimistic future for Dublin city services. My whole idea was, as my committee advised my party, that we would have a Dublin city services company as stage one of a reorganisation of CIE but a company who would be independent and not merely a company with an umbrella in the form of CIE.  I visualised that that company would act as the agent of the Dublin Transport Authority which would be budgeted properly and strengthened by the provisions of this Bill and which with the improvements for which this Bill provides in terms of traffic management and so on and with imaginative leadership and marketing could develop a transport system which would not merely pay its way but eventually make a profit.</P>
    <P>I reiterate, too, that the Dublin Transport Authority, if given the proper strength, could make arrangements for the deployment of public transport in our capital city and, if necessary, could make regulations and rules regarding the restriction of private transport in the city. This combination of imaginative leadership, good marketing, good service and improved traffic flow and with a Dublin Transport Authority that would have the proper statutory muscle would mean that we could look forward to a very effective and profit making Dublin city services transport system.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that I am a voice crying in the wilderness at this stage.  I have tested parts of what I have outlined by way of a vote and I am not so Quixotic as to believe that I can do anything other than stress the importance I attach and that <Col N="2245" /> my party attach to the view of the Dublin Transport Authority that I have been outlining.</P>
    <P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4a:</P>
      <P>In page 19, line 27, after &ldquo;or previous experience&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or income tax reference number and details of any benefit or assistance in payment to the applicant under the Social Welfare Acts at the time of the application&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment incorporates Committee Stage amendment No. 18 sponsored by Deputies Mac Giolla and De Rossa.  Its purpose is to prevent distortion of competition through income tax evasion or abuse of the social welfare system. Information obtained by the Garda Commissioner or the Dublin Transport Authority from applicants for licences about their income tax reference number or social welfare payments, including a nil return, would, therefore, be checked with the Revenue and Social Welfare authorities.</P>

      <P>In page 20, to delete lines 39 to 43 and insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(9) A person who contravenes a by-law under this section shall be guilty of an offence and, in any such case involving a vehicle, as may be prescribed in a by-law under this section or prescribed in regulations to which subsection (12) applies, where that person is not the owner of that vehicle the owner shall also be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make clear in what circumstances the owner of a vehicle who is not the driver of the vehicle involved in the contravention of a by-law made under section 31 of the Bill would also be guilty of the offence as well as the driver of the vehicle. Those circumstances would be specified in by-laws of the Authority under this section or specified in existing regulations made by the Minister for the Environment under section 82 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and continued in force by subsection (12) of section 31 of the Bill. Under those regulations &mdash; Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations, 1963 (S.I. No. 191) (as amended) the owner of the vehicle as well as the driver would be guilty of an offence in any of the following five circumstances, a vehicle is used as a public service vehicle without the necessary licence (Article 5); a vehicle is used as a public hire vehicle without the necessary licence (Article 6); a public hire vehicle is used without the necessary taximeter (Article 7); a public service vehicle is used without the necessary vehicle plate (Article 13) and a large public service vehicle &mdash; a bus &mdash; is used without the necessary conductor or controlled powered entrance-exit door &mdash; Article 14.

      <P>I move amendment No. 4d:</P>
      <P>In page 29, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>41.&mdash;(1) The Authority, with the consent of the Minister for the Environment, may make by-laws, either generally or for particular cases, in relation to the regulation and control of access to and egress from construction sites within its functional area by vehicles or particular classes of vehicles.</P>
      <P>(2) By-laws under this section may in particular relate to all or any of the following matters:</P>
      <P>(a) the regulation of the times or days during which access to and egress from construction sites by vehicles or particular classes of vehicles may be permitted,</P>
      <P>(b) the number of vehicles that may be allowed access to and egress from construction sites at any particular time, or</P>
      <P>(c) the requirements to ensure that vehicles or any particular classes of vehicles are cleaned before leaving any construction site.</P>
      <P>(3) A person who contravenes a by-law under this section shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>(4) This section shall not apply to the carrying out of repairs, maintenance or any other works to, above or under, a public road or to the construction of a new road.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment contains enabling powers for the better control of vehicles serving construction sites in the functional area of the Dublin Transport Authority and supplements the amendment by making it an offence to contravene any by-law which the Authority may make under the new section with the <Col N="2251" /> consent of the Minister for the Environment. The maximum penalty for that offence will, by virtue of the consequential amendment now proposed to section 52 (2) of the Bill, be as follows: £150 for the first offence, £350 for the second offence or subsequent offence outside 12 months and £350 and/or three months' imprisonment for the third or subsequent offence within 12 months.  Subsection (4) is necessary in order to avoid duplication of section 40 and safeguards new roads works.</P>
    <P>The amendment has been proposed in order to reduce the severe disruption to road traffic which can be caused by vehicles serving construction sites, especially in heavily trafficked areas of Dublin.  It is accepted, of course, that detailed controls on vehicle arrival and departure times at construction sites could cause some difficulty for the building industry and staff and it is therefore proposed to have discussions with the building industry and staff representatives to see how disruption of traffic can be minimised.  The Dublin Transportation Task Force will be arranging those discussions at an early date in order to make progress on this matter.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4e is consequential on the amendment inserting the new section 41 to provide for better control over vehicles serving construction sites in the functional area of the Dublin Transport Authority.  The effect of this amendment is to bring by-laws made by the Authority under the new section 41 within the procedures to be followed for all by-laws of the Authority requiring the consent of the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 4f the purpose is to apply the penalties specified in section 52 (2) of the Bill to contraventions of any by-laws made by the Dublin Transport Authority under the new section 41 for the better control of vehicles serving construction sites in its functional area.  The maximum penalties specified in section 52 (2) of the Bill are £150 for the first offence, £350 for a second or subsequent offence outside 12 <Col N="2252" /> months and £350 and/or imprisonment for a third or subsequent offence within 12 months.  Those penalties apply also to any contravention of the Authority's by-laws under other sections of the Bill, namely, section 31 which deals with the licensing of public service vehicles and section 36 which deals with the licensing of public car parks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important amendment.  The House knows by now from various pieces of legislation which have come before it that I have an instinctive dislike for a <i>carte blanche</i> in legislation with regard to ministerial powers or the operation of by-laws.  In the event of the Authority making these by-laws, I am sure that the by-laws are covered by the provisions we have already talked about and will come at least into the view of the Oireachtas after they have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this drafting is to enable regulations to be drafted if the Minister, after consultation with the industry, is satisfied that such regulations would not be disruptive of the industry.  We do not want to insert powers which could be very disruptive of the industry, so we are providing enabling powers which will allow the Minister to discuss with the industry the disruption of traffic by construction activity and to see how without disrupting the building industry we could improve the situation and minimise disruption of traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the need for it and I approve of the Minister's approach.  The only point is that, if the Minister consults with the industry and the industry does not agree, in the end he must make a decision.  His decision having been made, there is still a possibility of the thing coming under the eye of the Oireachtas afterwards to make sure there is no unnecessary infringement of the rights of the people involved.  I appreciate what the Minister has said about the purposes and I also appreciate the necessity for such by-laws.  Reference was made on a number of occasions to traffic management &mdash; the fact that all factories open at <Col N="2253" /> the same time, all schools open at the same time and all shops open at the same time.</P>
      <P>It has been said that this is not conducive to the best management of traffic in an ancient capital city like Dublin with its constricted thoroughfares.  The thrust of the Minister's amendment is to so organise such traffic on construction sites that the minimum amount of traffic interruption will take place if regulations are made with regard to the time of day when access and egress are permitted.</P>
      <P>Another important point not merely in Dublin but everywhere is the cleanliness of vehicles.  Many accidents are due to skids on roads where clay carrying trucks have dropped part of their load on the road surface.  This causes accidents, particularly in soft or damp weather.</P>
      <P>With regard to the fines, I am always a little reluctant about jail sentences but, if somebody is there for the third time, I will restrict charity on this occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputies, especially Deputy Wilson, for their very constructive contributions to this debate.  Deputy Wilson and I had a fairly fundamental difference on this Bill because he wanted to go for what I would see as a heavier type of Dublin Transport Authority.  I believe the Dublin Transport Authority which is now being authorised by the House will be a leaner, fitter, much less bureaucratic and much more effective Authority than that suggested by Deputy Wilson.  This Authority have a major role to play, not only in the transport affairs of our city for decades to come but also because of the effects of transport on other things it will have a major influence on other aspects of life in the city.  I believe that influence will all be beneficial.  Much needs to be done about co-ordinating transport matters in this city.  It is amazing that transport in general has survived as well as it has in the absence of a co-ordinating body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dublin we have four local authorities who separately consider their roads programmes.  They do it in total isolation from considerations of bus and rail investments.  They do it in isolation from traffic enforcement and traffic management, which are divided not only between agencies on the ground in Dublin city and county but between Government Departments.  The Department of Communications <Col N="2255" /> have an obvious role not only in regard to Dublin road and rail services but in the area of road freight and port activities and the Department of the Environment have responsibility for road traffic law, vehicle fitness, etc. The Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána have roles in respect of traffic law enforcement.</P>
    <P>This Authority will co-ordinate all those things.  It will order priorities and clear the Dublin streets of unnecessary traffic jams.  It will keep the city moving. The House had done a very good job in getting this Bill through and, when the Bill has passed through the other House &mdash; I hope it will not take too long &mdash; we will begin to see the work of this Authority.</P>
    <P>All of this has been going on for the past few years.  The Dublin Transportation Task Force, without statutory authority, has been doing a lot of commendable work and I wish to thank and congratulate the task force.  For instance, it initiated the idea of bus lanes to great advantage.  It promoted many new traffic management arrangements which have helped.  I thank the House and in particular Deputy Wilson for his contribution.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús buíochas a ghlachadh leis an Aire as ucht an méid adúirt sé mar gheall ar an obair atá déanta ag an Teach in rith na díospóireachta seo.  I said that we might do something about Iompras Bhaile Atha Cliath. I was not the first to call attention to it &mdash; I refer to the Short Title.  I would have used &ldquo;Údarás Iompair Bhaile Átha Cliath&rdquo;.  Whether it is Iompras Bhaile Átha Cliath or Údarás Iompair Bhaile Átha Cliath, I should like both Houses of the Oireachtas to indicate that we are still committed to the use of Irish terminology in the names of our semi-State bodies.  Córas Iompair Éireann was objected to originally on the ground that we would not be able to get used to it, and so on, but we did.  It was a quite euphonious title, as Údáras Iompair <Col N="2256" /> Bhaile Átha Cliath would have been.  The tendency nowadays is to use initials, and we will find it hard to get a suitable grouping of initials from either of the terms that will catch on.  For example, I was a little disappointed that DART did not have an Irish title. &ldquo;Mearlíne&rdquo; was suggested &mdash; fast line &mdash; which would have been easy enough to get over.</P>
      <P>While appreciating what the Minister said, I still reject the idea that what I was proposing would be heavily bureaucratic. It is very important to have this Bill, weak though I regard it, on the Statute Book. I know that the recession, the closure of factories and so on, has taken some of the pressure off Dublin transport before 8 o'clock in the morning and after 5 or 6 o'clock in the afternoon.  The new bridges have helped greatly to get traffic moving fast.  We are not legislating for a permanent recession.  I know the pressure will come on again and it was advocating the kind of Act I wanted to see on the Statute Book.  I go fully along with the Minister in what he said, and indeed that is what provided the impetus originally for the Bill.  In the ten months I was in the Department I was anxious to get the legislation to the parliamentary draftsman, and I succeeded in doing so within ten months.</P>
      <P>There will be four local authorities involved in the new regime.  There will have to be planning for roads without taking buses into account and planning for buses without taking rail into account. The Dublin Transport Consultative Commission pointed out how much they had to do to make a simple little by-law about traffic.  That is what was damning all attempts to control traffic in the city. Transport, as the economists say, is one-eighth of the costing in our community and consequently moving traffic fast through Dublin, apart from a social activity, is a very important economic activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have liked to have all those people who have an input in Dublin traffic taken by the scruff of the neck and told: &ldquo;We are working to a single plan. This is the way you will do it, whether you like it or not&rdquo;.  That applied to the <Col N="2257" /> Department of the Environment, CIE, the people working with buses and those on the rails.  In my time the Department of the Environment were <i>bête noire,</i> because they fought against this legislation. When the present Tánaiste became Minister in that Department the view of the Department of the Environment prevailed over that of the Department of Transport.</P>
    <P>That is all water under the bridges already there.  In the minute I have left I endorse the remarks of the Minister about the task force which arose from suggestions made from the TCC.  The TCC went in without statutory backing and achieved a great deal.  The urgency we saw about putting this Bill on the Statute Book was what we were doing without statutory powers.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom arís mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire faoin méid a dúirt sé.  Tá brón orm nach bhfuil Bille níos láidre, níos fearr agus níos éifeachtaí againn tar éis na díospóireachta.

      <P>Yes. I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, concerned at the acute shortage of hospital beds in north Dublin, condemns the Government for their failure to open Beaumont Hospital and calls on the Government to arrange for its immediate opening.</P>
      <P>The reason for this motion is that we are concerned at the delay in opening Beaumont Hospital which, in the Minister's words, is badly needed.  In north Dublin there are 50,000 people and the Mater Hospital is the only major hospital. Blanchardstown it to get a major general hospital in the future but here this hospital has been completed for two years and there is not a sign of the Minister opening it.  We intend to confine tonight's debate to Beaumont Hospital and we do not intend to go down different avenues in criticising the Minister and the Government on health policy generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The building of Beaumont Hospital was completed in 1984 at a gross cost of £53 million.  At present 40 people are employed in the hospital at an annual cost of £1.2 million of taxpayers' money. To date there is no patient in that hospital. That is an indictment of the Minister <Col N="2259" /> and the Government and it is due to intransigence and doctrinaire, socialist ideology on the part of the Government and the Minister.  The hospital has 730 beds and will replace Jervis Street and the Richmond Hospitals which are doing excellent work at present but whose conditions are not suitable either to the patients or staff to continue work.  Beaumont Hospital was due to open in July 1985. The Minister stated in the House on 7 February 1985 that he was determined to open Beaumont Hospital in July of that year.  One of the tragic effects of not opening it is that the staff involved who, despite the disturbance caused by moving out to the north side of the city, were looking forward to the move, have suffered a loss of morale.  This will create a problem and the Minister must accept responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>The reason for the delay in opening the hospital is that in July 1984 the Minister wrote to the board of the hospital and informed them that he intended to reverse a decision of his predecessors to allow consultants have private facilities on the campus.  The consultants already knew that because they had read it in <i>The Irish Medical Times</i> in April 1983 when the Minister had clearly stated that he would not either give away, sell or lease land for private facilities as long as he was Minister.  The Leader of my party, and Deputy Woods as Minister for Health, both promised that they would provide a site for private facilities for the consultants at the hospital.  They gave that commitment in writing to the board of the hospital.  When the Taoiseach got a letter in September 1984 from a member of the staff who was concerned at the decision to reverse the commitment to allocate land, he replied that he understood that the Minister had written to the board of the hospital that he would not allow private facilities.  It was a Government decision so it is not absolutely fair to blame the Minister entirely.</P>
    <P>I question the logic of that decision.  I put it to the Minister in November 1985 that it was a purely doctrinaire, socialist ideology and the Minister in reply to a <Col N="2260" /> supplementary question said that of course it was ideology.  That sort of ideology is not in the best interests of the people.  Anybody with commonsense would agree that it is in the interests of the patients in a public hospital to keep the consultant staff on the campus, as long as possible during the day, and if their private work is on the campus, all the better.  The Minister apparently did not mind where they had their private facilities, Bray, Dún Laoghaire or Mount Carmel, so long as they did not have them on the Beaumont campus.  If I were a public patient in Beaumont having hadserious surgery I would like to think that the consultant would be on the campus in the afternoon or evening if a complication arose.  I would not like to think that he would be a two hours drive away across the city.</P>
    <P>The Minister did a U-turn since his original decision and has offered the consultants to lease them land to build their private consulting rooms.  In so far as that goes it is welcome.  Fianna Fáil have always supported the right of the consultants to have their private facilities at Beaumont Hospital.  It is something they have in their existing employment.  The Minister has referred to the cost to the Exchequer and says that this is what puts him off.  However, there is no cost to the Exchequer because the consultants were prepared to lease or buy the land.  In fact there would be an income to the health services through leasing or selling the land that would not be needed in the foreseeable future for the public service.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister the nature of the lease he has offered the consultants. How fair is it to the consultants?  How much control is the Minister keeping?  Is it a good lease for the consultants to raise money to build their private consulting rooms?  The Minister offered the consultants 70 beds out of the 730 beds for public patients.  How does he reconcile that with his doctrinaire attitude that public funds should not be spent on providing private beds in a public hospital? Surely those 70 beds would have been paid for out of public funds.  It is most <Col N="2261" /> unfair of the Minister to blame the consultants because he has not succeeded in opening that hospital.</P>
    <P>In answer to a Parliamentary Question on 6 December 1983 the Minister told me it was planned to commence building a nurses home at Beaumont Hospital in the autumn of 1984, but he did a U-turn on that.  He showed no regard for the fact that young people coming to train in this hospital &mdash; young people who would be involved in the care of the dying and looking after those who are at their most vulnerable &mdash; would be working irregular hours on a large campus.  The Minister dismissed their need for residential accommodation.  He said these trainee nurses were the same as any other trainee working with AnCO or any person working in the centre of the city.  He showed no regard for the need to provide accommodation for these nurses in the first six to nine months of their training.  The nurses' organisation recently issued a statement in which they condemned the Minister and the Department for refusing to enter into meaningful discussions with them.  They have been making representations since December 1984 &mdash; 15 months &mdash; without any success.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Minister will use the 50 beds to open a long stay psychiatric unit.  This would be a disgrace because he would be getting into conflict with the whole purpose of the psychiatric unit which is for acutely pyschiatrically ill patients in the general hospitals.  I believe it would be a retrograde step for the Minister to do such a thing.  The only reason he would do so is the bungling in Carlow and the suggestion is that he will transfer patients from other health board hospitals.  I do not know if he intends to do that over the heads of the Beaumont board and the consultants working in Jervis Street and the Richmond.  He might tell up this evening.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister consulted with the board of Beaumont or the consultants in Jervis Street and St. Laurence's Hospitals on the staffing of the pyschiatric unit &mdash; that is, if he intends to do such a ludicrous thing at this stage as to open a psychiatric <Col N="2262" /> unit in what is a major general and teaching hospital.  Some of the essential equipment has not been ordered yet. Negotiations have not been held with any of the 14 unions.  There is no reason why the Minister could not have negotiated concurrently with all the unions.  Is he serious in his desire to open this hospital?</P>
    <P>In conclusion I will quote from a very worthwhile letter which appeared in <i>The Irish Times,</i> 11 March 1986, signed by Harold J. Browne and Patrick J. Collins, two very eminent surgeons in Richmond and Jervis Street hospitals:</P>
    <P>It is long past time for the Minister to come down from his pedestal and make reasonable concessions to various concerned parties so that this much needed new hospital can be opened to urgently relieve the severe pressure on the hospitals involved.</P>
    <P>The emphasis is on &ldquo;reasonable concessions&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I have some difficulty in dealing with this motion because I am not quite sure precisely what the Opposition want for Beaumont Hospital.  Do they want to see it opened?  Do they want to see this issue dragging on for another 18 months or two years and then perhaps there will be some movement on it?  Do they want to urge the parties to co-operate in an open and constructive way so that the people of north-east Dublin will have a hospital facility available to them as a matter of urgency?</P>
      <P>The Opposition do not appear to know what they want.  Like the rest of us they want to see the hospital open but Fianna Fáil, being the party they are, could not care less on what terms this hospital is opened.  That is the best way I can sum up what has been the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party to hospital building down the years, including Beaumont.  I do not believe Deputy Haughey cared what kind of hospital was built as long as he had a hospital in his constituency, and all the better if that hospital had 700 beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2263" /> With all speed he set about having that hospital built, without working out in advance the implications of such a move. That is typical of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I want to reassure Deputy O'Hanlon in particular of my full commitment to the opening of the hospital.  This is on the record of this House.  I look forward to the opening of the hospital later this year. If everyone works hard it should be possible to have the hospital in operation on a phased basis.  I am very conscious of the need to replace the inadequate facilities in Jervis Street and St. Laurence's hospitals by the provision of a modern hospital at Beaumont.  Whatever reservations I may have had about the hospital, be they in terms of design or otherwise, I am putting them to one side now because a hospital has been built and we have to get it opened and operating.</P>
    <P>I am acutely aware that the population of north-east Dublin need a proper, fully available acute hospital service and the national specialities in these hospitals should be taken into account in the transition. Beaumont will be a general teaching hospital with 730 beds and will provide a full range of specialities.  The building cost about £52 million.  So far we have spent over £3 million on equipping the hospital.  It is estimated that, when the total equipping of all of the hospital is completed, we will have spent an additional £7 million, or a total of £10 million in all.  I made provision last year and the year before, in the capital moneys of my Department, so that, had we received the co-operation we sought, the money was there for the spending.  At the end of the day the money was spent elsewhere in the country.  That is a measure of how difficult the situation was in terms of getting the co-operation of people.  I have been prepared to make the necessary resources available to enable the equipping to be completed and the hospital to be opened.  Deputy O'Hanlon rightly alluded to the serious difficulties which arose with the consultants in relation to their exceptional demands.  Their demands were exceptional.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There never has been such a demand.  The Deputy will have ample time to reply.  I have a mere 25 minutes.  I draw that analogy in terms of a major hospital now being constructed in Dublin where we are spending tens of millions of pounds &mdash; just one example of one hospital where at no stage was there a demand within the hospital campus that there be a public property given to a group of people on which to build their own private hospital, getting revenue out of it for themselves and denying the public hospital the right of revenue.  As in St. James' when it is completed, there will be private beds, as there are now.  The money out of those private beds in St. James' Hospital will go into the budget of that hospital, not into the pocket of any private company. That is the issue.  I regard it as a scandal, a matter of grave public concern that Deputy Woods, who did not know what the hell he was doing anyway, he was so infrequently there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the background. I want to give a further brief background.  I have been making strenuous efforts to resolve these difficulties. I have had discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation on a limited question, namely, the fact that I am prepared to provide private consulting rooms at the hospital.  I am not prepared to provide, as long as I am Minister for Health, a site for a private hospital on public lands which would reduce the budget of the public hospital.  I am not prepared to do that. That is a positive and definite position which is now accepted by the Irish Medical Organisation.  It may not be accepted for all time but, in so far as my term of office is concerned, it is accepted.  I think it is a right decision.  If Deputy O'Hanlon regards it as being excessively ideological, so be it.  I regard it as pragmatic commonsense in the public interest.  If that is ideology, then it is the best form of ideology in the public, in the national, interest of delivering the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 1985 I indicated to the Irish Medical Organisation that I was prepared to lease to the consultants a site on the Beaumont Hospital complex on which they could construct a building for use as private medical consulting rooms.  An outline of the terms on which the site would be leased to the consultants was sent to the Irish Medical Organisation at that time.  They did inform me, fair dues to them, that they were prepared to enter into negotiations on the terms of such a lease.  A very detailed lease has been prepared by the Chief State Solicitor to allow the consultants to construct private medical consulting rooms on the Beaumont site.  Every effort has been made in that lease to safeguard two things, the rights of the consultants themselves &mdash; which I do not particularly propose to <Col N="2266" /> deny &mdash; to have private consultation with their patients and the rights of the Beaumont Hospital authorities to preserve the general integrity of that site.  That is all that I am interested in.  I forwarded the draft lease to the Irish Medical Organisation on 31 January last.  As of today &mdash; I stress as of today &mdash; I am still awaiting their formal views as to the contents of that lease.  I have kept away from <i>The Sunday Press,</i> I have kept away from the <i>Sunday Independent,</i> I have kept away from the date of the next general election. I am anxious to resolve the issue.  I am not interested in medical or political rhetoric, or any other aspect of confrontation. I am anxious to resolve the issue. Therefore, I strongly urge the Irish Medical Organisation that there should not be any further delay on their part in coming back to me with their legal views, if they have any, or whatever modifications they want to propose.  I have told them they are quite welcome to come to me when the matter will be dealt with with absolute expedition.  Any day of the week we will work overnight to resolve the issue.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be interested to know that, since then I have received notification that the medical board of St. Laurence's Hospital, at their meeting on 3 March 1986, passed the following motion:</P>
    <P>That an early meeting of the Richmond/Jervis Street Staffs Association be arranged.  The Richmond will indicate at this meeting their intention to directly meet the Department of Health to secure an early opening date for Beaumont and to finish negotiations on the lease for the site of the private clinic forthwith.</P>
    <P>I welcome that resolution by the consultant staff.  It is a very constructive approach.  I understand also that at a meeting of the joint staff associations of St. Laurence's and Jervis Street Hospitals on 4 February 1986, it was decided by a majority vote that the consultant staff of both hospitals would co-operate fully with all concerned to get the hospital open.  Therefore, I share the concern of the consultant staff of the two hospitals <Col N="2267" /> in relation to the early commissioning of Beaumont Hospital.  I am encouraged to expect that, in the light of these indications of co-operation, the matter of agreeing on the lease for the site will now move towards a rapid conclusion.  In anticipation of a satisfactory outcome of this matter I propose now to proceed without further delay with arrangements for the opening of the hospital.</P>
    <P>First, we come to the staffing requirements. It is necessary to understand that Beaumont will replace the existing St. Laurence's and Jervis Street hospitals.  It will be financed from the budgets of these two hospitals, which this year aggregate £28 million, and will be operated by the staff of the two hospitals.  There will be no redundancies, no difficulty.  I would point out that there are already some 27 staff now working in Beaumont, new, additional staff, working in anticipation of full commissioning.  We are paying every one of their salaries out of the general health vote.  That is a measure of our earnest to have the hospital open. The boards of the two hospitals have already been informed that the staffing of the new hospital must be carried out within the limits of the current combined &mdash; I stress &ldquo;combined&rdquo;&mdash; pay budgets of the two hospitals; they will both transfer up to Beaumont.  It is a reasonable deal, plus the 27 staff working there at present.</P>
    <P>I would stress that there are at present 1,700 staff employed in the two hospitals. The structures for determining the staff requirements of Beaumont are already in place.  I am confident that it will be possible to reach agreement on those requirements at an early date.  So that there be no misunderstanding about this, I would stress also that I cannot afford to pay &mdash; there is a Government decision on the matter anyway and even if there were not a Government decision I would not be disposed to paying &mdash; disturbance money to anybody going up to that hospital. There will be no disturbance money paid.  Therefore negotiations will be relatively simple.  As a former trade union official I know how very difficult such negotiations can be but, with goodwill on <Col N="2268" /> both sides, we can move up to Beaumont quite rapidly.</P>
    <P>Regarding the consultant medical staffing requirement for Beaumont Hospital, the Beaumont Hospital Board have agreed to finalise their proposals in this regard and to forward them to my Department by the end of May, prior to their submission for approval to Comhairle na nOspidéal.  Deputy O'Hanlon knows that is the procedure now in relation to any revision of consultant staffing in any hospital and there will be no delay on my part in deciding immediately on that submission.</P>
    <P>Regarding nursing and other staff, I am concerned to ensure the fullest consultation with representatives of the other staff involved in the transfer of services to Beaumont and my Department are now making arrangements in this regard.  I stress that we will make concurrent arrangements, the phrase used by Deputy O'Hanlon and I agree with him that there should be concurrent negotiations, and these will go ahead in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon referred to residential accommodation.  It has been stated that extra residential accommodation should be provided for certain staff working in the hospital.  I accept entirely that accommodation is required for those staff whose presence on the hospital site is essential in their ordinary day to day work for the proper operation of the hospital. However, I do not think I would be justified in funding residential accommodation for all other categories of staff, given the present levels of remuneration and the availability of private accommodation, and bearing in mind that many of the staff live within a reasonable distance from the hospital.</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared to give sympathetic consideration to any proposal from the hospital board concerning the provision of staff accommodation on a commercial, rented basis.  Otherwise I propose to conserve public funds and I understand that the board are at present negotiating with developers in an area close to the hospital on the possibility of <Col N="2269" /> residential accommodation being provided for certain categories of staff.  I stress that this is on a commercial basis. The days are gone when we provide free accommodation all over the country for student nurses.  I hold the view strongly that in enlightened hospital administration young nursing staff should not be institutionalised on a training basis.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I have seen the trauma of nurses who were circumscribed in such residential accommodation and it is a very interesting argument to have, but as far as the on call staff are concerned, medical, nursing, administrative, chaplains and so on, adequate facilities within the hospital framework of residential accommodation will be fully provided. There is no difficulty in that regard and I have requested the board to keep in close touch with me about the prospect of outside accommodation on a rental basis being provided for staff who might need or require such accommodation.  There should be no great difficulty in that regard either.</P>
    <P>Regarding the opening of the psychiatric unit, I do not accept at all the argument put forward by Deputy O'Hanlon that nothing should happen until the whole lot goes in <i>en bloc</i> and then you open the psychiatric beds in the hospital. I think there are about 33 psychiatric beds within the framework of the hospital.  In view of the large scale of the facilities at Beaumont I intend to commission the hospital on a phased basis and in this context I have decided to proceed with the opening of the new psychiatric unit in Beaumont immediately.  The plans of the EHB, which I am delighted to accept in spite of the appalling reaction from a psychiatric consultant who should know better &mdash; I was appalled I must confess and I am glad that his views were not accepted and were overwhelmingly rejected by the EHB &mdash; for a sectoralised psychiatric service for north-east Dublin include a psychiatric unit at Beaumont Hospital.  The new psychiatric unit will provide an in-patient service for the Dublin north-east catchment area and will form part of a comprehensive community <Col N="2270" /> oriented psychiatric service as outlined in the policy report &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The health board are prepared to co-operate in the early opening of the psychiatric unit.  This proposal has now been advised to the chairman of the Beaumont Hospital Board and I await the board's formal response.  I envisage that staffing and related issues associated with the commissioning of this facility will be subject to consultation between the health board and the hospital board and between both boards and the staff interests concerned.  I have asked that those discussions take place as a matter of urgency, and the full co-operation of my Department is assured.</P>
    <P>I have been asked by the board recently to give some additional staff to expedite the general commissioning and to assist in this work and have now given approval to the hospital board to appoint a personnel officer who in the first instance will act as commissioning officer for the opening of the new hospital, and that aspect will go ahead immediately.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the question of private hospitals generally because serious issues are involved.  Some Members of the House still wonder why I am so strongly opposed to the building of a new privately owned hospital on Beaumont site.  I want to outline the current position with particular reference to the three new privately owned hospitals coming on stream this year.</P>
    <P>First we have in Galway the Galvia private hospital which will open with about 40 beds on Easter Monday, although it will ultimately provide 65 beds.  The Deputies know that it is the Old Calvary hospital in Galway which was bought, refurbished and re-equipped by local medical practitioners backed by community hospitals who are an English based health care and private hospital development company with seven or eight hospitals in the UK, and of course local financial interests in Galway were involved.  This hospital will add no new beds to the overall total in the country, but it is of considerable interest to note that there seems to be plenty of <Col N="2271" /> money among such interests for such investment at a time when the health services are allegedly in such acute straits.</P>
    <P>The new Mater private hospital will provide a total of 156 beds, replacing a total of 146 private and semi-private beds in the existing Mater private and public hospitals.  The Blackrock privately owned clinic will also provide a total of 115 beds which in effect, are additions to the overall hospital bed stock in the country.</P>
    <P>The important point about those hospitals is that they are high cost, high technology centres and the average daily costs, including medical extras, are estimated to emerge in the region of £280 a day for private rooms and £240 for shared accommodation.  These charges are far in excess of the charges applying in the existing range of private hospitals the highest cost of which would be at the moment in the region of £100 a day. Therefore, the cost difference is enormous in terms of total annual expenditure. For instance, it is estimated that these two hospitals alone, the Mater and Blackrock, will generate an annual expenditure of about £20 million which is roughly one quarter of all claims made against the VHIB in 1984-85.  The cost of operating private hospitals of this nature is so great that it simply could not be accommodated within the premium structure supporting the existing B and C hospital plans offered by the VHIB.</P>
    <P>As Minister responsible for approving the various VHI schemes and in particular any increases in subscriptions for quite some time, I thought that it might prove absolutely impossible to devise a scheme to provide cover for these hospitals. Deputy O'Hanlon knows well that pressures on me and my Department to impose massive increases on VHI subscribers in 1986-87 to accommodate these hospitals were extreme.  I am proud to say to this House that I resisted them to the last in the public interest.  However, in the event, proposals were formulated to offer a new VHI hospital plan to accommodate them but at much higher premiums.  I approved these proposals <Col N="2272" /> and the details will be notified by the VHIB to their subscribers in the near future.  Indeed, there is still a real danger that the ordinary VHI subscription, even with the generous tax relief still available, could become prohibitive to the ordinary subscribing family should such hospitals proliferate.</P>
    <P>I mention all this simply to highlight my view that there is little, if any, further scope for the development of this type of high cost, privately owned hospital within the structure of our Irish health services. Otherwise the VHIB will go the way the PMPA and the ICI went.  As Minister for Health in the past three years I predicted that that could happen.  It did not happen and I have no doubt that it will not happen provided this House acts sensibly. Therefore, I am convinced that a proliferation of separate privately owned hospital facilities can only lead to a diminution in the level of services provided for public patients by the public hospitals and it will reduce the budgets of those public hospitals resulting in a two tier hospital service with all the inherent deterioration in the health services involved.</P>
    <P>I make those points in passing because they are of critical importance.  If Deputy O'Hanlon regards them as an outpouring of doctrinaire, socialist philosophy he has yet to learn a great deal about what socialism is all about.  That is the issue.</P>

    <P>I should like to emphasise that, with the other members of the Government, I am concerned that Beaumont Hospital should be commissioned at an early date. I cannot accept the Fianna Fáil motion. We have made significant progress in resolving the difficulties involved.  I do <Col N="2273" /> not want to see any party political confrontation on this issue.  Deputies on the north side of Dublin, and my self in the Custom House representing their best interests, can build on the progress made. I do not want any confrontation with consultants or nursing staff on this, despite all the propaganda, suspicions and emotions which hospitals give rise to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I seem to recall the Minister issuing a similar invitation to us to join him in July 1985 at the opening of Beaumont Hospital.  That month has gone but Beaumont remains closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since coming into office the Minister for Health has caused a great deal of concern to all those who are genuinely interested in promoting better care and facilities for the sick within our community. He has, unfortunately, made many disastrous decisions and presided over massive cutbacks in health services, including the withdrawal of treatment facilities for thousands of deserving <Col N="2274" /> cases, a reduction in the number of beds in hospitals all over the country resulting in the closing of complete wards and units and, of course, the closure of so many hospitals instanced by his recent announcement to close eight hospitals without having made any provision for alternative accommodation and care for those in need.  The extraordinary thing about the Minister is the apparent relish he shows for his actions which have caused heartbreak, dismay and distress to so many patients, their families and to the medical profession.</P>
    <P>Our motion calls on the Minister to open Beaumont Hospital and I have no doubt whatever that this issue is one of the greatest scandals that we have ever witnessed.  Beaumont Hospital would appear to have presented the Minister with the greatest challenge of all to behave in a most irresponsible manner. His irresponsibility has not only caused distress and hardship to the people needing hospital treatment, and to their families, but has also caused concern and distress to hospital management and to the medical and nursing professions.  On top of all that, the Minister is deliberately spending £1.5 million a year on maintaining an empty hospital that has to date cost almost £50 million to build, all in the pursuit of some ideological, or political motivation that one finds very difficult to understand or appreciate.</P>
    <P>Dublin city and county, with a population of more than one million people, is very badly served as far as hospitals are concerned but the north side is affected much more by having to depend mainly on a smaller number of older hospitals which have given excellent service to past generations.  However, during the past ten or 20 years these hospitals &mdash; the Richmond and Jervis Street &mdash; have deteriorated to such an extent that management, and the medical profession, are now working under severe handicaps and in dreadful conditions that would not be accepted anywhere else in Europe.  Most of the time the staff find themselves apologising to the patients, visitors and others who have <Col N="2275" /> come to the hospital.</P>
    <P>The saga of Beaumont has gone on for many years and the fact that it was to replace the existing Jervis Street and Richmond Hospitals meant that those two institutions were allowed to run down over the years with no effort made to improve the buildings or conditions in any way.  It is difficult to understand why any Minister should allow such a magnificent new hospital as Beaumont to remain unused, particularly after so much State money has been poured into it.  At present nobody appears to be quite sure What are the reasons the Minister now has.  We do know that he is still in confrontation with the medical profession.</P>
    <P>The Minister, firstly, reversed a decision of his predecessors to allow the building of a private hospital on the site and the only reason that he gave was that he could not allow public funds to be used for such a project.  The extraordinary thing about this argument was that the consultants had made it clear that they were anxious to build a private hospital on location and were prepared either to buy or lease the site, as the Minister preferred, and the cost of building would come totally from their own resources. This proposal, therefore, would not have cost the State one single penny and, indeed, to a layman appeared to have all the ingredients that would go to make up a first class hospital facility for private and public patients alike, which as I have said, is a very badly needed facility, particularly on the north side of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Beaumont is in the heart of my constituency and I am therefore only too well aware of how the local people feel about this terrible travesty that has been going on for far too long.  Does the Minister not realise that the total cost of the building to date has been borne by the taxpayer? It is morally wrong that this asset should be allowed go unutilised where there is such a heavy demand for the facility.</P>
    <P>The advantage of having a private hospital on location is very obvious as it would mean that consultants would be in the vicinity of the hospital for a longer period during the day.  That surely is in <Col N="2276" /> the interests of public patients in the hospital and in the management of the hospital.  It is not in the interests of the public patient that a consultant, if required urgently, is not available in Beaumont and could be, for example, operating in a private nursing home on the south side, in Rathgar, Dún Laoghaire, or wherever.  The time taken in getting back to Beaumont could be fatal and, certainly, in my view, does not lead to good management or to good medicine in the interests of the public patient as well as the general management of the hospital itself.</P>
    <P>I am aware that negotiations have been taking place recently between the private consultants and the Department on another proposal put forward by the Minister but, once again, that proposal does not appear to have mutual agreement. Meanwhile the magnificent Beaumont Hospital that could be a monument to Irish medicine is instead today a monument to the failure of the Minister for Health to come to terms with the requirements and needs of the people.  It seems that the Minister is grieved that Beaumont Hospital was ever built and credence to this would arise from a statement by the Minister reported in the issue of the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 1 December 1984 when he said that millions of pounds were wasted on Beaumont and was money ill spent.  That was a most extraordinary statement coming from a Labour Minister and one could be excused for thinking that the Minister's actions in refusing to open this hospital are tied up with his political opposition to this side of the House whose Leader decided to cut all the red tape when he was in office so that this urgently needed hospital could be provided at minimum cost and in the fastest time possible.</P>
    <P>It is now two years since the building of the hospital was completed.  To date the hospital has cost almost £50 million to build and interest charges in those two years since its completion on the capital outlay have been £1 million plus a further £1.5 million per year to maintain.  Interest charges, we are told, are continuing at <Col N="2277" /> £500,000 per year along with the everincreasing maintenance costs.  In the meantime, patients badly needing hospital attention are being forced to use overcrowded facilities elsewhere.  The consultants, I understand, are prepared to go into the hospital any time if the Minister would only honour the terms of the agreement entered into with them by his predecessors and his Department.  In recent negotiations there has been a willingness on their part to water down these terms in return for an acceptance of the right to build a hospital with beds in the future under a mutual agreement.  The Minister must know that in a complex such as Beaumont to extend the provision only for a clinic with no beds is not only unwise but is not fair either to the thousands of people living on the north side who would prefer to have the facility of private hospitalisation as is their right just as it is the right of many thousands of people living on the south side who have those facilities in a number of hospitals located there.</P>
    <P>Another very serious and reprehensible aspect of this whole unhappy situation is the fact that, even if the Minister were to reach agreement with the consultants, the hospital could not be opened in 1986. No arrangements have been made whatever for the ordering of basic technological equipment needed for the hospital and in recent replies to questions the Minister indicated that it could take at least ten months from the date of order before this equipment could be supplied and fitted in the hospital.</P>
    <P>Even more appalling is the fact that a further dispute looms ahead between the Minister, his Department and the Nurses' Organisation.  Here again the Minister refuses to acknowledge that a complex such as Beaumont should have any residential accommodation for nurses on duty or student nurses.  This is once again a more than strange decision in view of the size of the complex and the fact that in emergencies a number of nurses could be on call on site.</P>
    <P>Despite numerous representations from the Irish Nurses Organisation dating back to 1984, negotiations have not taken <Col N="2278" /> place between that organisation and the Minister or his Department.  It is very evident that experienced officials in the Minister's Department could not possibly fall into the trap of such gross inefficiency in failing to advise the Minister on the correct approaches that should be taken in this respect and one must therefore conclude that the reasons can only be put down to the actions of this Minister in adopting a complete and totally hostile attitude to Beaumont Hospital.</P>
    <P>A Government who allow their Minister to behave in such a draconian fashion must be indicted with him and it is an absolute disgrace that to date about £57 million of taxpayers money is being used as a weapon by the Minister in his private quarrels with the medical profession.  He tried earlier this year to act the bullyboy with them and some time ago even issued a statement threatening to remove funding from the Richmond Hospital thereby forcing that hospital into a situation where it might have to close down its present inadequate facilities to the public.</P>
    <P>The Minister has repeatedly put up the pretence of being interested in getting the best possible services for the poorer sectors of our community and using the funds available to his Department in the most appropriate ways.  He has shown scant regard for either in this whole unhappy episode.  We have the crazy situation also where the cost of a private room in a public hospital is more expensive than a room in one of our most exclusive private hospitals.  That is an attack on already hard pressed taxpayers who go to the trouble and expense of providing for their own accommodation in the event of future illness.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House in our motion call on the Minister to set the machinery in train immediately to open Beaumont Hospital without further delay as a general hospital, as originally envisaged. Any other form of provisional opening of, for example, a psychiatric section, in advance will not be in the better interests of the hospital and would obviously downgrade the hospital stature and attraction to medicine from the very <Col N="2279" /> outset.  The Minister may have the idea of facilitating an immediate transfer of Eastern Health Board patients from the Carlow mental hospital as a short term solution to his other difficulties.  This is not acceptable to Beaumont Hospital as it was never envisaged that it should cater for long term psychiatric patients.  It would create also serious difficulties and confusion between the hospital's own board and the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>The very large population in areas such as Coolock, Clontarf, Artane, Beaumont, Santry and so on have had to depend on only one major hospital on the north side and, due to scarcity of beds, many patients were not able to obtain necessary treatment for illness. They are entitled to better treatment and consideration.  This hospital which is intended to cater very much for their needs should even now, at this late stage, receive the priority it is entitled to.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment to our motion asking Dáil Éireann to approve of his efforts cannot be taken seriously and I would therefore urge the Government to re-consider their attitude to Beaumont Hospital and to commence the steps that are necessary now for its opening as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>This evening the Minister adopted a cynical attitude to this whole issue. Everyone was to blame except he.  He accused us of using this issue for political expediency.  That is not the case.  We are sincere in our efforts to have the hospital in operation as soon as possible.  This is in the interest of the people and for their benefit.  One would have thought that it would be for the benefit of the Minister also that this magnificent hospital should be opened as soon as possible.  There is no question of a loss of revenue to the State or to the Department in the event of the location at Beaumont of a private hospital.  The consultants were anxious to lease the site.</P>
    <P>These arguments which the Minister puts forward in a bizarre way are incomprehensible. He has not on any occasion given a single detail as to how the operation would have meant a loss of revenue <Col N="2280" /> to the State.  If there are grounds for such assertion, the Minister should tell us what they are.  Anything I have read in relation to this hospital in the past number of years would not indicate that there would be any loss of revenue by reason of accommodating the consultants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We must recognise first that the halcyon days of 1977 to 1980 are well and truly over and that promises made in those days when money was flowing freely and borrowing did not matter cannot be honoured always in the way indicated when the promises were made.  That is the economic reality of living in the mid eighties and the sooner we realise that is what must inform public decisions on spending the better.</P>
      <P>I can understand readily the sense of having private consultants on site at the Beaumont Hospital complex for as long as is possible in terms of feasibility, but where is the sense in building a second hospital side by side with one that has been built?  If one were to make such a proposal to some stranger, he would very likely regard it as ludicrous.  The abiding principle that must inform in relation to care for the sick is that scarce resources are used in the areas of greatest need. Plainly, that is not happening now.  We must realise that public patients face long delays, that there is a crying need for this facility to be opened.  The sooner we engage in genuine negotiations to open the hospital as a matter of urgency the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The delay is causing a huge waste of taxpayers' money.  I would estimate conservatively that in this context we are talking about £600,000 per month.  Meanwhile there is a crying need for health care on the north side.  We need better health care.  We need to eliminate waiting <Col N="2281" /> times for important medical operations. In my constituency where this hospital would be located, we need the boost to activity that it would bring.  I am unashamed in saying that.  It can help. We must now build on the co-operation which the Minister says now exists between the consultants and other members of the staff to ensure that this hospital is opened within the shortest possible time.  The Minister should now set a date for its opening.  He should recognise that there is a real cost of £600,000 per month to the taxpayer to have it idle.  He should be willing to offer every member of staff in the two hospitals a sum if they beat his target date.  I see the possibility of offering £250 to £300 across the board to every member of the staff to beat that date.  We must look at an idea like that. There will be other hitches if we just leave it to delayed negotiations.  We have heard that the nurses are not satisfied on one issue and I am sure there will be other members of the staff who will be dissatisfied on an issue.  For every month that the staff beat a reasonable target date there should be some recognition from the taxpayer that that is ground gained.</P>
    <P>I return to the abiding principle that must inform all our discussions about health spending, that is, that scarce medical resources must go to areas of greatest need.  That is not happening when a hospital stands idle.  The Minister and the people medically involved must recognise that.  I hope that a little charity and understanding will inform the discussions which will proceed and that the Minister's start to use this facility will quickly be followed by this badly needed hospital being in full use for the community of the north side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister for Health, I am quite aghast at his attitude to this issue.  Quite frankly, he appears to be glorifying the fact that he has a principle here that he will stick by through thick and thin, irrespective of the damage it is doing to the health <Col N="2282" /> services, of the sufferings caused, the disruption and the interruption of programmes. Irrespective of any scenario that emerges, the Minister is firm in his mind on a little personal hobbyhorse of his that this supersedes anything that might be said in this House or by any of the interest groups involved.  Coming from a Minister in an area so sensitive and important as the health services, that is very sad; coming from a Minister of the Labour Party, it is even sadder that he is prepared to cast aside what I presume was traditionally associated with his party &mdash; the care of all those misfortunate enough to need health care urgently and who in many cases cannot afford it.</P>
      <P>It was sad, over the last 12 months, to hear the Minister making public statements in relation to his position on this matter and paying no regard to the very urgent and vital needs obtaining on the north side of the city, making no reference to the part that this hospital plays and has been envisaged to play from the early seventies in the overall plan for the provision of hospital services throughout the city.  At all times the only emphasis comes in terms of cost to the taxpayer, by acceding to what was regarded in the seventies and even subsequent to the seventies&mdash;I might remind other speakers&mdash;as a very reasonable, logical plan to bring the best medical services available and the best standards to the people of the north side.  I make no apologies in this House for demanding that level of service and that standard.  It was regarded by the Minister's Department as being reasonable, feasible, logical and necessary in the early seventies; it is equally so today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again we come back to this question of cost.  Deputy Brady took up this issue and I also wish to take it up.  I do not know what the Minister is referring to when he talks about the enormous cost to the taxpayer if we were to accede to the plans designed and agreed to and into which so much care and attention, time and effort were put by his predecessors. I cannot see where the Minister has identified this phenomenal cost.  Has the <Col N="2283" /> Minister a bee in his bonnet about a certain sector of the health services and is he putting these arguments forward, spurious as they might be, without any validity or back-up of proof, in an effort to camouflage the bias which he has allowed to creep into his own vision of what he should do as Minister for Health?  I believe that that is the case.  If so, it is indeed a sad indictment of the Minister.</P>
    <P>This Private Members' motion put down by our party spokesman, Deputy O'Hanlon, states:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, concerned at the acute shortage of hospital beds in north Dublin, condemns the Government for its failure to open Beaumont Hospital and calls on the Government to arrange for its immediate opening.</P>
    <P>This is a very well reasoned but vitally urgent plea from that Deputy to the Minister here present and the Government immediately to make available for the people of north Dublin a hospital service&mdash;a level of hospital care that was not needed just today or yesterday, but a few years ago.  It is a sad reflection on any Government that a much needed facility, such as this 730 bed hospital unit at a cost of, to use the Minister's own figures, &ldquo;£50 million for the overburdened Irish taxpayer&rdquo;, should be left idle for over a year without any valid reason. It surely must rank as an unparalleled insult to the taxpayer and the public that such a huge investment should be left in mothballs solely on the basis of some vague ideological hang-up on the part of the Minister.  Whatever personal grounds he might have or whatever reasons he has worked out with such intransigence as being valid, sound and important to him, these must be put aside immediately in the interests of responsible administration of our health services.</P>
    <P>I know that this is not usually considered an appropriate time for tracing the history of the development of any programme.  Nevertheless, given the manner in which this project has been bungled at its latter stages, it is important that we should get the issue properly in <Col N="2284" /> perspective.  How did this hospital come to be in Beaumont in the first instance? It was part of a very thoroughly worked out plan.  In the early seventies, Mr. Corish was Minister for Health.  A programme of hospital provision for the entire Dublin region was deemed to be needed.  Rationalisation and updating of the health services were deemed urgent and should have been taken on board. There was in existence at that time within the Minister's Department a team of experts and planners, also those who could make projections as to the requirements right up to the nineties.  We had then, as now, old hospitals on the north and south sides that had not been modernised. The question was whether they should be modernised in the absence of an expanded programme.</P>
    <P>The decision was taken at that time that six hospitals should be built, three on the north side and three on the south side, to replace some of the older hospitals around the inner city.  These decisions were taken on the basis of thoroughly worked out research as to population projections and the need and level of health care requirements through the eighties and nineties.  There was not just an airyfairy approach to this.  There was a very professional approach and the plan was drawn up by 1977, according to my information, for a programme that would match the best level of medical and professional services and the best standards possible and feasible.  The three hospitals referred to on the north side were to be Blanchardstown, The Mater and Beaumont.</P>
    <P>When the then Minister, Mr. Corish, was asked in 1976 how long it would take for such a programme to be completed, he said that Beaumont would not be ready for upwards of 17 years.  However, in 1977 he was succeeded by Deputy Haughey as Minister for Health and he very quickly cut through the red tape and problems and efficiently and professionally took on the task of updating the hospital services.  What was earlier deemed to be a 17 year programme was cut to four years.  The target of four years <Col N="2285" /> was met because of the attention, care and concern for the increasing needs of northsiders for health care.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey's successor, Deputy Woods, helped to bring the plan to completion on target.  Looking at the attention and care given to this programme, it is sad that the Minister treats us with derision, sarcasm and cynicism with regard to the concerns we are legitimately voicing on behalf of all northsiders.  Originally the Minister took issue with the consultants and made the point that he was not prepared to spend taxpayers' money to give a facility to private consultants. However, when this plan was initially agreed it was on the basis of what was best for the people of the north side in terms of private and public care and how these needs could best be catered for.  It was decided that their needs could best be met in one complex.  Given that kind of attention and commitment to the development of that programme, it is sad that the Minister has seen fit, on the basis of some vague, ideological fantasy, to interrupt it and to bring it to a halt.</P>
    <P>It is public knowledge that there was agreement for the provision of a site at a commercial rate to enable consultants to build a private hospital within the complex. I am not aware of any strong public opposition in that regard from the north side or anywhere else.  The Minister, for reasons best known to himself, saw fit to initiate and promote a public debate on the issue.</P>
    <P>Lack of consultation is nothing new as far as this Minister is concerned.  On 6 December 1983 the Minister, in reply to a Dáil question from Deputy O'Hanlon, stated that the building of the nurses' home would commence around autumn 1984.  There was no indication that he intended to reconsider the position.  The Minister cannot now say that he and the Government were unaware of the financial position, given all the public statements which had been made over the preceding 12 months.  He has now reneged on a promise given and it is indicative of his refusal to consult, co-operate and to manage the affairs of the health services constructively, logically, positively <Col N="2286" /> and in the best interest of the public. The Minister should look at the serious rundown of medical facilities on the north side.  It is a terrible disservice by a Labour Minister to the urgent needs of the area. It is an indictment of his attitude and that of his Department&mdash;if they agree with him&mdash;to these needs.  The Minister spoke about costs but it does not make economic sense for him to procrastinate and to dig in his heels on this issue.  I call on him to be logical, reasonable, responsible and sensitive to the needs of the people.  He should open this hospital immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has shown a striking lack of sensitivity to the needs of the people on the north side of Dublin. He has been busy undermining the long established mix of public and private medicine which has been and will continue to be a valuable attribute of our health services.  This is the first element in regard to which we disagree with the Minister.  We believe that the mix which we have is our strength and the Minister knows quite well that when he looks at the costings in the different elements of the mix that in the voluntary and private hospitals he gets a keenness in cost which he will not find elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an acknowledged demand for the provision of private and semi-private facilities in this country.  We are used to being provided with these services and when my predecessor, Deputy Haughey, set about establishing that hospital he was thinking of the needs of the people of the northside as they perceived them.  He knows á lot more about their needs than the Minister and has shown greater sensitivity to their requirements.  I know that the people in Clontarf, Coolock, Raheny and Howth make demands for private and semi-private facilities as do the people in Dún Laoghaire and Dublin 4. The Minister should try his experiment somewhere else as we do not want it on the north side.  His theories are insensitive to the needs of the people on the north side and this is reflected in the fact that more than one million citizens opt <Col N="2287" /> for and contribute to the services provided under the voluntary health insurance scheme.  The Minister knows that this is also the trend in the UK and that many leaders of Labour organisations looked for private and semi-private facilities and joined BUPA.  They brought the managing director of our voluntary health insurance board over to run their organisation for them.  Let us look at what we have developed instead of trying to damage it.  People living on the north side have a right to the facilities enjoyed by those on the south side.  No expense to the taxpayer is involved in this case. The consultants from Jervis Street and the Richmond merely wanted a lease on a site of 1.3 acres but, because the Minister had his personal views&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>They could have provided consulting rooms and a private hospital. These consultants who have been providing services for the citizens of the north side for generations saw this as a desirable development and plans were well under way when the Coalition came into office at the end of 1982.  I was Minister for Health at that time and I had given an undertaking in writing that the site would be provided.  Negotiations on the lease were under way.  I say to the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The first element in the memorandum and articles of association of Jervis Street-Richmond Limited is to establish and operate on a non-profit making basis.  Of course, the Minister forgets all that.  He is prepared to provide and build the facilities and make them available otherwise in the general hospital at this stage &mdash; he was not initially. The board of Beaumont Hospital were happy with the arrangements; the consultants were happy; and the new hospital was handed over on target in July 1983, thereby meeting the target which the previous Minister, Deputy Haughey, had set in trying to get this hospital built quickly, <Col N="2288" /> accepting the most modern design available at the time, despite what the Minister has said here tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Minister take his medicine and squirm in his seat as he looks around to see what colleagues he has to support him tonight.  The old, dilapidated facilities at Jervis Street and the Richmond hospitals were soon to be discarded and the sick and infirm patients on the north side were to have the most modern hospital in the country with first class accident and emergency services. This is still lacking.</P>
      <P>Then came the dead hand of the Coalition Minister for Health as far as development in Beaumont was concerned, as well as every other fact of economic development.  That is why we have so many people unemployed.  He reneged on the agreements reached and publicly attempted to attack and vilify the consultants, those men and women, extremely well educated, who give their lives and services to this country.  We are fortunate to have available people of that calibre.  It is because of the Minister's predecessors that such people are working in this country and have not joined the brain drain to America or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Having failed to deliver on jobs or welfare nationally, the Minister for Health selected the consultants as the whipping boys.  That was his approach to the problem.  He tries to mislead people by talking about the costings of hospitals, referring to those being built for a very wealthy segment of the market.  The Minister knows that the cost in St. Vincent's Private Nursing Home is about £77 a day for a private bed.  He does not quote figures like that.  He quotes the figure of £250 which he got somewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not from somewhere. It is from the hospitals themselves. The Deputy has made five mistakes so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should try <Col N="2289" /> to control himself.  We are looking for similar facilities to those which exist on the south side.  There is a first-class example in St. Vincent's Hospital, with the private consulting rooms and the private hospital in the same grounds.  I am sure the Minister is very familiar with them. They are not talking about costs like that.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach supported him throughout because he needed the Minister for Health to cut back the services provided under the Health Estimates.  This he has done consistently in each year he has been there.  His arrogance in setting aside normal procedures for consultation and his consistent policy of centralised bureaucracy and authoritarianism have brought him into conflict with the health boards, voluntary and private hospitals and consultants.  What we are seeing tonight is one small facet of this Minister's misdoings.  The Minister neither understands nor cares for delegation.  He strives for the nationalisation of the health services on the same basis as in the UK.  Apparently it is not within his capacity to countenance or visualise systems other than those in the UK.  His constant striving to achieve this has brought him into conflict with sections of the health services.</P>
      <P>We know that the Taoiseach lost confidence in the Minister but could not move him away from Health where he has done so much damage.  He was very anxious to get rid of him but the House and the whole country know that even the Taoiseach was not able to do it.  Having at first used him very skilfully, he felt it was time to get rid of him.  He had done his Thatcherlike job on the health services &mdash; forget about the handicapped, the sick and infirm but whip up the public against the consultants who are making their contribution to the country.</P>

      <P>It was only by request. His own Taoiseach lost confidence in the Minister and now he is in a sort of limbo. He does not know what day they will get <Col N="2290" /> the courage to shift him somewhere else. Probably the sooner they do it the better for the health services and certainly for those who require health services on the north side of Dublin.  How can this House now vote confidence in his efforts?  All we are asking the Minister to do is get on with the job which he should have been doing from the beginning.  He has lost approximately three years by this stage and has cost the State a fortune.  What he has done is a public scandal.</P>
      <P>Various Members on both sides of the House have pointed tonight to the fact that each year's delay costs between £1.3 million and £1.5 million.  In the meantime the Richmond and St. Laurence's Hospital should have been sold off, which would have raised a couple of million. He has also lost the deal on Jervis Street Hospital because circumstances have changed and he will not do as well now as he would have done if he had gone ahead in the beginning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The handling of this matter is a public scandal.  The waste of public money and the delay in the provision of facilities should be inquired into.</P>
      <P>The Minister says he does not intend to provide nurse training facilities or a nurses' home on the site.  This is to be a major teaching hospital and the normal approach is to provide for first-year students on the site so that they become fully integrated with the hospital and its way of life.  That is why the nurses and others are looking for the facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 11 March <i>The Irish Times</i> carried the comments of two distinguished surgeons, Harold J. Browne and Patrick G. Collins, one working in Jervis Street and the other in St. Laurence's.  It was pointed out that, despite the modern advances in almost 21st century medicines, care of the dying, witnessing suffering, preparation of the dead for the mortuary remain arduous tasks.  The bonding together with mutual support at this early stage in their careers, particularly during stress, has been incorporated for many years in the <Col N="2291" /> training of Irish nurses and has made them outstanding the world over for their unique qualities of gentleness, enormous compassion and empathy towards sick people.  That is the kind of thing for which the Minister has no sensitivity.  He does not realise the damage he is doing and the value of what he has.  That has been the tragedy of this Minister's occupancy of his office and that is why the Taoiseach is anxious to get him out of there as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about the cost of the lease.  The site which is being spoken of amounts to approximately 1.3 acres and it cost approximately £24,000 in 1977.  The Minister has held up a hospital costing £62 million because of an argument over £24,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This puts matters into their proper context.  The purchase cost of the site was approximately £18,000 an acre. Because of the Minister's ideological hang-ups over amounts like this, he has acted in this way.  What does he offer to the people on the north side of Dublin? He proposes to turn this hospital into a psychiatric hospital so that he can conceal his embarrassment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Wrong again. Mistake number eight.  This is the greatest load of rubbish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>After three years delay he can go ahead and open the hospital.  This major, multi-discipline hospital is now to be opened for psychiatry.  We know that he does not have the equipment to open the hospital otherwise at this stage, but he wants to conceal his embarrassment by going ahead and giving the hospital at the outset the image of a psychiatric hospital.  Deputy R. Bruton said that the promises of the eighties are out of date now.  He is a north side Deputy.  For many years we were looking for a hospital on the north side and it was not until the present Fianna Fáil Leader came along that we got it.  If he had not gone ahead with the design at that time we would never have that hospital.  It has been available for three years but that crowd over there will not open it.  I am asking Deputy Bruton what kind of crowd is he associated with?</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton spoke about the consultants and said there is not much reason in our arguments.  In my experience, these consultants are reasonable and dedicated people and we are very lucky to have them.  Deputy Bruton should bring pressure to bear on the Minister to stop fooling about with the north side hospitals. Get this hospital open.  Deputy Bruton should get in behind the Taoiseach and get the Minister shifted out of there as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following regulations in draft&mdash;</P>
      <P>Health Contributions (Yearly Reckonable Income) (Variation) Regulations, 1986</P>
      <P>a copy of which regulations in draft was laid before the House on 27 February 1986.</P>
      <P>It is provided in sub-section (3) of section 9 of the Health Contributions Act, 1979, that the Minister for Health may, by regulations, vary the income ceiling up to which health contributions are payable.  Subsection 5 of section 9 of that Act provides that a draft of any such proposed regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.  It is not proposed to vary the rate figure which has remained at 1 per cent since 6 April 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The income ceiling is at present £13,000.  It is proposed to raise this to £14,000 with effect from the beginning of the next contribution year, namely, 6 April 1986.  In determining this, I have taken into account &mdash; as required by the Act &mdash; the latest information available regarding changes in the average earnings of workers in the transportable goods industries since the last income ceiling was adopted.  The latest recorded information on average weekly earnings in those industries relates to June 1985. Average weekly earnings in June 1985, were £173.94.  This represents an increase of 7.9 per cent on the June 1984 figure. When this is applied to the current ceiling of £13,000, a new ceiling of £14,027 or, say, £14,000 per annum, emerges.  The <Col N="2296" /> effect of the revised ceiling is to increase the maximum contribution payable from £130 to £140, an increase of £10 per annum.  The increase will be collected from most contributors towards the end of the 1986-87 contribution year, that is, in the first quarter of 1987.  While the total estimated annual additional yield is £2.1 million approximately, only about £195,000 extra will be realised in the current financial year ending on 31 December, 1986.  The balance of £1.905 million will come in the first quarter of 1987.</P>
    <P>Regarding the eligibility ceiling, I shall be reviewing shortly the income limit for free hospital consultants' services.  I am not in a position as yet to say what this limit will be.</P>
    <P>A total of £75.8 million was collected from health contributions in respect of the year ended 31 December 1985.  The vast majority of this was, of course, contributed by the PRSI workers and collected through the PAYE system.</P>
    <P>There is obviously more difficulty in collecting contributions from farmers and other self-employed where the contribution due is based on income assessments. It will be agreed that &mdash; from the viewpoint of equity alone &mdash; every effort should be made to ensure that the self-employed pay their fair share.</P>
    <P>Since 6 April 1984, the Revenue Commissioners have taken over responsibility for the collection of health contributions from farmers, in addition to their previous responsibility for collecting contributions from the PRSI workers and the self-employed.</P>
    <P>The only involvement on the health boards now in the collection arrangements relates to the collection of arrears due for periods up to 6 April 1984.  The total amount of health contributions owed to health boards at 31 July 1984 was £11.80 million.  This amount was reduced to £9 million at 31 December 1985.</P>
    <P>I am extremely anxious that these arrears should be collected and used to relieve some what the extremely tight budgetary situation in which the health boards now find themselves.  It is manifestly unfair that a situation should exist whereby persons who have reneged on <Col N="2297" /> their obligations in this regard should be able to obtain health services without penalty.  I advised health boards to make full use of every enforcement procedure available to them in the collection of outstanding amounts.  In fact, in recent months health boards have notified a number of defaulters of their intention to take legal action for the recovery of arrears.  Solicitors letters have issued and some boards have selected cases for proceedings if demands are not met.</P>
    <P>Members are aware that in 1984 I introduced a regulation whereby any person who, on admission to a public hospital bed, fails to produce evidence of current payment of health contributions is liable for an additional charge of £100.  So far 154 persons have had to meet this charge and I propose to amend this regulation shortly to increase this penalty to £150. I stress that persons in arrears are not refused admission to hospital but the collection of the admission charge and arrears is pursued later.</P>
    <P>As an added incentive to health boards to collect amounts outstanding, I introduced regulations in 1985, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, which allowed health boards retain in full, arrears of health contributions collected by them in 1985.  In the normal way these contributions would have been credited to the Exchequer.  A total of £1.4 million health contributions arrears was collected by the health boards in 1985.  I wish to announce that I am extending this arrangement to cover all outstanding health contributions arrears collected by health boards in 1986, 1987 and future years.  This decision will be of continuing benefit to the health boards' budgets.</P>
    <P>However, the purpose of the motion today is simply to raise the ceiling level or health contributions from the current figure of £13,000 to a new figure of £14,000.  I now ask the House to approve the regulations before it in draft form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>These regulations come before us each year.  In the current year the Minister is asking us to raise the ceiling level of income for contributions by £1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2298" /> He has not stated what the income will be for eligibility for service.  Is there any reason why, when he circulates these regulations, he does not announce what the figure for eligibility for service will be?</P>
    <P>There are a few points I would like to raise.  First, when will the Minister announce the income level for eligibility for service?  The second deals with the collection of the health contributions, particularly in relation to the farming community.  There has never been a satisfactory method of assessing farmers' incomes.  No sooner was one method beginning to show results but the Government of the day changed that method.  I acknowledge that the poor law valuation was not fair, and a court case abolished the PLV as a means of assessing farmers' incomes.  Then farmers, like other self-employed persons, were obliged to submit accounts.  The health boards assessed farmers on the basis of an estimated figure, without having an accurate figure to work on.</P>
    <P>A number of farmers produced books and appealed the figure assessed.  An agreement was reached with the health board as to what their health contribution should be.  Those farmers who did not keep books &mdash; many of them because they could not afford it &mdash; received an estimated income.  Some of them did not pay in the relevant year and now are getting letters from the health boards telling them they will be prosecuted within 14 days if they do not make the payments.</P>
    <P>A number of small farmers have general medical service cards and these farmers have received demands from the local health board for the health contributions which they are not required to pay. A proper record has never been kept of farmers who are not liable to pay health contributions because they have general medical cards.  That is a point we have raised in the House on a number of occasions. Yet nothing has been done about it.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of farmers who made returns to the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;I am talking now about the <Col N="2299" /> years preceding 1985-86 when the health boards were collecting the health contributions on behalf of the central Exchequer &mdash; who received a demand from the Revenue Commissioners and another from the health board.  They did not know where they stood in regard to their eligibility. It is for these reasons that arrears have accumulated amongst the farming community.  In fairness to them a certain proportion of the blame must lie with the administrators who allowed these anomalies to obtain in the manner of collecting contributions.</P>
    <P>Now we have a land tax.  While health contributions up to the year 1985 were the responsibility of the health boards, the health boards are now making an effort to collect arrears which they are entitled to put to their own accounts.  As the Minister said there were arrears of £11 million of which they have collected approximately £2 million to date.  For instance, perhaps the Minister would say what method was used by the Revenue Commissioners last year to assess farmers' incomes?  How much money was collected?  What method is being employed in view of the fact that the majority of farmers no longer have to submit accounts to the Revenue Commissioners, their tax being collected by way of a land tax?  What is the position in relation to that land tax?</P>
    <P>The other point I should like to raise is the whole question of the assessment of income of farmers.  Currently farm incomes are assessed in a number of ways, there being no uniformity about the manner of assessment.  For example, the Department of Social Welfare assess farmers' incomes for pensions.  The Department of Health community welfare officers assess them for medical cards and eligibility for other health services. Then the Department of the Environment, through the local authorities, assess them for eligibility for education grants.  Finally the Department of Finance have their way of assessing them. This lack of uniformity has been raised in the House before.  I know the Minister does not have prime responsibility for <Col N="2300" /> collecting tax.  Up to recently he was Minister for Social Welfare also and between the two Departments they absorbed 45 per cent of the annual budget.  Because of the cost of the health services on the Exchequer the Minister would have a major input into ensuring some uniformity in the method of assessment of farm incomes where necessary in regard to any State benefit.</P>
    <P>Each year we continue to raise the level of income for contributions while at the same time reducing the level of service, thereby creating another anomaly.  The level of service has been curtailed.  The amount of money allocated in real terms to the health services has been reduced on the Minister's own admission in answer to questions in the House.  On 5 March, in answering questions, the Minister said that the measures taken to reduce expenditure on health services for 1985 related largely to institutional services.  He listed the measures included: the non-filling of a substantial number of vacancies, reduced employment of locums, reduction on expenditure on pay extras such as overtime and on-call allowances, tightening of budget levels in relation to drugs, medicines, consumables, travel, energy and so on; the temporary closure of wards and the designation of a number of wards as five day-wards.  That had to lead to a very real reduction in the level of service on the hospital side.</P>
    <P>On the community side there has been an even more dramatic reduction in certain community care areas, including, in our own constituency, a Cheann Comhairle, where there is now practically no dental service or optical service for adults.  It is worth making the point that, at a time when the level of service is being reduced, we have regulations before us here requesting that we increase the amount each worker will pay towards health contributions.</P>
    <P>These regulations come before us each year.  While we are not opposing them the Minister might tell us why we are not told at this stage the level of income for eligibility for services.  Will he say when he will be in a position to announce that?</P>
    <Col N="2301" />
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement this evening, especially that he is extending the arrangement whereby health boards will be allowed to retain any unpaid contributions in 1986. This will be of some help to health boards.  I am a member of a health board with a deficit at present of £5 million.  We are being told of the major cutbacks that will have to be effected in coming months to overcome our problem.  Therefore, the Minister's announcement this evening will mean some small easement.</P>
      <P>Health boards have become inefficient, over-administered, badly-managed devourers of public moneys.  Health costs us £1¼ billion at present, of which £682 million goes into the hospital service. Having been a member of a health board since July last, I have endeavoured to learn as much as I can about the system.  One thing that has appalled me is the lack of cost control within hospitals, with £682 million of public money being spent in hospitals annually and with very little control on the way that money is expended.</P>
      <P>For example, there are no real controls over departments in our major hospitals. If I ask a programme manager on a health board what departments of a particular hospital are efficient or inefficient, I cannot be told.  There are no controls on cost unit efficiency per patient.  Neither can we pinpoint efficient or inefficient consultants or whether diagnostic tests are carried out in an efficient manner. Until such time as we tighten up hospital spending we will continue to have appalling debts.  This is something the Department of Health should examine immediately because, between the spending on hospitals and administration costs, we find ourselves in a very difficult position.  The people who rightly clamour for taxation cuts cannot be catered for until we get our spending in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admire the Minister in his attempts to get this whole sector in order.  I disagree with him on certain issues.  But on this one he is opening a hornet's nest.  He is committing political suicide in taking on some of the most powerful groups within the State.  We have seen the teeth <Col N="2302" /> of these people in recent times when they have attempted to embarrass the Minister and to challenge him at every opportunity because their cosy, lucrative positions and performance have been called into question, and it is about time.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I ask the Minister this evening to continue with the work on which he has started out in bringing this whole £682 million monster under control.  I wish him well.  As I said, he has been criticised by certain people who perhaps are making fortunes out of the health service, who are paid a salary by the Department of Health and who at the same time in tandem with that are pursuing a private practice.  We talk about morality. This is an area where the morality of this whole practice must be called into question.  I go to hospitals quite often to see what is happening there and to try to learn as much as I can about the situation, and I am appalled at what I find in outpatient clinics.  Maybe a dozen or two dozen people are called for appointment at the one time and are herded into waiting rooms because they are public health patients.  Maybe a junior doctor is waiting to see the patients when they are expecting to see a consultant.  Contrast that with the private practice being pursued by the consultants in another area.  It is immoral and the Minister is quite rightly trying to bring these costs under control and is suffering politically for it.  Some consultants who are making huge fortunes in this area are demanding more and more up-to-date facilities.  We see it every day in the Munster region and in all the regions.  They are looking for more and more facilities and at the same time taking as much as they can out of the system.  That must be stopped.</P>
    <P>One thing that puzzles me at times relates to the health contributions.  I am not here to defend the farmer, but when he puts a case to me which I think is reasonable I feel that I should follow it up.  I ask the Minister to explain how he levies the charge on a farmer.  I cannot understand why a farmer cannot take some of his justifiable expenses off his income and why he cannot be assessed on his net income rather than as at <Col N="2303" /> present, as I have been told, on his gross income.  There is something wrong about that and I would like the Minister to explain in more detail how the assessments are arrived at.  I know a number of people who are willing to pay their way in other areas but this demand upsets them, and they are people who are not easily upset.  I would like the Minister to explain how the assessments are arrived at.</P>
    <P>I ask him also to tell us how much is owed by the consultants in hospitals.  I was at a health board meeting in the past few days where the question of outstanding payments from consultants to the Department of Health came up and £3 million was mentioned as the figure the consultants owed to the Department of Health for the use of public facilities in hospitals and were refusing to pay.  The case they put forward was that they are paying 10 per cent and sometimes 15 per cent of their salary already for the use of the hospital equipment.  I would like the Minister to set the record straight here so that we can at least know what we are dealing with.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister if any assessment has been done on the level of private practice in our publicly funded hospitals.  In other words, what are the consultants taking out of our public hospitals by way of private practice?  I ask the Minister to give his opinion.  I have an opinion that where a consultant operates a private practice and is an employee of the Department of Health, there is a conflict of interest within the hospital.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on this.</P>
    <P>Otherwise I welcome this regulation and I await with interest the Minister's response.  This is a huge problem area which is labour intensive, finance intensive and full of inefficiencies and irregularities. I would like to put on record my support for many of the things the Minister is trying to do and being much maligned for doing them by the vested interests within the health system.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to ask the Minister on a parochial level about a cancer treatment unit in the regional hospital, Cork.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2304" /> There have been justifiable demands for updating the facilities there.  I ask the Minister to update us on his present attitude towards the provision of equipment for the cancer treatment unit in the regional hospital which has caused serious public concern in the Cork region because of statements made by both medical and lay people in recent times.  I ask the Minister to respond to this.  I know it is a question of money in an area where money is short, but people's fears have been aroused.  I have had many letters from cancer sufferers who are very upset by some of the statements that have been made publicly and in fairness to these people the record should be set straight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Allen and I was amazed at his uncaring approach and his attack on both the consultants and the Southern Health Board.  Consider a body who have a deficit of £5 million because the Government have not given them the funds necessary to make them viable and then think of the state of our hospitals in the SHB area with the closure of wards in many of our modern hospitals such as the orthopaedic hospital in Cork and in the regional hospitals.  I did not intend to go down this road, but I have been brought into doing so.  I intended to make a short contribution on the self-employed in respect of the farming community and the payment of levies but now I am brought into this area.  Like Deputy Allen I visit the regional hospital regularly and I visit also the Mater general hospital, the orthopaedic and some of the other health board hospitals and I have nothing but praise for the medical people, the nursing profession and the administrative staff in those hospitals and in the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>He talked about efficiency and that type of thing.  Efficiency is one thing but when you talk about <Col N="2305" /> efficiency in health you are talking about a very sensitive area.  People are entitled to a service.  We budget fairly heavily for that but there is more inefficiency in the hospital service now than there was heretofore because of the cutbacks.  Now we see wards where extra beds must be provided because of the closure of other wards.  This is a fact of life and it is creating greater inefficiency within the hospital service than we had heretofore when we had full hospitals with all wards in use.  Perhaps we should look at this again, but it is wrong to give the health boards the kind of condemnation they have received here this evening.</P>
      <P>I would like to talk about hip replacements. Recently a family called to me seeking assistance in getting a hip replacement for their father.  They were told that their father would have to join the long queue.  That poor family had to come up with £450 for that operation.  I have nothing but praise for the family concerned but their father should be entitled to the operation without delay. It is wrong that such a person should have to wait three or four months.  A constituent who approached me about a knee operation told me that he had been waiting from the middle of last year for it.  I accept it is expensive to have a knee replacement but people should not have to wait so long.</P>
      <P>At the same time that we have people waiting a long time for such operations private consultants are being condemned. Some people forget that such consultants help the health boards, the Department and the State by providing a service.  They should be commended rather than criticised.  Many consultants have spent a long time at college and travelling around the world gaining knowledge about different operations. When they return to Ireland at the age of about 35 or 38 they do not have much money.  They are the people who carry out major operations in our hospitals and we should praise rather than criticise them.  If an anomaly exists it should be corrected without criticising people in public.  The public are getting an erroneous view of consultants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2306" /> I am concerned about the collection of levies.  That system is a shambles because of the dispute that has gone on for many years, particularly in regard to the way the self employed are assessed.  Huge bills are being posted out and many people have received solicitors' letters and threats. The farming community, particularly small farmers, are suffering most.  Many of them will never have a taxable income but they are being asked to fork out huge sums of money at a time when they are finding it difficult to rear a family.  Those people do not know how to deal with such problems and must approach their local representative.  However, some of them do not know how to appeal against such demands and I am concerned about them.</P>
    <P>The main complaint farmers have about the health contribution and the youth employment levy is that they are not allowed to deduct capital allowances when arriving at an income base for the purpose of calculating health contributions. That anomaly must be corrected.  I received numerous representations from farming organisations about this matter. They are being discriminated against compared with other sectors.  Many farmers have invested heavily in buildings, fencing and land reclamation and they are penalised for carrying out that work.</P>
    <P>I am not objecting to farmers being asked to pay a health contribution but it is unfair that they are asked to pay the levies on a basis different from other sectors in the economy.  I accept that other self employed people pay levies on the same basis as farmers but the capital they are required to invest in their business is lower in many cases.  For example, a businessman may require a cash register and that would cost a small amount of money.  The Minister should remove this anomaly once and for all and farmers should be asked to pay the levies on the same basis as other sectors in the economy. The current system of assessment is inequitable and does not make economic sense.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the need for a cancer treatment unit in Cork.  It appears <Col N="2307" /> that there has been a breakdown in communications between the Minister and the health board.  It is important that our hospitals have the most up-to-date equipment.  We are all aware that after three or four years cars have to be replaced and the same should apply to plant in hospitals.  The treatment plant transferred from St. Agatha's in St Finbarr's Hospital to the regional hospital is out of date.  The section of the community who suffer most because the plant is not up to date are those who can ill afford to pay.  A person with money can get the treatment on demand in London.  The people of Munster should not be deprived of that treatment in the Cork Regional Hospital.  On behalf of the people of Cork, Kerry, Waterford and Tipperary I appeal to the Minister to assist the health board and the medical profession in regard to this plant rather than confronting them.</P>
    <P>Health is a very sensitive area and the health of our people must be our first priority.  I accept that costings must be taken into consideration but we should not emphasise them too much.  I shall continue to make an issue of this at every opportunity although I must admit that to date I have made little progress.  Those who do not see any hope of the equipment being provided become disillusioned while those fortunate enough to have the money do not have to go on the waiting list or avail of outdated equipment but can take the first flight to London, have the treatment over three days and their life span greatly extended. The provision of that equipment should be a priority.  The Minister should also deal with the anomaly in regard to assessment of farmers because we are the only country in the EC that operates this system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the proposals outlined by the Minister.  However, serious problems exist in a number of areas.  Those who have contributed to the debate have highlighted the problem of self assessment for farmers.  I am aware that bills for two years, amounting to <Col N="2308" /> £327, were sent to an individual in my constituency.  The income of that person from his small farm was £2,000 per year with the result that he was liable for £40 each year, £20 for his health contribution and £20 for the youth employment levy. The individual concerned was assessed for £327.  That is an example of a large discrepancy.  I do not accept that the original assessments sent out by the Revenue Commissioners are proper assessments.  I say this because of the overall way that Revenue work.  A few months ago I had the opportunity of asking the chairman of a representation from the commissioners, during a meeting of the Committee on Public Expenditure, what the assessments amounted to and what percentage of the assessments sent out represented the gross income of firms.  The commissioners accepted that they send out assessments that are much higher than the actual amounts on which there is liability for tax.  When we take that into account and bear in mind also that the 1 per cent levy is based on those assessments, we must realise that we are operating an unfair system and that something needs to be done radically to rectify matters as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>We all realise that there are cutbacks in some areas but in some areas also services are inefficient.  With respect to the health boards and to the professional and nursing staffs of the hospitals it is fair to say that there is a certain discrimination in so far as some people who earn huge amounts of money are availing of the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entire health services represent a cost of £400 per annum in respect of every man, woman and child in the community. Services in some areas may not be adequate.  It may be that sometimes a person needs to go outside the State for the treatment he requires but the point is that the health services we are providing are costing £400 per head of the population. Surely we cannot increase that cost expecially when there is a diminishing number of taxpayers.  We all realise that if the services generally were administered more adequately from the top down we would probably have a more efficient service, <Col N="2309" /> thereby saving a lot of money.  I am a member of a health board that is one of the most efficient, if not the most efficient, in the country in so far as capital expenditure is concerned.  That health board have been conscious always of the need to obtain the best value possible for the taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>Though they do not care for people generally in the lower income groups I was amazed to hear at a meeting of the Committee on Public Expenditure yesterday that people operating private hospitals and nursing homes can provide a service at very much less than similar services are provided publicly.  I was amazed, too, to hear that the people involved in this area of private hospitals and nursing homes are not consulted by the Department.  We were given examples of some reports that had been produced in recent times.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a health service that will cost less we must harness all the expertise available both in the private and public areas of health care.  The views of all involved in health care should be taken into consideration at all times in regard to any report that the Department may be commissioning in an attempt to ascertain where improvements might be made in the service and savings effected. Each of us here, as well as anyone who is a member of a health board, has a duty to save the taxpayer money in so far as possible.  A bed in a private hospital costs about £110 per week while in a public hospital the cost is about £150 per week. In the various areas in which I am involved I will be doing everything possible to ensure that adequate services are provided and that where services are already more than adequate, cutbacks will be effected.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker referred to the unsatisfactory situation of calling a large number of people to a casualty unit at the same time.  This could mean that a patient arriving at 2 o'clock would not be seen until 4 or 5 o'clock.  We had a discussion recently in the North-Eastern Health Board in this regard in the context of Navan Hospital.  It was interesting to learn that at weekends the numbers of <Col N="2310" /> people presenting themselves at casualty are much higher than the numbers attending such units during the week.  It was interesting also to learn that when there was a small service charge for treatment at a casualty unit, the attendance was between 35 to 40 per cent less than is the case now.  Equally, if there was a fee in respect of visits to a GP, people might not avail of that service as often as happens in some cases now.  In any event, we should consider imposing a charge in respect of prescriptions.  In many instances much of the medicine prescribed is not used.  The imposition of a prescription fee would help to eliminate such wastage. Measures such as that must be considered if we are to reduce the <i>per capita</i> cost of the health services.  There is waste right across the board in the services we are providing.</P>
    <P>Over the years we have provided excellent services which as a country we were not able to afford in many cases.  We have come to the cross-roads and we should only provide services for which the taxpayer can pay.  We must be realistic about this.  Those who are paying 58p in the £ are sick and tired of doing so because they are the very people who must also pay voluntary health contributions for all the health services needed by themselves and their families.  I must compliment the Minister in taking very tough decisions, even though the Opposition may not agree fully with some of them.  They might find themselves in the position of having to take such decisions.  If psychiatric care can be given to people in their own homes that is the proper way to care for these people and I compliment the Minister on his proposal in this regard.</P>
    <P>Since our discussions last year on this subject we have had a very comprehensive and up-to-date report and legislation as regards nursing homes and we are all grateful for these measures.  It had been brought to the notice not only of the Department of Health but of the different health boards &mdash; and also there were reports on the radio &mdash; that some patients in nursing homes were not being treated as they should.  One cannot condone that.  A stop was put to people <Col N="2311" /> taking money from unfortunate individuals whose families were hard pressed to keep them in the homes while at the same time a subvention was being paid from the Department of Health in the region of £42 per week.  Despite those payments, the patients were not getting proper care in those homes, but we have now taken a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I come back to the area of self-assessment of farmers.  A decision must be made with regard to the introduction of the land tax for those with an acreage of under 80 adjusted acres.  How will these people be assessed for health contributions? People should be let know what they will be paying and in what manner. When asked about self-assessment, the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners told the Committee on Public Expenditure that the assessments were relatively high to get people to react.  This was the case when the accounts for the previous year were not forwarded to the Revenue Commissioners.  As I said earlier, a person with three years' arrears of £327 was assessed for £80 because his land was set and his income was receipted.  When bills at a higher level are sent to farmers they become alarmed, but a large percentage decided they did not have to pay that amount and as a result arrears accumulated over two or three years.  It came to the point where there were arrears of £11.8 million due to the health boards at 31 July 1984.  It is nice to note some small improvement in that situation.</P>
    <P>The assessment system is inadequate and must be changed radically.  I am amazed that nobody, either from the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Health, tackled this problem on the basis of accepting a reasonable valuation.  If that had been done, a large amount of those arrears of £11.8 million would now have been paid, instead of the health boards going short. I am glad that the amount collected may now be kept by the health boards for use in the health care area.  In all negotiations taking place with regard to the updating of the health services the views of the experts, both private and public, should <Col N="2312" /> be taken into consideration.  By arriving at a synopsis of all the opinions, a large saving of taxpayers' money will be possible. At present the cost is £100 per head.  The Committee on Public Expenditure will help all they can in highlighting areas that need to be looked at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter of the health contribution has been under discussion for a number of years but it is just another aspect of the crazy <i>ad hoc</i> taxation system with which successive Governments have lumbered the people.  Whether we call them youth contributions, youth employment levies or income levies, they are nothing more than a part of an ill-thought out taxation system.  The 1 per cent income levy has, happily, now been abolished but all these levies have had their own peculiar inequities.  The 1 per cent health contribution is taken from gross income and takes no account of tax allowances.  It ceases to apply to incomes which reach £13,000 per annum.  It is proposed that this figure be £14,000 for the year ahead.  This raises further inequities. The measure bears down more heavily on those whose salaries reach only the health contribution ceiling.  It is more lenient on those over that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that people over the health contribution ceiling do not enjoy the same hospital benefits.  The health contribution also highlights inequities between different sectors of the community because there is a serious problem in some parts of the country in regard to the farming community due to the nature of the tax system.  This is not the fault of farmers.  They have been seeking to have depreciation taken into account in assessing their liabilities.  The Progressive Democrats maintain that inequity and blatant injustice between different taxpayers is at the root of the very serious national unease which exists regarding taxation.  My party are currently preparing a comprehensive policy on taxation. We will be seeking to get away from income levies and to propose an equitable taxation system which will treat all sections of the community fairly and provide a basis of taxation which will do away <Col N="2313" /> with the need for any more ill thought out, impromptu tax measures to fill occasional gaps in revenue.</P>
    <P>I support my colleagues in Cork in relation to cancer treatment.  I do not think a week passes without my having consultations with the Minister in regard to this acute problem in Cork and the Munster area.  The Minister is aware that many patients are referred to St. Vincent's Hospital but I understand that that hospital will no longer take patients from the Munster area.  I am sure the Minister appreciates the problem and anxiety caused to people suffering from cancer. We met the Minister on a number of occasions in relation to this matter and something must now be done about cancer treatment in Munster.  The Minister is also aware of the hundreds of people who go around the country collecting funds to help to provide equipment in Cork Regional Hospital.  A sum in the region of £200,000 has been collected and it is not asking too much of the Department of Health to make a contribution and to give recognition to these voluntary workers who are prepared to continue their work to ensure that the necessary facilities are provided in this hospital.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say too much on this subject because it will cause alarm to those unfortunate people who are being referred to the regional hospital for treatment. The Minister should recognise the tremendous dedication of people who are trying to provide a service which the State should be providing.  We have been trying for two years to raise sufficient money for this treatment.  The doctor in charge of the cancer unit is dedicated to his patients but it is appalling that the hospital in Cork which covers the Munster area does not have proper equipment for treating cancer.  I make a very special appeal to the Minister to provide the necessary equipment at the Regional Hospital Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with five or six points as briefly as possible.  Deputy O'Hanlon raised the question of problems regarding <Col N="2314" /> collections from the farming community and there is no doubt that there have been many problems in that regard.  Some years ago farming organisations advised their members not to pay any contributions but thankfully that policy was changed and they have now recommended, particularly in relation to arrears, that farmers should clear their arrears.  A large number have attempted to do so. Deputy O'Hanlon asked about the extent of revenue collection and the amounts involved.  I do not have information regarding the amounts collected since the change over of the system but I will try to obtain the data and forward it to him.</P>
      <P>The collection of health contributions and the levies under the land tax is under consideration at present but no final decision has been taken in that regard.  However, such a decision may be expected shortly in relation to the procedure to be adopted under the land tax for health contributions and the levies.  I note that many Members referred to the farming community but, in many respects, it is irrelevant because, for all practical purposes, the collection from the farming community is too small to be relevant.  In 1983 insured persons were contributing £62.5 million in health contributions but the farming community paid £700,000.  It would take that amount to run a fair sized hospital for a few days.</P>

    <P>In 1984, as a result of a major effort, health contributions for insured persons went to £65.8 million and the farming community paid about £2.3 million which is still a very small figure in terms of health services provided.  The following year we had the change over and in 1985 health contributions from the insured population went up to £73.2 million and down to £1.6 million from the farming community.  The relativity is almost an irrelevancy in terms of contributions. That was last year.  I hope there may be some improvement in 1986.  I do not know.  It depends in large measure on the extent to which the land tax measures are introduced and effectively deployed.  For all practical purposes the average of £1.5 million per annum from the whole of the farming sector has to be contrasted with <Col N="2315" /> the total expenditure on the health services of £1,276 million.  It is not even half of one per cent.</P>
    <P>The PAYE sector are the people paying the contributions.  In 1983 when I became Minister the amount contributed was £62 million and this year I estimate to get in £75 million, a substantial increase from a declining labour force with higher earnings.  Everybody pays, including myself, up to £13,000 last year.  I congratulate the Deputy opposite who is, I think, the only voluntary contributor in the House.  I also pay another 6.5 per cent on my income.  By the time I have finished paying my contributions and six per cent Oireachtas pension as well, there is a fair slice taken.  The ordinary insured worker is the person paying health contributions.</P>
    <P>We have a lot of political guff about things like capital allowances.  Not only do farmers not pay for the most part but they want capital allowances added in terms of an exemption.  It is a joke. Deputy O'Keeffe raised the question of capital allowances.  On the new factual assessment basis farmers' income is determined on the same basis as that of every other self-employed person.  Profits from farming are subject to health contributions. Farmers pay health contributions after deducting rent, rates, wages paid, repairs to machinery and equipment &mdash; one can always find a few dockets for that one &mdash; and if the farmer is stuck he can purchase seeds and fertiliser and charge all that against profits.  To that can be added business interest and stock relief.  After all that there might be a profit figure and a farmer might pay his health contributions on that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, if a farmer is feeling fairly desperate about his spouse and his unfortunate children he might decide to take out substantial superannuation and charge that also against the profits.  We do not allow the capital side.  There are serious suggestions <Col N="2316" /> in terms of health contributions that if somebody puts up a couple of hundred yards of fencing it could be charged against profit and he would pay virtually no health contribution at all.  He could put in roadways to the holding yards, or become involved in drainage and land reclamation.  In the end the nett effect of all that would be that I would be giving health contributions.  I would have to give them a net payment of a refund of a notional health contribution.  This proposal for capital allowances in terms of health contributions is something which cannot be considered because there is no good reason why an exception should be made for the farming community who, for the most part, do not pay health contributions.</P>
      <P>Lest we get carried away with the health contributions by insured persons, the figure to the end of this year will probably be about £78 million, representing only about 5 per cent of total health expenditure.  Health expenditure is paid for out of ordinary income tax, VAT, excise duty and the bit of corporation profits tax we get.  By and large people do not pay for health as such.  God be with the days when we had many and vigorous arguments about health charges at local authority level.  All that is gone now and it is all moved to the central Exchequer and placed on the shoulders of one or two Ministers who will be pilloried for the rest of their lives because there is nowhere else to come to get the money. Nobody pays for anything and nobody wants to pay for anything.  That is the experience one has in Government or in Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of private nursing homes was raised by Deputy Farrelly.  There was a lot of raiméis on the early RTE news about the Minister for Health not consulting with private nursing homes and private hospitals about their role in the health services.  The Committee on Public Expenditure, with profound respect to them, swallowed a lot of guff in that regard.  The only relationship between my Department and such facilities is that we sanction the rate of increase in subscribers' premiums to the VHI and <Col N="2317" /> we give approval for new schemes.  That is our function.  We also give approval to the health boards to pay certain subsidies to certain nursing homes where they provide beds for the health board for geriatric care.  Apart from that we have no role whatever.  These facilities are privately funded, privately owned, the staff are privately employed.  Their accounts are not sent to the Department of Health and if we were to ask for them we would be told to go and get ideologically knotted and mind our own business because they regard themselves as very private within the system.  Their admissions and their discharge policies and their consultant staffing policies are privately determined.</P>

      <P>Everybody in this country wants to run a nursing home provided the health board will pay for the <Col N="2318" /> beds on a subsidised basis.  It is quite easy to run a very good nursing home if the health board will subsidise all the beds. That is the degree of consultation some people require.  I want to bury that one, just as tonight we had a lot of political guff in relation to the north side of Dublin.  I would point out that there are 365 private beds on the north side of the city.  This unfortunate segment north of the Liffey whose population is so desperately deprived of private hospitals that they have to build another one, have 365 private beds.</P>

      <P>There are so many hospitals in Cork that you would have a nervous breakdown if you tried to make up your mind which of them to go into. There are a couple of thousand private beds in Cork.  The debate strayed somewhat in regard to the point made by Deputy Allen and, to some extent, Deputies Wyse and O'Keeffe.  It related to cancer treatment services in the Cork area.  I have taken careful note of what has been said and I assure the Deputies that I will be taking steps to deal with the situation as a matter of urgency.  I want to expand the services throughout the country on a rational basis.  I have some work to do in regard to the Cork Regional Hospital and I will be making a number of decisions in that respect.  I will consult with the health board, and I do not want it to become another political football. Health is bad enough but when politicians start messing around with cancer, God help the people of Ireland.  Politicians would make a real dog's dinner of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon spoke of the Category 2 limit of £13,500.  This is being reviewed and it will be increased with effect from 1 June 1986.  Taken into account will be the income from 5 April this year.  Through information from the Revenue Commissioners and with the approval of the Minister for Finance I will get a fix on the precise figure.  It is not possible for me to state now what the new limit will be, but it will be in line <Col N="2319" /> with usual developments in this area.  I am as anxious as the Deputies to ensure that persons in Category 2 will be looked after.  I, too, have a hospital services card as a fully paid up voluntary contributor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be occasions on which a change of format would be justified.  The notes would form part of a statutory document which must be filed in the Companies Registration Office.  A company might change radically its type of business and decide to have a different format.  A company might be taken over by another company which was using a different format.  In such cases a change in the format would be logical on a company basis or a consolidated accounts basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The actual format of the account, whether it is balancing or profit or loss account, is hesitational in its effect and once the comparisons can be made there is no difficulty in a changeover period.  It is of no great significance, it is primarily a matter of presentation. The content of the accounts under one formula or the other would be the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>All I want to establish for practising accountants is that should they decide to change the format, they do not necessarily have to do a retrospective change of the previous year's figures so as to have the comparative in the same form.  That would lead to considerable administrative costs.  Will the Minister clarify that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated in the Bill, <Col N="2322" /> there must be a comparison with the previous year's figures.

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would agree that there is much greater rigidity now in the formats than heretofore.  Up to now the matter was dealt with under the 1963 Act and certain SSAPs and certain rules attached to the Stock Exchange.  Now there is a big change.  I would contend that the formats are now fixed for those listed companies and the notes of disclosure are much increased and that that rigidity itself places a considerable workload on accounts.  I want to try to get that into perspective so that people can be properly advised on these formats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the principal thrust of this is to make sure all commercial trading companies make returns to comply with the directive.  I do not accept the Deputy's submission that the Bill imposes rigid formats.  The formats are quite clear and comprehensive but the hesitation of the various formats is not rigid in the sense that the Deputy describes and there is quite an amount of flexibility allowed under this section to ensure that while full information is given certain sub-headings can be amalgamated for the sake of simplicity.  It does not affect the thrust of the Bill.  The flexibility allowed in section 4 will be acceptable to the accounting profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I take issue with the Minister on that.  Whether or not these new formats are acceptable to practicising accountants or people involved in this business, there is no question as to their rigidity.  I am alarmed that the Minister says they are not rigid.  A casual glance at page 22 of Part I of the Schedule would indicate to anybody that the format for both balance sheet and profit and loss accounts is quite rigid.  I take it they must be complied with, as stated in the Schedule, so it is not true for the Minister <Col N="2323" /> to say that there will be any flexibility in accounting practices henceforth.  For that reason it is important for people involved to know that there is a narrow rigid format involved and that it is compulsory on those final accounts.  Following on my question on section 4(4) should a company for a reason stated in the notes to the account decide to change the format for this particular year &mdash; and according to the Minister it is not necessary that they would use the comparatives in the previous year in the same format &mdash; and return to the original format, will they be permitted to do so.  If so is there a time limit on when they may or may not return to the original format?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take issue with the Deputy.  I accept that what is required by the directors and included in this Bill is a comprehensive and a true and fair picture both in relation to profit and loss format and balance sheet format.  The provision of section 13(5) of this Bill allows for an amount of flexibility which should be acceptable in relation to formats or presentations. What we are looking for is comparative figures, in other words that a figure in one year can be compared with a figure in the previous year.  If there is a change in format the continuity of comparability must be maintained.  That is quite clear in this section and in the Bill in general.  There must be valid reasons why the director of a company would change the format.  The whole thrust of the Bill is the predominant necessity of presenting a true and fair picture.  While the format may change, the actual continuity of comparability must always be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  Would the Minister answer the final part of my question?  If a company chooses to change the format for a reason, can they go back to their original format if subsequently they decide that it suited them better administratively?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>They may go back for special reasons if the directors wish. What is really important is the continuity <Col N="2324" /> of comparisons and that the full information be given in each year's accounts in accordance with the formats.  If the directors feel it essential for some important reason to change the format it is allowable once the continuity of comparisons is maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give a few examples of special reasons?  Any time wording of that nature appears in legislation it requires that what are regarded as special reasons should be set down specifically as advice to people working the legislation.  The Minister might not have that information with him this evening but perhaps he would let us have a list later on so that people would get an indication of the special reasons affording an opportunity to change the format.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Communications if he is aware of the difficulties created for flights into Cork Airport due to instrumentation landing gear being out of commission since 6 January 1986 and the non-availability of the radar equipment recently causing flights to be diverted to other airports and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all too well aware of flights having to be diverted from Cork Airport and other airports in this country and in other countries for various reasons.  The people in Cork are very conscious of how often flights have to be diverted because of fog.  The reason I raised this question had nothing to do with fog over Cork Airport.  It was alarming for the people <Col N="2326" /> who use this airport for commercial or other reasons to become aware through the media of information such as the following.</P>
    <P>On Thursday last three flights were diverted to Shannon &mdash; a plane from London carrying 110 passengers, a plane from Bristol with 114 passengers and a plane from Dublin with 40 passengers. Two reasons were advanced for that: first, that the instrument landing system has been out of action since last January when work started on a four month project to replace it with a more modern system; and second, that the radar system is run by air traffic control and only certain members are qualified to operate it. Nobody would confirm that when qualified people are not on duty the radar system is declared to be &ldquo;not available&rdquo;. The result is that flights are diverted.  I put down this question for those reasons. Concern was expressed in the media and by people I met who are interested in Cork Airport about the diversion of flights.</P>
    <P>A spokesman at the airport when questioned would not agree 100 per cent that the non-availability of qualified staff was caused by a rigid no overtime rule which did not take into account the enforced loss of the instrument landing system. Nevertheless, it is believed that all three diversions on Thursday last were caused by the non-availability of radar qualified air traffic control men and radar qualified technicians.</P>
    <P>A spokesman said that new equipment had been installed in the airport.  However, it appears that staff still have to be trained to use it.  We thought things would have been much worse since January but we were fortunate during February that, due to the easterly winds, the airport was able to continue operating without the instrumentation needed for that type of landing.  I want to emphasise that we did not experience the usual weather conditions such as fog which very often is the cause of diverting flights from Cork to other airports.  We were fortunate that during February we had strong easterly winds which kept the airport clear of fog. The seriousness of the situation can be <Col N="2327" /> seen from what happened recently in Cork Airport.  This creates uncertainty in the minds of travellers using the airport. That is the reason I raised this question today.</P>
    <P>I want to make a passing reference to the situation in the Cork area since the loss of the ferry.  If the Minister, the Department and everybody concerned with the running of Cork Airport allow that situation to develop, they will be cutting off Cork's remaining link with the outside world.  We will not have air traffic nor will we have sea traffic in and out of Cork.  That is very serious.  I am pleased the Ceann Comhairle agreed to allow me to make that point here this evening.</P>
    <P>This is an intolerable situation.  This breakdown in equipment could have very serious repercussions for Cork Airport and the Cork region generally.  Air traffic into Cork must be a certainty.  I am at pains to emphasise that while we have had, and we will always have, diversions because of low ceiling cloud or fog, to divert traffic because there is no one qualified to operate the landing and radar equipment is not acceptable to me, or to the people of the region.</P>
    <P>In reply to a Parliamentary Question on 11 March as reported at column 1393 of the Official Report, the Minister said that an estimated total expenditure of £500,000 would be spent on the instrument landing system at Cork Airport, in addition to other items of capital expenditure. The Minister said he was aware that aircraft diversions caused by weather conditions had been a problem for Cork Airport.  I acknowledge that the Minister is aware of that fact, but so is everybody else including the people in the Department and the people in the region. What happened recently is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>I will pose a few questions to the Minister on this matter.  First, is the embargo on recruitment in the public service having an effect on the service of controllers, assistance controllers and supervisors into Cork Airport?  If that is the case I might suggest that the embargo on recruitment be adjusted with some <Col N="2328" /> selectivity in that area so that the safety of passengers in the air and, indeed, on landing and take off, would not be endangered. I am aware that there are five supervisors, nine controllers and eight assistant controllers, or cadets if one wishes to describe them as such, in the service at Cork Airport.  I am aware also that the roster is operated by a system of teams of five and that morale within the system is very low.  I know that discussions have been taking place with the Department and all those concerned with the question of manning and staffing levels at Cork Airport.  I know also that the instrument landing system there is available on one runway only.  The radar equipment, when available, can be used on that runway and the others also.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the landing equipment was taken out of commission on 6 January last.  Bearing in mind that that landing equipment must be renewed or repaired the least we can do is ensure that the radar equipment is available and is adequately manned.  Perhaps the Minister would confirm that the reason the radar equipment was not available on the recent occasion to which I have referred was because of shortage of staff, or that the manning levels are insufficient. I should like to know from the Minister also if this landing equipment will be available before May 1986 or will it be from May 1986 only in accordance with the Minister's remarks made in the Official Report from which I have already quoted when he said that the actual expected completion date is May 1986.  If that is the case, by way of alternative, we must ensure that the radar equipment at the airport is available and is staffed with the numbers required.  I say this bearing in mind that Cork Airport operates on limited hours only; we do not have a 24-hour service there.  Indeed, the airport closes at 11 o'clock in the evening.  Surely it is possible that the system be operated by way of a more satisfactory schedule than that obtaining.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my raising this question is to get an assurance, not for myself or the House only but for the people of the region, for everybody intending to use <Col N="2329" /> Cork Airport, to have it made abundantly clear to them that the airport is and will be available, that whatever manual or radar equipment is required for that purpose will be laid on.  I should like the Minister to reasure us that we need have no fears on that score.</P>
    <P>If there is any doubt about the ability of aircraft to land at Cork Airport, if there is any uncertainty among passengers and operators about Cork Airport being adequately equipped or manned and that one is likely to be diverted to another airport then we say that is not good enough.  We want an assurance that the airport &mdash; though it closes down at 11 p.m. &mdash; will be available with its facilities so that people can fly in there with reasonable expectation.  We all accept that in time of low cloud diversions will take place, as they will at any airport.  Limited though it is, it is our remaining direct link with our partners in the EC, Britain and elsewhere.  Along with the cessation of the ferry out of Cork to Great Britain we cannot and will not tolerate any doubt about the capability of Cork Airport and its facilities to serve the people wishing to use them.  It is absolutely essential for the commercial life of Cork that the airport be maintained and adapted for additional use, and that there should not be a reduction in its activities.  We must ensure that every opportunity is availed of to develop and expand these facilities. I am mindful of the indications given in a recent reply to a Parliamentary Question about the proposals for floodlighting, roadworks, security fencing, the fire station extension and new fire fighting vehicle, along with fireproofing of the control tower.  All of that is very welcome, as is the proposed expenditure to which the Minister referred.  However, all of those efforts to establish Cork Airport as a link with the south-west will be nullified if we cannot assure all those people using and promoting its facilities that they can with any degree of certainty land there and will not be diverted to another airport because the radar equipment is not operating or because the instrumentation landing equipment will not be repaired or be available again until May 1986.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2330" /> I want the Minister to dispel any fears that exist and, if necessary, correct the reasons given for diversions of flights last week because it was not the weather that occasioned those diversions, rather was it the non-availability of the radar equipment at the airport.  It should be well within the competence of the Minister to ensure that that does not recur.  Whatever the reasons, the Minister and his Department should ensure that they are corrected.</P>

      <P>I consider that Deputy Lyons has an awful neck raising such an issue, quoting as he did my recent substantial parliamentary reply about the extensive improvements taking place at Cork Airport. It is totally unreasonable of him to raise this question in the House at this hour of the evening when the difficulties to which he refers are caused substantially by the temporary absence of an instrument landing system while we instal a new one.  I am very proud that as Minister I have set to rights the communications, radar and instrument landing systems at our three national airports. Most of those facilities were in not very good condition when I came to office.</P>
      <P>There have been diversions in Cork Airport.  There have been about 23 since 6 January, but that is not out of line with the number of diversions there over recent years on average.  Of course, most diversions take place during the winter months.  I hope that the new instrument landing system when installed will bring about some improvement in the situation. I am glad to tell the House that the installation of the instrument landing system is on schedule and should be operational within about two months from now.  That is a considerable step forward for Cork Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also major improvements in relation to instrument landing systems taking place at Dublin Airport where a second instrument landing system is now <Col N="2331" /> being installed.  There have been major improvements at different airports in the communications and radar fields, so much so that we can be reasonably happy at all our airports with the present level of communications, radar and instrument landing systems.</P>
    <P>I am vexed at Deputy Lyons hyping up this question tonight.  No Minister has done more for Cork Airport than I have done.  In the year just gone, 1985, Cork Airport had its best year ever and what was a substantial loss maker has now reached almost a balance.  I am very happy to be able to say that.  It applies not only to Cork Airport.  Shannon Airport which was in deficit only a few years ago, is in boom time making substantial profits and a record number of landings in recent years.  Therefore, I want to assure Deputy Lyons and the House that as far as I am concerned these improvements <Col N="2332" /> will continue at our airports.  Further, the embargo on recruitment has had no adverse impact on Cork Airport. Arrangements are being made to send extra traffic control staff to Cork to enable the airport to open for 24 hours over the coming summer.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say tonight.  I am sorry that Deputy Lyons sought to hype this question here at this hour of the night.</P>

      <P>The present agreement was made between my predecessor and the Motor Insurers Bureau in 1964.  Under the agreement, personal injuries compensation is payable by the bureau to victims of accidents involving uninsured vehicles, including stolen vehicles.  In the case of &ldquo;hit and run accidents&rdquo; where the driver of the vehicle cannot be traced, <i>ex gratia</i> compensation is payable by the bureau only for personal injuries which involve serious and permanent disablement <Col N="2119" /> or death.  Under the 1964 agreement, the bureau do not pay compensation for property damage.</P>
      <P>The limitations of the present agreement will be largely eliminated as a result of the implementation of the Second EC Directive on Motor Insurance, which requires the bureau to: compensate for all personal injuries caused by unidentified vehicle drivers by 31 December 1988; and compensate for property damage, other than damage caused by unidentified drivers, by 31 December 1992.</P>
      <P>The time limits laid down for implementation of the directive in Ireland are primarily designed to ease the impact on motor insurance premiums.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> As the Deputy is already aware, there was a delay in the commencement of production at this factory because the promoters had, for commercial reasons, to review the range of products proposed for manufacture. Although production began in early 1984 the company has been unable to date to develop as originally planned and it is not, therefore, envisaged that there will be any immediate increase in the number at present employed.  To date a building designed to accommodate 220 for phase one of the project has been completed; phase two has not commenced.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the IDA will seek to ensure that the company can take advantage of the expected upturn in the electronics industry worldwide in the event that this results in increased demand for the company's products.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> There is little information available from any source about public works contracts secured by Irish firms in other EC countries. <Col N="2127" /> Such contracts as may exist are private. The EC Commission commissioned a report in 1984 on the awarding of building and public works contracts in the EC. This showed that there has been a low level of participation by construction firms in the EC generally in invitations to tender in the member states.  It also showed that very few contracts have been awarded to non-national firms by awarding authorities.</P>
      <P>In the area of general construction type activities it can be difficult for many Irish firms to break into foreign markets, whether throughout the EC or further afield, because of practical considerations such as prequalification requirements, size, track record, cost and experience in getting a foothold established and recognised in overseas markets.</P>
      <P>Since CTT's mandate was extended in 1983 to cover exports of services it has been concentrating on identifying suitable markets for Irish construction firms. Within the EC it has identified the UK as the major focus for Irish contractors. In the past 18 months it has assisted over 40 firms representing main contractors, specialist subcontractors and professional practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CTT's assistance consists of limited financial incentives mainly in the area of tendering and representation, information on market trends and opportunities and sectoral studies in particular sectors such as hotel and restaurant refurbishment, nursing homes and sheltered housing. CTT also offers an advisory service through its London office using specialist staff.  Its main promotional work in the UK however is geared towards introducing contractors to buyers and developers. Irish companies in receipt of CTT's assistance are estimated to have IR£45 million worth of UK business on their books <Col N="2128" /> covering both the public and private sectors.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the precautions being taken in the light of the expected <Col N="2135" /> increase in silage making to protect our fresh water environments from pollution due to silage effluent during the summer of 1986.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mrs. A. Doyle) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mrs. A. Doyle)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mrs. A. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter in the first instance for each local authority to take whatever measures they consider necessary to prevent water pollution. The authorities have power under section 12 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, to serve notices on any person having custody or control of any pollution matter, such as silage effluent, specifying measures to be taken within a stated period to prevent pollution occurring.</P>
      <P>My Department have sought to create greater awareness of the dangers posed to our water resources by certain agricultural practices, particularly silage making.  The Department have regularly impressed on local authorities the importance of increased co-operation with bodies such as the fisheries boards, ACOT, tourism and farmer organisations in order to highlight and deal with pollution risks associated with these practices. The efforts of the Department in this regard will be continued during 1986.</P>
      <P>Local authorities may avail of their powers under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts to impose conditions designed to protect the environment on certain agricultural developments.  While the making of silage may constitute exempted development, the Local Government (Planning and Development) (Exempted Development and Amendment) Regulations, 1984, limit any exemption to cases in which, <i>inter alia,</i> adequate effluent storage facilities are provided.  In addition, these regulations limit the amount of exempted development which may take place in any farmyard complex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A manual is being prepared to provide advice and guidance for local authorities, farmers and all other agencies involved with agricultural development.  The Departments of Agriculture and Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry as well as <Col N="2136" /> An Foras Forbartha, An Foras Talúntais, ACOT, and the Central Fisheries Board are assisting in drafting the manual. Information on essential requirements for the control of water pollution from silage making is already contained in the Department of Agriculture's &ldquo;Guidelines and Recommendations on Control of Pollution from Farmyard Wastes&rdquo; which was revised and issued late last year. These guidelines will be applied by the farm development service of the Department of Agriculture to determine whether proposals for walled silos and silage slabs should qualify for assistance under the new scheme of structural aids for agriculture.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer held three separate employments in 1984-85, two of which ceased on 31 August and 7 September 1984.  The inspector of taxes was not notified by the employer of the cessation which took place on the latter date.  Consequently, when a review of the taxpayer's liability for 1985-86 was being carried out in November 1985, in connection with a claim made by her for a tax refund on the grounds of unemployment, no repayments emerged because the inspector was not in possession of all the relevant facts pertaining to the claim.</P>

      <P>Two claims were submitted to the inspector on 4 November 1985, one for repayment of tax on the grounds of unemployment and the other in relation to the tax deducted from the lump sum payment.  The unemployment repayment claim was dealt with and all the tax which had been deducted from his earnings for the current year up to the date of cessation of employment, was refunded to him on 2 December 1985.  The other claim will be dealt with when the details requested by the inspector in his letter of 12 February 1986 to the agents are supplied.</P>

    <P>(1)  There is no reliable information available on which to base an estimate of VAT receipts from goods vehicles and other motor vehicles.  However, VAT-registered persons are entitled to a deduction in their returns for VAT borne on business purchases of motor vehicles (other than cars and motor cycles), and this would very significantly reduce the VAT yield from such vehicles.</P>

The allowance in question was withdrawn following reviews of his liabilities for the relevant years and the total underpayment which emerged is being collected over a period of five years which commenced on 6 April 1984.</P>

      <P>Grants for archaeological research excavation are, in the normal course, made to the Royal Irish Academy which then decides on the allocation to individual projects subject to final approval by the Commissioners of Public Works.  Usually <Col N="2154" /> the allocation provides grants for projects under the direction of staff of the Department of Archaeology, University College, Cork.  A major excavation at Dublin Castle must be completed this year to enable the construction of the new conference centre planned for the site to be ready for the next Irish presidency of the EC in 1990.  In view of the very large expenditure, £300,000, which must be allocated to this excavation in 1986, and the restrictions on the resources available to the commissioners, they are not in a position to allocate funds to the academy for archaeological research this year.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is looking for the statistics which are relevant to the Cork north community care area.

Details of individual cases are not held in the Department.</P>

    <P>The latest statistical returns from the health board concerned, which relate to the last week of September 1985, show that 27 rent supplements and two mortgage interest supplements totalling £161.25 and £76.40, respectively, were paid in the Cork north community care area in that week.  There were no cases where supplements were paid to persons in rented accommodation who are also mortgage holders.

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a claimant must be available for employment. The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 9 December 1985 but her claim was disallowed by a deciding officer on the grounds that she was not available for employment.  She appealed against the disallowance and attended an oral hearing of her case on 13 March 1986.  The appeals officer allowed her appeal.</P>
      <P>However, she did not satisfy the contribution condition of having 26 contributions paid or credited during the contribution period 6 April 1983 to 5 April 1984 which governed entitlement on her claim from 9 December 1985 to 5 January 1986 and, accordingly, her claim was disallowed.  A new benefit year commenced on 6 January 1986 and as she satisfies the contribution condition for entitlement to unemployment benefit from that date her claim has been allowed at the weekly rate of £34.70.  All arrears due from 6 January 1986 will be paid this week and further weekly payments will be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>The rate of unemployment benefit payable to an applicant is reduced after 156 days of benefit have been drawn if he does not satisfy the contribution condition of having 280 paid contributions in a seven year period.  In addition, any two periods of interruption of employment not separated by more than 13 weeks are regarded as linked and are treated as one period of interruption of employment.  A link can also occur between a period of incapacity, where a person is in receipt of disability benefit <Col N="2163" /> and a period of unemployment.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment benefit from 22 November 1984 to 17 August 1985.  He claimed unemployment benefit again on 27 January 1986 and this claim was linked to his previous unemployment benefit claim as he had been in receipt of disability benefit from 8 November 1985 to 4 January 1986 and the periods of employment between the end of the first unemployment benefit claim and the commencement of disability benefit, and between the end of the disability benefit claim and 27 January 1986, were for less than 13 weeks.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment benefit at the maximum rate, until 25 May 1985 when he had drawn 156 days of benefit.  He did not fulfil the contribution condition of having 280 paid contributions in a seven year period and, accordingly, the weekly rate of unemployment benefit was reduced from 26 May 1985.  The unemployment benefit claim from 27 January 1986 is linked with the earlier claim and, accordingly, payments are being made at the appropriate reduced weekly rate, which in this case is £81.10, from that date.  The person concerned had insufficient earnings during the relevant income tax period 6 April 1982 to 5 April 1983 to give entitlement to pay-related benefit. Further weekly payments of £81.10 will continue as they become due.</P>

      <P>The rate of unemployment benefit payable is reduced after 156 days of benefit where an applicant does not satisfy the contribution condition of having 280 paid contributions in a seven year period prior to the date of claim. The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 8 February 1985 and was in receipt of the maximum appropriate rate of 156 days of benefit until 21 August 1985.  He did not satisfy the contribution condition for further payment at the maximum rate and accordingly his weekly rate of unemployment benefit was reduced to £32.75 from 22 August 1985.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether there is justification in using different definitions of average income for the purpose of <Col N="2165" /> calculating restrictions on pay-related benefit under disability benefit and under unemployment benefit: i.e. under disability benefit the restriction is based on income in the 1984-85 year and under unemployment benefit it is based on the income since April 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Pay-related benefit is payable with disability benefit, maternity allowance, unemployment benefit, and with injury benefit where there is an underlying title to disability benefit.  It is normally calculated on a person's reckonable weekly earnings in the relevant income tax year which is the last complete income tax year before the year in which the claim commences.  For a person whose claim commences in 1986 the relevant income tax year is the 1984-85 income tax year.</P>
      <P>Where pay-related benefit is payable other than with unemployment benefit the combined total of pay-related benefit and flat rate benefit may not exceed 75 per cent of a person's reckonable weekly earnings in the relevant income tax year. Details of these earnings are readily available in that they are used in calculating the level of pay-related benefit.  More recent details would not normally be available in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of unemployment benefit recipients, the total of flat rate benefit, pay-related benefit and income tax rebates is limited to 85 per cent of average net weekly earnings in the current year, or one-fiftieth of the earnings ceiling for pay-related benefit, whichever is the lesser.  The different limit in the case of unemployment benefit can be applied without unduly delaying the processing of claims because the necessary documentary evidence is normally available when persons become unemployed: e.g., the P.45 document giving details of immediate past earnings which a person gets from his employer when leaving employment.  Such up-to-date earnings information could not, however, be obtained from other claimants without <Col N="2166" /> causing undue delays in payments of their benefit.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is dependent on an applicant being the holder of a qualification certificate and to obtain a qualification certificate an applicant must satisfy certain conditions including an assessment of means.  An applicant for unemployment assistance must also satisfy the statutory conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work.  Following extensive investigations into the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned, her means were recently assessed at nil from 15 August 1985 to 7 October 1985.</P>

      <P>The person concerned submitted a claim for contributory old age pension on 7 August 1985.  One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of this pension requires a person to have a yearly average of at least 20 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from his year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.  The Department's records showed that the person concerned had a total of 619 reckonable contributions in the relevant period which, in his case, is from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1985.  This is equal to a yearly average of only 19 and is not sufficient to qualify for a contributory old age pension. He was notified accordingly.  He would need to have a further 21 reckonable contributions to qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is last recorded as having credited <Col N="2173" /> contributions in 1965.  He has claimed that he was employed up to 1966.  The local social welfare officer was asked to investigate this claim and a final decision will be made when the officer's report is received.  In the meantime, his entitlement to an old age non-contributory pension is being examined.</P>

      <P>Following investigation of the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned he was assessed with means of £26.90 weekly, derived from the value of board and lodging on his parents' holding.  He is, accordingly, in receipt of unemployment assistance of £4.85 weekly being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £31.75 less means of £26.90.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the amount of means assessed against him, but an appeals officer also assessed his means at £26.90 weekly.  Further weekly payments of £4.85 will continue to be made as they become due.  If the person concerned feels that his circumstances have changed it is open to him to apply for a review of his means.  A form for this purpose may be obtained from his local office.</P>

      <P>The person concerned transferred his holding to his son who is employed and lives a considerable distance away. He is not, therefore, in a position to work the holding, the transfer of which, in the circumstances, is not acceptable for pension purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before giving his decision on the appeal in this case, the appeals officer <Col N="2174" /> requested further inquiries.  These established that the pensioner's son had not returned to work the holding and, in the circumstances, the appeals officer also held that the transfer was not acceptable for pension purposes.  He accordingly decided that the person concerned is entitled to an old age pension at the weekly rate of £32 from 30 July 1985, which is the rate appropriate to the assessment of his means consisting of half the weekly value of the holding and capital.</P>
    <P>The appeals officer was of the opinion that this case was of such a nature that it could properly be determined without an oral hearing and, in accordance with the regulations, he dispensed with a hearing and determined the case summarily.</P>

In this case both the person concerned and his wife are in receipt of qualifying payments and either one can therefore qualify for the allowance provided the other is permanently incapacitated as above.</P>
      <P>An application for the allowance was received on 4 February 1986.  However, no medical evidence was furnished in support of the application and a decision could not be made in the case.

    <P>My Department operates a number of schemes to improve the production and marketing of vegetables.  These include aid under the farm improvement programme, grants for conversion of glasshouse heating systems from oil to solid fuel, aid for the formation and operation of producer groups, and aid for market co-ordination in the horticultural industry.  Initiatives have also been taken by commercial interests to improve production and marketing.
