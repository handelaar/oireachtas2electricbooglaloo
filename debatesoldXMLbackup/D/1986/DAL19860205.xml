      <P>Relating to the way we order business in this House, I ask the Chair to take note of the fact, perhaps with a view to doing something about it, that yesterday my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, in this House raised the question of the imminent closure of one of the great educational institutions in the country, namely, Carysfort College, and she asked that the Government should make a statement on the matter.  The Government declined to do so but within two hours the Minister for Education went outside this House and made a public statement.  I am not quite sure how the matter can be dealt with, but I think the conduct of the Minister and the <Col N="1596" /> Government shows a flagrant disrespect for this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>During the general election campaign in 1981 the Taoiseach promised a standard rate of income tax of 25 per cent.  We now realise exactly what has been achieved by this Government. The dust has settled on the Alan Dukes budget of 1986 and the public are aware that they will be much worse off.  Personal taxes and taxes on spending will increase instead of decrease as was promised by the Minister for Finance.  This year there will be a yield of £2,477 million from combined income tax, the 1 per cent youth employment levy and tax from the income levy in respect of the first three months of 1986.  This represents an overall increase of 9.6 per cent on last year's revenue or £270 million in addition to the £2,403 million raised already.  The proposed increase will be twice the expected level of inflation, which is estimated at 4.5 per cent.  If the budget plan is on target the total yield from personal taxes will be equal to 14.7 per cent of GNP in 1986, the highest level ever recorded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1599" /> One must question the legality of deducting 35 per cent of the income tax paid by banks and Post Office account holders and which cannot be set off against income tax liability.  Pensioners and others on low incomes are now to be taxed for the first time.</P>
    <P>The Government have abandoned the task of creating jobs thereby leaving the 240,000 who are unemployed without hope.  In the past three years 50,000 people have emigrated.  Since the budget some of the hidden cutbacks have been announced by the Minister for Health in the form of the closure of eight hospitals including Saint Patrick's Psychiatric Hospital in Castlerea.  I should like to remind the House of the Labour advertisement for the 1982 general election and which appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 15 November of that year.  In this advertisement people were urged to vote Labour and the phrase, &ldquo;Penalising the sick is obscene&rdquo; was included in that advertisement. I wonder whether the Minister for Health and Social Welfare recalls that. He is penalising the sick.</P>
    <P>May we expect statements from other Ministers during the coming weeks about further closures.  This administration have abandoned whatever plans they had.  They are trying to curry favour as much as possible with the electorate, but they are failing in that regard too.  The only alternative is an early general election. That is what the people are demanding. Our unemployment figure is the highest ever in the history of the State but the Government have failed to take any action to cope with the problem.  If they were concerned about unemployment they would declare a national emergency by way of highlighting the trauma of this problem, the difficulties being experienced by those out of work and the general depression among the people.  During the past three years particularly the sad effects of unemployment have been obvious in my constituency of Roscommon and the surrounding areas of Galway.  Between February 1982 and November of that year, when we were in <Col N="1600" /> office, we were very conscious of the need to create employment and to do so in a balanced, fair and equitable way.  We believed in regional development, in the decentralisation of major Government Departments so as to provide a source of employment in the regions.  The Dublin region is overcrowded.  The deployment of staff to offices in the regions would be a great contribution to the revitalisation of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising the budget merely for the sake of criticism.  Matters are much too serious for that.  During the debate on last year's budget I announced that in my constituency I was establishing an enterprise development association. That organisation has been established since and in this regard I must recognise the assistance we have had from the Youth Employment Agency who have provided a grant for the employment of a development officer.  That officer is working on a full time basis in trying to create jobs in County Roscommon and the surrounding districts.  During the past year we have succeeded in creating jobs in the constituency.</P>
    <P>All Deputies must play a part in job creation in their constituencies.  It is not sufficient to voice our criticism at budget time or during other debates in respect of inaction on the part of the Government. In Opposition Fianna Fáil are playing a positive role.  Basically, we are a government in exile because we are a government of the people and for the people.  That has been the case always. We have been responsive down through the years to the needs of the underprivileged, the deprived and the unemployed. Our policies have been accepted by the people.  We have the highest percentage vote of any party in the State.  The Coalition are not representative of the wishes of the people.  As individual Deputies we can play a more positive role directly in the area of job creation.  I appeal to my colleagues on every side of the House to become engaged in this work.  Our experience in Roscommon in this respect has been very worth while.  In March 1985, when I called together a group of business people, of unemployed and of <Col N="1601" /> industrialists with a view to setting up the organisation I have referred to, I was very much aware of the difficulties facing us.  In Roscommon alone more than 2,500 people are out of work.  That is perhaps the highest level of unemployment there in the history of the State and certainly since the fifties when there was rampant unemployment and a high level of emigration.</P>
    <P>We have embarked on a survey that is supported by AnCO.  To date we have created 22 jobs, admittedly part time. Nevertheless, there are 22 people at work in the area who were unemployed 12 months ago.  In addition, as a result of our activities we have created about ten permanent jobs on one project alone, a project initiated by the Roscommon Enterprise Development Association. We have other plans in the pipeline also.</P>
    <P>Deputies should be given more say in relation to development in their constituencies. They should be co-opted members of the county development teams.  Both Deputies and Senators have an important role to play in this area.  It is not sufficient for them to represent their people in this House or at county council level.  They should be involved directly also in job creation.  I appreciate that this would not be an easy task but it would be very worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the pressures on the IDA to entice industrialists here.  From my recent trip to the US I am aware that the IDA are competing with states within the US who are competing aggressively with each other for industry.  Great credit is due to the IDA for what they are doing. I should like to pay tribute to the late great Michael Killeen who contributed so much to the development of industry here.  His passing is much regretted.  I am confident that the IDA will continue their work in a vigorous manner but the Government in this budget are not making the necessary contribution to the authority that would enable them to embark on further aggressive marketing in the US and in mainland Europe also. The IDA are fighting a tough battle.  They are competing with very big vested interests <Col N="1602" /> in the US who are fighting to secure the deployment of jobs from one state to another.  During my recent visit to the US I was made very much aware of this when I attended a luncheon organised by one of the leading party organisations there.  In one case I learned that an estimated $250,000 was spent by one state in an effort to attract one of the multinational corporations from California. Nothing is left to chance in their operations. They bring forward all the stars of all the major television soap operas to try to persuade the companies to relocate in their state.  The IDA can put forward their progressive marketing.  They have been very successful and we have a good reputation in the United States.  We are well regarded there as a country and should maintain our outpost there and try to attract as much industry as possible to this country.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála to my mind are not aggressive enough in marketing in the US.  I have not seen their work in the Irish stores in Denver, Pitsburgh, Maine, or any other part of the United States.  I do not think they are active enough, but they may wish to reply to this comment. They should be more active on the ground, trading and pushing our goods at all possible opportunities, not just in New York but throughout the United States. Irish goods are <i>par excellence</i>.  They are favourably regarded in the States and on mainland Europe.  From my experience Córas Tráchtála are not doing their job there to the fullest extent and they should be revitalised.  I call on the Minister to review their activities in the United States in particular and to ensure that they engage in more aggressive marketing and work alongside all our organisations here and all the companies that need assistance in marketing.</P>
    <P>As far as job creation in every constituency is concerned, Deputies, Senators, councillors, public representatives have a responsibility also.  They should be to the forefront of job maintenance and creation.  The Government have the major responsibility of ensuring that the tax regime is right and I do not believe that it is at this stage.  The State should <Col N="1603" /> be more active in relation to import substitution. During our administration in 1982 we set up in the Department of the Environment a group to monitor all the purchases by State authorities.  By careful management we can reduce our imports and create jobs at home.  That would be positive, patriotic action by everyone concerned.</P>
    <P>We must appeal now to all our countrymen and women to buy Irish where possible at all times.  By buying Irish they are creating jobs here.  By import substitution on the Government side jobs are also being created.  I do not believe that the Government are really serious about import substitution.  Since we left office in 1982 they have not taken any real action to create the environment for job creation.</P>
    <P>Since 1982 the Department of Energy have decided not to go ahead with the proposal for the briquette factory at Ballyforan in County Roscommon, which would have created in the region of 500 permanent jobs for a period of 25 to 30 years.  The harvesting of sod and milled peat in the Derryfadda group of bogs near Ballyforan takes place in the Roscommon-Galway area.  The IDA and Bord na Móna had supported the project but the Minister, Deputy Bruton withdrew it and it has not been reactivated by the Minister for Energy, Deputy Spring.  I hope that the Department of Energy will take note that we are not giving up hope of revitalisation of this project in Ballyforan.  It would create much needed employment in an area decimated by unemployment &mdash; jointly in the East Galway-Roscommon constituency area.  This would be positive action showing the sincerity of this administration with regard to job creation in that constituency which is deprived of facilities as a result of the activities of this Government.  I question the reestablishment of a new department for job creation.  I do not believe that they are serious in their present portfolios.</P>
    <P>I return to the announcement of a closure in my own constituency.  Last night on &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; the Minister's <Col N="1604" /> statements were outrageous.  He attacked the genuine, sincere public representatives in the constituency of Roscommon who are fighting a campaign for the retention of full facilities for psychiatric patients in St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea. The word &ldquo;squalid&rdquo; is not parliamentary and it is not fair to use it against the public representatives on the Government as well as the Opposition sides.  The Minister is only carrying on the attack which he launched in the Dáil on Thursday last when he said that he would not take any ignorant objections to his proposals.</P>
    <P>The people of Roscommon and the people of Castlerea are in rebellion as far as this issue is concerned.  They are concerned primarily with the care of psychiatric patients in the hospital.  I call on the Minister to enter into meaningful discussions for the development of psychiatric services there.  I ask him to restore the £1.9 million which he is taking from the western health budget to transfer to another institution in County Mayo.  He is using one area to fight another on this issue.  He and his officials should visit the institution in Castlerea. It is strange that he had not the courtesy of doing so and did not see the facilities at first hand before making his statement last Thursday.  He should have courage and come to the county to review the facilities at first hand.</P>
    <P>We are disturbed by the actions of the Minister.  He is being used as a hatchet man and it is a sad day that a Labour Minister would be used by Fine Gael to implement cut-backs to hospital services throughout the country.  He is being used to chop projects, to reduce facilities for the elderly, the sick, the disabled, the mentally handicapped and the psychiatrically ill.  I am afraid that he will go down in history as a Minister who certainly was uncaring, unkind, unfeeling towards his portfolio.  He has now an opportunity to announce that, on review, he is not proceeding with this proposal. Meaningful discussions would be welcomed by all concerned because we have a very progressive and hard working staff in St. Patrick's Hospital who are prepared <Col N="1605" /> to discuss the situation.  I hope the Minister will then rescind the proposals to withdraw facilities from St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea, and the other institutions affected.  I can speak with the knowledge of one institution only, that being St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea.</P>
    <P>There is much more that could be said about this budget.  For example, the deprived, the elderly, widows, the disabled will receive no assistance whatsoever. It should be remembered that a Labour Minister for Social Welfare has granted the lowest increase in any budget for many years to those needy people.  I would appeal to the Minister for Social Welfare to examine the position of the widows of teachers and doctors who are being deprived of free electricity, telephones and so on.  That is an anomaly in the social welfare code.  Those facilities were introduced by a former Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, in a humane and positive gesture to the elderly and disabled, a gesture which has not been sufficiently recognised.  These facilities could easily be extended to the few who have been excluded.</P>
    <P>This budget will be labelled as one which neglected to tackle the problems confronting the country, in particular that of unemployment.  This Government have basically finished their term, have no real mandate from the people, there is no confidence being shown in them by anybody.  They will continue to founder along from day to day, from crisis to crisis, eventually dissolving and calling a general election.  I hope that will arise sooner rather than later, particularly for the benefit of the unemployed and others deprived of assistance.  There is no confidence being shown in this administration, there is no hope being held out by them, no future for the country as long as they continue to govern.  If they are concerned about the electorate then let them put their policies before them.  We are preparing detailed election commitments and plans to be put before the electorate at the next general election when our detailed scheme for job creation will be <Col N="1606" /> announced.  We believe we will receive a clear mandate to take up the reins of office again, to restore the country to some level of prosperity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I sat here and listened to Deputy Leyden speak about the budget introduced in this House by the Minister for Finance on 29 January 1986.  It appeared to me that Deputy Leyden neglected to tackle any of the issues at present confronting the country.  The Minister examined his budgetary proposals from three points of view.  For example, he ascertained what proposals would be most appropriate bearing in mind the present state of our economy.  He had to recognise the constraints on public finance, both national and international. Then he ascertained the shifts necessary in the balance of taxation required for the purposes of achieving equity.  In addition, he wanted to tackle the black economy.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that Opposition Deputies, in contributing to this debate, use emotive techniques and phraseology to dampen confidence in the economy. That was not the Minister's budgetary purpose.  Deputy Leyden was at pains to criticise the state on our economy.  He said we were bankrupt.  Since this Government assumed office there has been no attempt made by the IMF to come in here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no such call.  It should be remembered that this Government have the ability to borrow and have demonstrated their capability to do so at all times.  The Minister for Finance has been extremely successful in realigning new loans.  For example, last year he realised £1.1 billion and placed that amount against new loans.  That is success.  I have heard Deputy O'Kennedy criticise the Minister frequently for having borrowed in dollars.  Deputy O'Kennedy has not referred to that success of the Minister last year.  All criticism emanating from the Opposition benches has been destructive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Leyden made one suggestion <Col N="1607" /> with which I would agree, that is that at local level Deputies should form part of the county development teams.  I accept that that is a good proposal.  It is good that such county development teams continue in existence.  A previous Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, wanted to abolish them.  He was then a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  That proposal was shelved then because it was found that there was local opposition to it.  Deputies are well aware of local difficulties with regard to the promotion of employment.</P>
    <P>In his budgetary proposals the Minister examined the present state of the economy. There is no doubt that the principal achievement of this Government to date has been the huge drop effected in the rate of inflation.  Being at its present low level affords people an opportunity to invest in manufacturing industry, knowing that they can plan to compete abroad and budget for the ensuing year with regard to expenditure.  Furthermore, it affords the workforce an opportunity to reap the advantage of any real increases in incomes that may come their way.  Such benefits can be reaped by export industry only.  The Government have not been found wanting in their promotion of the activities of the IDA and of employment generally.  In my constituency in County Clare there is a good example at Shannon where the employment record of the industrial estate last year exceeded that of many previous years.  SFADCo announced a net gain in jobs in the course of last year.  Achieved amidst the climate of doom and gloom depicted by Deputy Leyden that constitutes a major achievement which must be recognised.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was considering the shifts necessary in the balance of taxation required for the purposes of achieving equity he found it necessary to propose changes in the tax bands and their ceilings. Indeed many commentators in the papers have placed much emphasis on the fact that the PAYE income tax payers have received significant relief, particularly bearing in mind the constraints obtaining on public finance.  I believe this <Col N="1608" /> to have been a correct decision on the part of the Minister at the right time. Indeed, he has improved on the proposal contained in <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> in which the Government guaranteed that income tax payers would be protected from the effects of any further cost of living increases.</P>
    <P>The PAYE sector appear to be somewhat confused with the figures published, whether they be plus or minus.  It will be clearly seen from the various documents prepared that the PAYE changes as they affect single people indicate a reduction in tax payable ranging from £70 per annum on a total income of £3,000 to £860 on a total income of £30,000.  In the case of a married couple the reduction is £95 on a total income of £6,000 to £820 on an income of £30,000.</P>
    <P>By altering the system of tax collection from direct to indirect taxation the Minister has given an opportunity to taxpayers to purchase as they wish.  Criticism has been offered by the Opposition that the total tax take is about to increase, but overall, given the financial problems that this country has suffered over a long number of years, this matter has arisen since 1972 when we started with a budget deficit and our current expenditure has multiplied in leaps and bounds.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister examined public service pay and incomes policy.  A major achievement of this Government has been to reduce expectations after a succession of Governments had unnecessarily fuelled them.  In 1977 the Fianna Fáil manifesto said that Utopia was around the corner.  By 1979 Utopia was tarnished to such an extent that the current Opposition, the Fianna Fáil Party, who then had the greatest majority in the House, felt free to remove the Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch and bring in their current leader, Deputy Haughey, who fuelled further expectations by offering a recipe for the economy in which there would be cuts intended to relieve the current budget deficit dramatically in a short time.  However, when he got the reins he found that was more difficult than he had anticipated.  The current Government said there are difficulties <Col N="1609" /> in reducing the deficit.  They have been maligned and portrayed as a Government who have slashed everything.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health are facing major criticism, but this year the Minister for Health has brought in an Estimate which is an improvement on last year's. From £12,000 million to £12,035 million is not a cut in my estimation.  I do not understand why people talk about total cuts.  As the argument went between the Taoiseach and Deputy Haughey on budget day it is possibly a cut in real expenditure.  At the same time the Minister has been asking the people who utilise funds to control waste, and he has done that in various ways.  To give an example, in my constituency I have seen the Minister act humanely.  As Minister for Health Deputy Haughey approved a proposal to add a maternity hospital at the Cahercalla St. John of God's hospital in Ennis.  This building was completed and we needed that facility in the country.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Some would argue that this should have been attached to the county hospital in Ennis but I agree with Deputy Haughey's decision.  It was the right place to site it.  It is more amendable to maternity care, and the nurses, the management and the nuns have been very caring for the sick there down through the years. However, the Minister, Deputy Desmond, was faced with the fact that finance was needed to open that hospital and he proposed rationalisation which included the closure of the geriatric unit in my parish.  The Minister succeeded in transferring the long term patients in that hospital to hospitals more convenient to their families.  The health board together with the staff arrived at the decision that they could move.  Now in Clare the St. John of God's hospital is open, and any patient suffering from a severe kidney complaint can avail of the dialysis machine which has been put in operation in the Limerick Regional Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That demonstrates that the Minister, <Col N="1610" /> Deputy Desmond, has been caring in his use of Department of Health funds.  He was accused by Deputy Leyden of ignoring the needs and problems of patients and their relatives.  The Minister is challenging Deputy Leyden to look at the system of psychiatric nursing and care. The Deputy should debate the change from institutional to community care and the merits and demerits of it.  Various people in the health area have examined this.  I have met many psychiatric nurses who want to get on to the community care rota and who applaud the Minister for wanting to promote it.</P>
    <P>On the other hand I have met patients who have been asked to go out into the world after 15 or 20 years in an institution and they are having difficulties.  The initial problems created in this area by the new policy were extreme, but the doctors and medical staff generally have come to terms with the difficulties, and the community are responding.  I have met people who are prepared to invest money in houses to give care to people who have been taken from institutions.  I urge the Minister to examine the operation of this changeover to see that it is properly supervised.  In this House we should seek to promote the goodwill and the interests and improve the lives of patients who are suffering from psychiatric difficulties.</P>
    <P>The real problem for a long time has been the state of the public finances. Even to this day there are severe constraints. A recognition of this problem nationally and an acceptance of it by all the parties involved would help us to overcome our difficulties.  The major area has been the expectations that have arisen from time to time.  There has not been an indication from any sector that they will agree to voluntary restraint. Some time ago the Minister for the Public Service asked for a voluntary contribution by public servants either in terms of hours for which they would forego payment, or in terms of a day's work for the economy, and he was scoffed at.  But it will require a sacrifice from all the people.  If the burden of debt is not <Col N="1611" /> reduced it will continue to climb.  Posturings by political parties as to how they would introduce taxation without increasing borrowing should not be believed.</P>
    <P>There are expectations about the bonanza awaiting us in natural resources.  In oil exploration everybody is waiting for a company to come up with a major gusher which will solve our tax problems for ever.  The Government, through the Minister for Energy, have published their current policy on oil exploration but the policy of the Opposition is not clear.  Two articles in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> and the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 19 January last dealt with Fianna Fáil policy and the views of the Chairman of Atlantic Resources, Mr. Tony O'Reilly.  What emerges is that the revised measures to encourage exploration did not prevent the third round from being a disaster and that Fianna Fáil are clearly set to offer more favourable terms.  The oil companies, on the other hand, will sit tight knowing that the Government need ready cash to reduce taxes.  The aspect that worries me is the trade off being made.</P>
    <P>The announcement by the Minister that present policy gives concessions to smaller or marginal fields of under 75,000 barrels and that the State is still entitled to 50 per cent participation but that these fields will be relieved of royalties on the first 25,000 barrels was greeted by an outcry from Deputy Reynolds and Deputy Mac Giolla.  The level of State participation will be decided by a formula difficult for the layman to understand. That is why the Opposition have been shouting &ldquo;sell-out&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 19 January last was scathing in its criticism of Fianna Fáil policy and said that what passed for policy had been cobbled together to meet minor party objectives, and that these objectives were identified as screwing the Coalition and making sure that Tony O'Reilly got no favours. It is worth looking at Fianna Fáil Party statements in chronological order as they occurred in 1985.  On 25 April Deputy Reynolds condemned the giving up of royalties and said that Fianna Fáil would <Col N="1612" /> keep the royalties and get the maximum benefit for the taxpayer.  The Deputy also said that Dick Spring erred in getting the maximum benefit for the taxpayer and repeatedly pointed out that exploration funds are very scarce.  On September 25 Michael O'Kennedy said that ten years ago we were perhaps too concerned with maximising the potential gain for the State and that all the evidence was that the oil industry were waiting for a Government with whom they could do serious business.

      <P>Thank you Deputy Haughey.  Mr. Paddy Lalor, MEP, Vice-President of the European Parliament said that there had to be a reasonable financial return to the oil companies for their efforts.  Fianna Fáil told the taxpayers that they would screw the oil companies and they told the oil companies that they would give them an easier ride than the present Government.  Does our problem arise because we are throwing tax and grant concessions at companies, as illustrated in the problems the Opposition are having at present with regard to natural resources?  The oil is there.  The Irish companies should dictate the terms and any money made from oil exploration should be used for capital and infrastructural projects and not for buying popularity. That appears to be the last hope of the Opposition to relieve the tax burden.</P>

      <P>I have confidence that this Minister will do the right thing for the economy.  The Minister has laid great emphasis on improving conditions for people in manufacturing industry.  There are incentives and if there is to be any long term relief of the unemployment problem surely it will be through the growth of manufacturing industry.  When the next general election is fought the incoming Government will find an economy well placed for growth, with public finances brought under control, a check system in place on national waste and they will find that the future of our young people is assured.</P>

      <P>Because this budget contains no measures to stimulate economic growth, it fails to meet the needs of the nation today and must be rejected by the Dáil.  It has already been rejected by the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The formulation of economic and financial proposals for the coming year provided the Government with an opportunity to face the reality of our present situation and to make plans, based on that reality, to commence a programme of economic recovery.  That would have involved a frank acknowledgment that the policies pursued over the last three years have not worked.  It would also have involved an admission that the document, <i>Building on Reality,</i> is no longer relevant, that the targets and projections of that document have been abandoned and a statement that the document itself <Col N="1614" /> was being withdrawn and replaced by a new strategy.</P>
    <P>This has not happened.  The 1986 budget represents a continuation of existing Government policies.  The opportunity it provided to make a new start has been missed.</P>
    <P>The Government propose that we continue along the same dismal policy path in 1986 as we have been doing for the last three years.  There will be continuing mass unemployment, exorbitant taxes, a further major increase in the national debt and still more harmful cutbacks in essential services, an outbreak of which we have seen in the last two days.  It is quite clear that this budget is simply going to give us more of the same.  There is no attempt to turn the economy around and start it moving in a new direction &mdash; a direction which would offer hope to a people who are deeply depressed and dispirited.</P>
    <P>The year 1985 was another bad one for the Irish people, the third in succession. During 1985, economic growth came to a standstill and unemployment went up again to reach its highest level ever.  As firm after firm closed down, more and more people lost confidence in their own country and emigration increased steadily.</P>
    <P>But that was not the prospect offered by this Government and this Minister for Finance at budget time last year.  Speaking in the 1985 budget debate, the Minister for Finance said, and I would like the House to listen particularly to these words: &ldquo;At the beginning of 1985, the economy is, therefore, well placed for the substained expansion which is envisaged in the plan&rdquo;.  That famous document, <i>Building on Reality</i>, which is becoming a kind of economic museum piece, includes the following statement:</P>
    <P>In the final analysis, the success of any economic policy can be judged only by its impact on economic activity within the State, account being taken of the extent to which benefits are captured through numbers employed, levels of income, taxes and profits.</P>
    <P>By those standards, which were set by <Col N="1615" /> this Government for themselves after being two years in office, their economic policy, which has brought growth to a standstill, created no new employment, pushed unemployment higher and higher, reduced incomes and profits, increased taxes, must be judged as a total failure.  The depressing reality is that the existing policies which have brought us to the present disastrous economic and social situations are to be continued by this budget through 1986.</P>
    <P>In my view, the high taxation policies of the Government have contributed more than any other single factor to reducing the economy to its present depressed state.</P>
    <P>The existing levels of taxation, particularly personal taxation, are in a very large measure responsible for the prevailing mood of frustration, low morale and lack of confidence.  They are choking enterprise and initiative and preventing investment and development in practically every area of the economy.</P>
    <P>It is our view that this Government made a fundamental error of judgement when on assuming office, they gave complete priority, to the exclusion of all other economic and social objectives, not just to balancing the books but to achieving that balance mainly through the imposition of higher taxes.</P>
    <P>From that crucial and erroneous decision, practically everything else has followed. Immediately on assuming office in 1981, they introduced a supplementary budget which imposed savage increases in taxation, thereby dealing a severe blow to an economy which was already feeling the effects of the international recession.</P>
    <P>Since then, they have piled tax upon tax in every single year that followed.  As a result, by the end of this year they will have taken over £2 billion extra in taxes from the people and out of the economy. This high taxation policy has depressed our economy further and further until we have now finally reached the present farreaching crisis situation.</P>
    <P>It is absurd for this Government to attempt to deny the existence of the deep seated crisis in which we find ourselves <Col N="1616" /> when we have officially 240,000 people unemployed &mdash; officially 240,000, but as we all know, the figure is far higher &mdash; the highest ever current deficit, an enormous increase in Government borrowing, gone up from £12 billion when they took office to more than £20 billion today, and in the national debt.</P>
    <P>The extent of the economic and financial crisis manifests itself in many ways. Perhaps the most chilling aspect of the crisis is the fact that national output is declining and revenues are falling, even though the rates of taxes are being increased.  The entire Irish economy today is in a state of diminishing returns.</P>
    <P>Over the last four years, revenue has persistently fallen short of budget targets. The cumulative shortfall for four years has now reached £545 million.  Last year's shortfall of £123 million must surely set the alarm bells ringing.  Revenue actually realised was a staggering £123 million less than the target set.  For four years now, what has been happening is that the amount of revenue the Government have been attempting to raise has been greatly in excess of any anticipated growth rate.</P>
    <P>In 1982, revenue was increased by 23.5 per cent on the previous year which was 9.75 per cent above the nominal rate of growth in GNP.  In 1983, revenue was increased by 15.5 per cent compared with a nominal growth in GNP of 9 per cent.  In 1985, however, the inevitable happened when the attempt to raise revenue by 7.5 per cent as against a nominal GNP growth rate of 5 per cent failed.  The revenue refused to rise above the rise in nominal GNP.  The process of taking more tax out of the economy than the rise in nominal GNP year after year when the economy was in deep recession could not continue indefinitely.</P>
    <P>The experience of the last four years has great significance for this year's budget.  It must cast serious doubt on the credibility of forecasts in the budget for tax revenue in 1986.  That revenue is forecast once again to be well in excess of any possible nominal rise in GNP.  The actual outcome of the last three years indicates, however, that this is not likely to be achieved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1617" /> The steady deterioration in the public finances over the past three years is perhaps most starkly indicated by the increase in the current budget deficit. Last year, at £1,284 million or 8.2 per cent of GNP, it was at the highest level ever in the history of the State.  This year it will continue at a similar level and this Government, instead of eliminating the current budget deficit over a period of years, are in fact eliminating the public capital programme.</P>
    <P>Is there any point in even mentioning at this stage that the current budget deficit projected for 1986 is about £180 million higher than the target set in <i>Building on Reality</i>?  As the current budget deficit has risen and used up more and more of the amount borrowed by the Exchequer, the capital budget has been reduced each year accordingly.  More and more money borrowed by this incompetent Government is going to meet the current budget deficit and less and less is available for investment in the economy through the public capital programme.  That is the record of the past three years.</P>
    <P>Before the budget was published, the public capital programme had been cut back to £1,706 million.  Incredibly, a further £25 million was cut in that amount and announced in the budget.  This, of course, is in complete contradiction to a statement in the 1986 public capital programme booklet which, speaking of the programme, states:</P>
    <P>This reflects the pivotal role of State investment in the achievement of the objectives of long term growth and employment creation.</P>
    <P>These are the Government's own words but despite the clear statement in this year's public capital programme booklet about the fundamental importance of the programme in generating investment and economic activity, the record shows a consistent reduction in the public capital programme during the past three years. This is, of course, economic madness.  In money terms, the decline is from £1,835 million in 1982 to £1,681 million in 1986 &mdash; a reduction in real terms of about <Col N="1618" /> one-third.  The decline in our investment programme is from 15 per cent of GNP in 1982 to 10 per cent of GNP this year. That sums is all up.  Where are we going when we are actually reducing the proportion of GNP invested in future economic developments from 15 per cent to 10 per cent?  In the budget the Minister for Finance announced an additional cut of £25 million in the capital programme. Of course the reason for the additional cut in capital expenditure is clear and I want to explain it to the House.  It is typical of the deceptive approach of this Government towards our public finances. I use that word &ldquo;deceptive&rdquo; advisedly here in this House.  For window-dressing, presentational purposes, it was obviously necessary to appear to reduce total public sector borrowing requirement &mdash; the Thatcherite phrase we must always keep in mind &mdash; from 15.7 per cent of GNP in 1985 to 14.2 per cent in 1986.  In order to make it look well the figure had to be reduced to 14.2 per cent in 1986.  When that could not be achieved through the management of current expenditure and the current budget deficit had to be presented as £1,250 million, then the only thing was to take this additional £25 million off the capital programme so that the right percentage of GNP for public sector borrowing could be presented to the public.  This is a cynical and unforgiveable piece of manipulation of the public finances.  Here we have a case of necessary and desirable capital expenditures already included in the public capital programme being cancelled so that the public sector borrowing requirement can be presented to the public in a favourable light.</P>
    <P>The depressing reality about this area of the public finances is that while Government borrowing and the national debt kept on rising steadily, spiralling upwards, the amount available for economic development and infrastructure is being steadily reduced.  What a contradiction in terms there is in this. The Government are borrowing more and more, the national debt is going up and up but less and less is being invested in the national economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1619" /> When this major reduction in State investment through the public capital programme is added to the heavy increases in taxation which have been imposed, it is not surprising that we have reached a stage of cessation of growth in national output and permanent mass unemployment.  For the last three years each winter has brought another sickening rise in the level of unemployment.  In December 1985 alone, the figure rose by another 12,000 to bring it to the unprecedented level of 240,000.  As we know, that is a serious understatement of the actual position.  Our disastrous experience in rising unemployment must be starkly contrasted with the completely different situation in the rest of the EC. In most other countries in the Community unemployment has practically stopped rising since the end of 1983.</P>
    <P>The average rise in unemployment in the EC was just above 1 per cent in the nine months to September 1985, whereas the rise here in Ireland was 8.5 per cent. While the Community as a whole were keeping their rising unemployment to 1 per cent, we were actually pushing ours up by 8.5 per cent.  This denies this Coalition Government any excuse of pointing to a world-wide or Community situation as being responsible for our unemployment rate.</P>
    <P>At 18 per cent our unemployment rate is the highest in the entire Community. This is despite the fact that in last year's budget this Minister for Finance had the audacity to tell us that employment would begin to go up in 1985.  But it did not and the few limited measures brought forward in a flurry of public relations by the Government in October had no real effect on the outcome.  The annoying feature of the situation is that, even as late as November, a Government statement to the people claimed that:</P>
    <P>This package of measures to combat unemployment announced last week should further consolidate the improving trend indicated by today's figures.</P>
    <P>The following month, December, we had <Col N="1620" /> an increase of 12,000 in the figure.  In this whole area of employment and emigration, this Government have been and still are totally dishonest.  They have made a series of false claims and unreliable projections to the extent that they have lost all credibility.  Right through 1985, the Taoiseach, who on coming into office made the statement that he would always tell the people the truth, made a series of misleading statements one after the other to try to conceal from the people what exactly the situation was in regard to unemployment and emigration.  Even now, he will not come clean on the issue of emigration.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that my young colleague, Deputy Francis Fahey from Galway, is consistently trying to address questions to the Taoiseach on emigration and that the Taoiseach is equally consistently, through the use of parliamentary devices, avoiding answering those questions. It is my belief that were it not for the fact that the official figures of the live register have to be published every month we would not get the truth about unemployment either no more than we are getting it about emigration.  The true position is that emigration continues unabated.  The Central Statistics Office passenger figures would suggest that emigration was running at around 30,000 in 1984.  The figures for the first six months in 1985 appear to be running at even higher levels still.  This re-appearance of emigration in Irish national life is morally and psychologically the worst failure of the Government.  It is a national humiliation and a constant reproach to the Government and their policies.</P>
    <P>While the reduction of VAT on restaurants and selected services are welcome, they can only be of marginal effect and they are not related to any current strategy for employment.  In fact there are quite a number of specific actions taken in the budget which will have a directly adverse effect on jobs, which will curtail investment and depress business activity and employment.  The continuing reductions in investment, especially the reduction in public capital expenditure on building and construction and the decision <Col N="1621" /> to take £536 million more in taxes out of the economy this year, will create further deflationary pressures.  The Taoiseach said only last November in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham &mdash; I had the doubtful pleasure of hearing him &mdash; that:</P>
    <P>The Government remain convinced that the economic strategy of stimulating growth is the only realistic approach to job creation and to the improvement of our national finances.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach actually meant that why then did he not give us a budget that would stimulate growth instead of one which will depress the economy even further? Were his words in Kilmainham in fact just so much empty verbiage?</P>
    <P>The principal new feature of this year's budget was the introduction of a withholding tax on interest paid on deposits in banks and other financial institutions.</P>
    <P>Let us be absolutely clear that this is not a new levey on banks and financial institutions for the benefit of the income tax payer.  It is simply a means of collecting more income tax from the public and the general body of income tax payers. The financial institutions concerned will not pay one penny more as a result of these changes.</P>
    <P>To a considerable extent this new measure represents a book-keeping trick. It will have the effect of bringing forward revenue in the form of income tax that would normally be paid in the following year into this year so that in respect of a large amount of the tax payable on deposit interest the Government will take credit for two years' income in this one year.</P>
    <P>It is certain in one way or another to generate an increase in bank interest rates and building society mortgage rates. Bank interest rates have been increased and building societies have already indicated that a rise in mortgage rates is very likely on the way as a result of these changes.</P>
    <P>A very objectionable aspect of this new collection mechanism is that it will be grossly unfair and discriminatory in so far as small savers and those on low incomes <Col N="1622" /> are concerned, especially retired persons living on savings.</P>
    <P>For individuals who because their incomes are small are not liable to income tax this new system will mean that they will pay income tax on income which is not taxable.  Income tax will be deducted by the financial institutions from the interest payable to the depositor and paid over to the Government, and even though the person concerned is not liable to tax he or she will not be able to claim it back.  This is unjust and inequitable.  A sizeable proportion of the small deposits in our financial institutions would represent the life savings of older people and the interest on these deposits would represent a vital part of their small incomes.  The Government propose to confiscate 35 per cent of that income.  I use the word &ldquo;confiscate&rdquo; advisedly because, as these people would not be liable for income tax on the interest, they should be able to reclaim the tax deducted.  They will not however be able to do so under these new provisions.  In respect of one particular, group of people it can clearly be identified as naked confiscation of a portion of their income.</P>
    <P>A married couple living on a contributory old age pension will receive just under £5,000 a year from July of this year &mdash; but their tax exemption limit will be at least £6,300.  This means that over and above their old age pension they would be entitled to receive another £1,300 or more in deposit interest before they would become liable for income tax.  But income tax at 35 per cent will be deducted from their deposit interest at source and they will not be entitled to claim it back. This is a glaring piece of injustice arising from this new provision which must be put right.  This is not a tax on banks or financial institutions.  In that, and many other cases, it is a confiscation of income from those on low incomes.</P>
    <P>Here let me draw attention to one particularly glaring instance of contradiction in the approach of the Minister for Finance in this budget.  In so far as the commercial banks are concerned, he is now giving them the benefit and the privilege <Col N="1623" /> of non-disclosure.  From now on individuals, no matter how wealthy, will be entitled to place their money on deposit with a commercial bank and that bank will not be permitted to disclose to the Revenue Commissioners either the amount of the deposit or of the interest paid.  On the other hand, the VHI, a State body which deals with the health of the people, an area which traditionally has been regarded as one where complete confidentiality should prevail, will in future be compelled to disclose personal financial information about both patients and doctors.  We will not have the absurd situation where a businessman who may be engaged in some doubtful area of commerce will be entitled to hide his money away in complete secrecy with a financial institution while the law abiding citizen who is prudent enough to provide for his or her own health care will be compelled to reveal through the VHI their private medical history to the Revenue Commissioners.  There is something about this divergence in the treatment of two different groups of citizens which is disturbing.</P>
    <P>The world money markets are in a very volatile state at present.  The psychology of the market place should always be taken into account when long established practices are being changed whatever the reasons for the change may be.  It is legitimate to ask if the Government gave full consideration to the likely overall effects on savings, financial stability and the operations of the financial institutions, of the radical change made in this budget in the arrangements governing those financial institutions.  The events of the last few days leave many of us with a suspicion that they are not unconnected with the approach of the Minister for Finance in the budget.</P>
    <P>Everybody is putting a brave face on it, but there is fairly widespread questioning about its wider long-term implications. This is particularly true in the case of the life assurance world.  This sudden imposition out of the blue of a direct tax on the income to assurance companies must <Col N="1624" /> have serious detrimental implications for their future operations.  People contributing to pension schemes and endeavouring to provide for their retirement through life assurance and related schemes will certainly be affected adversely and are perturbed about this action by the Government.</P>
    <P>A new child benefit scheme announced by the Minister in the budget has been rightly described as a confidence trick. The first thing to be noted about it is that it will supplant the existing children's allowances scheme.  The value of children's allowances has declined considerably over recent years because of a consistent failure of the Coalition to increase them in line with inflation. Accordingly, the increase now proposed of £3 per child per month does not represent any significant improvement.  This is especially so when we set against it the failure to extend the 4 per cent social welfare increase to child dependent allowances and abolition of the existing £100 child tax allowance.  The reality is that the vast majority of families will get no increase in support for their children.</P>
    <P>The increase of 4 per cent is completely inadequate and it is deplorable that it will not be paid until the third week in July.  The Minister for Finance admits that the budget itself will raise the rate of inflation to at least 4.5 per cent and it is possible and likely that developments in the exchange rate of the Irish pound during the year could push it higher still.  A reduction in food subsidies in April will further increase the cost of living for social welfare recipients.  Many Deputies and commentators have already pointed out the hardship that will arise from the fact that while the additional cost and charges imposed in the budget on pensioners, lower income families and the unemployed will have immediate effect on household budgets, the small increase in social welfare will not come into effect until the third week in July which is the latest date ever.  The poorest sections will have to pay all the increases immediately without any compensation until July.</P>
    <P>That there is a serious hardship and <Col N="1625" /> deprivation among those who rely on social welfare for their standard of living is undeniable.  It is a fact of life today that for well over one-third of our population, life is a constant daily struggle to make ends meet.  This is a permanent state of affairs, not something that arises from time to time for them.  There is no scope for the occasional luxury or the odd extra; it is the basic requirements &mdash; food, rent, heating and clothing that are the constant worry of countless thousands of housewives.</P>
    <P>In this situation, a 4 per cent increase in social welfare benefits is almost completely meaningless.  It will certainly bring no improvement in the circumstances of those on lower incomes.  In the vast majority of cases, it will not make things any easier and as the year progresses, it is almost certain that their situation will actually disimprove.  No matter how difficult the economic or financial situation may be, a Government have a moral duty to protect the living standards of those who are their special responsibility. This Government are simply not doing that.  The Government made a very cold mathematical calculation this year. Their statistics show that the rate of inflation will be 4 per cent and that is the increase in social welfare recipients are going to get and not a penny more.  That was not a very generous approach; the calculation is just a little too fine, too exact; there is no allowance for any margin of error or any inaccuracy in their measurement of the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Another stated objective of the Minister for Finance in the budget is to achieve a major shift from direct to indirect taxation. This in itself, of course, militates decisively against the lower income section of the community and shifts more of the burden of taxation on to them.</P>
    <P>I want to say calmly and without any degree of either emotion or exaggeration, that the social welfare provisions of the Coalition in this budget are a disgrace. The denial of the 4 per cent increase in the allowance for children specifically highlights and typifies their mean and miserable approach.</P>
    <P>No one would seriously suggest that <Col N="1626" /> this Government deliberately framed a budget which is anti-family.  What they can be accused of, however, is failing to understand or recognise that the combined effect of a number of different measures in the budget is very detrimental to families with children.</P>
    <P>The increase in the standard VAT rate from 23 per cent to 25 per cent will increase the cost of practically all household purchases.  The income tax allowance for children has been abolished.  The miserly increase of 4 per cent in social welfare rates has not been extended to the children of the family.  Nothing was done to compensate for the forthcoming rise in the price of bread and butter which will follow the reduction in the food subsidy in about a month's time.</P>
    <P>I have heard and read speeches by the Taoiseach in which he has given expression to the finest caring humanitarian sentiments one could wish to hear.  This miserable 4 per cent and its denial to the family makes a mockery of them all.</P>
    <P>For the overwhelming majority of individuals, the income tax reliefs granted in this budget will be of marginal effect. They will not change the fact that we are the highest taxed country in the European Community and what relief there is will be greater for those at the higher end than for those at the lower end of the income scales.  It is very much in keeping with the standard, traditional Fine Gael policy and outlook.</P>
    <P>In the case of the overwhelming majority of taxpayers, however, the relatively minor reliefs in income tax will be more than wiped out by the taxes on motoring, beer, spirits, cigarettes, by increased VAT on household goods, increased charges for all kinds of services and higher bank interest and mortgage repayments. Even through the top rate of tax has been marginally reduced, a single person will still be paying a top rate of tax on an income of £10,500 and a married couple on an income of less than £20,000. Fianna Fáil see the high taxation policies of this Government, which are in no way altered by this budget, as being a principal cause of the depression in the economy and the record rise in <Col N="1627" /> unemployment.  We believe that a substantial reduction in personal taxation, in particular, must be an essential ingredient of any programme of economic recovery. This budget has achieved nothing of any significance in this vital area.  In fact, the truth is that overall the Government will collect an extra £217 million from the income tax payers of this country in 1986.  That is the figure that matters, not presentational aspects by the Minister for Finance or Government speakers. Here let me quote Paul Tansey in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> last Sunday:</P>
    <P>The slick selling of the 1986 budget cannot disguise the fact that the personal tax burden will increase significantly during the year if the government's taxation plans are realised. Taxes on both personal income and personal spending will rise rather than fail as a result of the budget.</P>
    <P>Taxes on personal income will rise more than twice as rapidly as inflation this year.  As a result, direct taxes on personal incomes will account for a higher proportion of Gross National Product than ever before.</P>
    <P>Taxes on personal income &mdash; income tax itself, the Youth Employment Levy and a quarter's contribution from the 1% Income Levy, are expected to yield £2,477 million this year.  That represents an increase of £217 million or 9.6% on the £2,103 million raised by the government last year.  Since the government anticipates that the inflation rate will rise by only 4.5% this year, the increase in the personal tax burden will run at more than twice the expected inflation rate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As far back as the summer of 1983, we on this side of the House were making the case for selective self-financing cuts in taxation.  As the economy was going into an era of diminishing returns in many revenue areas, that seemed to us to be eminently sensible.  Having first dismissed the idea, the Minister for Finance, finally and grudgingly in the autumn of 1984, introduced some cuts in excise duties on an experimental basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1628" /> In our view, and in the view of the people engaged in the trades concerned, these cuts have been successful.  For some perverse reason, however, the Government will not acknowledge this success and are engaged in arguments which seek to deny the benefits that accrued and to justify their not proceeding further along this road.  We all heard the convoluted attempt by the Taoiseach on budget night to make that case.  He did not convince anyone on this side of the House, whatever about his own side.</P>
    <P>We have done our calculations and are satisfied that there has been and can be a still greater gain for both the Exchequer, in pure revenue terms, and the economy in increased activity and jobs by further self financing cuts in taxation.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in this budget, the Minister has now reverted to the old sterile process of imposing higher and higher taxes to bring in more revenue, whatever the cost in general economic terms and the danger of diminishing returns.</P>
    <P>This is a complex area, but the benefits would be very considerable if the concept is right and properly and selectively implemented.  I would, therefore, urge that an impartial examination be carried out by some outside agency which, having taken all factors into account, would give us an objective assessment.</P>
    <P>There are two others areas which should be examined also; the excise yield from petroleum products has increased by £160 million, but the quantity sold is down by almost one-third.  VAT on new houses has been increased from 3 per cent to 10 per cent since 1982 and private house production has declined by over 4,000 and employment in the construction industry has been halved.  A cost benefit study of taxation policy in these two areas would surely be well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>This Government have made a complete mess of the whole situation in regard to farmer taxation.  The Minister for Finance has had the humiliation of having to come before the Dáil and announce in this budget that, a year and a half after it had been introduced with such a flourish, the land tax will not become operative in 1986.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1629" /> Fianna Fáil never had any doubts about the true nature of this proposed land tax. It was an expedient not based on any principles of equity or sound taxation policy, rushed in hurriedly to meet a political crisis in the Coalition.  Fianna Fáil stated at the time that in our view the right way to proceed was to have farmers pay income tax on their incomes the same as every other section of the community and that the abolition of income tax for the majority of farmers was a mistake. These recent developments prove that we were right in that opinion.</P>
    <P>I recall the Tánaiste and Leader of the Labour Party stating at the time of the introduction of the new land tax &mdash; and it is no harm to recall these things from time to time &mdash; that:</P>
    <P>The new arrangements will be devised to increase the yield from farmer taxation in 1986 to about twice the level produced by the present system.  This objective of increasing the yield is an absolutely critical factor and the legislation will be designed to ensure that the administration and collection of the tax will be fully effective.</P>
    <P>Far from producing double the yield, the land tax will produce nothing in 1986. The Minister for Finance has been forced to do an about-turn and extend income tax for another year, but he has also been forced into the sorry admission that he cannot put any estimate on what it will yield.</P>
    <P>The situation in regard to the taxation of farmers is now one of total confusion. This Government stand convicted of political manoeuvering resulting in a clear dereliction of their responsibilities in this important area, farmer taxation, an area which is important from the point of view of tax equity and badly needed revenue.</P>
    <P>Despite many claims and statements to the contrary this Coalition Government have no policy for taxation.  Their actions and statements in the area of taxation over the last three years have been a mass of contradictions and inconsistencies. They put the highest rate of income tax up to 65 per cent, they brought it down <Col N="1630" /> to 60 per cent, and now down to 58 per cent.  They put VAT rates up to exorbitantly high levels, then brought them down, and now in this budget have put them up again.  We have had the virtual dismissal of the reports of the Commission on Taxation.  After all the protestations about equity and reform and shifting the burden of taxation on to those who can best carry it, we have in this budget a change-over which is universally recognised as being regressive, and bearing much more heavily on the lower income section of the community. This budget clearly shifts the burden of tax from direct to indirect and the Minister stated that that was one of his objectives.  How can this be justified on the grounds of equity?  How can this be reconciled with the frequently stated objective of this Government of spreading the tax burden more fairly throughout the community?  Every student of economics knows that a shift from direct to indirect taxation is in fact acting in an unfair manner against the lower income section of the community.</P>
    <P>In the table of contents of the budget speech this year there are 87 headings and subheadings but the word &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; does not appear in one of them.  The only item related to agriculture is one solitary heading entitled &ldquo;Farmer Taxation&rdquo;.  The approach and attitude of this Government to agriculture is exemplified by the total absence of any reference to it in the budget.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to decide whether this attitude derives from a supercilious Dublin 4 hostility to farmers or just plain indifference.  Is it necessary to remind this Government of the fundamental role of agriculture in the Irish economy?  Agriculture employs directly 15 per cent of the workforce &mdash; I want to give these figures in case the Minister has forgotten them &mdash; and accounts for over £1.5 billion in exports.  Just now when there is a major shift in European Community policies to the disadvantage of Irish agriculture and when the European outlook is becoming increasingly doubtful and difficult for Irish farmers, the Irish Government should be giving increasing attention to <Col N="1631" /> the problems facing Irish farming.  Domestic agricultural expenditure should be so structured as to make maximum benefit of EC funds.  Something must be done urgently about our beef cow herd, which has fallen from three quarters of a million to 400,000 in ten years, before it too becomes subject to quotas.  With domestic interest rates so high there is still a case for cheap guaranteed European loans, at least for development farmers. This Government's neglect of our primary industry, agriculture, is a national scandal.  A budget speech which gives no indication of any support for agriculture or even an assessment of its prospects or its contribution to the economy, cannot be taken seriously as a statement of economic policy.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will seek the support of the people in the next general election on the basis of an Action Programme for Economic Recovery.  Monetarist policies have been tried and found wanting.  They have not worked.  Economic recovery is an urgent national necessity to restore national morale and social solidarity. Unless it can be got under way soon the strains and stresses on community life will reach breaking point.  Mass unemployment as a permanent feature of life brings increasing alienation and confrontation with more and more young people turning against the institutions of State. The higher taxes needed to pay unemployment benefit cause resentment and disillusionment and as the morale of the working population sinks, the black economy flourishes.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive action programme for national recovery must be formulated on the basis of the existing economic and financial realities.  This can be done and it is nonsense to suggest that because the financial situation is difficult, economic recovery cannot be attempted.  It is precisely because there is deep-seated economic recession that a programme of economic recovery is necessary.</P>
    <P>We see this Government's preoccupation with the financial difficulties and a blind refusal to look beyond them as the principal intellectual constraint on any <Col N="1632" /> attempt to initiate economic revival.  The obsession with budgetary arithmetic to the exclusion of everything else is preventing positive thinking.  It is an intellectual straitjacket.  The pluses and minuses of the budget arithmetic have become the reality, not the economy, but we must break out of this straitjacket.  In fact, it is not civil war politics that this country needs to get away from but Victorian economics and financial precepts.</P>
    <P>In planning our economic recovery we must be conscious of the fact that despite the awful climate of defeatism created by this Government and their policies, we do have many resources and great economic potential.  The modern world is one of new opportunities even though this Government see only problems and constraints.</P>
    <P>The new industrial revolution the information-technology revolution is likely to continue at a very rapid rate over the foreseeable future.  For many countries this brings the fear of job losses, but for us in Ireland, it is a Heaven-sent opportunity.  It represents a possibility of competing on equal terms in a way that was never possible in the old traditional sectors.  This is a period of fundamental innovation and development, with new markets being created all the time and with endless scope for us to take a share in these markets.</P>
    <P>In this new industrial revolution, we do not have to compete with the large industrial nations who in the past dominated world markets in old industries like shipbuilding and heavy engineering industries where the economies of scale gave them an insurable advantage.  Today there is a new ball game with totally different dimensions and demanding different resources and abilities.  We have a great opportunity to excel in these new areas which do not involve competing with well entrenched countries in existing markets.  Fortunately for us, the determinants of success in information technology and associated industries are knowledge, intelligence and education and not huge fixed assets or large concentrated workforces.  We can have highly successful small firms in computer software <Col N="1633" /> and in valuable components for high-tech international programmes for instance.  We have in Ireland the right kind of educated flexible labour force for this new world.  The micro-electronic revolution is a golden opportunity for us if we grasp it.  We have access to the right market and our small size means that we can have a major increase in output without distorting world markets or having to substantially upset existing market shares.</P>
    <P>In the past we lacked industrial and entrepreneurial skills and experience in developing products, through industrial innovation, research and design.  But the sixties and seventies have changed that and instead of complaining about being too heavily dependent on multinationals we should see the period of their arrival here as creating the foundation from which a leap forward in new high-technology industrial development can take place, building on the wave of new products and techniques they brought.  In terms of an industrial resource and technological base, the situation is better now than it has ever been in our history.</P>
    <P>We have now a different type of industrial and commercial community from when we started the present phase of development 30 years ago.  We have built up over the past decades a reservoir of skills and personal resources necessary for the development of a new type of strong exporting indigeneous industry. The potential is there if we decide to go after it.</P>
    <P>We must be active in developing efficient companies with quality products meeting market needs here and overseas, whether these companies are private, State owned or joint ventures, whether they are big or small.  We must give a further emphasis to science and technology, which is an important component of international competitiveness.  Failure to bring forward new products has led to the decline of many firms in our economy. The identification and development of new products must be accorded a higher priority than hitherto.  Food processing, mari-culture, products based on national <Col N="1634" /> resources such as forestry, micro-electronics, information technology, biotechnology, chemical and pharmaceutical products &mdash; these are the sort of areas that we should be concentrating on because we can win in these areas.</P>
    <P>A national programme for technological innovation outlined in our policy document will be developed by us to raise the level of innovation and technology transfer to Irish firms.  We intend to improve linkage between third level colleges and industry, including the establishment of enterprise centres in third level colleges, and seek a greater market industrial spin-off from higher education. Our document on science and technology charts the way for a major input from our scientists, engineers, chemists and technologists into a dynamic innovative new sector of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>There are strong grounds for considering the establishment from the existing State support agencies of an industrial and commercial advisory service similar to the agricultural advisory service.  At present the YEA can provide some advisory support to community enterprises and the IDA and Shannon Development in the mid-west provide advice to existing and intending small businesses in manufacturing and some limited services but many types of firms and potential entrepreneurs are not covered by the existing framework.</P>
    <P>A programme of economic recovery must involve a complete reorganisation of the taxation structure, an increase in the public capital programme, a mobilisation of private investments for economic development and the creation of a favourable climate for private investment.</P>
    <P>A significant reduction in personal taxation is an essential to economic recovery. The present crucifying levels of personal taxation are choking enterprise and initiative, because the rewards of endeavour are snatched away by taxation, whether that endeavour is in the form of private enterprise or extra earnings on the factory floor.  To restore national morale and confidence, it is also necessary to give everyone confidence in <Col N="1635" /> the taxation system and to inspire the belief that it is equitable and that all are paying their fair share.</P>
    <P>The first step in this area is to implement the reforms recommended in the Fifth Report of the Commission on Taxation. That report proposed a comprehensive range of measures for a more efficient and effective tax administration, including assessment, collection and enforcement.  In particular, it proposed a system of self-assessment for the selfemployed, with effective sample auditing and definite automatic penalties.  This could certainly bring about a significant increase in the tax collected from the non-PAYE sector.  With an efficient tax administration all would pay their taxes within an equitable system coupled with lower tax rates than at present.</P>
    <P>Interest rates and exchange policy are becoming increasingly inportant elements in the management of the Irish economy.  High interest rates have had a very real restrictive impact on the economy, discouraging investment and multiplying business failures.  We must aim at the lowest level of interest rates and there should be a clearly stated policy for this area.</P>
    <P>The rate of exchange of the Irish pound is also of crucial importance either in promoting or inhibiting exports.  Here again a clearly stated policy is called for. The Economic Background to the Budget makes the following statement: &ldquo;The protection of the external value of the Irish pound is the primary aim of monetary policy.&rdquo;  We must ask whether that represents an actual statement of policy or whether it is just one of those ritual statements made from time to time to prevent any speculation in the market place.  Neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Finance has made any statement about the value of the Irish pound. Vague statements of intent such as the one I have quoted are not a substitute for policy.</P>
    <P>Ours is an open-ended economy.  We rely heavily on our export trade for economic progress and development.  We should have the best possible calculation <Col N="1636" /> as to what exact external value of the Irish pound is in our best interest and formulate our exchange rate policy accordingly.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Kennedy, has been asking for such a statement for three or four weeks.  It is most irresponsible of the Government that we have not got a clear statement of policy in this area either by the Taoiseach or by the Minister for Finance.  As far as we can see, the market place is being let run riot.  We have had no indication of any kind of the Government's intentions, their objectives or what they would like to see happen.</P>
    <P>An expanded and revised public capital programme is urgently needed.  Over the last three years, the public capital programme has been decimated.  It has been reduced by one third.</P>
    <P>In this year's booklet published by the Government, the statement to which I have already referred emphasises the basic importance of the public capital programme as an engine of growth and development.  The resources have to be found for an expanded programme and the thrust of the programme itself has to be redirected towards positive, specific investment projects.  Two other things are necessary.  First, the public capital programme should be dovetailed into the reorganised taxation structure so that both will be working towards the same objective with tax incentives related towards capital investment projects. Secondly, there should be a completely new drive to mobilise investment funds to support the public capital programme and to parallel it in appropriate areas.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have been attacked about our proposal to invest an additional £200 million in the building and construction industry to get it moving again.  We have had the stereotyped rejection from Government commentators on the grounds that it would involve more State borrowing.  They prefer to borrow to pay dole rather than to put the money into building and construction.  But it need not because I am certain there would be no difficulty whatever in securing this <Col N="1637" /> level of investment and more, through suitable arrangements with the building societies and other financial institutions.</P>
    <P>By cutting back the public capital programme as they have done, the Government are in effect saying that there are no worthwhile projects available to invest in.  That is absurd and certainly does not offer any great encouragement to the private sector to invest.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are fully committed on return to office to a revival of the construction industry through investment in high-yielding projects.  This will: (1) give a significant stimulus to the economy generally; (2) boost confidence and morale in an important area; (3) take workers directly and immediately off the dole queues and (4) improve our infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Our investment projects would include, tourist development, enterprise centres in third level institutions, motorways, by-passes and the road network generally, decentralisation projects and infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Britain and France, though in the middle of an economic recession, are about to undertake one of the biggest construction projects ever.  Should we not be thinking along the same lines with, of course, European Community involvement?</P>
    <P>Our full tourist potential is not being realised.  High prices, high taxes, inadequate supply of facilities are severely limiting factors on growth and development. There is no overall direction and policy initiatives are made on a piecemeal basis.  VAT goes up and VAT goes down, excise duty on spirits goes down and then goes up, a few minor hotel grants are thrown in for good measure.  We need a clear, consistent strategy for the industry which would identify the inputs from the relevant agencies, the level of resources to be committed, the priority locations and tourism products to be developed.</P>
    <P>The right energy policy is a key element in a programme of economic development. Energy is one of the few areas where recent developments have been favourable from our point of view.  We have our own supply of natural gas and <Col N="1638" /> oil prices are falling dramatically on the international markets.  But we must fully and urgently exploit this situation for economic development.</P>
    <P>For many years now the high cost of energy has placed a very heavy burden on industrial costs and affected our competitiveness. Natural gas must now be used widely and extensively as a flexible instrument of economic development. There is no point in leaving the gas stored up for the year 2,000 when the whole emergy situation may have changed.  If these gas finds off our coast are to be developed and if even the present field is to be used adequately after the ESB present usage diminishes drastically when Moneypoint comes on stream a much more dynamic approach is needed. Investment in natural gas projects are remunerative in every sense of the word. It is difficult to understand why this Government do not press ahead with all possible speed in the development of the natural gas network.  We will do that instead of slowing it down by the exercise of excessive bureaucratic control as this Government are doing.</P>
    <P>By the end of this year, Bord Gáis Éireann will have paid over £300 million to the Exchequer.  That has been a very welcome injection into the Exchequer, but in my view it is bad economic policy to maximise the financial return to the Exchequer in that way.  A far better economic return could be procured if a flexible pricing policy were used and natural gas supplied at favourable rates to key areas to stimulate economic development and job creation.  In this way the return to both the economy and Exchequer would be infinitely greater.</P>
    <P>In this country the whole area of mining exploration has been badly handled in recent years.  We need a new orientation with a programme of onshore exploration, so that mining can make its full contribution to economic development.  An attractive climate for exploration needs to be set out by the Government in order to attract investment. The necessary risk capital is available internationally for this very specialised type of risk investment, but it <Col N="1639" /> will not be forthcoming until clear and reasonable terms are outlined by the Government on the basis of which really significant development could take place.</P>
    <P>We will develop the neglected marine wealth around our shores in order to make a significant contribution to the economy.  State investment in fisheries today is less than half in real terms what it was in 1982.  The new department of the marine and the implementation of a national marine policy will give a major boost to research and exploration and to the development of fish farming, fish processing and marine related industries. We will set up such a department.</P>
    <P>The full scale development of the forestry and timber industry can make a major contribution to an expanding Irish economy.  Ireland's capacity to grow trees quickly is one of our great natural advantages. The international market for timber is a buoyant one.  It is estimated that there will be an 8 per cent shortfall in world supply by the year 2000.  The EC is only 50 per cent self-sufficient in its timber needs and imports approximately £10 billion worth of timber every year. We have about 300,000 hectares of State forest at present and while our stated annual planting target is 10,000 hectares we are planting only approximately 6,500 hectares annually.  The management and development of this basic natural resource needs commercially oriented management and direction and accordingly we intend to place it under a commercially-oriented State company like Bord na Móna, who are already successfully engaged commercially in the development of a similar natural resource.</P>
    <P>Major initiatives are needed in the development of our horticultural industry.  We will be putting forward shortly a comprehensive development plan for that industry.</P>
    <P>The decentralisation of the public service and greater regional autonomy will play an important part in our programme for economic recovery.  Local authorities will be encouraged to act more in the <Col N="1640" /> role of development corporations in their areas.  The situation whereby every decision of any consequence must go to Dublin, often to people who have no first hand knowledge of the areas which their decisions will affect, is seriously impeding development in a number of areas.  Local authorities will be encouraged also to deal direct with Brussels for funds for development projects.</P>
    <P>My colleagues and I are increasingly conscious of the fact that in practically every parish in Ireland there is an individual or a group with an idea for development. It may be in any one of a wide variety of areas, manufacturing, agriculture, tourism, services, community development and very often related to a local resource or local circumstances. These initiatives should be encouraged and we intend to devise special machinery to do this.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil on return to Government will above all else provide Government leadership in bringing about the economic transformation that is needed. This Government have failed hopelessly in that regard.  They are seen to be walking away from their most solemn commitments. They did a bad day's work for the morale of employees everywhere when they rewarded their own loyal employees in Irish Shipping for a lifetime of dedicated service, by callously throwing them on the scrapheap.</P>

    <P>What people everywhere were hoping <Col N="1641" /> for in this budget, apart from some improvement, either through social welfare or taxation in their own personal circumstances, was some major effort by the Government to overcome our present difficulties and to get the economy moving again.  But there was absolutely nothing of the kind, no attempt to create one extra job.  This is why people are so angry and frustrated.  They see that all the crushing taxes and cutbacks of the last three years have got us nowwhere and that we are now in a worse position than when this inept Government took over and started preaching fiscal rectitude three years ago.</P>
    <P>There was no economic strategy of any kind outlined in this budget.  All we had was a series of unrelated budgetary exercises, not directed to any central economic aim or objective.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the budget speech, the Minister, in outlining what he considered the broad approach to be followed in the budget should be, dealt exclusively with the book-keeping aspects of the budget, income and expenditure, borrowing and the budget deficit. There is no mention of an economic purpose or any indication of an attempt at economic recovery.  He did not mention mass unemployment, the principal feature of our economic life today.</P>
    <P>What the budget really demonstrates is that there is no positive management of the economy.  There is no economic strategy, no policy.  The Government merely react to economic pressures and developments as they arise.  More often than not, their reaction is simply to close something else down.  There is no question of their looking ahead and steering the national economy towards some clearly defined objective.</P>
    <P>The Government had probably their last opportunity in this budget to make a major attempt at economic revival, but they passed it up.  They have made no attempt to break out of the economic trap their policies have created.  They have made no attempt to get the economy moving, to create jobs or to relieve the burden of hardship of families.  In so far as the influence of this budget is concerned <Col N="1642" /> 1986 will be no better than 1985.  Only a new Government with a new orientation, a sense of purpose, direction and determination can make the change so urgently and desperately needed in economic affairs.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil firmly believe that it is the duty of the Government to manage the economy for the benefit of the community. A modern Government cannot dodge that responsibility.  A small, relatively underdeveloped open economy like ours cannot be left to the unrestricted operation of market forces, domestic or international. In our circumstances to talk in clichés about Government withdrawal from the nation's affairs is nonsense.</P>
    <P>This Government are not managing the economy successfully.  If the manager of an enterprise is not successful, if the enterprise goes further and further downhill, it is not good enough for the manager to blame the workforce, the state of the market or the structure of the company.  The manager's job is to overcome the difficulties, solve the problems, generate growth and make the enterprise profitable and successful.  If the manager cannot do that he or she is removed.  It is the same with the Government in regard to the national economy. If they cannot do the job, deal with the situation and solve the problems, they should call it a day and make way for someone who will.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Creed) George Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Creed)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this budget debate.  I will confine myself almost entirely to the areas for which I am responsible.  I want to deal with the school building programme, primary and post-primary, school transport, special education and particularly the area of sport. Deputies will agree that in recent years there has been a tremendous upsurge of interest in sport, which contributes very much to the society in which we live.  I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss the area of sport, which has benefited from the budget in three successive years. Our athletes and sports people generally <Col N="1643" /> have contributed a considerable amount, not only at home but also abroad.</P>
      <P>In a free democracy such as ours the policy of the Government, being supportive of sport and sports people, is the correct one.  Sport in modern Ireland has in the main evolved through the establishment of a wide variety of sporting bodies catering for sport at a competitive level. Sport is for the most part maintained by a host of voluntary sports persons, many of whom devote their entire spare time to the promotion of a particular sport.  In thus adhering to the concept of support, the Government and I deeply respect the independence of the sports body to conduct its own affairs independent of bureaucratic and State institutions. There is no doubt in my mind that all parties in the House contribute to the notion that the national governing bodies should be free to conduct their affairs in a free, independent manner.</P>
      <P>The Sport for All Charter of the Council of Europe, a powerful reiteration of freedom of the individual in a free society, was brought into force in 1976. Ireland has long adopted the Sport for All Charter for which the following extracts therefrom have particular significance for us:</P>
      <P>(1)  Every individual has the right to participate in sport.</P>
      <P>(2)  Sport shall be encouraged as an important factor in human development and appropriate support shall be made available from public funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to place before the House a record of this Government's response to this great European charter which called on the 21 countries of the Council of Europe to respond to the needs of our society through sport.  I would like to recall to the House that in 1983 the allocation in the Estimates for sport was £719,000.  For 1986 the total allocation for sport is £1,605,000.  This is an increase of 123 per cent over the 1983 allocation and 18 per cent increase over the 1985 allocation.  The Government's and my own determination to provide the maximum possible support for sport should be <Col N="1644" /> seen against a back-drop of grave economic difficulty both in the Irish and international scene.</P>
    <P>That our national needs in the sporting <i>milieu</i> are great, the Government are fully aware.  Ireland, as well as other western countries, is faced with a new social phenomenon, the leisure revolution.</P>
    <P>Like our neighbours in Western Europe we suffer from high unemployment in a post-industrial era, coupled with a large youth population, half the country's population being under 25 years of age.  Social commentators in western society have been preaching that we must fill the vacuum in people's lives resulting from too much free time; that the most useful way to do this is to provide opportunities for them to participate in sport, leisure and recreational activities. Not only must we provide facilities but we must make them accessible, eliminating or reducing transport and other costs for the less well off.</P>
    <P>While thus recognising the need for providing sport for all facilities for the ordinary citizen, the Government likewise recognise the need for greater development of the needs of competitive sport and, in particular, for providing top-class opportunities for our elite sportspersons.</P>
    <P>While again re-emphasising the progressive, substantial funding for sport since the present Government came into power, I, for one, am delighted that the Government have firmly grasped the nettle, where the previous Government were very slow to do so.  I refer to the Government's decision to establish a national lottery.  <i>Building on Reality</i>, published in 1984, committed the Government to a National Lottery, part of the proceeds of which would be given to sport.  It is now history that An Post have been assigned responsibility for running the lottery which will be in operation in the near future.</P>
    <P>While creating a mechanism which will provide for the needs of sport in the future, the Government, in difficult circumstances, are providing a total allocation of £1,605,000 which is £245,000 or 18 per cent over the 1985 allocation.  This <Col N="1645" /> is a most generous allocation and one which I, and I am sure, all decent sportspersons will greatly welcome.  Grant-aid for sport has now gone very much beyond the £1.5 million and is heading in the direction of the £2 million point.</P>
    <P>As regards the additional budgetary funding of £500,000 &mdash; the biggest ever budgetary allocation for sport &mdash; I would like to let the House know the developments which will now be possible because of this additional subvention.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that in 1985, as a result of a joint initiative between the Olympic Council of Ireland and Cospóir, I accepted a proposal from the Olympic Council of Ireland, which was basically a four-year plan leading to the Seoul Olympics in 1988.  The plan drew attention to the need for selective programmes for competition aimed at producing world-class performances in the right places at the right time, a long term junior programme, an on-going physiological and psychological monitoring and assessment programme and a full time administrative unit.  For phase I of the plan in 1985 the Olympic Council of Ireland were given a special budgetary allocation of £150,000 to which I added a further £90,000 from the grant-in-aid fund, making a total of £240,000.  That constitutes a far-sighted step <i>vis-á-vis</i> the preparation of our athletes for the Olympic Games.</P>
    <P>For 1986, being phase II of the project, the Government, in recognition of the fine work being carried out by the Olympic Council of Ireland, are making a special allocation of £250,000 which is an increase of £100,000 over the 1985 budgetary increase.  The Olympic Council of Ireland will be getting a further subvention from me in the near future from the grant-in-aid fund.  This will enable the Olympic Council to implement phase II of the operation involving (a) coaching/training of &ldquo;Elite Group&rdquo;; (b) junior programme; (c) monitoring and assessing; (d) international grant requirement of sports; (e) administration.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that this provision will be increased again next year, particularly <Col N="1646" /> as we enter the fourth year of the fouryear cycle, so that the Olympic Council of Ireland and the governing bodies of sport will be in a position to ensure that our athletes are properly trained and can compete with their counterparts from other countries.</P>
    <P>Complementing this programme and with the interests of the Irish sports stars of the future at heart, the Government are providing a sum of £100,000 to enable scholarships to be awarded to outstanding athletes to undertake training and competition at the highest level.  It is hoped that these scholarships will further enhance the image of Ireland as a great sporting nation.  I envisage that sports people will now be afforded an opportunity to train more fully in order to improve their levels of achievement.  With this Government support, who knows but that Ireland will strike gold at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, thus finally bridging the gap between the 1956 Melbourne Olympics and the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget also makes provision for a sum of £150,000 for sporting organisations to enable them to undertake special developments.  The main beneficiaries are as follows:&mdash; Bórd Lúthchleas na h-Éireann, £20,000; Cumann Lúthchleas Gael, £15,000; National Finance Committee, for Amateur Football (Soccer), £10,000; Irish Wheelchair Association, £15,000; Irish Amateur Rowing Union, £10,000; Irish Lawn Tennis Association, £10,000; National Community Games, £10,000; Irish Amateur Boxing Association, £10,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The balance of the £50,000 will be spent in developing sporting initiatives in the greater and inner urban areas.  The <Col N="1647" /> intention is to introduce sporting initiatives which will provide opportunities for our young people in these areas to enable them to benefit from sporting activities. I will be in consultation with Cospóir shortly in this regard.</P>
    <P>Apart from the initiatives arising from the budget the allocation for sport will be used in a variety of ways.  Grants will be allocated to over 60 national bodies of sport towards the cost of equipment, coaching and administration.  Grants will be made available towards the cost of competition at international level.  Funding will be given for the continued employment of 27 sport and other community development officers.  An allocation will be given for the maintenance of reciprocal sports cultural exchanges, mainly, between Ireland and France.  A sports scholarship scheme is in operation which enables young sportspersons to develop their potential while also attending third-level colleges.  My Department also pay for one-third of the cost of maintaining Morton Stadium.</P>
    <P>Grant-aid is given to Cospóir to enable it to develop its programmes.  Corpóir's main concern is to develop sport for all programmes in a variety of ways.  Cospóir is developing walking routes throughout the country.  Among its other programmes are a survey on coaching in Ireland and the development of youth sports leadership programmes.</P>
    <P>In particular, I have established, under Cospóir, a special committee to examine the requirements of a national sports centre.  The present position is that the committee have (1) analysed detailed questionnaires returned by the national sports bodies and (2) analysed submissions received from sports and other interested bodies.</P>
    <P>The committee are at present visiting locations suggested by different bodies around the country and are devising a chart, on the basis of the comprehensive information submitted, which will establish the core facilities common to the largest number of national governing bodies.  The committee's report is expected to be ready by May next.  On <Col N="1648" /> that point, I might refer to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of today reporting a meeting of Dublin Corporation at which the Lord Mayor of Dublin made certain statements.  I should like to quote some of those statements referring to the committee established and the work they are doing:</P>
    <P>As far as we in Dublin Corporation are concerned, this is an unnecessary waste of time &mdash; the obvious place for the centre is Santry where the requisite infrastructure in terms of access roads, accommodation and land for purchase is already available.</P>
    <P>The article continues:</P>
    <P>Mr. Tunney said &ldquo;I know of no other country in the world where the National Sports Centre is not located in the metropolis and it upsets many people that Mr. Creed should now be going around the country, hawking the idea of establishing it in their particular area.</P>
    <P>The article continues to accuse me of being parochial and of wasting time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that I am not involved.  I set up the committee to undertake the task.  I set up the committee, formed of ten members, to investigate all aspects of a national sports centre &mdash; and here I am sure the Deputy will agree with me &mdash; which is long overdue in this country.  It is not good enough for the Lord Mayor of Dublin to accuse me of being parochial, of running around the country selling the idea of a national sports centre.</P>
      <P>I want to say to the Lord Mayor of Dublin in this House that, as of now, we have not received a submission from Dublin Corporation with regard to Santry.  It should be remembered that he is the Lord Mayor of Dublin and, as a consequence, is also chairman of Dublin Corporation.  I cannot understand such remarks being made by a predecessor of mine who must be well aware of all the difficulties involved but who did very little in his term of office to make provision for a national sports stadium.  Such remarks belittle the work of the committee I have established, a committee who will ensure that every submission will be examined in detail.  At the end of the day that committee will make a recommendation to me &mdash; that is, before the first week in May &mdash; incorporating all of the submissions made as to where such a sports stadium should be located.  I resent that type of attack, that type of insult.</P>
      <P>A further aspect of Cospóir's work is the initiative to generate more co-operation at Anglo-Irish level through sport. Cospóir was successful in 1985 in bringing the Sports Council of England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Cospóir itself together at a meeting.  Agreement was reached on generating further sports co-operation which is ongoing.</P>
      <P>Through the Vote for Vocational Education Committees, I am providing grants to vocational education committees which enable them to grant-aid youth and sports bodies at local level as well as setting up special projects for youth and sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to place on record my appreciation of the valuable work undertaken by many committees under the <Col N="1650" /> aegis of the vocational education committees throughout the country in relation to the promotion of sport.</P>
    <P>In my capacity as Minister of State at the Department of Education I want to come to another area, that of special education.  The area of special education is one which immediately commends itself to Deputies on all sides of the House as an area which must be dealt with sensitively and imaginatively and one about which I am sure there would be no disagreement in according it a very high priority.  We have reason to be proud of the developments in special education services which took place under successive Administrations and which resulted in a network of special schools, special classes and special services to provide for children in need of such.  It is against this background that I wish to mention a number of matters which arise out of the present Estimates and which will have implications for future Estimate provisions.</P>
    <P>The first matter to which I refer is the question of special classes in ordinary national schools.  The earlier years of development of special education services were marked by a strong orientation to providing such services in special schools, categorised by the nature of the handicap experienced by the children attending them.  Thus we have special schools for the mildly mentally handicapped, for the moderately mentally handicapped, for the deaf and hard of hearing, for the blind and partially sighted, for the physically handicapped and so on.  It is appropriate that I should commend the dedicated and unselfish work carried out by the teachers and other personnel in these schools and recognise the magnificent contribution they are making to the welfare and development of the children under their care.</P>
    <P>In recent years increasing emphasis has been placed on the ordinary school rather than the special school as a setting for special education.  The trend towards the integration of mildly mentally handicapped in the ordinary school through the expansion of special class provision <Col N="1651" /> in ordinary national schools has been fostered and assisted by improved financing of special classes.  The level of capitation grants payable in respect of pupils in such classes has been increased to that pertaining in special schools.</P>
    <P>Within the general framework of the increased provision, the special school has an important role as a resource and reference centre for teachers and pupils in special classes throughout its area.  A committee including representatives of management and teaching interests has been established to identify ways in which co-operation between special schools and classes might be further developed for the benefit of pupils, teachers and school authorities.  Seminars have been organised for teachers in designated special schools and classes.</P>
    <P>In a small number of areas distant from established special school centres, as an alternative to residential placement, moderately mentally handicapped children in their early years of schooling are being educated in special classes in the ordinary national schools in their home locality.</P>
    <P>Until recently children with severe or profound mental handicap have not come within the scope of the formal education system.  The question of education and training for this group was examined by an inter-departmental working party. Following consideration of their report, the Government agreed to train and provide a group of teachers for the severe and profoundly mentally handicapped and their deployment in selected centres should be implemented at a very early date.</P>
    <P>In meeting the challenge of catering for those pupils who fall behind the normal level of development with regard to literacy and numeracy, my Department continue to allocate additional remedial teaching posts.  A further allocation of 32 additional remedial posts based on the priority of need in schools generally has been made for the current school year. Further posts will be provided this year.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the Travelling People Review Body and consideration <Col N="1652" /> by a Government task force who made many recommendations, a monitoring committee was set up.  This includes representatives of the travellers, and reviews the implementation of the recommendations.  The first report of the monitoring committee outlines the excellent progress in regard to the provision of education for travellers especially where suitable and reasonably settled living accommodation makes it possible for the travellers to avail of the facilities provided.</P>
    <P>Special education also includes provision for special schools for young offenders.  These include: (i) Trinity House School, Lusk, a secure school for serious offenders under the age of 16 years; (ii) Finglas Children's Centre comprising (a) St. Laurence's Special School and (b) St. Michael's Remand and Assessment Unit for Boys; (iii) St. Joseph's, Ferryhouse, Clonmel, Co. Tipperary; and (iv) Cuan Mhuire Remand and Assessment Unit for Girls, Collins Avenue, Dublin.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for four youth encounter projects, two in Dublin, one in Limerick and one in Cork which consist of day centres with school facilities and out-of-school activities.</P>
    <P>The rules for national schools provide for the establishment of schools in which the general training and instruction of the pupils in the subjects of the school curriculum other than English is given in the Irish Language.  I am dealing now with all-Irish national schools.  Such a school can be established where the Department are satisfied that there is sufficient demand to indicate that the school will be educationally viable.  It would be expected that these schools generally would become sufficiently large to maintain a staff of eight teachers so that each standard would have an individual teacher.</P>
    <P>There are at present, outside the Gaeltacht areas, 47 national schools in operation in 15 counties in which all subjects are taught through the medium of Irish. The State is prepared to purchase sites for and to fully finance the provision of permanent buildings for all-Irish schools. <Col N="1653" /> This would mean, of course, that the State would be the owner of any such school provided in this way although it would be managed on the same basis as other national schools.  An additional teacher, over and above the number which would be warranted by the enrolment of pupils, is sanctioned for these schools and each member of the staff is paid an allowance for teaching through Irish, which at present amounts to £417 per annum.  All-Irish schools are paid an additional 50 per cent of the normal capitation grant.  Transport is provided to the nearest all-Irish school for children wishing to pursue their primary education at such a school.</P>
    <P>I want to deal also with the primary and post primary school building programme which is a very difficult area demanding a considerable amount of resources to resolve the problems facing it.  Deputies will be aware from representations made to them in their constituencies by boards of management and educational interests generally that a major problem faces us in this area.  Fifteen or 20 years ago we introduced into the primary school building programme the idea of prefabricated buildings.  The idea then was that the buildings would have a ten to 12 year lifespan.  Unfortunately, at this stage many of those buildings have outlived their usefulness.  I can understand the problems and difficulties of teachers in particular and of pupils also and the problems of teaching in prefabricated buildings. I have visited a number of areas and schools.  I have had discussions with boards of management.  I have received numbers of people at my office in relation to the replacement of schools.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the primary school building programme alone, at this stage we have approximately 800 applications on hands for dealing with replacement, extension, minor repairs and alterations. For these an enormous sum will have to be provided.  With the resources available to me we are proceeding as quickly as possible, but I appeal to boards of management and educational interests generally to have patience because there is no way that you can wave a magic wand and <Col N="1654" /> get the necessary resources in one or two years.  This must be an ongoing programme.  I have a particular interest in this area.</P>
    <P>The allocation for the building, equipment and furnishing of national schools for 1986 is £28.18 million.  This programme has to cope with many competing priorities, from new schools in new housing areas to additional classrooms in existing schools and the upgrading and improvement of schools which do not meet modern requirements.  A significant number of the new buildings replace prefabricated and other temporary accommodation and a proportion of the available finance is also reserved for the renewal and improvement of basic facilities such as sanitation, heating, lighting and furniture.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem in relation to the movement of population.  I could quote Cork as an example and I am sure that Deputy Fitzgerald would agree. There is movement of population to the outer satellite towns which will demand schools immediately and there are vacant places within the city schools.  In one area we have provided a 16 classroom school and there is a demand for another school which is also in progress at the moment. This massive investment in school buildings must be reviewed.  I refer to Ballincolling in particular, in which there is movement of the population out and vacant accommodation within the city.  In these new developing areas houses are built and children come on stream at the one time.  There is a peak and then there is a valley.  I am sure the acting Chairman, Deputy McGinley, as a teacher is well aware of this.</P>
    <P>The programme of primary school building continues apace and a target for the provision of 13,750 school places has been set for the current year.  Present indications are that this target will be achieved.  At the present time 407 projects for new school buildings, extensions and renovations are being dealt with in the various stages from grant sanction onwards through detailed design, tender action and construction.</P>
    <P>A further 236 projects are under active <Col N="1655" /> consideration, while 206 more are at the stage of preliminary investigation.  I am happy to say the decision to transfer the responsibility in respect of primary school buildings, hitherto exercised by the Office of Public Works, to the Department of Education has now been implemented.  It is confidently expected that this step, together with the implementation of a computerised information system, will minimise administrative delay in the handling of projects.</P>
    <P>This was a major advance in so far as streamlining the system of dealing with school buildings is concerned.  When I came into this Department first I thought it very cumbersome that there were two agencies, the Office of Public Works and the Department of Education, sharing responsibility for the provision of primary schools.  I wish to pay particular tribute to the Office of Public Works for the way in which they have co-operated on the transfer to the Department of Education. I sincerely hope that from now on the Department will be in a far better position to advise boards of management and public representatives as to the position in relation to any particular school.</P>
    <P>I always felt a little embarrassed at telling people, as Minister with responsibility for school buildings in the Department of Education, that I did not know the position because the file was then with the Office of Public Works. That would necessitate another deputation to the Office of Public Works.  With programmes of school buildings at several different stages, files would be going backwards and forwards, which caused delays, disillusionment and much confusion. The position is now streamlined and we shall be in a position to say what exactly the situation is at any time.</P>
    <P>The 1986 allocation for secondary, vocational and community/comprehensive schools is £38 million and includes provision for expenditure on construction, furniture, equipment and professional fees and for sites other than secondary school sites.</P>
    <P>The continuing capital investment in post-primary school buildings forms part <Col N="1656" /> of the ongoing programme designed to meet the growth in enrolments arising through population growth as well as population shifts, to replace unsatisfactory and uneconomic accommodation and to meet the backlog of places for which short term arrangements were made in the late sixties and early seventies, mainly in the form of temporary prefabricated accommodation.  Over 60,000 places were so provided and with age, this temporary accommodation has become a great liability.  It is part of our policy to replace this accommodation as speedily as possible.  Replacement of unsatisfactory and uneconomic accommodation has been ongoing under strict criteria with replacement only taking place as part of a needed major expansion of a school, where there is no economic alternative.</P>
    <P>About 140,000 permanent places were provided in the period 1966 to 1985 against a growth in enrolments in that period of 192,000 pupils.  A considerable amount of accommodation is still needed to replace temporary and unsatisfactory accommodation and, in addition, a further 10,000 places will be needed to meet increased enrolments in 1985 and it is estimated that a similar amount will be provided in 1986.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of 1985 there were 53 projects under construction and during the year permission to seek tenders was given in the case of 61 projects with a total estimated cost of £47 million.  Apart from providing essential school places, the school building programme should be of immense benefit to the construction industry.  In addition, there are about 100 projects where planning has been initiated and is proceeding.</P>
    <P>I now come to deal briefly with the difficult problem of school transport.  The school transport service continues to achieve its basic aim of enabling children who might have difficulty doing so to attend school regularly.  The provision for school transport in 1986 is £32,963,000. This represents an increase of £1,338,000 or 4.2 per cent on the cost to the State of operating the service in 1985.</P>
    <P>Under this school transport scheme, <Col N="1657" /> 155,000 pupils are eligible for school transport benefit.  About 70,000 of these are primary pupils who are carried free. Of the 85,000 post-primary pupils who are carried, over 39,000 are carried free by virtue of their parents being in possession of a medical card.  The remaining 46,000 post-primary pupils pay charges. These are £18 per term in the case of junior cycle pupils and £29 per term in the case of senior cycle pupils.  In order to take account of the circumstances of large families, this Government have restricted the maximum charge for any family to £60 per term.</P>
    <P>When one considers that the average cost of providing school transport is about £230 per annum for each eligible child, the benefit to the parents is enormous even in the case of those who are required to pay the charges.  As you are aware, these charges were introduced in January 1983 as a result of an inherited shortfall in the 1983 provision for school transport. The total cost of operating school transport services in 1986 will be of the order of £36,163,000.  It is expected that the shortfall of £3.2 million between this amount and the provision of £32,963,000 will be made up by the yield from the charges.</P>
    <P>It was found necessary to impose a modest increase in the charges in January 1986.  The increase was in line with the increase in the rate of inflation.  The yield from the charges will constitute less than 10 per cent of the total cost of the services. Parents who wish to pay the charges by instalment may use the pre-paid vouchers system, which is operated by CIE.  Under this scheme, vouchers may be purchased in units of £5 from designated CIE offices.  I arranged for CIE to introduce this system in 1983 as a result of representations which were made following the introduction of the charges.  It appears, however, that few parents avail themselves of this facility.</P>
    <P>The school transport system is a complex one involving the movement of 155,000 eligible pupils each day.  About 2,500 vehicles are engaged in the system. They operate over 6,200 routes to 335 post-primary centres and 1,490 primary school centres.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1658" /> When I talk about the complexity of the problem, the Deputies&mdash;particularly rural Deputies &mdash; will appreciate the enormous task of collecting each morning 155,000 pupils at different pick-up points throughout the country and dropping them in time for school, collecting them in the evening and bringing them back at different times, getting them as near home as possible.  It is impossible to provide a school transport system that would suit everybody.  There are rules and regulations laid down and arrangements with the transport services provided.  All the Deputies are aware of the numbers taken to qualify.</P>
    <P>We have various suggestions for an alternative system of school transport.  I have examined them in great detail.  I have taken the advice of experts and discussed the matter with the Private Bus Owners' Association, and I am convinced that there is no alternative to the present system.  It has been suggested that if the parents of children, who are costing £250 per head for school transport, were paid directly it would be far easier to provide an efficient service.  However, though it would be easy to provide school transport in some areas, it would be almost impossible to cater for the more remote areas.</P>
    <P>Because of the complexity of the system, which involves a massive outlay by the State, it will be appreciated that it is necessary to keep it under constant review to ensure that it is operated as cost-effectively as possible.  In this connection a pilot project under which the organisation of school transport would be devolved to local interests in a selected small number of areas for an experimental period and the effects of these arrangements assessed is under consideration. Although I have certain doubts about the effectiveness of the present administration of the transport system generally, I accept that decentralisation of the system, giving greater powers to the local authorities and the VECs to oversee the running of the system, might be examined shortly.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of my statement I promised to deal with the aspects of the budget that referred to my responsibility. <Col N="1659" /> I will go back to that, and refer again to sport.  I echo the opinion of all sporting organisations here who have expressed appreciation of the valued contribution made by sporting organisations throughout the country.  It is because of that contribution that we have had the position that has obtained in the past three years.  This year in times of economic stringency, there was an increase of 18 per cent in the Government's contribution. I constantly argue that there is a strong economic advantage to be gained from further grant-aiding sport.  I said that in my contribution to the budget debate last year.  Then, I was not aware of the major contribution made voluntarily by the community and particularly by sporting organisations.  They have tried to provide facilities for young people to get them off the street corners and into centres where they can get involved in sport.  That provides a strong economic argument for further contributions to the provision of sporting facilities for young people as an antidote to crime, violence and drug abuse among young people.</P>
    <P>Under the chairmanship of Ronnie Delaney, the National Sports Council have discussed with me many times that aspect of financing sporting organisations. I have no doubt that young people actively involved in sport are never involved in any anti-social behaviour.  We have been very fortunate during the years in having had very generous sponsorship. This has become very necessary.  To augment the voluntary effort of sporting organisations and the generous sponsorship, the State must make greater contributions in the years ahead.  With extra funding in 1986 we will be in a position to examine a number of matters which we had to omit in the past.  I believe that with the National Lottery coming on stream later in the year we will be able to ensure a much more prosperous future for sport in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I could deal with many other aspects of the budget but I am sure they will be dealt with at length by my colleagues.  I listened to the Leader of the Opposition in his contribution today.  We have a <Col N="1660" /> number of problems, one of the greatest being unemployment.  Our large population of young people adds to the problem of unemployment, but I do not accept the official figure on the number of unemployed. Unfortunately, we have many abuses of the social welfare system.  Many people are drawing unemployment assistance and working at the same time.  In some European countries unemployed people have to sign for assistance every day.  Recently, a case was made very forcibly to me that it would not be unjust here if we asked people to sign at exchanges three days per week in order to prevent abuses.  People who are working have to go to work every day every week. Although we talk constantly about these abuses, we do very little to remedy them. Detection is difficult, even with an army of civil servants.  I think many of the abuses would be eliminated if we had the unemployed signing on three days a week, not knowing until the previous day what time they would have to sign the following day.</P>
    <P>Some of the problems we have to contend with in this respect can be illustrated by tenants of local authority houses paying rents under a differential system, which is based on income.  People working, rearing families and having an income of £150 per week pay rent for local authority houses of between £20 and £25 per week.  A person next door drawing unemployment assistance and working would have twice the income of the person officially working, but he would be paying only £4 or £5 a week. These anomalies and difficulties cause unease and unrest throughout the community. Therefore, I ask the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare to examine that type of abuse.</P>
    <P>On employment and the creation of jobs, I welcome the efforts made by the building industry.  However, I am aware of the major step forward taken by the Minister for the Environment when he introduced the house improvement grants recently.  In my opinion, this will bring many people out of the black economy, carpenters, masons and so on, some of whom heretofore were drawing unemployment <Col N="1661" /> assistance.  From the number of applications made for these grants, the scheme will create a number of building and reconstruction jobs in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>As I have informed the Deputy in reply to previous questions, the profits of Tara Mines Ltd. for corporation profits tax purposes, which is the basis for calculation of the company's royalty liability, have yet to be agreed with the Revenue Commissioners. Consequently no payment of royalty has been demanded from the company.  The matters at issue involve a number of complex points and, whilst progress is being made towards their resolution, it is not possible to say precisely when they will be resolved.</P>

      <P>I have asked this question every six months since June 1984 and I have got the same answer each time.  The Minister has said this is a very complex matter being negotiated with the Revenue Commissioners for over 18 months now.  Could the Minister say what stage negotiations have reached?  I understand that Tara Mines are making considerable profits and the State have not got a penny in royalties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The question related specifically to royalty payments and I must confine myself to my reply in regard to that.  This is really a question of decisions by the Revenue Commissioners and not my Department.  In previous replies I told Deputy Mac Giolla quite clearly that the questions are complex.  From information I have received I understand they have wide implications.  I am not in a position to give a finite opinion on this matter.  Complex negotiations are going on between the company who have raised complex legal issues and the Revenue Commissioners.  I hope these matters will be resolved sooner rather than later but procedures must be gone through before a determination is made.  For the information of the House, the State is receiving considerable revenues from employment at Tara Mines in the form of PAYE, PRSI, VAT and rates on industrial buildings, so revenues accrue to the State from this important economic activity.  In relation to the specific question asked by the Deputy, it is a matter of procedure which is set down in the tax <Col N="1663" /> laws to be settled in the normal course which is outside of my control.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>Gulf Oil (Ireland) Limited is operator for the consortium involved in licence 5/82 under which well 50/6-1 was drilled. As Deputies are aware it is the practice that statements regarding the results of wells are in all cases issued by the operator. In regard to well 50/6-1 which has now been completed, the operator has today issued a formal statement on its results which indicate that, on test, the well produced a flow rate of 2,074 barrels of 44.8 degrees API gravity oil per day with, 1,284 thousand standard cubic feet per day of gas.</P>
      <P>In view of the strictly confidential nature of the specific well data, I do not propose to depart from normal practice by adding to that announcement but I can let the Deputies have copies of the operator's statement if they wish.</P>
      <P>The question of bringing the oil ashore, either in this country or elsewhere, does not arise at the present time.  Obviously, all parties concerned will have to study the results of the well in detail before they can reach any conclusions about the discovery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if the memorandum and <Col N="1669" /> articles of association of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation have been amended to allow direct participation in the exploration and development of our oil and gas resources; if any steps have been taken to ensure participation in exploration and development programmes by the INPC; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle that the memorandum and articles of association of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation should be amended to permit them to participate in hydrocarbon exploration and/or development, has been approved by the Government.  The actual changes in the memorandum and articles will be implemented at an early date.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the House on a previous occasion, the requirement for the amendments arises because certain companies involved in exploration offshore Ireland wanted INPC participation on a carried basis in licences or options held by them.  The Government have decided that the INPC should be permitted to accept these invitations, on condition that the interest is small, that it is carried, and that the corporation are not liable for costs if no development takes place. In the case of a development arising from a licence or option in which INPC have a participating interest any such interest would be subsumed into the overall State participation.  Details of the INPC interests will be announced in due course when the necessary formalities have been completed.</P>
      <P>The amendment of the INPC's memorandum and articles of association as proposed will provide a mechanism whereby the State may accept these and other offers to participate in the exploration phase of the search for hydrocarbons. Once a commercial discovery has been established, the State already has the right, provided under the 1975 licensing terms, to participate up to a maximum level of 50 per cent in the development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government consider that it is appropriate, at this stage in the exploration of our offshore, that a State entity should acquire firsthand experience of <Col N="1670" /> Irish offshore exploration activities without cost to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>My information is that this money is available and should be applied for.  The Minister does not seem to have pursued this matter and I would be very grateful if he would do so now, at the highest level, because there is some doubt regarding the future of the cutaway bogs.  There are thousands of acres involved.  The people are anxious to know what the future holds for them.  This is very important expecially for the people in the bog areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Each application for grant aid under the private bog development scheme is considered by Bord na Móna in accordance with the terms of the Turf Development Act, 1981.</P>
      <P>Section 8(1) of the Act, which is concerned with the provision of grants towards the cost of turf extraction machinery, stipulates that such grants will only be paid in respect of machinery &ldquo;designed or intended by its manufacturer to be used exclusively or principally for the extraction of turf for fuel&rdquo;.  As swamp dozers and diggers do not come under this category, I regret that grant aid from my Department cannot be considered for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Department, through Bord na Móna, a scheme for the type of machinery mentioned?  Is there any assistance from the EC for grant aiding this type of machinery?  Is there any energy directive under which this could be grant aided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear not.  I am <Col N="1673" /> informed that a swamp dozer is a machine which levels swamp land and a swamp digger is employed in the construction of outfalls.  Because of the fact that neither machine is either exclusively or principally for the extraction of turf for fuel or similar energy related projects, there would not be any assistance from either the EC or Bord na Móna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that in the private bog development scheme a lot of levelling and drainage work has to be done?  These dozers and diggers are of vital importance in doing this work.  If the Minister checks with Bord na Móna he will find that there are many applications for grant aid for this type of work.  Does the Minister realise that many groups have to get contractors to do this work and contractors are very anxious to know if grant aid could be given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

The Act is quite specific and I assume Bord na Móna are quite rigid in their interpretation.  If the Deputy has a particular case he wishes to bring to my attention, he is free to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>Since the commencement of the scheme in August 1981 to end of December 1985, a total of 3,952 applications for grant aid have been approved by my Department.</P>
      <P>In the case of the &ldquo;new supplies&rdquo; heading of the scheme, provision was made for 1,500 connections.  This number has almost been reached, but the cost has been significantly lower than anticipated. An approach is being made to the EC Commission to increase the number.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will no doubt be aware from my press statement of 11 June 1985, I have put forward proposals for approval by the EC Commission suggesting relaxation of the regulations in two areas of difficulty.  The first of these related to cases where a second dwelling house is built on a farm which already has an electricity connection and the second to cases where the owner of a farm has his sole income from the farm but is in receipt of income assistance or other social welfare benefits.  The Commission's response to these proposals is awaited.</P>
      <P>There are no provisions in the rules governing this EC scheme, as laid down in the relevant regulation, which would allow for the awarding of grants in cases where electricity supply is required for local authority housing.  My Department are precluded, therefore, from allowing the scheme to apply in such cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The original provision was for 1,500 connections and that figure has almost been reached, but as the cost anticipated has not been realised and there has been a saving, an approach is <Col N="1675" /> being made to increase the number of connections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>

      <P>The responsibility for the safety and maintenance of gas installations lies with the gas undertakings themselves. I am, of course, concerned that the gas utilities should meet fully their statutory obligations in relation to safety. For this reason, I commissioned the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to carry out an independent assessment of the safety practices in all of the town gas undertakings.  The IIRS are expected to submit their report within three months.</P>
      <P>Measures taken by the companies themselves to provide for safety of the public, include, in the case of Dublin, increased leak surveying, improved leak control and maintenance procedures.  In addition, during 1985 Cork Gas Company commissioned a specialist's report on their system in order to identify what refurbishment was required.  On foot of this report, I understand that the company intend to undertake a major refurbishment programme over the next two years.</P>

      <P>I thought I might get some cheap information but it is not <Col N="1678" /> forthcoming.  Did the Minister receive a report on the serious leaks that have occurred and can he tell the House what was the cause?

      <P>The Cork Gas Company have recognised that there is a high level of leakage in the system.  They have commissioned a report from a British gas consultancy and they will be considering the matter of refurbishment of the system generally.  There is a multiplicity of reasons, age being one reason, and there is also the question of an on-going replacement policy for mains and service which will be undertaken during the next two years by the Cork Gas Company.  If the Deputy wants specific reasons for the various leaks that have occurred he should ask specific questions.  I have not detailed information to hand.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if any of the 32 million ECUs available from the EC under Council of Ministers Regulation 3637/85 for Border gas development, will be taken and spent during 1986; and the reason none was taken up during 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 11, 13, 15 and 19 together. The EC Council of Ministers approved a Community regional aid package on 17 December 1985, which included provision of up to £23 million, 32 million ECUs, for a gas development programme in Border counties.  The Council Regulation No. 3637/85 was published in the Official Journal on 27 December 1985, and provides that only expenditure incurred after the regulation came into force is eligible for ERDF aid. Funds could not, therefore, have been drawn down in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1680" /> The prospects for the gas supply network being extended to particular centres in the region covered by the Council regulation are very much dependent on the economic viability of such projects. The priority is to carry out the detailed feasibility studies necessary to determine the viability of particular projects, taking into account the availability of ERDF funds.</P>
    <P>Under the Council regulation a project programme has now to be drawn up and approved by the EC Commission.  Until this programme has been prepared and agreed it is not possible to comment on the likely draw down and application of the ERDF funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>During last summer there was talk of amending the regulation regarding the Border fund to involve extension of the gas pipeline but from information I can get it appears little has been done since to examine the market in that region.  Article 7 of the regulation states specifically that member states shall take the necessary measures to make the potential beneficiaries aware of the possibilities.  I am concerned that to date local authorities or people in the private sector have not been contacted regarding the potential usage of the gas. The area has suffered greatly under the allocation from the regional development fund because of the Border fund which operated in other years.  This year we received only a meagre allocation from the Regional Fund.  The area has lost the Border fund and now we are losing with regard to the Regional Fund.  It is difficult to see how the area can benefit from the regulation mentioned by the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained in my reply that money could not be drawn down until the regulation was clarified by the <Col N="1681" /> Council which was done on 27 December. It is envisaged that Bord Gáis Éireann would be the lead agency in drawing up the programme.  At present we have a steering group comprising the Department of Energy, the Department of Finance and the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism. Our objective is to draw up a programme as quickly as possible, to seek the approval of the Commission and then to implement the project.  We need the approval of the Commission in respect of a project as specified.  Obviously there is the question of the viability of the project in the Border areas and that matter will receive my attention in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state the amount of money available for the project?  Will he state if this fund which is available for the supply of natural gas to Border counties will replace the special programme for Border areas? Donegal benefited to a reasonable extent from that fund but there are fears that Donegal may not get a supply of natural gas as it may be suggested the project is not viable.  If Donegal is not to get its share of this programme, will the Minister insist that we get a share of the special Border programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's query, the sum is £23 million or 32 million ECUs.  It will be spent on the basis of a viable project for the Border areas.  The Deputy is aware of the counties concerned, namely, Louth, Cavan, Leitrim, Monaghan, Sligo and Donegal.  We have to prove to the Commission that an overall viable project can be established for those counties and then we will seek their approval.  The question of any other fund is a separate matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>We have set up an action committee in Donegal to try to impress on the Minister and his Department that the project can be made viable.  Will the Minister or his Department consider meeting in the near <Col N="1682" /> future a group drawn from business interests and public representatives in Donegal County Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that can be arranged at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the feasibility and viability of extending the natural gas pipeline to Drogheda and Dundalk has been established as a result of the survey work carried out for the pipeline from Dublin to Belfast?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not agree for the simple reason that the Deputy is not comparing like with like.  The economics of bringing gas to Belfast and feeding the towns of Drogheda and Dundalk along the way are quite different from the economics of a stand alone project involving two counties.  It was for this reason that we had to recommission studies on the Drogheda and Dundalk aspect of the project after it was realised that the Northern Ireland gas deal was not being brought to fruition.  If the Deputy is probing in relation to viability, I would have to say that we should be fairly optimistic about developments taking place in the northern counties, especially in the light of funds being made available now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister be more specific and tell us when natural gas will be available in Drogheda and Dundalk? This is very important when one considers the very serious unemployment problem in County Louth where there are more than 8,000 people out of work. The availability of natural gas in the two towns in question would be an added dimension for the IDA in their industrial promotion work.  This consideration, together with the domestic demand, should dictate that natural gas be made available there as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be to the benefit of everyone that natural gas be available as soon as possible.  As I have told Deputy Leonard, my objective is to draw up a programme that will stand the test when sent to the Commission.  That test will be <Col N="1683" /> one of viability.  My intention is to have the programme drawn up as quickly as possible and to have it back before the Commission by mid year.  It would be our intention to move as fast as possible after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to use the RDOs for the purpose of compiling information on potential usage in the area concerned? They would be in a good position to undertake this task because they are gathers of statistics and would be of much help in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other Deputies waiting to ask supplementaries, too, and we have taken about four questions together.  Can the Minister say what level of grant is available from the EC towards Border gas development specifically in the matter of taking gas from Dublin to Drogheda and Dundalk?  Will the Minister accept that taking the level of grant that is available from the EC together with the £5 million in the Exchequer coffers by reason of the aborted North-South gas deal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not touched that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;only a small outlay would be required on the part of the Government.  The economics are so simple as to be capable of being worked out on the back of a matchbox having regard to the small input that would be required on the part of the Government and taking account of the large number of people in the Dundalk-Drogheda areas who are awaiting natural gas?  In addition, a factory in that region is barely in <Col N="1684" /> existence.  It is hanging on by the boot straps awaiting for natural gas.  How much more time is to be spent on viability studies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I often wondered how Deputy Reynolds arrived at this economic evaluations.  Perhaps they were all done on matchboxes.  In relation to the level of grant, the EC regulation regarding the provision for gas infrastructure is that 50 per cent of the public expenditure involved in the extension of the Dublin pipeline to viable centres in the counties mentioned may be contributed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of bringing gas from the outer rim of the main pipe in Dublin to the Border was estimated in 1982 at £13.5 million.  In today's terms, with construction costs lower and a depleted construction industry the estimate now might be of the order of no more than £15 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  With £5 million sterling available plus the grant, the Government could supply natural gas to the towns in question for about £1.5 million. If they are not prepared to do that neither they nor Bord Gáis should be in business.  There are potential customers waiting to pay revenue to the Exchequer but the Government will not give them that opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the place to talk. There is a grant of £7.5 million available from the EC and there is £5 million in the coffers.  Is it any wonder the Government are on the way out?  Poor Deputy Bell's seat is gone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the long delay in bringing the pipeline to Drogheda and Dundalk and taking into account the implications and delays involved in feasibility studies, it will be light years before we in Donegal can hope to have a supply of natural gas.  In view of the chronic economic situation in that country and the hardship involved in trying to keep industry operating there, would the Minister consider relieving the industrial sector in Donegal by way of a subsidy in respect of ESB charges?  We are entitled to that kind of concession. At least we are entitled to be compensated by way of a concession in respect of the source of energy we can produce in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>That is somewhat a different question.  There is no proposal before me in relation to considering a variety of charges for electricity to customers in Donegal or for that matter in Mayo, Galway or Kerry.  In terms of an island energy policy or of our industrial policy, a system of variable charges would be the beginning of the end of any sort of pricing policy for energy.</P>

      <P>The information the Deputy requires is available from the Energy Statistics yearbook published by the Statistical Office of the European Communities.

      <P>In terms of ranking, in 1983 Ireland is placed sixth in relation to dependence on energy imports, with the UK, the Netherlands, Germany and France having a lower dependence.  Ireland's dependence on imported energy decreased from 85.9 per cent of gross inland consumption in 1975 to 62.5 per cent in 1983.  My Department have estimated that in 1984, the rate was 58.6 per cent and for the nine months ended 30 September 1985 the rate was 58 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he envisages a reduction in the cost of electricity after Moneypoint comes on stream this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the price of electricity to the consumer.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the ESB in December 1985 announced a price increase of 2.7 per cent on average.  The determination of this price increase took into account the coming into operation by October 1986 of the first two units at Moneypoint. It is not expected that there will be any further increase in electricity prices before March 1987.  In effect, this constitutes a real reduction in electricity price taking account of inflation.  The Moneypoint project will not be fully commercial until after October 1987 when the third 300 MW unit at the station becomes operational. Its effect on electricity prices then will depend on the prices prevailing on international energy markets for oil and coal.  Indications are, however, that the price of coal will remain very competitive in the long term and that this will have a beneficial effect on the price of electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is questionable whether price increases in the future should be related to inflation?  This is a time when everyone must cut production costs.  Will the Minister accept that there has been a very marked decrease in oil prices in recent months?  Prices are continuing to drop and some people say that oil could go as low as $10 a barrel.  There has also been a drop in the price of coal.  Instead of talking about no more price increases between now and March 1987, would the Minister take steps to have electricity prices brought down, in view of the far reaching changes that have taken place in coal and oil prices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that inflation will always be a factor in relation to price increases.  There is a lead-in time in relation to outstanding contracts and the cost at which oil or coal is bought by the ESB. My Department monitor the situation very closely and have constant discussions with the ESB in relation to pricing structures.  We should be heartened by <Col N="1689" /> the fact that there will not be a price increase.  The price increase in December 1985 was very modest, only 2.7 per cent. If increases are necessary, it will be my intention to keep them as low as possible and to keep our energy costs competitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that if inflation runs at 4.5 per cent it should not automatically follow that the ESB or anybody else should get a price increase of 4.5 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point about the lead-in time, but the whole cost factor of fuel input to the ESB has drastically changed in respect of oil, coal and currency.  There are three benefits coming together.  It is not good enough for the Minister simply to say that there will not be any price increase.  We should be looking for price reductions if we are to take advantage of these external benefits to bring down the cost of energy to industry and the domestic consumer. There is a real case for cost and price reductions throughout 1986.  Would the Minister accept that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept a certain amount of what the Deputy is saying.  It is a question for ongoing discussion between my Department and the ESB.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy whether the Irish Government have protested to the British Government about the discharge of nuclear waste from the Sellafield plant into the Irish Sea, reported on January 29 1986; and, if not, the reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister for State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins) Minister for State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>At my request the Nuclear Energy Board contracted the UK authorities about the recent discharge of 458 kilograms of uranium into the Irish Sea.  I understand that the UK Department of the Environment have asked for a report on the matter from British Nuclear Fuels Limited which operates the Sellafield nuclear fuels reprocessing plant.  The report is expected shortly.  British officials have agreed to discuss with my Department all aspects of the issue when the report becomes available.  I will decide what action I should take when I get details of the incident.</P>
      <P>I envisage that the discussions will take place under the aegis of the Ireland &mdash; UK Contact Group.  This group was set up following a meeting between the Tánaiste and the UK Secretary for the Environment to provide formal contact between the two countries on nuclear matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy knows, the Government are opposed to any radioactive discharges from Sellafield into the Irish Sea.  Every opportunity has been taken and will continue to be taken at meetings of the contact group and at other international <Col N="1692" /> fora to express the view that discharges from Sellafield must be minimised, and must be eliminated as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had far too many recurring incidences of the dumping of nuclear waste in the Irish Sea.  We have also had many reports by various groups in relation to the potential damage not only to fisheries but to the health of people living on the east coast of Ireland. We have had meeting after meeting and complaint after complaint to the British Government but again we have an incident. Does the Minister agree that it is time for the Irish Government to say to the British Government: &ldquo;Enough is enough, close it down once and for all&rdquo;? In the interests of everybody concerned that will have to be the only result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my Government's wish that any discharges from Sellafield should be eliminated.  That is the clear and unequivocal opinion of my Government as expressed by the Minister to his opposite number in the British Government. I do not want to be alarmist, as the Deputy seems to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time somebody got excited about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Nuclear Energy Board that there is no danger to the Irish population resulting from discharges at Sellafield and that these discharges are less than 1 per cent of the limits advised by the International Commission for Radiological Protection and by the EC.  I do not want any alarmist statements to go out from this House in that regard.  Having said that, I am annoyed about the most recent discharge of 458 kilograms of uranium into the Irish Sea.  I must express grave concern and I am annoyed at the failure to notify my Department of the proposed discharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to await the report from the British Department of the Environment who have requested BNFL to give them a report on the discharge.  I am not pleased with the situation and, if necessary, I will <Col N="1693" /> have further ministerial contacts with the British Government in this matter.  I should add that I am pleased that at European Community level the suggestion has been taken up by the Commissioner Clinton Davies that a Community inspection force be established.  I would welcome such a force.  I am also aware that there is a report to be debated in the House of Commons on the British nuclear industry.  I will await that debate with interest.  I will take whatever action I deem necessary to protect Irish interests and to ensure, in the first instance, that the Alara principle is maintained, that is, that any discharge would be kept as low as is reasonably achievable, and secondly, our primary objective that all discharges from Sellafield should be eliminated as soon as possible.  Those are the objectives of my Government, as stated by the Minister for Energy and myself on a number of occasions and will continue to be our position.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he has had any recent meetings with the principals of Aughinish Alumina on the question of supply and pricing of natural gas to their plant in Limerick in order to secure 800 jobs there; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>On 28 January 1986 the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and myself met the principals of Aughinish Alumina.  A statement was issued afterwards indicating that the meeting had been a constructive one and <Col N="1695" /> that an understanding had been reached on a wide range of issues.  The statement went on to say that all parties were to give further consideration to the issues and had agreed to meet again in the near future.  I have nothing further to add to this at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister now satisfied that Aughinish Alumina will continue in business in the Shannon region, that any action required on his part or that of his Department has now been taken to ensure its continuance and the preservation of the 800 jobs involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has posed two questions.  In reply to the latter I would say that, from the point of view of the Irish Government, from the point of view of my Department and the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, we have had a very constructive approach to the difficulties being experienced by Aughinish Alumina.  From the point of view of the company generally and their future in the Shannon estuary, one has to accept that they have major problems, many of them pertaining on a world wide basis because of the world-wide depression in the aluminium market.  They have a number of aspects to put in place before they can restore their marketing position.  From our point of view and that of the plant in Limerick the company acknowledge that the Irish Government are being constructive in their efforts to remedy their difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the largest single factor under which they operate at a total disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> their other plants around the world is that we are so far removed from the raw material that has to be imported from Guinea in West Africa? Secondly would he agree that our energy costs are way out of line with those they must pay in Quebec, Jamaica or Australia? For that reason is the Minister satisfied that the company now believe that there is the commitment required on the part of the Irish Government, within limits &mdash; I am not talking about giving <Col N="1696" /> away natural gas for nothing or anything like that &mdash; that we are prepared to make a significant contribution so that if anything should happen down there the closure of Aughinish Alumina will not be the fault of anybody in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped I had reassured the Deputy that his latter suggestion is in the negative from our point of view.  Our approach has been constructive. The Deputy mentioned a number of factors, but there are others in relation to the difficulties being experienced by the company.  There are pluses from the point of view of the plant in the Shannon estuary, the pluses being that it is the most modern and probably the most efficient plant they have.  Overall I would have to say that any efforts on the part of the Irish Government to assist the company will be dependent for their eventual success on the outcome of market trends.  I can assure the Deputy that our approach has been constructive. With a meeting in mind in a number of months hence our approach will continue to be constructive in the interests of saving jobs in that plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister say that the last meeting was constructive because serious concern had been expressed about the previous meeting, that it was not constructive.  Certainly that was the view of the international people in charge.  Would the Minister accept that there is such over-capacity in the Alumina business that some plant of the four I mentioned will have to go and that we must be very careful in relation to our handling of the position to ensure that it will not be the one in Ireland that must go?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am being extremely careful, given the seriousness of the situation.  But I would have to refute any suggestion that meetings we have had with this company have been anything other than constructive.</P>

I am not adding to or subtracting from what was said to me.  They were totally disillusioned with the approach adopted at that meeting.  I am glad to hear from the Minister that the last meeting was more constructive.</P>

      <P>Following detailed discussions and certain inquiries which I have had made, I have given my agreement in principle, subject to a number of conditions, to the assignment of the State mining leases at Rossmore, County Carlow, to a Canadian based company. My Department have also approved of the grant of certain prospecting facilities to the company in the Leinster coalfield.</P>
      <P>The provision of facilities in the Leinster coalfield is designed to safeguard existing mining jobs in the area and to secure further mine development there.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there were serious inaccuracies and misleading statements contained in news releases circulated on the Vancouver Stock Exchange by Amble Resources Limited, a company which has been granted the prospecting licence to which the Minister of State referred?  Was the Minister aware of such inaccuracies before he granted the licence, or has he become aware of them since?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of an article in a national newspaper in this regard.  I have made some inquiries.  My Department have checked out with the Vancouver Stock Exchange the allegation that a stock exchange investigation was being carried out in regard to Amble Resources Limited.  The reply received <Col N="1698" /> was to the effect that this was incorrect, indeed that the shares were being freely traded.  I was not particularly pleased with the statement issued by the company. I asked them to issue a further statement, with my approval and that of my Department, and this they did freely. I am satisfied that the company is a freely traded one on the stock exchange in Vancouver and is not the subject of investigation.</P>
      <P>I might say further, in relation to the article in the national newspaper, that comments contained therein would not meet with my approval but, since legal action may be taken in regard to that article, I would not wish to comment further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that what I did was in the best interests of the continuation of mining at Rossmore, County Carlow, and the preservation of the 52 jobs involved there.  I have reached an agreement in principle.  The conditions attaching to the agreement are normal ones: first, that the company would show to my satisfaction that they have the necessary financial and technical resources for a viable operation at Rossmore; secondly, that the company would make arrangements in relation to the debts of Clifbourn (Mining) Limited &mdash; that is the present licence holder &mdash; which are acceptable to the creditors.  I understand that Amble Resources Limited have already invested money to secure some of the debts of that company, to ensure that mining is continued.  Thirdly, I might say that Clifbourn (Mining) Limited have to satisfy me that they have not concluded other agreements which would stand in the way of the enjoyment of the leases by Amble Resources Limited.  These are prudent provisions on which I insisted. Therefore, it will be seen that my consent is conditional.  It must follow that the requirements I set down are met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult really to put the Minister of State's statements together.  Is he aware that the dealings of another company, called Boulder Mountain Resources Ltd., operated by the same gentleman who is president of Amble Resources Ltd., were suspended on the Vancouver Stock Exchange last year?  Is the Minister of State also suggesting seriously to me that he took all this matter into consideration plus all the misleading statements issued by Amble Resources Ltd. prior to getting the licences? I will give a couple of examples.  First, they stated in a press release to the Vancouver Stock Exchange that they had already got licences, despite the fact that the application to the Department of Energy was made only on 28 October. They sent that out to investors on the Vancouver Stock Exchange saying that they had these licences although they did not apply for them until three weeks later.  That can only be interpreted as soliciting investment into this country. Second, in the press release they sent out and the information they issued to the Vancouver Stock Exchange they doubled the amount of measured reserves that were available in the Leinster coalfields. The real figure is 5.5, not 10 as they said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I want to make before dealing with the budget speech refers to budget day.  I appeal to the present Minister for Finance &mdash; or whoever his successor may be introducing the next budget &mdash; with regard to the distribution of copies of the budget speech in this House on budget day.  My copy is marked &ldquo;Confidential. Circulated by the Minister for Finance to Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, TD for his convenience and to be treated as conficential until the Minister has concluded his financial statement.&rdquo;  That is fine in itself and I welcome it.  Every office holder and former office holder, Minister or Minister of State on both sides of the House gets a copy of this speech on budget day.  However, the other Members of the House do not.  I honestly think that decision is archaic.  It seems a little schoolboyish that Deputies have to look over each other's shoulders into their neighbour's copy of the budget speech.  Many by and of their own choice never have been and never will be office holders.</P>
      <P>I suggest, as a non-political, non-party matter, that all Members elected to this House should be given the same courtesy and facility on budget day so as not to have discrimination between two different groups of Members all elected to the same House through the same process. I plead with the Minister to consider strongly this suggestion.  His successor may be here sooner than he expects as a result of this budget, anyhow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For eight of the past 13 years Coalition Governments have governed the affairs of this country.  During that period many budgets have been introduced by Coalition Ministers for Finance.  None has been as unimaginative or unhelpful as that introduced by the present Minister, Deputy Dukes, on Wednesday last.  No budget of modern times has contained so many hidden stings in addition to the many impositions that were so apparent <Col N="1736" /> on Wednesday last.  One must look at the present scenario before getting down to detail.  There are almost 250,000 unemployed, or 80,000 more than when this Government took office.  They are the figures available to us.  The real position, we all agree, is far worse.  This budget offered no hope of additional jobs.</P>
    <P>Foreign debt stands at £20.5 billion, or £8 billion more than when the Government took office.  We have the highest ever budget deficit at about £1,300 million. All this despite the much publicised aims of the Government to introduce financial rectitude in the early months of their tenure in office.  Because of their abysmal failure in this regard, as well as the appalling growth in unemployment, they should now resign before irreparable damage is done to our economy.  Many young people are coming on to our labour market each summer.  Is it any wonder that our next most serious problem is the resumption of emigration on a large scale, with no effort made to assess or measure the magnitude of this problem, much less to arrest it.  Perhaps one could accept the unemployment figures if financial rectitude had been achieved.  Alternatively, if the unemployment figures had been controlled at the expense of financial rectitude, then one could not be overcritical. But for both problems to have grown to their present magnitude will forever be a memorial to the disgraceful management of our economy by the present Taoiseach and his Government. Not even the highly paid and no expense spared handlers could try to put an appearance on this budget because it was obvious to them that it could not be sold to the community.  Indeed, the Government backbenchers are already aware of how that budget has been received on the ground.</P>
    <P>Recently these same handlers circulated leaflets to homes in the Dublin and Cork areas telling people, among other things, how successful this Government had been in reducing mortgage interest rates.  Will they now send out similar leaflets explaining the Government's role in increasing these same mortgage rates, or will they disclaim responsibility for <Col N="1737" /> the increase, having taken credit for the decrease?  So much for honest Government as presided over by the present Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I said that this budget was anti-job and there is no doubt that it makes no attempt whatsoever to help or improve the employment position.  Before going further, I should say that the speaker before me was the Minister of State at the Department of Education.  He spent most of his time speaking on the grants for sporting organisations and for sports, which were welcomed by those sporting organisations.  I am a great lover of sport and I agree with the sentiments he expressed regarding the necessity for support in these cases.  I welcome the growth in the financial allocations to these bodies.  However, it is incredible that that same Minister of State comes from a Department from which we had this announcement yesterday, under most peculiar and unusual circumstances, of the closing of Carysfort Training College. For three quarters of an hour in an address to this House, Deputy Creed, Minister of State, did not think it worthwhile to refer to this matter.  The excuse offered was that it did not come within his remit or under his responsibility within that Department.</P>
    <P>Surely he could not ignore a disgraceful decision taken in such an appalling manner and received, as it has been, incredibly by the staff, the authorities, the students and indeed by the public, not only of Dublin but of the entire country because of the great contribution which that training college has made.  The decision made by his Minister was announced only because the issue was raised by Deputy O'Rourke in this House yesterday morning.  It is very hard to understand, despite the fact that the Minister of State and perhaps other speakers will say that it was not within his area of responsibility.  That is a poor excuse for ignoring a topic so important and current. Certainly we as a party will be probing for further information as to what really happened yesterday.  Why were there no consultations?</P>

There has not been consultation.  I do not want interruptions that are not in line with what the Minister for Education said clearly this morning.  Indeed she went further and became vehement when asked about the fate of the 109 staff.  I wonder if the Minister for Foreign Affairs heard her reply to that question.  I will not be goaded into repeating her very unfair response.  So much for open Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now refer to the hidden budget. In his Budget Statement the Minister for Finance said he had cut the Estimates by £55 million plus.  He said details would be given to the House in &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;, handed around after the speech.  I see from that document that there has been a cut back in the Education Estimate of more than £12 million from the amount originally estimated. At no time did the Minister of State at the Department of Education refer to that cut back.  We have had announcements &mdash; I suppose there will be more coming &mdash; of increased fees for vocational and other third level students. The capitation grants are being withdrawn from private schools.  It should be remembered that that grant is not in respect of the schools but &mdash; the students. <Col N="1739" /> One must ask if there are sinister reasons for that.</P>
    <P>I saw the performance of the Minister for Health on TV last night.  Rupert Murdock would have been proud of him: he would like to have him as his chief handler in difficult situations, because that Minister, with a wave of the hand, told the Irish people that he was responsible for controlling £1,200 million expenditure and for employing 58,000 people. He said that if tough decisions had to be taken he would take them in the interest of the Irish people.  That is a far cry from the caring trade union official I first knew.</P>
    <P>The cuts do not end there, or the announcement of closures.  All one can say is that the longer Ministers are kept in the House the safer we will be because if we let them too loose and too free to roam about they will close everything they see.</P>
    <P>There has been a cut back of £19.3 million in the Environment Estimate. What will be the major components in that?  There has been a big cut back in respect of the Garda Síochána despite the grave comments we had here last night on the growth in the crime rate.</P>
    <P>They are some of the hidden stings in the budget.  There will be no jobs created by the budget.  My party Leader this morning gave details of the £25 million cut in the capital spending programme, obviously to accommodate a target the Minister wanted to achieve.  In addition to cuts in the capital programme throughout the last three years, that cut this year indicates a complete lack of commitment to jobs.  This is an entirely wrong approach because we need to take a new look at our infrastructure.  The Minister and I travel regularly from Cork to Dublin and neither of us can have any doubt that the Naas by-pass and the Curragh dual carriageway have given tremendous benefit to motorists on the southern road.  The same applies to the Cork-Killarney road and many others. However, we need many new bridges and by-passes and we should go further with the development of toll bridges.  We should encourage private investment in <Col N="1740" /> this respect.  Certain members of the Government, perhaps, would object to that type of development.</P>
    <P>In France there are many toll roads and bridges.  The socialist Government just about to finish office did not abolish any of those toll roads.  Without doubt, they earn much revenue.  Their provision here would have a twofold purpose: it should provide many jobs and if private people are prepared to invest it would ease State involvement.  Simultaneously, we could build many new roads, particularly to the west and south and in other directions.  Investment in that type of work would take thousands of people off the dole and at the same time provide the infrastructure we are lacking and which is needed to help regional development.</P>
    <P>I read a copy of <i>Aspect</i> magazine, dated December 1985, to help me to remember all the broken promises of the Government and how that affects the budget situation.  Broken promise No. 1 was contained in their <i>Programme for Government</i>.  It promised firm and decisive action to halt and reverse the growth in unemployment &ldquo;which stands at the alarming level of 170,000&rdquo;.  The magazine I have referred to stated in December that unemployment then stood at 228,000.  Of course the real figure is much worse.  Now, in the first week of February, the figure stands at more than 230,000.  Again, the real position is much worse.</P>
    <P>In broken promise No. 2 the Government said they would pursue domestic budgetary policy that would phase out the current budget deficit by 1987.  Do I have to tell the House how far off target that is?  The current budget deficit is approximately £1,300 million.</P>
    <P>Broken promise No. 3 is that in which the Government said that the portion of tax derived from PAYE on salaries and wages would be reduced.  The performance has been the same: income tax as a percentage of GNP is at an all time high record.  Do not let anybody tell you that the mickey-mouse improvements of last week will change that substantially.</P>
    <P>I could go on with all those broken promises but the House is already aware <Col N="1741" /> of the major difficulties our economy is encountering.  There was a lot of screaming and noise about the 1981 budget deficit which stood at £802 million, 7.4 per cent.  That is a far cry from the £1,300 million of today which represents 8.6 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>The budget is anti-business in many ways.  The Minister and the Department of Finance seem to have got their way at last with section 84.  I will quote from an article in <i>The Irish Times,</i> dated 30 January last, the day after the budget, written by Ron Bolger of Stokes Kennedy and Crowley.  He referred to the cost to borrowers under section 84 of the Finance Bill.  This neutral observer wrote:</P>
    <P>The effect will be to increase the cost to borrowers of such loans, since a typical section 84 loan agreement will contain tax warranties allowing the lender to increase the interest rate so as to leave it in the same position after all taxes.  The essence of section 84 loans has been to reduce borrowings in Irish pounds to a level comparable with our industrial neighbours.  At a time when Irish interest rates are still quite high, the effect is to increase the cost of funding to Irish borrowers.  For a relatively modest yield of £6 million in 1986, this proposal will have serious consequences by removing one of the best financial incentives in attracting investments to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that this is an anti-family budget.  One can say that for many reasons, particularly about the 4 per cent increase to social welfare recipients and because of the reduction in food subsidies which will make food dearer.  I appeal to the Minister to rethink this situation and to rethink the retention tax, as it is called, not as far as the big investors are concerned but where it concerns small investors. I endorse what the Leader of my party said this morning about old age pensioners.  The old age pensioner and his wife are probably getting about £5,000 through his pension.  Now the threshold has been raised to about £6,300 so in their tax allowances they have a surplus of £1,300 but, because of the new situation, <Col N="1742" /> if they have a nest egg in the bank, that £1,300 tax free allowance cannot be used and whatever nest egg is in the bank or the Post Office is taxed at source at 35 per cent although they have a balance in their tax free allowances.  I appeal to the Ministers in the House to consider that seriously.  We hope to see amendments to the Finance Bill when it comes before the House.  If the Government do not introduce amendments we will submit them.</P>
    <P>Over the weekend I was alerted to three cases giving rise to serious difficulty because of this decision.  The three cases are somewhat similar but I will cite one, marginally altering the figures, for obvious reasons.  A man with a health condition disposed of his assets, on doctor's advice, some years ago.  He had two school-going children.  He bought a small house from his assets and invested the balance to give him an income of £7,500 per annum which is substantially less than the average industrial earnings, but he can get by on it.  Against that income from the investment that man was allowed the normal tax free allowances, marriage allowance, mortgage allowance, life assurance, VHI and so on, which meant that he had to pay income tax on slightly less than £1,000 a year.  The tax paid by him last year was £321.  Because of the new arrangement that man cannot claim any of those tax free allowances so his income, which after tax amounted to about £7,200, is now reduced to £4,800, because his tax payment now becomes £2,600 instead of £300 as a result of the tax allowances being withdrawn.  I checked that situation with the Department of Finance who confirmed that that was the position as far as that man was concerned.  Whatever one can say about taxing income at source for big investors this is an example where a caring Government should look at the retention tax very carefully before the Finance Bill is published.  The case I have cited illustrates discrimination against the individual, and is surely unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>In relation to agriculture, our prime industry, it got little or no treatment from the Minister for Finance on budget day. <Col N="1743" /> I among others, was recently criticised for saying that this will be a difficult year for farmers, perhaps our most difficult since we entered the EC.  It will be a difficult year but both the Government and the Minister seem to be intent only on confronting every group in society. If it is not the Minister for Agriculture confronting the president of the farmers' association, it is the Minister for Health closing every hospital he can get his hands on, or the Minister for Education closing colleges because of their religious background or for whatever reason.  They seem to be intent on confronting communities, organisations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister is a bit testy, but what I said was, &ldquo;I wondered was it&rdquo;, because I saw recently a young Fine Gael group saying that they wanted the religious orders taken from control of the schools.  Is the Minister aware of that?  Is the Minister aware that his Taoiseach was embarrassed about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw where young Fianna Fáil said recently that the Deputy was going to join Des O'Malley.  Are you going to do it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not say <Col N="1744" /> that.  Will the Minister show me the quotation?  I am obviously pinching the Minister for I can let the Minister have the quotation from his Fine Gael group, so am I not entitled to wonder why Carysfort was closed?</P>
      <P>This is a very serious time for agriculture. Our family farm is so far behind in average European production that it needs to be protected and one must be concerned about the competence and determination of the Minister and the Government to ensure this protection. We are facing a six months presidency by the Dutch who are very developed, at two and a half times the European average. They are not concerned about setbacks and they are very much into factory farming as compared with our family holdings. For the second half of the year the British, who have no commitment to the CAP but merely to a British cheap food policy, will hold the presidency.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to thank <i>The Cork Examiner</i> for its leading article this morning relating to the mean and petty tax.  Like the Minister, I do not always agree with the leading article in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> but on this occasion the article is well researched and well worth quoting from.  The article refers to this retention tax to which I have referred and to the hardship that would be created for people.  It states:</P>
      <P>Whatever the reason, the end result is a system which can only be described as a monumental piece of financial and social blundering and one which is fraught with physical as well as financial perils, especially for old folk.</P>
      <P>It will be recalled that last year, when attacks on the old people were at their height, special concessions were given to them to encourage them to save rather than keep money at home, where both they and the cash would become targets for the robbers.</P>
      <P>Now those concessions have been removed at one fell swoop, leaving them wide open once again to the temptation to retain their savings at home...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In more general terms, every small <Col N="1745" /> saver is being hit with the imposition of £35 tax on every £100 of interest earned, in the majority of instances on money that has already been subject to taxation.</P>
    <P>Not only is this element of double taxation immoral in every sense, but it also brings into the direct tax net, for the first time in this country, children who have small savings accounts.</P>
    <P>If this mean and petty tax represents caring Government, more and more people will begin to take the view that the Government should be changed.</P>
    <P>And it would be interesting to know whether in fact double taxation is constitutional anyway.</P>
    <P>That very adequately covers the points I made, especially in relation to tax on children's savings.</P>
    <P>There has been a 2 per cent increase in the standard rate of VAT which has been subject to enormous fluctuations over the years.  It is a further example of the anti-family nature of the budget as the standard rate applies to almost all items essential for the home.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he would be looking at further improvements in the area of sport and I wish to make a special plea in relation to VAT on hurleys.  Hurling is a very old traditional Irish game played the length and breadth of Leinster and Munster and in Galway.  It is also played in towns and cities, but the cost of hurleys puts an enormous strain on families.  The Minister of State referred this morning to all the amateur associations who do so much for all games, and I agree with him. However, ordinary schools and colleges play hurley from 1 February and when they break for holidays the students continue to play.  They all need hurleys and, unfortunately, sometimes they break after only one game.  They cost around £5 and the additional imposition of VAT at the rate of 25 per cent should be looked at because no other sporting equipment is as deserving of a reduction in VAT as hurleys.  Perhaps hurleys for adults could be taxed and those for children exempted.  I know that the Leas-Cheann <Col N="1746" /> Comhairle shares my views because hurling is played all over his county also.  I will continue to raise this issue, no matter what party are in power, because it is very important.</P>
    <P>We will be hearing all about teachers' pay tomorrow but I am disappointed at the motion coming before the House. During my years as Minister I appealed almost daily to all sides to accept negotiated procedures, whether from the Labour Court or the conciliation and arbitration scheme which served the public service so well over the years.  If the Government break those procedures it will have a far reaching impact and effect.  If that happens it will be very difficult to appeal to other bodies to observe the rules.  It is said that, if the rules do not suit you, you should change them but you cannot do so arbitrarily, you do so by negotiation.</P>
    <P>It would be very wrong of me to name or compliment anyone but I can claim credit for having appointed the present arbitrator.  I went to great pains and trouble to find someone who was suited to the post.  Politics did not enter into it and I was not interested in his political views as long as he was competent and had a commitment to perform an extremely difficult job.  I have no hesitation in saying that my choice was a good one and it was endorsed when the present Minister for the Public Service reappointed the same arbitrator.  The arbitrator, having taken all factors into account, came up with his findings and I am saddened that the Government saw fit to break their word because they are honour bound to pay the award.  I hope that many of the Government backbenchers will realise tomorrow how important it is to preserve the conciliation and arbitration scheme because it was negotiated by agreement.</P>
    <P>I welcome some aspects of the budget, especially the assistance for Cork Opera House, the Cork Enterprise Board and for other cultural and sporting organisations. Some Members thought they were bitty but these organisations are deserving of support and I welcome any move in that direction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1747" /> The overall direction of the budget is very hard to understand.  There has been no assistance for jobs or job creation and there are a number of areas which we have neglected over the decades.  I refer in particular to the forestry programme. The EC's second largest import after oil is forest and timber products.  It is appalling that we cannot make a greater impact in getting revenue from our forests.  I do not lay the blame at anybody's door, but successive Governments have failed to tackle this urgent problem.  There can and should be a big improvement in this area.  I read today that the Taoiseach, the Leader of the Seanad and others had gone to France to a conference covering concern about the deforestation of Europe.  I am very concerned about that matter, but did it merit the Taoiseach going to such a conference when we are already ably represented by competent people in the person of the Minister of State and the Leader of the Seanad?  At a time like this, with Ministers capable of undertaking any project and closing anything, he is very unwise to go to any such conference.  Forestry and its development are very important.  It is sad that the Community should be importing from third countries such large quantities when we, as a small nation, could supply some of those needs.</P>
    <P>Fisheries is another area where there has been little or no progress.  With the advent of Spain particularly, and Portugal to a lesser extent, there are problems facing our fishing industry and our fleet who are responsible for the control of our fishing waters for the transitional period. It seems inevitable that many of our food processing plants have experienced difficulties over the years.  It is disappointing to see the difficulties being experienced by the food processing plant in Midleton. I hope they will be satisfactorily resolved for the sake of the workers and the farmers in the Cork area.  I am very concerned that this business will be saved for the people of Cork, particularly east Cork.</P>
    <P>Despite claims by the Minister, an area <Col N="1748" /> which has not been treated well in this budget is tourism.  Admittedly small concessions were made.  If there are parts of the budget which could be described as bitty, those relating to tourism could be so described.  I acknowledge that the reduction in VAT on meals is a help, but only a little help.  This Government are not giving a direction to the tourist industry.  I was disappointed to hear today that we will not have a ferry between Wales and Cork.  I realise the Minister will say that they promised to guarantee so much money many months ago.  That may be, but they took too long to reach that decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We promised the money six months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It was too late.  I realise the Minister is probably testy today because he knows that his Government's treatment of this ferry over the last three years has been disgraceful. It is terrible to think that in the Cork-Kerry region we will not have a ferry this year.  This is a tremendous drawback.  You cannot expect people coming into Dublin to drive to the Cork-Kerry region.  The Minister says the money was promised six months ago but that was too late, as has been proved because when the firm set about getting a suitable vessel it was not available.  We must plan ahead but we do not do that.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I asked the Minister for Labour about AnCO courses, trainees, the Youth Employment Agency, this year's schemes and projects and the numbers involved.  I asked if this year's figures would be as good as last year's and he said he did not know.  There is something wrong with planning of that nature.  I believe there are many stings in this budget which have not yet come to light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On budget day the Minister cut back on the original Estimate for the Department of Labour by £6 million. There was a lower estimated take up of £6.4 million from the social employment scheme.  Does that mean there will be a cutback of training programmes or what? I am not satisfied with the present position. <Col N="1749" /> I would prefer to see jobs created. It is significant that yesterday the Minister was not able to tell me how many placements had been made of people who completed AnCO courses.  I suspect that the figure has been dropping because no number of courses can substitute for permanent employment.  At a time when unemployment is so high it is important that the present rate of activity be maintained. We must ask if the Minister for Finance is cutting back on those training schemes and programmes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey said this morning that the £25 million cutback in the public capital programme was being made to achieve this 14.2 per cent reduction.  This is a book-keeping measure.  To blazes with more jobs; forget about creating employment; keep the books to suit the Government.  Between the time the Estimates were agreed and the Minister presented the budget, there was a cut of £55 million.  This was another effort to make the arithmetic of the budget look better.</P>
    <P>I can never understand why successive Coalition Governments seem to be completely anti the building industry.  I dread to think what is contained in these hidden strings.  Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Barry, will tell us.  There has been a £19 million cutback in the Estimate for the Environment.  This Government, who are worse than their predecessors, seem determined to run the building industry down to a hitherto unknown level.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the necessity for encouraging privatisation in road development, and there are many other areas I could mention.  Resources are scarce but in my city there are more than 50 per cent unemployed.  Things are even worse now than they were in the fifties when another Coalition Government were in office.  I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Creed, saying this morning that a great job had been done ensuring that work on housing repairs was carried out by registered builders.  If any Minister thinks that is going to make a major contribution to employment in the building industry, it shows that he is far out of touch with the feelings on the ground.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1750" /> The Minister said there had been consultations about the closing of Carysfort College.  I listened to the Minister for Education on radio this morning and she specifically said she intended having consultations. When asked about consultation with staff interests &mdash; I think 109 was the figure mentioned &mdash; she said of course there would be consultations but it would be wrong for her to tell these people what their future would be.  Obviously there were no consultations.  The same would appear to be true of some of the hospital closures.  Yet today the Minister of State told me that the Government had made a major contribution to the construction industry by ensuring that only registered builders would do this work.  I admit that was a wise decision, but the impact it will make will be minimal.</P>
    <P>I have tried to give an assessment of the budget.  It is going nowhere.  It is not giving us any direction.  It is making life more difficult for everybody and it is increasing the cost of living.  The old claim about the drop in the inflation rate is no longer true, that rate has bottomed out and it will turn in the other direction.  We must be concerned about the massive run on money out of the country and the apparent inactivity of the Government to arrest that flow.  As a nation we will suffer serious consequences.</P>
    <P>We have to learn a lot yet about this budget.  Its original impact has been catastrophic. Even the Government backbenchers are downhearted and disappointed because of their experience in their constituencies over the weekend. I have made some appeals that certain matters be rectified in the Finance Bill.  In particular, I mention the retention tax and its impact on the elderly, the young and on the person whom I gave as an example in my speech.  I also make an appeal with regard to the 4 per cent that was not given to child dependants on social welfare.  How could any Minister have been so mean?  This was done at a time when the Minister present in the House knows that in our city we have poverty of a magnitude I have not seen since the fifties.  This Government have <Col N="1751" /> lost their way and have not kept in touch with the people.</P>
    <P>I have said in this House on many occasions that holding clinics is a very important matter.  I know the Minister present holds clinics and he must know now from his experience last week that people, the young, the old and the sick, are worried about their savings.  I appeal to him to tell his colleague who does not seem to know what is happening to reconsider this matter in respect of the categories I mentioned.  If the Minister cannot rectify the matter in the Finance Bill, surely the Labour Party at least will have to vote with us on the reasonable, caring and concerned amendments we shall submit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to apologise to the Chair and to Deputy Fitzgerald for interrupting him on two occasions.  It is not my wont to do that.  It is bad for my blood pressure and I should not engage in interruptions.  I hope my future behaviour will not be a cause of concern.</P>
      <P>The effect of the tax change in last week's budget is to give to every PAYE taxpayer the equivalent of one week's wages.  We have removed the 1 per cent income levy; we have increased the PAYE allowance by £100 for a single person and £200 for a married couple; we have increased the personal allowance by £100 for a single person; we have broadened the 35 per cent tax band by £200 for a single person and £400 for a married couple; and we have raised the age exemption limits to keep pace with inflation.  We have reduced the top rate of tax from 60 per cent to 58 per cent and we have doubled the age allowance.</P>
      <P>These benefits to those who are PAYE earners are the most significant reductions in income tax that have been given for a great number of years.  The effect is bound to encourage the ordinary worker who will know that more of his wages will be under his control after April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the budget the Government have been guided by four clear and essential objectives: to allocate scarce national <Col N="1752" /> resources in a way that will most benefit all the people of the State; to continue to fight the growth in foreign borrowing and to cut public expenditure; to encourage the productive sectors of the economy with the aim of creating employment and generating wealth; to provide for those in our society who must look to the State for assistance.</P>
    <P>The budget is set firmly in the context of the Government's economic policies as set out in the national plan <i>Building on Reality.</i> These policies are working.  I make no bones about claiming credit for the Government where I feel it is due. We have had significant economic success since we came to office.  Thanks to our determined anti-inflation policies we have succeeded in reducing the inflation rate to under 5 per cent.  In 1981 Ireland's inflation rate was among the highest in the western world; today it is down to the average in our main trading partners. That is a considerable achievement.  The balance of payments has improved dramatically; the deficit has fallen to the equivalent of 3 per cent of GNP, compared with 15 per cent in 1981.  Significant improvement has also been achieved in the public finances, especially in relation to the control of public expenditure.  All this represents real progress, especially when you consider the enormous problems the Government faced on coming into office, and the fact that the international economic climate over the past three years has been far from propitious.</P>
    <P>It appears from listening to speakers on the opposite benches that they have learned nothing in the past three years. All the sins to which they were prey in 1977, to spend away, borrow away and tax away, are still what they are offering the electorate nine years later.  There has been no change.  They will raise taxes &mdash; there is no other way to pay for the borrowing they envisage or the increased expenditure they propose.  They will raise public expenditure, further damage the economy and increase further borrowing, thus passing the debt on to another Government and to another generation.</P>
    <P>That is not the way this Government <Col N="1753" /> intend to proceed.  In the interests of the people who pay the bills, namely the taxpayers, the Government are determined to cut public expenditure and to pass the benefits of cuts in public expenditure to the people whom we forced to pay the bills, the ordinary taxpayers.  I suspect that part of the reason there is a division in the ranks opposite is that some former members of Fianna Fáil could no longer wear the policy of borrow more, spend more and tax more which has been the hallmark of Fianna Fáil for the past ten years.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley and his party are enunciating precisely the policies I have laid down today.  In the past three years the Deputy and his so far small handful of supporters have been battling to bring some form of realisation into Fianna Fáil and to woo them away from the rake's progress they have indulged in in the past ten years.  Deputy O'Malley has been endeavouring to bring some reality into the thinking of the economic gurus who guide the political fortunes of Fianna Fáil.  Unfortunately, if one is to judge from the contributions to the budget debate from the other side of the House, there is no sign of change.  I presume it was in despair that Deputy O'Malley left that party and has been followed so far by three others.  He was aware of the economic reality.  He knew that the Fianna Fáil policy of taxing more people, borrowing more money and spending more of the money taken from the ordinary man and woman was no longer a realistic policy.  The Deputy left before Fianna Fáil sink the ship of what was once a fine party.</P>
    <P>The country is still paying for the policies that Fianna Fáil introduced in 1977. Many more years will elapse before we can reverse the damage caused by those policies, but we have made a start.  It is significant that the public generally accept what we are doing as being necessary and are prepared to follow us.  The level of support for Deputy O'Malley is an indication of what the public preceive as the correct thrust of his policies, though we yet have to hear the details of his policies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1754" /> We have set out in the budget details of how we intend to achieve the goals we have set ourselves.  Deputy Fitzgerald concluded his remarks by saying that the budget shows no clear sense of direction. I reject that charge totally.  The Government do not claim to be all knowing, but we do claim to have the courage of our convictions and the courage to do what we consider best in the interests of this small country.  We know where we are going and we are determined to follow our consistent policies through to success. We will not be dissuaded from our course by soft options such as those being proposed from other quarters.</P>
    <P>It amazes me that after ten years Fianna Fáil have learned nothing despite the damage they caused to the economy. They continue to suggest easy ways out. There is no painless way by which our economic position can be improved.  The national debt, for instance, stands at 128 per cent of GNP.  The growth in debt service charges has been absorbing an ever increasing proportion of our tax revenue. This has reduced inevitably the scope for the provision of essential services and for the creation of sustainable employment.</P>
    <P>The level of debt has reached the point where debt servicing absorbs almost one third of Government revenue and, with that revenue standing at 40 per cent of GNP, there is little room for manoeuvre on the tax front.  Tight control must be maintained on all expenditure programmes if the debt burden is not to escalate beyond control.  This is the reality the Government faced in preparing the budget.  It is the reality the Opposition refuse to face.  The approach we have adopted has been to recognise the constraints this reality imposed.  This budget is a major step forward in sharing the national cost fairly and at the same time creating a climate for economic growth and for the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>The budget has spread the tax burden more evenly and more equitably.  The policy of the Government has been and remains that the overall tax burden will not be increased.  We recognised that personal tax levels were very high and <Col N="1755" /> we shared the widespread conviction that they must be reduced significantly.  As I said at the outset, as a result of this budget every taxpayer will have the equivalent of an extra week's wages this year.</P>
    <P>High personal tax levels, as the Minister for Finance reminded the Dáil last week, as well as being a burden on the individual and on families act also as a disincentive to employment creation, discourage initiative and ultimately slow down economic activity.  It is no accident that many people when asked before the budget what was the most worrying aspect of their economic situation, replied that it was taxation.  We appreciated this concern and, despite the difficult financial position still facing us and the pressure for high tax revenue, the changes announced last week constitute a significant and substantial improvement for the PAYE sector.  This has been recognised generally since.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Government would have liked to have taken these tax changes a lot further but we must all face up to economic realities.  In the light of current constraints, the tax changes announced are as far as any responsible Government could go.  However, the changes will mean that an additional 12,000 people will no longer be subject to tax while 191,000 persons &mdash; a huge proportion of the population &mdash; will be subject to lower marginal rates of tax. The marginal rates of tax have been the bugbear for many in the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>The Government are fully alive to the need for a fairer and better tax collection and enforcement system.  The measures announced in November last, together with the further measures, particularly the tax amnesty introduced in the budget, mark a major step forward in this system. The message to the PAYE sector is that the Government are conscious of the burden that sector have been shouldering and are determined to continue to try to lighten that burden further in the future. We have made a significant start this year.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the retention tax <Col N="1756" /> on bank and building society saving deposits will lead to a more cost efficient collection of tax due to the State in respect of deposit income.  It will serve also to prevent the evasion of tax and to ensure a more balanced treatment between the main financial institutions.  This creative innovation not only taps the resources of the investment sector but widens the tax spread to such an extent that we can reasonably expect a large portion of our black economy to be forced to make a due contribution to the national finances.</P>
    <P>We are being told constantly that there is much tax avoidance and evasion and that the black economy is destroying the legal side of the economy.  We are confident that a large proportion of the black economy will be forced to make a due contribution as a result of this new measure. The burden on the legal economy will be thereby alleviated.</P>
    <P>No one should question the justification for taxing interest income at source when investors are earning high real interest gains after inflation.  Logic and equity demand that the balance of taxation be shifted from the PAYE sector to the incomes derived from interest and other returns on financial assets.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of the retention tax, I should like to say a few words about the position of savers who would not normally have a tax liability.  There have been some alarmist reports in the press about the situation of elderly but small investors.  There have been allegations that money, on which tax has already been paid, will now be taxed again when deposited in the bank.  Let me make it clear that the retention tax applies only to the interest on deposits and is designed to bring all the financial institutions under the same rules as far as taxation is concerned.  This also means that the facility of confidentiality, previously enjoyed only by the building societies, will now be extended to all the other financial institutions.  As far as the small saver is concerned, there remain a variety of attractive schemes for saving money on a tax-free basis, such as through the Post Office and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1757" /> As far as the position of old people in general is concerned, let me underline the fact that this budget and, indeed, the whole economic strategy of this Government is designed to protect the incomes and savings of our old people.  Over the past decade the most alarming experience for those on pensions and fixed incomes has been the way in which inflation has eaten into their savings and depleted their spending power.  The previous speaker spoke about public representatives holding clinics.  If we think back a few years we remember the number of people complaining that the State was encouraging them to save but doing nothing to control inflation which was eating away the value of their savings.  That is no longer so.  The primary cause of the depletion of the value of savings was the high level of inflation and that has been corrected.</P>
    <P>Since this Government came into power inflation has been reduced from 20 per cent to under 5 per cent.  For the first time in years people are able to earn real rates of return on their savings and investments.  By decreasing even further the rate of inflation, as our policies are designed to do, we are ensuring that old people are protected from the appalling experience of seeing their incomes falling in value and in purchasing power from day to day.  Our determination to reduce the burden on taxpayers extends in particular to older people.  In this budget we have doubled the age allowance and we have increased by 5 per cent the age exemption limits.  I want to spell out what this means.  A married couple where either is over 65 can now have an income of £6,300 without paying a penny in tax. A married couple where either is over 75 can now have an income of £7,350 tax free.  This is about 75 per cent of the average industrial wage.  Of course the removal of the income levy and the other changes in the tax allowances and tax bands will also benefit old people paying tax.</P>
    <P>Our objective in stimulating the climate for intitative and enterprise is to bring <Col N="1758" /> about real improvements in the productive sector which is central to the creation of growth, employment and wealth. The budget, therefore, provides valuable incentives to improve the investment climate for our industry.  I would mention here the plan to increase the attractiveness for private investors of taking shares in companies qualifying for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax on profits of manufacturing industry and certain services. That is a very important and imaginative initative.  It means that in future the compaines in the 10 per cent manufacturing bracket can entice investment in capital from private individuals and save them, the companies, going to the banks to borrow, in the knowledge that they can pass back to those individuals from whom they get the money the benefits of their 10 per cent tax rate. When the implications of this become known and when the possibilities for investment and reward at a very low rate of tax are recognised, I am convinced that we will see a new surge in investment in industry and a consequent surge in the creation of jobs.  The details will be spelled out in the Finance Bill which will be introduced in the coming months and I would ask all Deputies to study it carefully and bring it to the attention of companies and of people who wish to invest. I hope that the Government will undertake a series of advertisements or seminars to bring to the attention of investors and people in industry the value we see in this measure for both partners.  The benefits for the workers will be extremely positive.  I would mention also the reduction in capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 35 per cent on longer term capital gains.  This reduction will encourage longer term investment.  The Finance Bill will also include an incentive to increase the share of private investment in research and new product development. These are very important for the future industrial growth of this country.  We have perhaps been a little tardy in investing in new products and the research which is necessary.  This is an indication of the Government's concern that job creation efforts should not be confined <Col N="1759" /> only to the present; we must look to the future and establish industries now which will provide work for future generations.</P>
    <P>One of the most encouraging aspects of economic performance in recent years has been our export figures.  Last year exports of goods and services rose by around 6 per cent in volume.  Industrial exports rose by 5 per cent, not as much as in 1984 when we had a record 19 per cent increase, but an encouraging result nonetheless.  Agricultural exports went up by 7 per cent.  Last year saw a trade surplus of £200 million, the first surplus in 40 years.  It is a fact which has not been sufficiently appreciated by commentators. It is an indication of the strength, imagination and dynamism of our exporting sector who could bring about such an achievement in adverse world economic conditions.</P>
    <P>Given that the trade sector is the main contributor to growth in the economy, it is essential that our export markets continue to grow this year by at least the same percentage as in 1985.  The maintenance of that level of export growth is highly dependent on our maintaining our competitive position.  The lowering of the inflation rate is the most significant contributor to what is in all the circumstances a modestly successful economic condition in the past few years.  We were able to bring about an improvement in exports because we were able to compete due to a lower rate of inflation.  They are all dependent on one another.  If we do this we can expect some growth in national output this year, a further reduction in the balance of payments deficit and a further fall in the inflation rate.  All this will be conducive to the creation of more employment.</P>
    <P>According to the best available estimates a growth of 4 per cent is expected in world trade in the coming year.  The Government's priority aim is to create a climate in which Irish exporters can share in such growth.  The figures for our trade surplus last year which I have already quoted indicate that we have already met with a great deal of success.  With the recent budget and the assistance of our <Col N="1760" /> State agencies such as CTT, An Bord Bainne, BIM, CBF and others and, of course, the help that will be given them by the officers of my Department, wherever we have embassies or consular services &mdash; with all these agencies &mdash; we are fine tuning our export potential to make the most of the possibilities before us.  For example, we may find it advantageous to concentrate our efforts more on the European market this year.  We have the confidence of our past successes, particularly in the high technology and chemical sectors, to ensure that we take full advantage of every possibility in the coming months and years.</P>
    <P>Tourism which is very important to us for economic growth, also turned in a very good performance in 1985.  The number of overseas visitors to Ireland rose by 3 per cent and tourist receipts were up by 20 per cent to over £700 million.  Together with the grants announced last year for hotels and guest-houses the budget will give a considerable boost to our tourism prospects in 1986.  I am happy to note that the tourist industry in general has welcomed the decision to reduce VAT on restaurant meals from 23 per cent to 10 per cent.  I believe that this reduction will help to generate further employment in the tourism sector and safeguard existing jobs. Almost one-fifth of expenditure on meals in restaurants and hotels is made by foreign tourists and this expenditure comprises a significant proportion of their spending in Ireland.  The VAT reduction on meals, therefore, opens the way to more competitively priced holidays and the attraction of more visitors.  Of course, another benefit, not for tourists but for the internal market, is the fact that VAT on food in canteens and such places will also be reduced from 23 per cent to 10 per cent, thereby putting more money back into the pockets of people who use these canteens.</P>
    <P>Further the budget introduces a special VAT refund system which will reduce VAT to 10 per cent on the purchase of certain high cost touring coaches used in the tourist industry.  There have been complaints in recent years that the high <Col N="1761" /> rates of VAT had handicapped Irish coach hire companies in their competition with foreign coach companies operating during the summer.  The Government have responded to such complaints.</P>
    <P>We are confident that the Irish companies will now be able to compete on a more equal footing and win their fair share of business.  I am encouraged by the statement of the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation that they will be able to use the VAT reductions to market Ireland abroad in a much more aggressive manner.</P>
    <P>As I said at the start of my statement this afternoon one of the prime considerations of this budget is to protect the less well off members of society.  The provisions announced under the various social welfare schemes will ensure that, given that the increases are designed to keep pace with inflation.  I am sure these benefits will be felt where they are most sorely needed, whether by the unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed, the elderly and the other poorer sections of our society.</P>
    <P>When I say that we have increased these benefits to take account of inflation I am not sure it is widely appreciated that we are virtually the only country in Europe that have done that.  Quite uniquely we have matched our social welfare benefits with inflation over the past number of years.  Despite all the other problems with which we have been confronted, our concern for the old, the unemployed and the children has made this Government ensure that we will at least do that when many other countries have abandoned any attempt to do so. Of course, for the first time &mdash; in the bonus we gave just before Christmas &mdash; we included the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>Unemployment continues to be an overriding concern for the Government. The thrust of this budget and of other current Government policies is to create conditions conducive to employment through the stimulation of greater economic activity.  The enterprise allowance scheme and the social employment scheme have already made real progress <Col N="1762" /> in this direction.  The 15,500 people who benefit from these schemes are concrete proof of this.  Similarly, measures for home improvements are bringing the triple benefits of improving living conditions for individual households, providing employment for those working on such improvements and those who supply the materials for such improvements and arresting tax evasion and related activities outside the legal economy.  The budget also aims at giving a further boost to employment and to reducing costs to the consumer by reducing the VAT rate on a number of services.  Much of the advice given us is to the effect that this is the most productive sector for job creation &mdash; the services sector &mdash; and the reduction in VAT from 23 per cent to 10 per cent for a lot of businesses in that sector must help to create more employment.</P>
    <P>The budget and our economic performance and prospects cannot, of course, be viewed and assessed except in the context of the international economic scene.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs it is important that I say something about this, especially since the Opposition spokesmen and commentators have failed to advert sufficiently and to give due emphasis to the international environment in which we must operate.  It is a hard fact of life that the Government's economic and budgetary strategy demands not only concentration on the specific problems in the Irish economy but must also take adequate account of developments in the world economic situation.  We are a small open economy, very much subject to world economic and market forces.  We must align our strategy with that of other economies in the industrialised world to counter, through co-operative efforts, the difficulties that beset us all.  On the positive side, we wish to ensure that our economy will be well situated to avail of an upswing in world economic activity.</P>
    <P>We have adopted a strategy similar to that of most other OECD countries in pursuing steady and restrained monetary and fiscal policies.  The aim of this strategy has been to reduce inflation, to stabilise it at a low rate, to contain budget <Col N="1763" /> deficits and public spending and to seek an improvement in profits and profitability among enterprises which could be conducive to stronger investment and the creation of employment.  There has also been an emphasis on improving the functioning of economies and allowing markets to function more effectively.  The OECD have recognised the steps that Ireland has taken in pursuit of this strategy.</P>
    <P>As a result of this strategy the economic situation in the OECD countries has for the past three years shown a trend of recovery.  While this recovery remains gradual, it is now mature.  The overall OECD growth rate in 1985 of 2.75 per cent is projected to continue at around 2.5 per cent for the next 18 months.  The average inflation rate has declined further to around 4.5 per cent, the lowest rate in 16 years, thus raising confidence in a sustained recovery.</P>
    <P>If that sustained recovery takes place our surest way of benefiting is to remain competitive.  Our surest way of remaining competitive is to ensure that our rate of inflation is not higher &mdash; bearing in mind that the vast amount of our trade is done with the other OECD countries &mdash; than at least the average of those countries with which we trade, and preferably at the lower end of the scale.  However, these successes are not matched in the fight against unemployment.  The rise of 1 per cent in employment among OECD States was concentrated mainly in the US and Canada with only a small increase within the EC.  Projections for the next 18 months unfortunately point in the same direction.</P>
    <P>The successes achieved to date in turning their economies towards a path of modest but sustained growth will encourage the OECD countries to maintain their basic economic strategy with a view to increasing the growth momentum. Current growth and employment prospects indicate that the major downturn is over although no major upswing is forecast. We must remain concerned about the debt problems of developing countries and the imbalances in current <Col N="1764" /> accounts between countries.  However, the strengthened commitment among major industrialised countries to address these issues increases my confidence that the present economic recovery among OECD countries will be sustained.  It is abundantly clear that the main task which must be effectively tackled by these countries is to bring down the unemployment rate without an acceleration of inflation and without creating new and unsustainable budget deficits.  This task is even more urgent in the Community member states where employment growth remains below the OECD average.</P>
    <P>Within the European Community Ireland has been in the forefront in focusing attention on the need to mobilise efforts to fight unemployment.  This has been a consistent and priority theme of the Taoiseach at successive European Councils. Ireland, along with its partners, has made progress through a co-operative but difficult economic strategy in cutting budgetary imbalances, reducing inflation, securing wage moderation and achieving improved balances of payments.  It would be a tragedy and a failure if these hard-won successes are not built upon to achieve success in turning the tide of unemployment in the Community through a rapid expansion of output and employment.  The Commission, in its annual economic report for 1985-86, has argued that improvement is achievable. intensification of structural adjustment, including the completion of the internal market, greater flexibility in market structures and wage moderation can contribute to this.  It will be necessary also to increase growth in demand by exploiting the room for manoeuvre available and supporting infrastructural projects which yield a good rate of return.  These measures would both promote profitability and lead to improved investment.  Ireland has lent its support to the Commission strategy which holds out a firm prospect of growth and employment.</P>
    <P>We will continue to seek the adoption of this strategy by our partners in Europe, since it is imperative that we, as a Community, can offer a future to the 13 million of our citizens who are unemployed. <Col N="1765" /> The urgency of this task becomes clearer when we realise that, unlike past experience, there is little prospect in the immediate future of such major economies as the US acting as a strong motor to force an upsurge in the world economy, since the pace of recovery is as yet merely steady.  Europe must show its resolve to force the pace of its own economic recovery. Ireland, which has borne a significantly higher rate of unemployment than many of its community partners, has shown that it is prepared to play its part in a co-operative strategy to counter the problems I have outlined.  We must boost growth, output and employment within the Community as a whole.  Success in this undertaking will benefit growth and employment not only in Ireland and within Europe but will also mark an effective contribution to increasing the pace of recovery in the world economy which can only be of benefit to us all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I found the Minister's speech most interesting if not fascinating for the simple reason that the points he mentions, which he says are wonderful innovations in the budget, run counter to established economic thinking.  I will try to show that what he says is at variance with what is said by a well known economic writer for <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> and I will quote what he said last Sunday without imposing on the time of the House too much.  He Said:</P>
      <P>The slick selling of the 1986 budget cannot disguise the fact that the personal tax burden will increase significantly during the year if the government's taxation plans are realised. Taxes on both personal income and personal spending will rise rather than fall as a result of the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is at variance with what the Minister says.  The economist went on to say that taxes are expected to yield £2,477 million this year which represents an increase of 9.6 per cent over last year, and that if we are talking about an inflation rate of 4 per cent, the increase in the personal tax burden will run at more than twice the inflation rate.  Here we have a different <Col N="1766" /> picture of the effects of this budget presented by a very reputable economist.  As he says, the slick selling of the budget cannot disguise this fact.</P>
    <P>If ever the country needed a budget of imagination and optimism it certainly did not get such a budget from this Government. Instead, the Minister for Finance threw out the usual hotch-potch of excise increases, VAT changes and juggling with taxes.  If one thing positive emerged from it was the admission that the Government's programme <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> has been finally laid to rest.  However, this new reality that the Government claim to be building on is not the reality of the unemployed or the taxpayer.  Whether the Minister likes it or not, I tell him that the greatest economic crisis in the history of this State is upon us now, and this budget is in no way responsive to this crisis.  It is no exaggeration to say that we have the greatest economic crisis in the history of this State.  As evidence of it we have the Taoiseach flying to Paris with no word to the Leader of the Opposition to see what can be done to avert this serious economic crisis.  It was a panic measure on his part to fly to Paris.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to ask what has been done in this budget to create employment and to stem the flow of emigration?  What has been done to lift the national morale which has never been so low?  That is most important.</P>
    <P>Because of our relatively underdeveloped economy, Ireland, <i>vis-á-vis</i> our neighbours in the EC, has tended to have a higher than average growth in GDP in European terms.  We have always managed to grow that little bit faster than the economies of our more industrialised neighbours.  Even so, the Minister for Finance was willing to tell the House in last week's Budget Statement that GDP had risen above the European average in 1984 &mdash; that was to be expected &mdash; but in 1985 there was a drop; there was no increase in GDP over that of our neighbours. Therefore, even in depressed European terms the Irish economy is fairing very badly.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech last year the <Col N="1767" /> Minister, Deputy Dukes, forecast that unemployment would level out in 1985 due to the adjustments in taxation in the budget which he said would lessen inhibitions on the expansion of employment.  I am afraid it did not work.  We have an increase of 14,500 in our unemployment figures &mdash; that was the levelling out. These figures were not only nominal but misleading.  People whose entitlement to unemployment benefit has terminated, cannot opt for unemployment assistance which is means tested because two of the family are working or the spouse is working and they find themselves facing a potential drop in income.  They have opted in very many cases for disability benefit, which obscures and disguises the real unemployment figures.  Figures obtained by me last week reveal that almost 6,000 more people drew disability benefit in December 1985 than in December 1984.  We could legitimately add 6,000 to the unemployment figures with a very serious result, because the admitted unemployment figure represents 18 per cent of our workforce.</P>
    <P>Even by the terms of the Government's own budget forecast last January, the performance of the economy in 1985 has been poor in the extreme.  The Taoiseach last year in his budget speech stated:</P>
    <P>We can look forward in the year ahead to some increase in the level of employment.</P>
    <P>What happened?  We have seen a decline in industrial employment in the last year. None of this Government's four budgets succeeded in stimulating economic regeneration and extra employment.</P>
    <P>If any Member stands up to criticise the budget it must not be done in a negative, destructive way.  Merely opposing for the sake of opposition is deplorable.  I shall attempt to offer some alternative suggestions or proposals that the Government could have readily introduced to stimulate the economy and create employment. They failed to grasp this nettle. They chose to ignore problems which were screaming out for attention.  They chose to do so because their policy has <Col N="1768" /> been dictated by the OECD.  That is admitted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  We see what has happened with this strategy.  We see monetarism at its best, with 3,250,000 unemployed in Britain through that same policy.  Monetarism may suit the large industrial nations, but it does not suit small economies such as ours.  It has brought us to the abyss and unless we supply original, radical, innovative proposals, we will never solve our economic problems.</P>
    <P>If only to initiate fresh debate and help the Government to break out of their smug obsession with rapid debt repayment and fiscal rectitude, which is their hallmark, new, radical ideas are needed in the areas of employment, taxation and the infamous national debt.  These fundamental problems are not as insurmountable as the Government's negative thinking would have us believe.  This is especially the case where one considers foreign debt.  When the money for investment is vitally needed, why do the Government not attempt to restructure a repayment arrangement?  We have a high reputation; we are considered to be a low risk debtor nation internationally and considered likely to be able to meet our debts in the long term.  As such, we should be able to repay these debts in a way that is not inimical to national development.  We should be prepared to restructure them over a more realistic period rather than at present break-neck speed.  As it stands, this foreign debt acts like a gun pointed at the country's head. Rather than policy-making being dictated to us by this predicament, surely it would be more rational and logical to remove the gun in order to think more clearly and calmly and formulate independent economic policies specific to our own needs?</P>
    <P>The Government must decide whether their commitment is to the people of Ireland or to the foreign bankers.  I maintain that their first commitment, their first duty is to the people of Ireland.  The Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach should have no hesitation in meeting the foreign bankers and telling them that we are not reneging on our debts; that we <Col N="1769" /> will honour and are honouring them but we want a longer time; we want a moratorium of five to seven years before we start repayment.  This can be done.  The Minister is smirking at this but that needs courage, initiative, originality.  Other countries have done this, why should we not?</P>
    <P>In the document <i>Building on Reality</i> this administration admitted:</P>
    <P>The long process of correcting the imbalance in the public finances has necessarily dominated economic policy.</P>
    <P>There is an admission, if ever there was a pathetic admission by the Government, of defeat and hopelessness.  With the worldwide fall in oil prices and interest rates and the drop in the value of the dollar, the cost of servicing the foreign debt is now less severe than previously. The Department could use this favourable period for the restructuring of this debt which progressively draws more money from us each year which we cannot afford.  If foreign bankers want to see their loans repaid they must have some interest in economic growth here and this cannot occur without productive investment.  The transfer of some moneys away from debt repayment into productive investment would create a more vibrant economy.</P>
    <P>It is not just foreign borrowing that has created our debt problem.  Our failure to invest in productive schemes has also contributed.  Only economic generation will make it possible to phase out the budget deficit.  To try to do this in a time of recession is putting the cart before the horse.  Economic growth must occur first. This requires a shifting of economic policy away from rapid debt repayment and into productive investment which would mobilise our people and their resources.  Over £750 million went out last year in interest on debt repayments. That money could be a lifeline for this State.  It need not necessarily have been rapid like that.  Surely it is within our negotiating power to reduce this outflow of money and release the extra funds for the most pressing task of creating jobs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1770" /> Many of our unemployment problems have been caused by large scale rationalisation in industry and elsewhere.  The biggest curse that could befall our country is this rationalisation.  It is like an epidemic which is overtaking us everywhere. This is monetarism, Thatcherism, Reaganism.  It will not succeed here.  We are inclined to take whatever comes from Britain and impose it on ourselves.  This rationalisation, which is dispensing with jobs, has gathered momentum.  The idea that it is somehow the panacea for the countries economic problems in dangerous. It has cost the State vast sums in extra social welfare payments.  It means taking the responsibility of payment of workers off certain companies and transferring it on to the State.  Some scheme could be implemented having a greater subsidy for employment.  We should be paying people to work instead of paying them to remain out of work. That should be our aim.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to acknowledge that the Government have tried to introduce schemes, but I do not think they have gone far enough in encouraging employers to take on extra staff.  Relief from PRSI and these other schemes have been good but we must go a little further.  I have checked and found that there are many restrictions connected with these schemes.  The Minister must look into this matter more seriously.</P>
    <P>Could we not appeal to companies to take on an extra 10 per cent of staff, give them the labour money and extra so that the person employed will get full minimum wage and the employer pay the difference between the labour money and full minimum wage?  This could be done as an emergency measure.</P>
    <P>A special select committee of the House of Commons in London dealing with employment have decided to subsidise jobs and employment generally.  We do not need to be importing all these ideas but there are many jobs which could be got here provided employers are given the facilities to do it.  Under such a scheme employers employing ten people would be able to give two extra jobs, and <Col N="1771" /> so on.  More of our people on unemployment would resume the dignity of working. If 50,000 people extra were employed in that way the Government would accrue £100 million a year in revenue. Apart from that, such a measure would generate a psychological boost.  It would mean more money in circulation and increased consumer demand.  It would eliminate the presence of unemployed people who are now being paid benefit or assistance and working at the same time.  There could be a proviso that employers would not get rid of any of their staff during a period of one year or 18 months.  It would create a whole new environment in the country.  In a small open economy an 18 per cent unemployment rate is not acceptable.  We need original ideas to be applied to Ireland, specifically to meet the needs of Ireland. Instead of importing our ideas we should be exporting them.  For years I have been trying to streamline the facilities for the unemployed.  First of all we have the employment change and then people have to walk from pillar to post throughout the city to visit the National Manpower Service office and AnCO.  In 1978 I asked why we could not have AnCO and the National Manpower Service together in the labour exchanges so that people could avail of the information provided on schemes available to them.  That was eight years ago but nothing has been done.  There must be a streamlining of the social services so that people will be able to find out what is available.</P>
    <P>Let us take the Government tax reduction commitment.  Instead of providing anything original, the Government merely reduced the upper tax band to 58 per cent.  I have shown from <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> article that the tax burden will increase, that taxes on personal incomes will rise by 9.6 per cent under this budget and inflation by 4½ per cent.  Taxes will be higher and therefore there will be less money in circulation.  We cannot disguise that.  Is it any wonder the public are cynical? Yet it is not the Government's intention to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>If the Government were seriously concerned <Col N="1772" /> to reduce the burden of tax why not reduce the top rate to 50 per cent as suggested this morning by the Leader of Fianna Fáil?  They will argue that they could not afford it.  My idea is that, instead of relieving the taxpayers immediately, the Government should introduce tax credit certificates over a period of five years.  It would cost £80 million in a year, with the tax credit certificates guaranteed by the State over a period of five years.  In such a scheme the tax rate would be reduced to 50 per cent, with a <i>pro rata</i> reduction for the other bands.  It would be a form of compulsory saving. This would give a psychological boost to taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The present system is a serious disincentive to people to work.  Overtime is not being worked at a time when people need to be taught to think in terms of work.  Such schemes are necessary if economic recovery is to be encouraged.</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare is here let us look at the social side of the budget. What it has given to the poorer sections of the community is derisory and shows a callous disregard for their needs.  It illustrates that the Government, despite the presence of the Labour Party, are punishing people because they are poor. It is a terrible indictment of that party that they support a budget which punishes the needy through the imposition of extra VAT immediately while they have to wait until mid-July to get their miserable increases.  How can you, Minister, support such a measure?  I am astounded that you, one of the most sincere people in the House, would do this. For the life of me I cannot see how you can come in here in defence of this budget which is a damning indictment of everything you are supposed to stand for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying to the Minister that I cannot see how he can support this budget which discriminates against the poorer sections.  In a miserly fashion it deprives the people dependent <Col N="1773" /> on long-term unemployment benefits of cost of living increases.  I am astounded that the Labour Party would support such a measure.  Not only has the budget not been redistributive, but it has been positively regressive.  It must be seen as the most miserly budget since the twenties. The presence of the Labour Party in this reactionary administration is an indication of a death wish on their part.  I hope the Minister has read the political correspondent's article in last week's <i>Sunday Tribune</i> which says that if they continue to support this administration they will find themselves coming back in a taxi. The Minister's seat is in jeopardy along with those of many of his colleagues.  The only hope of redemption for the Labour Party is to stand up and be counted in this House and say they cannot in conscience continue in this charade supporting a right wing administration.</P>
      <P>The budget does not offer any stimulus to employment nor any hope to our young people.  It will put more people out of work through the reduction of £55 million in current expenditure.  It will narrow the tax base even further.  The fewer people who are employed, the greater will be the tax burden on individuals.</P>
      <P>Where is the provision in this budget for the NDC which was lauded as a victory for the Labour Party?  Not one penny has been provided.  It has been quietly forgotten.  It has been interred without a word from the Labour Party.  In fact, the National Enterprise Agency received £223,000 less than last year.  That is the substance of the Government's support for the NDC.  The NDC was the greatest farce ever perpetrated in this House.  For how long more must the Labour Party be deluded by their colleagues on the right?</P>

      <P>I said &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;. Before I was rudely interrupted I was saying that the present Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Minister B. Desmond claimed that a characteristic of a good budget is that it allocates scarce resources to those in greatest need.  That is a significant statement.  It is not a characteristic of this budget; it is conspicuous by its absence.  Scarce resources have not been allocated to those in greatest need. Will the Minister consider honouring his stated beliefs when he can give practical application to them?  The resources have not been allocated to the sick and those in greatest need in mental hospitals as his savage and cynically timed announcement of last week illustrates.  It is all very well for a Minister to close hospitals when modern new facilities become available, but many of the hospitals now due to close were to have been kept open for another three to five years because we did not have the facilities to replace them. Alternative care has not been provided. We are seeing here Government by diktat.  Announcements are being made and consultation is at a minimum.  We see this in the areas of health and education and we will see it in other areas shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The empty Beaumont hospital is a testimony to the Government's commitment to the health services and to the Minister's ineffectiveness at the Cabinet table.  We see the Minister's pig headed-ness in evidence in relation to Beaumont hospital.  Intransigence on the part of the Minister is keeping that hospital closed. <Col N="1775" /> Whether or not we are in favour of private facilities for consultants, that is not the point at issue.  The point at issue is that an agreement was reached by a Minister with consultants for the provision of a site for a private hospital, and that was not honoured.  The Minister's ideological hang up and his perverse nature are keeping Beaumont closed at a cost to the State of nearly £2 million a year.  This should not be allowed to continue.  If the Minister is serious in saying that he wants this hospital opened, why has he not reached agreement with the non medical staff unions?  I question the Minister's honesty when he says he wants this hospital opened.</P>
    <P>The closure of the hospitals, particularly the mental hospitals, is a cynical cost-cutting exercise in which the Minister takes perverse pleasure and it directly contravenes a commitment given in <i>Building on Reality</i> that the small amount of outlay on mental health will be financed through the disposal of existing institutions made redundant by new projects. I would understand that, but where are the new projects?</P>
    <P>The Minister was at pains to refer to the Fitzgerald plan of 1968 as being a means of streamlining our hospital services. The Fitzgerald plan which sought to rationalise and streamline our hospitals was never endorsed by this House. The Minister said that the Fitzgerald plan was drawn up by a group of eminent consultants.  In fact it was drawn up by a group of Dublin consultants who had no knowledge of the unique circumstances in rural areas.  It was not necessarily the answer to our problems.  The Minister quoted the 1984 report on the psychiatric services, but again this report was not endorsed by this House.</P>
    <P>There have been many proposals from various Department but they are not necessarily the infallible way of solving our problems. I accept that there must be a rationalisation and I am not saying that large regional hospitals are the best answer to our problems.  Ireland is strictly a rural country, we have unique <Col N="1776" /> rural problems and big regional centres in which paitients are not treated as human beings may not be the answer to the problems either.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister propose to do with the psychiatric patients whom we have institutionalised?  They are unable to live as ordinary members of the community. They need supportive measures because they cannot live like ordinary people unless they are helped.  The Minister said in his flippant way that he would provide support but how?  We had a rationalisation programme in St. Brendan's Hospital which produced the revolving door syndrome of patients coming out and ending up in the Iveagh Hostel or in Mountjoy Prison because they could not cope with ordinary life having been in hospital for 25 years.  We should learn from that experience and we should not throw these people into the community with no supportive measures. The Minister should pay particular attention to this because he has a very personal interest in St. Dympna's Hospital, Carlow.  Where are the alternative community facilities available to the patients from St. Dympna's?  Where will they go? I should be glad if the Minister interrupted now and told me but he will not because I know there are no facilities available.  This is a serious matter and no Minister has the right to take perverse pleasure in closing hospitals because he is a master of commerce.  He is not entitled to adopt this clinical approach without considering the personal circumstances of the patients involved.  Unless community care is very supportive these patients will find life very disturbing.</P>
    <P>I agree that there is need for a fresh approach to mental health but it must be undertaken after due consultation and regard for the patients' well being.  It is a great shame that the Minister for Health does not realise this.  His histrionics last night on television on &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; will not convince anyone that his dictatorial stand is justified.  These people need care when they go outside and it was sad to see the Minister dismissing that as being of no consequence.</P>
    <P>Some may say that the State spends <Col N="1777" /> too much on health services.  I accept that we spend a lot in this area but this is because our demographical situation is unique.  High spending need not necessarily be interpreted as wastage.  The health service is still underdeveloped in many areas and there should not have been any cuts especially when they were introduced by the Minister with the zest and zeal of a convert.</P>
    <P>There is an army of unemployed young people and it is anomalous to see the country, particularly Dublin city, in a state of decay and disrepair while there are so many willing and able young hands idle who would relish an opportunity to undertake repairs and the maintenance of buildings.  It must be possible to mobilise our young workforce by means of a public works programme.  Many young people have become cynical, with justification, about the training schemes which are offered to them.  They merely keep them off the streets for six months.  I accept that they acquire skills but they will quickly be forgotten if they are not put into practice.  A public works programme would be a long term undertaking which would ease the plight of many young people who are idle through no fault of their own and would be money well spent.</P>
    <P>Investment in jobs and a necessary public works programme would save money in the long term.  Why should we not consider raising the school leaving age?  The problem of unemployment is so serious that it requires new thinking.  The school leaving age of 15 years is nothing short of Victorian compared with our European partners.  In Germany, for example, many students do not leave school until they are 19 years of age.  The education system needs to be reformed in order to allow people in the 15-17 year age group to continue in school without necessarily sitting for the leaving certificate. We could have an advanced vocational certificate which might suit the needs of many young people.</P>
    <P>Why not lower the retirement age?  It could be an optional age of 60 which could be phased in gradually.  People could work a two day or a three day week <Col N="1778" /> which would enable young people to be brought into the workforce.  The extra cost involved in regard to pension payments would be offset by a parallel reduction in unemployment payments.  I accept that there are no simple solutions to unemployment but there are relatively simple ways of easing it if the political will is there and if the Government are prepared to adopt new and bold policies. No doubt, some people will object to the policies I have outlined but the inconvenience caused to some people would pale into insignificance compared to the improvement on the jobs front.  The fact that other European countries have a higher school leaving age, lower retirement age and significantly lower unemployment rates speaks for itself. Therefore, these policies must be seriously considered for the future.</P>
    <P>The Government had the best of intentions when they came to power and were filled with enthusiasm.  However, they have now been overtaken by pessimism which, unfortunately, has worked its way through the whole community.  The economic policies which they introduced over the years are an indication of that pessimism and they have given the impression that emigration is the answer to continued unemployment.  They must make it clear that there is a future in this country and that everyone has a part to play.  I believe that, in this respect more than any other, this Government have failed.</P>
    <P>We hear Government speakers say that emigration is not such a bad thing. Over the years emigration has been considered a very serious problem.  History tells us that emigration has spoiled family life.  When we think of emigration we think of ultimate depression and despair. That is what emigration spells for Ireland and whether we like it or not that is inherent in our system.  It is infuriating to hear Government speakers encouraging young people to emigrate in order to ameliorate the political embarassment of massive unemployment.  It is a damning indictment that we have such a massive increase in emigration and is an admission by the Government that they cannot <Col N="1779" /> cope with unemployment.  Rather than considering emigration, the Government should come up with new ideas which would help young people to decide to stay at home.  We all accept that old ideas have changed.  We must have a radical optimistic rethink and offer the unemployed a future that will make them feel wanted.</P>
    <P>Our economy needs rebuilding and our young people must have a part to play in this area.  Our economy is crumbling and we need to mobilise our young people by guaranteeing them jobs.  I learned from the Minister, Deputy Barry, today that the economic policies we are adopting are those enunicated by the OECD.  I believe we need policies which are indigenous to this country but we are not following such policies.  Our present policies are chipping away at our industrial infrastructures.  We have no footwear industry to speak of and we do not have a national shipping company. The B &amp; I are in existence mainly to provide a means of escape for those who are emigrating.  If our young people continue to emigrate we will not have the population to pay for the services we must provide for our increasing numbers of elderly citizens.  This is the logical conclusion of the monetarist policies being followed by this Government.</P>
    <P>Even in handling the industrial relations problems the Government have been totally lacking in common sense. They have ignored the well established convention of conciliation and arbitration and the present position with the teachers is an example of that.  In <i>Building on Reality</i> industrial relations merit only three pages, yet the most dynamic European economies have achieved growth based on meaningful social partnership arrangements.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, advocated more worker participation in private industry, sharing more in the profits and management of private companies &mdash; and I am very much in favour of that &mdash; but what he has not espoused is worker shareholding in State industries.  We have the farce of worker directors intimidated and overwhelmed <Col N="1780" /> by the other directors with no say in the operation of the company.  Why can semi-State bodies, such as Bord Telecom, Aer Lingus and so on, not give workers shares in the companies, at a nominal cost in proportion to their years of service, making them shareholders and giving them a voice in the running of the companies? Why can we not bring industrial peace to these bodies by such means? This has not been tried.  This would give them a real say in the working of the companies.  I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would be the first to advocate this.  I mentioned this to him before and I was surprised that he did not succeed in persuading his colleagues to adopt it as Labour Party policy, which it should be. This would be a genuine incentive to workers and would give them more muscle than the farcical worker directors.  These are the kind of new, radical proposals that need to be discussed if we are to get the economy moving again.</P>
    <P>It looks as if this Government will trundle along in their usual, merry deflationary way, increasing unemployment and making no impact on the budget deficit. We can continue along those lines or we can look afresh at these problems and can consider the needs of the Irish people in preference to the needs of the foreign bankers.  We have a number of choices with regard to economic policies, but the policy this Government have foisted on us by pretending this was the only course of action open to us, has clearly failed over the last three years.  A change in policy is vital and is very urgently needed. This Government have to decide whether this is going to happen sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>The politics of retrenchment, rationalisation and reduction in public spending have failed the Irish people.  What the country needs is expansion.  Anything which blocks this should be removed and should not be allowed to dictate national economic policy, as is happening at present.  The destiny of this country is in our own hands and if we make the right choices now and follow new, imaginative policies we can look forward to prosperity and the rebuilding of national muscle in <Col N="1781" /> the nineties.  I believe we can do this, but I do not believe the present Government have the political will to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I like to come into this House to listen to a speech because it helps me to make a more constructive contribution.  I consider I have been most unfortunate having to sit here for the past hour listening to what was a not very inspiring contribution.  I could perhaps have tolerated its content with greater patience if it had not been laced with a measure of vindictiveness and bitterness, which rarely makes an appearance in this House, in a speech for one hour.  Sometimes one gets impatient outbursts and these are understandable, but the personal vindictive and bitter attacks made, particularly on the Minister for Health and the Minister of State, Deputy Pattison, the last speaker's former colleagues, makes me regret that I was the Deputy who had to sit here and listen to that contribution.</P>
      <P>We were told we were being offered a new, courageous and radical approach to a solution of this problem, but the most radical thing proposed by the last speaker was that we restructure our debt. &ldquo;Restructuring&rdquo; has become a great word.  I am sure there are people in the House who will be impressed by a phrase like &ldquo;restructuring our national debt in order to resolve our problems&rdquo;.  Already we have pushed the burden of paying for our current standard of living on to our children.  By restructuring the only thing I imagine the Deputy meant was that we push this burden on to our grandchildren.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see the countries who have lent us money willing to forego the rates of interest.  We know the countries that are involved.  We know the banks and the individuals from whom we have borrowed in the developed world.  To talk about restructuring our debts means pushing them further back.  Surely this country, listed among the 20 richest countries in the world, will not say to our creditors that we want charity in the form of reducing the relatively modest interest rates they are charging us.  It is all right for Brazil, Mexico and some African <Col N="1782" /> states to talk about renegotiating in a situation where they do not intend to pay all their debts and all the interest due. They might expect to be let off the hook, but we are a country who trade some 60 per cent of our GDP.  We trade with America, Germany, and Britain on equal terms and we hope to attract capital from those economies in order to generate jobs.  Yet, the best solution that can be proposed by Deputy O'Connell is that we should restructure our debts as a means of resolving our economic problems.  We have done a certain amount of restructuring with regard to loans but nobody should get the impression that is anything but putting off the day when eventually the entire loans and the interest due will have to be paid.</P>
    <P>There has been an attack on rationalisation measures.  Rationalisation is the application of sensible policies with regard to the production of goods and services.  It is not sensible for anyone to attack the idea of rationalisation.  I accept that sometimes this may lead to a loss of jobs in one area.  If two people are doing a job that can be done by one person and if they are to be paid a full wage, obviously the service given or the goods produced must cost more money or otherwise the State must give a subsidy and at the end of the day we do not create extra wealth.  The idea that we can cease to talk about rationalisation with regard to making our industries and our public sector more competitive is a clear indication that Deputy O'Connell was not thinking seriously about the solutions he was proposing.  He spoke about young people spending longer at school.  There is nothing new about that but, of course, it costs money to build the extra schools, to pay the teachers and perhaps extra transport costs.  The Deputy was against increasing taxation.  I consider I was most unfortunate to have to sit here and listen to such a hodgepodge of contradictions, irrelevancies and bitterness.</P>
    <P>The debate in this House at budget time is not very inspiring.  On the Government side there are claims of resolving all problems.  Credit is grabbed for everything that happens irrespective of <Col N="1783" /> whether the Government policies have made any contribution.  On the other side there are constant attacks and failure to accept the genuine efforts made by the Government.  There is a refusal to understand why some policies fail to achieve their objective even if put forward with the best will.  Sometimes a grudging concession is made in the form of obscure compliments to Ministers for minor matters but generally it is a case of attack and counter-attack with not much honesty on either side of the House.</P>
    <P>In recent years a regrettable feature is the personalising of the attack on the Minister for Finance of the day.  It is a game played in the media and the public appear to enjoy it, particularly the taxpayers and those who have been stung. It has a kind of sadistic humour and I do not like it.  The Minister is only part of the Cabinet who make their decision collectively. I am sure that if Deputy Dukes were the president of a republic with absolute power to draft his own budget and with the assurance that he could carry it, the budget he would put forward would be entirely different from the one he presented to this House.  I am sure if he were not answerable to his colleagues in Cabinet, to backbenchers, to the Opposition and the media, he would introduce a budget very different from what he has presented.  However, while Ministers have considerable powers there are limitations.  I do not think the Minister himself thinks everything he has proposed is ideal.</P>
    <P>To some extent this has probably happened because Ministers personalised their Departments at a time when we had a different economic climate.  I am talking of the day of the Santa Claus Governments when money started to come from the European Community, when there was economic growth here, when our trading partners had a very rapid economic growth rate and full employment and when our unemployed quickly flowed to their markets.  At that time the Minister for Finance did not have to pay unemployment assistance to all the people for whom the State failed <Col N="1784" /> to create the conditions in which they could get jobs.  In that era the question at budget time was what would the Minister give away.  Some Ministers liked that but now, instead of playing Santa Claus, they have to play the part of the policeman. This is the age of the policeman government. Now the Minister for Finance does not have so much to give away.  He cannot go on borrowing and getting increased amounts from the EC.  Thus, the Minister concerned becomes the object of caustic criticism and personal attack that is not justified.</P>
    <P>One of the saddest things is the extent to which there is so little understanding of economic and fiscal policy.  I honestly believe that there is little understanding on the part of people on both sides of this House of the effects of what we are doing here or of the options open to us.  Some of the proposals put forward are totally contradictory.  Opposition speakers and backbenchers sometimes take every side of the road at the one time, trying to have it every way.  There is immense confusion throughout the country about what is involved in spite of our improved standard of education.  Despite the fact that newspapers are available for the vast majority of people and that more families listen to or watch current affairs programmes on radio and television, they appear to be totally confused about the cause and the origin of our problems.  They do not seem to have any consistent view on what they would like a government to do. Even though much work goes into the current affairs programmes on RTE, many of them just subtract from the sum of the knowledge that exists about the whole procedure and at the end of the day people are more confused.</P>
    <P>Another feature which becomes very obvious at this time is the absence here of any consistent economic philosophy in any of the three major political parties. In all of these parties we get policies and philosophies of the extreme right and the extreme left.  Not only is there a failure to understand the influences and factors that operate, but there is no clear political ideology.  I do not favour extreme ideological views on economic matters but I <Col N="1785" /> like people to be consistent and clear as to where they stand.  Some people think the State should solve all the problems while others think it better to leave matters to the private sector.  In this House it is very difficult to identify people's political positions.  In Europe or in the US one can look at where people are sitting and have a fair idea about their general approach to solutions to economic problems. In any of the three main political parties here I can identify people whose economic views are considerably to the left of a group like, for instance, the Italian communists in the European Parliament. Though it is not likely to happen, I should like to see a shake out whereby people could choose between policies at election time and identify the kind of policies they favoured.</P>
    <P>Long ago I used to be grateful that we did not have extremes of political thought in Ireland, that we did not have periods alternating between privatisation and State control whereby at one time the State would be controlling everything and this would be followed by another period when another party would come to office and begin to deregulate everything.  I thought then that that kind of situation would not be good in the long term for the economy but today I should very much like people in the House to be identified as having consistent political views so that when the voter went to the polls he knew the kind of social and economic policies he could expect during the period of office of the Government he was helping to elect.  We have had a very much mixed up approach to social policies.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk in the past two days in this House and elsewhere about the state of the economy.  Some people say that we should give leadership and encouragement, that we should tell people everything will be well in the future so as to encourage them to work better.  This is the type of philosophy that Deputy MacSharry refers to as the policy of boom rather than the policy of doom. There are two sides to this argument. When I meet young people today and the topic of the economy or of jobs is raised, <Col N="1786" /> I notice that there is much disillusionment among them with our economic policies. These young people say we have failed to create the kind of country that would be a lot more attractive for them to live in.  On the other hand, some of us like to be realistic and to explain precisely what the difficulties are and what are the prospects. Only by knowing exactly what the position is can we succeed in proposing the right policies and having them accepted.  We can view the whole scenario in a number of different ways but when young people complain about the failure of the system to provide jobs for them or about the high cost of living or about the failure of the State to provide a new school somewhere, I like to remind them of the country in which I was brought up when the vast majority of children went to school barefoot and left school after primary level.  I remind today's young people that those who went before them did not have the option of State jobs, that their only option was the emigrant ship.  We have no wish to return to that situation but for those who seem to think that we have been going backwards all the time it is no harm to be reminded that a certain amount of progress has been made.</P>
    <P>On the employment side we should point out that despite the fact that in the rest of the Community 1.5 million jobs have been lost in the past 13 years, there are 50,000 more people working in Ireland than was the case 13 years ago.  In other words, we have created more than 50,000 jobs in that time because in that period 75,000 people left the agricultural industry.  Therefore, our record in terms of creating jobs is not all that abysmal.  If we did not have the kind of demographic structure that we have or if we did not have the kind of birth rate we have, we might have a tolerable unemployment level.  I can identify many regions of the Community which are bigger than Ireland and in which the unemployment rate is as high as if not higher than ours.  This is the case in parts of Holland, of northern Germany, of Britain and France.  We do not have to think of Spain, Portugal or <Col N="1787" /> Greece in this context because their position is considerably worse than ours in many respects.</P>
    <P>We might ask what the unemployment levels in those other parts of Europe would be if they had birth rates as high as ours.  If, for example, the Federal Republic of Germany had our level of birth rate and had pursued the same economic policies as they have pursued, creating the same number of jobs as they have created, they would have an unemployment rate as high as ours but in such circumstances that country would have readjusted its economic policies to cater for an increased population.  We have failed in that respect.  We have failed to readjust our economic policies so as to take account of the fact that families here are bigger than the family size in other countries.</P>
    <P>We might remind young people, too, that 13 years ago the proportion of our people in second level education was 50 per cent less than today's figure &mdash; 231,000 compared with 317,000 today. That is considerable progress.  Our young people should be reminded that they are being given an opportunity that was not available to those who went before them. Admittedly, there are not jobs in the public service for all those leaving school but our young people are better equipped now to look for jobs.  They are better equipped to provide services or to produce goods that some one somewhere is willing to pay for.  We cannot continue to raise money from the taxpayer to provide public service jobs simply to accommodate people on the basis that they have spent five years in secondary school.</P>
    <P>The number in third level education has increased from 29,000 13 years ago to 48,000 today.  Again, this is progress. It ensures that we are turning out as many engineers, for instance, <i>per capita</i> as is the case in the US; that we are turning out many qualified people.  Of course these people worked so far as their studies were concerned but their conditions were comfortable by comparison with the sort of places in which my generation attended school.  A considerable amount of taxpayers' <Col N="1788" /> money is spent on a person's third level education but when that person leaves college with his qualification he is in a good position to render a service to his fellowman in his own country if that is his choice, or elsewhere in the world. A graduate is better equipped to start his own business.  He has a better knowledge of the world he is facing into.</P>
    <P>Another measure of our progress might be to consider that 13 years ago the ration of telephones per 1,000 of the population was 49.  The latest figure I have in that regard is 106 per 1,000 of the population and I am sure that proportion has increased in the meantime.  This is another indication of the considerable economic progress we have made.  The figure for registrations of private cars went down over a few years but, over the period as a whole, it rose from 155 per 1,000 to 205 per 1,000, another indication that living standards have improved, that comforts and amenities are available to people to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>We have increased spending on health, education and social welfare from £336 million in 1973 to £3,728 million today. In spite of the fact that money has depreciated by about 60 per cent during that period, nevertheless in absolute terms we have increased our spending by 300 per cent in volume in that period.  That is a considerable tribute to a generation of workers and politicians.</P>
    <P>The quality of life in Ireland as measured by the standard of infant mortality, literacy and life expectancy is one of the highest in the world.  While there is a lot of weeping and moaning and a lot of depression about our failure to achieve more, the young generation growing up in Ireland and everybody living here should realise that they are fortunate in the time and place in which they are living.  We live in a free society where the frontiers of hunger, hardship and disease have been pushed back, where life expectancy is long and where people live in considerable peace and security.  We have much to be thankful for.</P>
    <P>Of course it is in the nature of human beings to want to make progress.  While we can explain to young people that they <Col N="1789" /> are fortunate in many respects, it is only fair to make the comparison between what we have achieved and what other successful economies have achieved in the social and economic area, to measure our performance against theirs and to ask ourselves if we could have done better, given ourselves more reason to hold up our heads in the developed world, more muscle as a member of the European Community, in the international political arena, in helping the deprived and the hungry.  Certainly we could have done all these things to a greater extent if we had been more careful.  Economic progress does give people more muscle.</P>
    <P>After the problem of Northern Ireland, we recognise that the vast number of people who are unemployed constitute our biggest national problem.  Now that the problem of Northern Ireland has at least been brought to the stage when we have clear understandings between the sovereign Governments about the road they should go, our next most serious problem is unemployment.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about the progress we have made during the past 13 years.  We achieved a fairly modest economic growth, but all the benefits of that economic growth have been swallowed up by the public sector, taken by the Government in increased taxation and spent in the social areas I have mentioned or in subsidising jobs in semi-State enterprises and other such things.  We have arrived at the situation where the Government are spending the highest percentage of GDP of any country in the developed world.</P>
    <P>When we talk about economies which are closest to ours such as Holland, West Germany and Sweden, we should not compare our economy as it is today with theirs as it is today.  When they were at our stage of development they were taking something like 25 per cent or 27 per cent of GDP into the public sector and spending it.  The position in which we find ourselves today is unprecendented anywhere in the world.  We cannot say with certainty that it is possible to get out of it, but we know that no other country <Col N="1790" /> has ever been there before.  While we may look at other economies and say they are spending as much of GDP on social services etc. as we are, when they were at our stage of development they did not have social legislation developed to the same extent as we have.</P>
    <P>Thirteen years ago we had a foreign debt of about £200 million.  Today it is £8 billion.  These are the truths which should be known to us on all sides of this House and to the young people who will have responsibility for keeping this economy going when the rest of us get tired.  We have a total public sector debt of £20 billion.  This has stunted agriculture because this continuous borrowing by the Government has taken out of our economy the money that would otherwise be available for the development of the agricultural industry.  We have made it impossible by our fiscal and economic policies for the private sector to borrow money.  We know that the average indigenous company last year was getting an average return of 5 per cent on capital and for expansion or development they were expected to borrow money at 14 per cent or 15 per cent, if they were lucky.</P>
    <P>Recently I have come across industrialists and people in the service sector who started their own businesses and find themselves in a different cash flow situation but can produce facts and figures to show that they have viable business, yet they are being charged penal interest at the rate of 22 per cent.  This is because this State gobbles up every shilling available in this economy and leaves nothing for the private sector.  Let the private sector take the leavings &mdash; that has been the attitude in recent years.  We have been expanding Government spending, Santa Claus Governments making gods out of themselves at the expense of progress and of the future.  We have starved the private sector and stunted agriculture. We have brought our social sector forward more rapidly than perhaps we could afford.</P>
    <P>I see a tendency to exaggerate this and make it worse at European level.  I am a firm believer in economic convergence <Col N="1791" /> between European countries.  I firmly believe that Ireland should play its full part as a member of the European Community, doing its best to harmonise social and economic legislation so that the Community may develop without borders of barriers, an area in which our young people will be able to trade and work and move freely.  This is one of the more prosperous areas of the world.  It is not geographically vast and is quite small by comparison with the USA, but it is a very favoured area.</P>
    <P>I should like to see economic convergence and harmonisation of laws but I am concerned about the very progressive social legislation which is being strongly promoted by some of our partners in the European Community and being accepted, apparently without full knowledge of what they are doing by Ministers from different Governments who acquiesce and go along with social legislation which will certainly have the effect of slowing down economic growth.  Until we have greater economic convergence we cannot have harmonisation of social legislation. We have moved too fast in pursuance of social legislation.  When we talk about the whole problem of unemployment and its solution this question arises, certainly in my mind, and I must ask myself: to what extent has the progress we have made in this area been responsible for much of the unemployment that has been created?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell proposed that we give grants to industrialists, allowing them to employ somebody and then give them the social welfare benefits as well. I should have thought that proposal amounted to much the same thing as the scheme already in existence under which the State undertakes to pay the shortfall in income.  I refer to the scheme introduced approximately a year ago, the supplementary income allowance, which amounts to much the same thing.  Deputy O'Connell forgot that we have introduced legislation which established minimum wage levels, that employers are obliged to pay these levels of wages whether or not they can afford them.  The <Col N="1792" /> attitude prevailing in many Departments is: if they cannot afford to pay the level of wages demanded by the law, then let them close their factories, put those people on the dole, allowing the Government to pick up the cost, allowing our economy to suffer the production loss as well.</P>
    <P>When we move away from a market situation, when the State begins to interfere to a certain extent, then it is very difficult to know where the State ought to stop.  If the State is to decide how much money people should receive, the conditions under which people should be employed, under what conditions employees should be dismissed, then the State should go all the way and decide where everybody should work and what wages they should receive.  If people say they are out of work, then the State should be able to say to them: &ldquo;All right, you report in a given place tomorrow morning and take up that job.&rdquo;  Once the State begins to interfere to an excessive extent, as it has &mdash; and it should be remembered that we now have the social legislation introduced over the past few years, for example, the Unfair Dismissals Act, the redundancy obligations of employers, minimum wages &mdash; this creates an environment in which employers are slow to take on labour.</P>
    <P>I know that in the past grave injustices were committed against employees by employers, that they were exploited and abused.  We must seek to achieve some sort of balance.  But the balance obtaining means that employees can walk out of work, mount a picket on a gate, bringing things to a standstill.  On the other hand, an employee may not be dismissed by an employer.  It has proved extremely difficult to sustain a case in any type of court advancing the argument that an employee has not carried out his or her job efficiently and well.  Unless they are caught robbing the till or such like it is very difficult to get rid of them.  Employers are aware that when they engage personnel today they are as good as married to them.  That is why they are fairly careful about increasing their workforce.  This constitutes part of the problem.  I do not <Col N="1793" /> contend that it amounts to all of the problem.  Certainly minimum wage levels form part of the problem.  It is interesting to note that in the countries which made most economic and technological progress, Japan, Austria, the United States, and Switzerland, since the first oil shock came, real wages have dropped.</P>
    <P>There is such a thing as the labour market.  If labour became cheap then production costs would be reduced, economies would become more competitive and there would be additional recruitment of personnel.  That is the way the labour market operates.  If the State could think of industries or jobs to create and did so without penalising the taxpayer in the process by continuing subsequently to subsidise those jobs I would welcome that.  I am not so far to the right in my economic thinking that I would be entirely against that idea.  If the State could think of goods and services to be made and sold competitively without the need to continue subsidising employees, I would be quite happy to see the State do so.  But I do not think there are easy solutions like that lying around so that some civil servant could say: &ldquo;Build a factory here; produce this commodity; sell it on the world market,&rdquo; and everybody would have jobs and all would be well.  The private sector is not that slow or stupid.  If such opportunities existed they would have been identified.</P>
    <P>The truth is we have become uncompetitive in our economy.  Deputy O'Connell seems to think that OECD reports prepared on behalf of the countries of the developed world that have successfully managed their economies &mdash; to the extent that they can lend to us and subsidise us &mdash; are somewhat immoral, that there is some thing immoral about accepting their advice.  They have told the British that the failure of their economy to respond to the surplus in the labour market by reduced wages and so on has created their unemployment problem.  It should be remembered that our wages levels increased more rapidly than those in Britain, as did our social services.  If that is what has occasioned the problem in Britain, certainly it has contributed in <Col N="1794" /> a big way toward the creation of that problem here.</P>
    <P>Over the past 13 years we have seen in the distance prosperity in other European countries, in the United States, and smelled it on the way here.  However, we grabbed it too fast.  We improved our social legislation and increased our standards of living.  We ate dinner at breakfast time.  We ate the green fruit and now we have a belly ache as a result.  We cut the green corn.  We borrowed £20,000 million to pay for those improved standards of living.  In addition we received, in today's terms, approximately the equivalent of £1,000 million annually from the EC.  We used that money to fuel inflation, rendering our agricultural and industrial production less competitive.  That is what we did over the last 13 years, in a period in which we were afforded an opportunity to catch up.</P>
    <P>Some people talk about the varying rates of growth as between the different European countries.  We should remember that a 3 per cent rate of growth in the Federal Republic of Germany is not the same as a 3 per cent rate of growth here because we start from an entirely different base.  If there is a 3 per cent economic growth rate prevailing in the Federal Republic of Germany and the same here, that means that the gap is widening even more between the GDP <i>per capita</i> here and that prevailing in those other countries.  That would mean that at present we would need to have double the economic growth rate prevailing in, say, the Federal Republic of Germany, Switzerland or even France or Britain.</P>
    <P>While we have the same level of social services as obtain in Britain &mdash; and there is not a great difference in wages either &mdash; the truth is that in Britain GDP per capita is 70 per cent higher than here.  In Germany it is two and a half times, 250 per cent, higher.  The truth is that we need to achieve an economic growth rate which is twice or three times that of our partners in order to catch up.  Of course the only other solution to the problem would be that they would transfer some of their wealth directly to us.  That is the <Col N="1795" /> type of solution Deputy O,Connell was recommending.  It is a wonderful solution and, I am sure, is popular but I want to warn anybody who cares to listen that it will not take place.  If one wants to know what the people of the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Italy, Britain, Luxembourg, Holland or Belgium will give us, then we should ask ourselves: what are the rich parts of Ireland giving to the poor parts of Ireland?  Equally we should ask: what is Ireland, as a rich country giving the poorer countries in the world? The answer is: very little.</P>
    <P>The truth is that we will receive very little.  We have received a fairly generous amount.  While the Community have been giving us what I would regard as generous amounts, the gap between our economic performance and theirs has continued to widen.  We have not used the money received as we should have used it.  The only solution we can think of now is to beg for more.  We have stolen from our children.  Deputy O'Connell in his contribution was recommending that we steal from our grandchildren as well. That does not represent any solution to the problem.  There is one solution only. If we want more money, if we want higher standards of living, we will have to produce more.  We have the education, training and resources.  Our main fault has been our failure to exploit those resources to achieve our potential and we have more resources <i>per capita</i> than any other country in the EC.  We must have, because we are a thinly populated country with quite an amount of good land &mdash; not the best in the world but good &mdash; a reasonable climate, rich fisheries around our shores and a population structured and educated to produce wealth particularly at this time, and to avail of technological developments in the world and the assistance that has been given to us.</P>

      <P>I dtosach ní mór dom cuidiú leis an mBille seo atá os comhair an Tí.  In welcoming the Bill in the few minutes made available to me, which I appreciate in the light of the many Members of the House who wish to contribute to the aspect of crime and larceny which is the subject matter of the Bill before the House, suffice it to say that the need for this Bill is more than obvious to every citizen.  Such need is made more urgent by the widespread volume of crime, lawlessness and vandalism which has increased at alarming rates in recent years and is continuing to grow despite the claims by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, in his many utterances about the reduction in crime which he has emphasised over and over again.  My contention is that he may believe it, but nobody else believes that such is the position.</P>
      <P>Surely the reality is evidenced by the sense of fear and concern in the community indicated by all the counter actions being taken by people, actions being encouraged to be taken to protect homes and property.  Is it not true that the crime situation has produced the end result of firms such as the burglar alarm and security business being one of the few businesses showing a growth rate, the cost of which is another tax on people?  We have also the increasing cost of home and motor insurance all arising from the growth in crime which the Minister is telling the nation is on the decline, decreasing. That alone is a contradiction of what the Minister has been saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me point out what has already been said in the debate, that in a six year period the number of indictable crimes rose from 62,000 to 99,727 in 1984.  Those are the figures nationally.  Let me give the figures for the Cork city region where we had again the dubious distinction, like the closures and liquidations, of having to endure the scourge of larceny, thievery and crime over recent years.  In 1983 the figure for larceny was 3,001.  In 1984, just one year later, that had increased to <Col N="1797" /> 4,000, an increase of 33 per cent.  The figure for burglaries in 1983 in Cork city was 2,192 and in 1984 that had increased to 2,614 which was about a 20 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>Burglary and larceny are the principal elements addressed in this Bill and account for 93 per cent of all crime.  I have quoted figures and I suggest to the House that those figures, like the figures for unemployment, are not really the total figure of crimes being committed. We are all well aware that in addition to the figures quoted, which are produced by the CSO and the Garda authorities, many more crimes of lesser and greater degree are not reported at all and are not listed among the CSO or Garda figures. The Minister must &mdash; or should &mdash; know, as I am sure he does, and I do from contact with my constituents, about this aspect of crime, that is, the many crimes committed and not reported.  How often when we have talked with constituents about this have they asked us: what is the point?  They say that the gardaí have enough to do already and more than enough to do.  We hear such comments, and nevertheless the Minister tells us in his opening comments on this Bill that, apart from the terms of the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deterrent to criminal activity is not sufficient.  Acts of the Oireachtas are out of date and have not been amended to take account of the serious situation we are addressing in this Bill.  I compliment my colleague on the introduction of the Bill and I condemn the attitude taken to it by the Minister, Deputy Noonan.  If the introduction of this Bill does nothing other than prompt the Government into action and to take cognisance of what we are about, and if the Minister with all the advice of his Department and the Government with all their supposed talents act responsibly in the face of escalating crime, that will be welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the limited time available to me I <Col N="1798" /> must motor on.  The figures quoted here indicate the extent of burglary, larceny, robbery and related offences in pursuance of these crimes.  It is clear that any steps that can be taken must be taken to detect and deter this type of crime and thus have a much sought impact on the total level of crime, lawlessness and vandalism. We must strive to bring back to our community the sanity and peace that our homes, streets and property once enjoyed.  The Minister's utterances, aided by selective statistics, that crime is on the wane are as acceptable as the failure of his guarantees given at the setting up of custodial care on Spike Island. The assurances he gave, tempered with no small arrogance to the Members of this Chamber and to the Prison Officer's Association at that time, were that as a result of his decision it would be safer to park your car anywhere, you would not be robbed, Spike Island was the answer. However, the nation will always remember his attitude, his words and his failures, and many people indicated the error of his proposal.  Time does not permit me to elaborate on this if, indeed, elaboration is needed.</P>
    <P>Spike Island was no deterrent.  If, as the Minister indicated in this debate, our Bill is inadequate he should take on the initiative that the Bill proposes, amend where the Government or he think necessary and give due recognition to its introduction. As is customary in our history, the people in time of need, whatever way that need may manifest itself, rely on Fianna Fáil to come to the rescue, as we have done with the introduction of this Bill on the matter of larceny, burglary and crime.</P>
    <P>Mention must be made of a monumental financial and social blunder which is fraught with physical as well as financial perils.  I refer to the budget stroke by the Government in imposing tax on the interest of all savings.  I recall last year that we all encouraged people keeping money in their homes, especially those who were vulnerable to attack, to put their money in banks and other financial institutions.  Special concessions and encouragement were given to them. <Col N="1799" /> Now, at one fell swoop, they are again wide open to the temptation to retain their savings at home, with very serious and dangerous possibilities of attack.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate this evening.  The debate that has taken place on this Bill has demonstrated that there is a good deal of common ground between the Government and Opposition. There is I believe, a general acceptance in the House that an updating of the law on larceny would be desirable.  The present Bill is designed to strengthen the law in relation to two offences under the Larceny Act, 1916 &mdash; those concerned with the possession of housebreaking implements and receiving stolen property. The Minister for Justice in his contribution, has accepted that the law in this regard could usefully be strengthened but has indicated that it would also probably be necessary for an amending Bill to deal with certain other offences under the Act.  The Minister has undertaken to bring forward an appropriate Bill at the earliest possible opportunity consistent with the Government's existing legislative priorities.</P>
      <P>The reason the Government are opposing the Bill at this stage is that it is defective in a number of respects.  Those defects have already been dealt with in considerable detail by the Minister for Justice and it is therefore unnecessary for me to deal with them except to say that they are of such a nature as not to be amenable to correction by way of amendment. It would be necessary for this Bill to be redrafted before it could be supported by the Government and if the Government were to undertake that responsibility now it would mean a delay in relation to other important legislative measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's most immediate legislative priority in the fight against crime is to ensure that those provisions of the Criminal Justice Act not yet in force are brought into operation at the earliest possible opportunity.  That requires <Col N="1800" /> the enactment of the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill and the making of the new regulations on the treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations.  I am pleased to be able to say that the debate on the Complaints Bill has recently got under way and that the Minister hopes to publish his proposals for the treatment regulations in the near future.</P>
    <P>While the Government accept the principle of the Bill, I must take issue with some of the comments and assertions which have been made in relation to it by the Opposition.  There is a suggestion in the Long Title of the Bill that it amends the law in relation to the offences of robbery and burglary.  The present Bill does not make any change in the law in regard to these offences, but is confined to those offences concerned with possession of housebreaking implements and receiving stolen goods.  The law dealing with the offences of robbery and burglary has already been modernised by the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal next with what this Bill does aim to do.  It proposes, as I have said, to replace the offence of receiving stolen goods with a new offence of handling stolen property.  The implication in many of the contributions from the Opposition benches was that the law on receiving stolen property as it exists at present is a dead letter.  While we all accept that the law requires strengthening, it is not true to suggest that persons who receive stolen property are in some way immune from prosecution.  That is simply not the case.  Prosecutions are and continue to be taken against persons suspected of this offence.  Convictions are also secured in the majority of cases where proceedings are instituted.  The Garda Report on Crime for 1984 shows that proceedings were commenced in respect of 990 offences of receiving under section 33 of the Larceny Act.  Of the 438 cases which were dealt with by the courts during the year, convictions were recorded or the case was held proved without proceeding to conviction in 357 of those cases.  These figures represent a successful prosecution rate of 81 per cent. The position in 1983 was similiar.  Prosecutions <Col N="1801" /> were successfully taken in 392 of the 465 cases dealt with by the courts that year.  It is not correct therefore to suggest that the present law creates insurmountable problems for a successful prosecution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods also suggested that the existing law in relation to receiving stolen property was defective because it failed to make the receiving of &ldquo;the proceeds&rdquo; of stolen property an offence.  To overcome this problem he proposed a new definition of property which is contained in subsection (2) of the proposed new section 33B in section 4 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The effect of the amendment would not &mdash; as Deputy Woods has suggested &mdash; be to extend the scope of the offence of receiving but to restrict it.  The 1916 Act already contains a definition of &ldquo;property&rdquo; in section 46(1) which applies to all offences under the Act including the offence of receiving and which includes:</P>
    <P>not only such property as has been originally in the possession or under the control of any person, but also any property into or for which the same has been converted or exchanged, and anything acquired by such conversion or exchange, whether immediately or otherwise...</P>
    <P>If Deputy Woods' intention was to replace this definition, the effect of his amendment would be to limit the extent to which proceeds acquire the character of stolen goods.  I accept that such a limitation may well be desirable but the point remains that the existing offence of receiving does extend to the proceeds of stolen goods, contrary to what Deputy Woods has said.</P>
    <P>One might also suspect from Deputy Woods' contribution that the effect of the Court of Criminal Appeal's decision in the <i>People (Attorney General)</i> v. <i>Oglesby</i>, 1966 I.R. 162 was to radically alter the law in relation to the offence of receiving stolen goods.  That was not the case, as Deputy Taylor pointed out in his contribution.  What the Court of Criminal Appeal did in that case was to confirm the application of the general principle that the onus of proof always lies with <Col N="1802" /> the prosecution in cases involving receiving in the same way as it applies to other criminal offences.  The court in confirming that principle rejected the proposition that the possession of recently stolen goods by an accused person casts an onus on him or her to give an explanation or that the jury are entitled to convict him or her of receiving the goods solely because they reject the explanation.  That does not mean that a jury are not entitled to draw an adverse inference in such circumstances &mdash; a jury may infer guilty knowledge in the absence of any explanation or where they do not accept the explanation given, provided that they are satisfied on all the evidence of the guilt of the accused. Such inferences can still are drawn as a matter of common sense from other facts.</P>
    <P>The decision in the Oglesby case is consistent with earlier decisions of the courts both here and in England.  That is clear from the judgment itself.  Kenny J., for example, quoted the following statement of Reading L.C.J. in <i>R</i> v. <i>Schama and Abramovitch</i>, 11 Cr. App. R. 45, a case decided in 1914,</P>
    <P>Where the prisoner is charged with receiving recently stolen property, when the prosecution has proved the possession by the prisoner, and that the goods had been recently stolen, the jury should be told that they may, not that they must, in the absence of any reasonable explanation, find the prisoner guilty.  But if an explanation is given which may be true, it is for the jury to say on the whole evidence whether the accused is guilty or not; that is to say, if the jury think that the explanation may reasonably be true, though they are not convinced that it is true, the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal, because the Crown has not discharged the onus of proof imposed upon it of satisfying the jury beyond reasonable doubt of the prisoner's guilt.  That onus never changes, it always rests on the prosecution.</P>
    <P>That statement of the law had already been approved by the High Court here in the Attorney General (Comer) v <Col N="1803" /> Shorten, 1961 I.R. 304.  These decisions are also consistent with the way in which the law on handling has been applied in England under the 1968 Theft Act.  That is not to say that some change in the law in regard to the onus of proof in receiving cases might not be desirable.  This is a matter which the Government would obviously like to consider in framing amending legislation.</P>
    <P>I should also mention at this point that the law in relation to those found in possession of stolen property has already been strengthened &mdash; a fact which Opposition speakers largely chose to ignore. Under section 16 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, a person found in possession of property reasonably believed to have been stolen will be guilty of an offence if he or she fails or refuses, without a reasonable excuse, to disclose to a garda who questions him or her the source of that property.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gene Fitzgerald &mdash; who did mention this provision &mdash; suggested, however, that it would be of no benefit to the Garda.  Section 16 is not intended for the type of case he mentioned but for circumstances where the Garda do not or are unlikely to have sufficient evidence for a prosecution for receiving.  Section 16 will then allow the Garda either to establish the source of the stolen goods or, where the person fails or refuses to divulge that source, to take a prosecution for witholding information.  In that way the section will allow proceedings to be taken against persons against whom there would be insufficient evidence to justify a prosecution at present, while also being of assistance in identifying those whose business is the trade in stolen property.</P>
    <P>The public will, I would submit, be better served at this point in time if this and the other provisions of the Criminal Justice Act which remain to be brought into operation are brought into force rather than by having resources in the Department of Justice diverted to the preparation of new legislative measures whose purpose is essentially the same.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal this evening with the provision in the Bill dealing with <Col N="1804" /> possession of house breaking implements. The points raised on that have already been extensively covered by the Minister for Justice and the Minister of State at the Department of Education and at the Department of Labour.  There is, however, one final point I would like to make in relation to the debate that has taken place on this measure.  Considerable stress was placed in contributions from both sides of the House on the fact that offences against property represent the vast bulk of indictable crime committed in this country.  We are not, however, unique in that regard.  The growth in crime against property is attributable far more to the transformation of this country to a modern consumer society than to any defect in the criminal law.</P>
    <P>I should stress that I do not intend these or any of my earlier comments to suggest that the Government do not see any need for the law on larceny to be further strengthened.  Amendments of the law on the lines proposed in this Bill may well be desirable and I can assure the House that the changes proposed will be among the matters considered by the Minister for Justice in preparing amending legislation.</P>
    <P>It is not altogether surprising, I suppose, that the Opposition in the course of this debate, including Deputy Lyons who spoke before me, have failed to give the Government any credit for the measures they have taken to tackle the problem of crime in our society.  Those measures do nevertheless deserve to be mentioned because they are concrete evidence of the Government's commitment to deal with the problem of crime.  The measures taken by the Government include the strengthening of the Garda by way of extra manpower, new technology and additional powers with which to investigate serious crime.</P>
    <P>Under this Government there has been a net increase of 700 in the strength of the Garda Síochána.  The current strength of the force at 11,400 is at its highest level ever and the Government are committed to maintaining it at that strength.  The Government's commitment to the Garda Síochána is also evidenced by the continued <Col N="1805" /> investment in the most up to date technology for the force in order, for example, to provide a national communications network and to extend the computer facilities at its disposal.  Equally important has been the determination of the Government to ensure that the Garda should have adequate powers to investigate serious crime.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1984, a measure which was introduced in the Dáil within a year of the Government taking office, ensures that this will be the case.</P>
    <P>Under that Act the Garda for the first time will have a general right to detain for questioning persons whom they suspect of serious offences.  The Act also enables the Garda to fingerprint and to carry out certain forensic tests on such persons.  The new powers of detention under the Act and the new offence of withholding information about stolen property to which I have already referred will be of particular assistance to the Garda in dealing with those persons who engage in offences such as burglary, robbery and other forms of larceny.  Other provisions of the Act should also contribute to an improvement in this regard. These include the provision dealing with the inferences which a court or jury may draw from the failure of an accused person to account for objects or marks or for his presence at a particular place at or about the time an offence has been committed, the power to fingerprint persons convicted of an offence or dealt with under the Probation Act and the changes in the law on bail.</P>
    <P>The Garda have been encouraging also the community itself to become involved in the fight against crime through the establishment of the Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert schemes. The response of the public to these initiatives has been very positive.  These schemes offer considerable scope for tackling the problems of burglaries and larcenies in local communities.  If the Garda are to combat these crimes successfully they must have the full co-operation and assistance of the community. The Garda should not be expected to <Col N="1806" /> act outside or independent of the community they serve.  The community at large are the eyes and ears of the force; Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert give the public a structure through which they can perform this important role.</P>
    <P>These are some of the measures which this Government have taken to deal with crime.  The Government will continue to give the fight against crime a high priority and to take the steps which they believe are necessary to respond to the challenge it poses.</P>
    <P>I would like to repeat that the Government in common with the Opposition regard a reform and strengthening of the law in relation to offences against property as desirable.  The Minister for Justice has already stated that he will consider the possibility of an early review of the Larceny Acts in the context of the Government's priorities in relation to future law reform work as soon as the availability of resources allows. Accordingly, I must recommend that this Bill be opposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to acknowledge the contributions of Deputies from both sides, all of which were helpful and objective. It is worth recording that all speakers in the debate agree that there is need for urgent legislation in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it was disappointing that some Government speakers tried to belittle the efforts of Fianna Fáil in trying to have the law strengthened in this very pressing area of national administration, while accusing us of copying legislation from another jurisdiction.  I refer to the contribution of Deputy Birmingham yesterday when, in the absence of any objective suggestion, he tried to castigate this party for endeavouring to assist the Government in regard to a matter that has been neglected sadly in the past four years.  In our efforts to assist the Goverment in this matter we examined the legislation of a number of European countries and, therefore, though perhaps it is not technically perfect in every respect, this Bill is directed towards the protection of the property and lives of our <Col N="1807" /> people.  For that reason the Government's negative attitude to this Bill is to be regretted.  If I were to ask Deputies on the far side of the House in which area has there been the greatest failure over the past four years they would readily identify the areas of unemployment and law and order and everybody on this side of the House would agree with them.  That view would be more than endorsed by all the people from the youngest to the old and infirm who live in fear and insecurity.  This fear and insecurity is not now confined to our streets but has entered into what was regarded as the relatively safe haven of our homes.</P>
    <P>I will not confuse the House with statistics in relation to the escalating crime wave.  They are available for those who want to study them.  The Minister of State's academic reply to this debate and her quotation of examples of court cases and High Court decisions of 50 and 60 years ago does not help the people looking to this House for protection.  The Minister of State and the Government generally would have been better employed in trying to find a way to support this Bill even if it needs amendment. The Government's failure to do that is a frightening indictment of the Government in this crucial area.</P>
    <P>The real picture of crime and violence is not truly reflected in the frightening statistics available.  Day after day and night after night the media unfold great human tragedy in house break-ins, robbery and associated crimes on an almost hourly basis.  That is only part of the tragedy.  People are now becoming despondent and they have little belief in the capacity of this House to deal with the problem, so much so that many crimes are not being reported to the Garda.  I warned this House against the danger of complacency on a number of occasions when speaking on other matters relating to the Department of Justice.  Complacency presents a threat to the credibility of our democratic institutions. When people lose confidence in the ability of this House to legislate for <Col N="1808" /> their security, we have reached a critical stage.  Our failure to legislate effectively in this area has resulted in despondency and a sense of helplessness in the Garda Síochána who find themselves in an almost impossible situation, being unable to cope with escalating levels of crime because of the weaknesses of the law under which they must perform their duties.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that Fianna Fáil have given so much time and thought to what we had hoped would be seen by the Government and the people as a genuine effort to deal with this matter.  Our party are disappointed at the Minister's response.  The Minister said that the Government were opposing this Bill which is defective in a number of respects and could not easily be put into proper shape by putting down amendments.  Will the Minister tell the House what Bills are not defective in some respects when first circulated?  Will the Minister admit that most Government Bills are amended as a result of examination and debate?  The Criminal Justice Bill is an example of a Bill which was totally changed from its original form as a result of amendments from this side of the House, particularly those put forward by my colleague, Deputy Woods.  The reality is that the Minister and the Government are unwilling to tackle the serious problem.  They are now prepared to abandon our citizens in this crucial area of national administration and leave our gardaí vulnerable and weak in their efforts to enforce inadequate laws.</P>
    <P>This House has every reason to be disappointed with the negative tone of the Minister's reply in view of the lip service given by the Minister's colleague the Minister, Deputy Bruton to the need for reform in this House.  I recall the vigour with which this Government on coming to office outlined the need for constructive opposition, the need for back-up services for the Opposition and the need for doing what we are doing here tonight, the need for introducing Private Members' Bills.  That has all been forgotten.  It was another example of Government rhetoric without action or commitment.  This is <Col N="1809" /> the second Bill which Fianna Fáil have brought before the House and it has been treated in the same dismissive way by this Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the Minister's reason for opposing this Bill.  The Minister said it would take a disproportionate amount of work and would divert resources from the Government's existing legislative programme to have the adequacy of the Bill analysed in complete detail and that this was especially so when, as he hoped to explain later, they would be introducing alternative legislation.  What does the Minister mean by that statement?  Apart from the fact that he is deliberately turning his back on the victims whose homes have been broken into he is, in effect, saying that it is too much trouble to examine the Fianna Fáil Bill in depth.  This is an admission that a great deal of thought and research has gone into the preparation of the Fianna Fáil Bill and undoubtedly that is so.  For selfish political reasons, the Minister has chosen to ignore all this work because he is too embarrassed to admit that legislation is required in this area.</P>
    <P>I can understand the Minister's political motivation but I cannot understand the recklessness of such a decision, particularly at this time.  The Minister also said he opposed the Bill because it would interfere with the Government's legislative priorities.  I ask the House to note the word &ldquo;priorities&rdquo;.  What priorities is the Minister talking about?  They were outlined to us in the early days of the session when the Taoiseach ordered the First Reading of a number of Bills for debate in the current session, many of which are being introduced as mere legislative statistics rather than for their relevance and content.  Indeed, the same could be said of much of the very limited legislation brought before this House by the Government.  Is there any more urgent or crucial area in need of the Government's attention and reform than the protection of the lives and property of our citizens?</P>
    <P>The Minister also said the Government could not divert resources from their own legislative programme to deal adequately <Col N="1810" /> with this Bill.  That is an unintended recognition of the value and content of the Bill and is an indictment of the Government's legislative priorities.  I wish to remind the Minister that the resources to which he refers are those which the Government extracted through taxation from the people.  By implication, he said that the homes, property and the lives of the people who made that contribution are no longer important and are not a Government priority.  That is a reckless and disgraceful situation.  It is a shameful admission and not worthy of any Government or Minister.</P>
    <P>The Government's opposition to the Bill will not deter Fianna Fáil from preparing and bringing before this House other Bills in areas where they find them necessary.  I was very pleased to have been associated with my colleague, Deputy Woods, in the preparation of this Bill, particularly in the very crucial area of Government administration.  I found the exercise fulfilling and my colleagues on our party's committee on law reform deserve our appreciation for their advice and guidance even though the Minister of State, Deputy Birmingham, belittled those efforts by aligning us with an administration outside the country.</P>
    <P>I hope the publication of this Bill will be seen as a genuine and deliberate attempt by Fianna Fáil in helping and encouraging the Government to come to grips with what is undoubtedly a very frightening and neglected area of Government administration.  I do not need to remind the House of the difficulty for the Opposition in formulating a Bill of this nature.  It is the second Bill brought before the House by Fianna Fáil in recent months and I know that other Bills will follow as the occasion arises.  The House will agree that law reform in this crucial area is long overdue and that the failure to do something about it before now has resulted in the Garda and the law generally being unable to deal adequately with the frightening increase in house breaking and robberies.</P>
    <P>The phraseology used in the Bill is easy to read and to understand from a lay person's point of view.  I have commented <Col N="1811" /> on this on a number of occasions in the past.  The Bill is wide ranging in content and covers the entire area &mdash; regardless of what the Minister of State said &mdash; of robberies, burglaries and other offences relating to crime.  It deals in particular with the disposal of goods arising from property taken in raids of various kinds. Our party believe that, if we can become effective in the area of receiving and disposing of stolen property, we will have removed the motivation for robbery.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk from the Government about the need for reform in the House and the desirability of more objective and constructive debate.  Yet we had the recent example of the Government deciding politically to torpedo our Bill in relation to domicile even before it could get an objective hearing in the House.  If the Government Bill was not an example of copying and duplication of legislation from another jurisdiction I should like to know what is.  I regret the Minister's unhelpful and dismissive approach to the Bill.  The frightening increase in the level of crime in recent years has reached alarming proportions and has created an atmosphere of fear and insecurity.  While perhaps this phenomenon is worldwide, the rapidity of its increase here and our failure to deal effectively with it is a matter of great concern and presents a very serious challenge to the House and the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make unfair political charges, but there can be no doubt that the complacency of the Government in not recognising the extent of the problem and their failure to take positive steps to contain the situation must be taken seriously by this House.  I appeal to the Minister, even at this late stage, to come down from cloud nine and make an effort to help defend our defenceless citizens instead of trying to protect the Cabinet for their failure to provide that much needed protection for which the people are crying out.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are playing our part in helping the Minister to achieve that objective.  We cannot enforce the law of the land but we have a bounden duty to <Col N="1812" /> legislate to update the law and ensure that it is effectively enforced.  Such legislation is urgently needed to enable our gardaí to keep abreast of the highly organised, professional and sophisticated crime syndicates which operate openly. This legislation is also needed to eliminate the alarming increase in house breaking, robbery and theft which has been of great concern to householders not only in the urban areas but, tragically, to old people living alone in rural areas.  The past 12 or 18 months have seen an escalation and transfer of crime from the greater urban areas to the relatively safer environs of the rural community.</P>
    <P>How often do we hear it said that nothing is safe any more?  This is a general comment made by ordinary, decent, law abiing citizens.  That is a true statement, a frightening indictment of the deteriorating standards in society and a reflection on this House because it shows a general deterioration in the economic structures of the country.  I regret that time does not allow me to go some way along that road because, as I said on a number of occasions, there is a direct link between the economic conditions prevailing at any given time and the level of crime and violence.  There can be no doubt that the present serious economic situation is a major contributing factor in the breakdown of law and order.</P>
    <P>It would be very wrong to blame the socially deprived for the increase in crime; it would be more accurate to say that they are far too often the scapegoats for the highly organised professional gangs who have made crime their career. Earlier in this debate, my colleague, Deputy Lyons, referred to the statistics which some people would like to ignore but which in fact represent reality.  Those grim figures were also unfolded by my colleagues, Deputy Woods, in his opening contribution.  He indicated that there was an increase in indicatable crime from 62,000 in 1978 to 99,720 in 1984, and burglaries accounted for 93 per cent of that frightening increase.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that robbery is now big business in this country.  This Government have been successful in undermining, <Col N="1813" /> through legislation, legitimate industries and businesses and it is ironic that Government inaction has resulted in the growth of a dangerous and illicit industry based on the stolen, hard-won property of law abiding citizens.  In 1984, £32 million worth of stolen goods were not recovered.  That sum of money in any man's language represents a massive industry, but it is also an indication of the level of the serious deterioration in law and order.</P>
    <P>For the Government and the Minister to come into this House in a negative fashion for the purpose of ridiculing Fianna Fáil about this Bill is nothing short of a national disgrace.  We spent hours and days in this House over the past four years debating legislation which was not as relevant as this Bill.  As I said earlier, if there is one area of this Government's administration which has been a total failure, it has been in the administration of the Department of Justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Since becoming a Member of this House I have always felt that Members who have legal experience have a great advantage over other Members, especially when we are speaking to Bills dealing with criminal law. I welcome the Opposition's initiative in introducing a Bill with a view to updating the law on larceny.</P>
      <P>I note in the Bill that the Principal Act referred to is the Larceny Act, 1916.  This has served Ireland and Great Britain well for a number of years but in recent times there has been a need for a revision of the law in this area.  On 18 March 1959 the then Home Secretary gave the following terms of reference to the Criminal Law Revision Committee:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To consider, with a view to providing a simpler and more effective system of law, what alterations in the criminal law are desirable with reference to larceny, and kindred offences, and to such other acts involving fraud or dishonesty as, in the opinion of the Committee, would conveniently be dealt with in <Col N="1814" /> legislation giving effect to the Committee's recommendations on the law of larceny.</P>
    <P>The committee decided to treat their terms of reference as extending to all the offences covered by the two principal Acts concerning larceny and related offences, the Larceny Act, 1861, and the Larceny Act, 1916.  The most important offences are stealing, robbery, burglary and other offences involving breaking and entering, obtaining by false pretences, blackmail, receiving stolen property and possessing housebreaking equipment and other instruments for criminal purposes.</P>
    <P>The committee were of the view that the then law in relation to larceny, the Larceny Act, 1916, worked reasonably well, that it was only exceptional cases which caused difficulty and most of the difficulties could be got rid of for practical purposes by amending the 1916 Act. Nevertheless, they were strongly of the opinion that the time had come for a new law of theft and related offences based on a fundamental consideration underlying this branch of the law and embodied in a modern statute.  The committee's deliberations led to the Theft Act, 1969.</P>
    <P>The committee were of the view that the chief defects in the existing law of larceny are, first, its difficulty and complexity and, secondly, its failure to deal with certain kinds of dishonesty which ought certainly to be punishable.  Lord Goddard in a judgment in 1958 referred to by the committee in their report, after alluding to the law of larceny as a law which is exceedingly technical and which has been the subject of many great decisions, quoted a statement from Mr. Rupert Cross, Professor of English Law at Oxford:</P>
    <P>That some of the decided cases of the retention of property innocently come by emphasise the utter unreality of the present law of stealing and are a public scandal both because the courts are reluctantly compelled to allow dishonesty to go unpunished and because of the serious waste of judicial time <Col N="1815" /> involved in discussion of futile legal subtleties.</P>
    <P>Lord Goddard added, &ldquo;These are strong words, no doubt, but it would be a good thing, I think, if the law of larceny could be somewhat simplified and cleared up&rdquo;. The committee considered it quite remarkable that the law should still be in a state in which so many cases, most of them involving the simplest of facts, could have produced so much difference of judicial opinion and controversy among legal writers.  The defects in the law of larceny arise mainly from it being regarded as essentially a violation of the owner's right of possession and not of his right of ownership.</P>
    <P>I feel it was the revision and updating of the Larceny Act of 1916 that has prompted the Opposition to bring in the present Bill which would go some way to updating our larceny laws.  The Larceny Act of 1916 is outdated in many ways as Deputy Woods outlined in his speech, especially in relation to offences that are committed at night.  The situation today is that just as many offences are committed during daytime as at night and indeed the 1968 Theft Act makes no distinction whatsoever between night and day.</P>
    <P>The law which governs the crime of receiving stolen goods is the Larceny Act of 1916 but, again, it has long been regarded as obsolete and ineffective. Clause 21 of the Theft Act of 1968 replaced the existing offence of receiving stolen property by a new offence of handling stolen goods.  This will catch not only the receiver as the term is generally understood but also those who have lesser roles in the enterprise, for example it will also catch the intermediary who puts a thief in touch with a buyer or a man who moves stolen goods from one place to another.</P>
    <P>The Garda have been seeking increased powers in this area and the courts have been calling for action and any amendment of the law in this area would be very welcome.  When a layman speaks about the law dealing with larceny <Col N="1816" /> he must bear in mind what the legal experts say about its difficulty and complexity. As Lord Goddard said, it is a very technical area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Opposition have raised this issue and the Bill is welcome from that point of view.  However, the Minister for Justice has told us he cannot accept some technicalities contained in the Bill.  As a layman, I do not know about them but I am sure they exist.  The committee to which I referred earlier thought there was a possibility of amending the 1916 Act but then they decided it would be better to have a totally new measure.  If we are to update the 1916 Act dealing with larceny it must be done by way of a Bill to be introduced by the Minister.  I hope that the action of Fianna Fáil in moving this Bill in the House will prompt the Government to bring in new legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>Legislation is essential because of the many offences committed.  Deputy Woods is Chairman of the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism on which I serve and at our weekly meetings we discuss the serious problems that affect the community.  We hear what is happening every week in our advice centres and when we meet our constituents. No longer do people feel safe in their own homes and that is a matter legislators must consider.  Last night Deputy Leonard informed the House of his experience at the hands of thugs.  It is only when one comes into contact with the problem oneself that one realises the serious effect it can have on society.  Last July I left my house to visit my sister for three hours and on my return I found it had been burgled.  It was the first time I had such an experience.  It is not just the things that are missing but the fact that somebody has been in one's house.  It leaves one with a very strange feeling that is hard to describe.  It is a most worrying experience.  When I returned home last night after listening to speeches on this matter in this House I found that all the lights were on in my home.  My wife explained that the house of a neighbour had been burgled in the afternoon.  In a small row of houses two homes have been <Col N="1817" /> burgled recently.  This kind of crime is being committed all the time.  There is a need to update the law to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>We have an excellent Garda force.  I am glad to see from the report of the Commissioner that their detection rate with regard to the crime of larceny has increased slightly.  It is most important that the Garda should have a high success rate in the detection of crime.  It is surprising to see the number of gardaí involved in court procedures who should be out on the streets in an attempt to combat crime.  Better management of the force is necessary if we are to tackle the crime problem.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Criminal Justice Act will have the desired effect.  Like Deputy Woods, I spent many long nights here last summer when the Bill was going through the House.  I took a special interest in it because I wanted to see a balance between the prevention of crime on the one hand and the protection of the civil liberties of the individual on the other. As Deputy Woods said, I think, we succeeded in getting that balance but certain sections of the Act have not yet been implemented because the legislation regarding the complaints procedure has not yet passed into law.  When the Act is implemented in its entirely I hope it will have the desired effect in helping the Garda to improve their detection rate in respect of crime.  It is desirable that the Garda should be empowered to detain a criminal in order to allow them to investigate the crime committed.  Also, the taking of fingerprints from a person detained is a very important aspect of crime detection.  I should hope that when all sections of the Act are in operation, the Garda will have at their disposal an instrument that will help them in their fight against crime.</P>
    <P>There is a further aspect to the area of crime detection.  I refer to the neighbourhood watch development, to which reference was made in the first report of the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism.  There are now many neighbourhood watches in operation and the <Col N="1818" /> initial reports indicate that the development is proving successful.  The Garda can do so much but, if everyone in the community participates in a neighbourhood watch, the Garda can be much more effective in their work and the person breaking the law will have a lesser chance of continuing in his criminal activities. The community can be the eyes and ears of the Garda, as it were, in the area of crime prevention and detection.</P>
    <P>As I have said this area was dealt with very well by the commission set up in England to produce a new Act.  That committee dealt fully with the technicalities in relation to the law on larceny and other matters.  I trust that the Government will address themselves to producing similar legislation here.  If the Bill proposed by the Opposition can have the desired effect, I trust it will be given due consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Doyle on an excellent speech and one that can be interpreted only as supportive of our measure.  His arguments are similar to those that would be offered by people on this side of the House and are in line with the thinking of my colleagues who did all the work in the production of this measure &mdash; Deputy Woods and Deputy Hyland.</P>
      <P>The argument that there are technicalities involved in the Bill which would cause some difficulty is erroneous and should not be represented here.  An example of what I have in mind is that a valuation Bill brought in by the Coalition on three occasions was postponed on each of those occasions until the legislation was right in technical term.  The point is that that piece of legislation was not abandoned.  It was not voted against. That does not happen in a parliamentary democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot take the arguments of the Minister for Justice very seriously anymore. I am giving him the benefit of the doubt as to whether we considered his arguments seriously in the past.  When we left office in November 1982 or, more accurately, were thrown out by the Coalition long before our time, the Criminal <Col N="1819" /> Justice Bill was ready.  It was brought into the House in October 1983 and was not passed until the end of 1984.  The delay was as much if not more because of the arguments from the other side of the House as because of the arguments we put forward.  The legislation setting up the complaints commission is only before the House now, so one must question whether the Minister is serious about ever implementing the Criminal Justice Act. Presumably he would much prefer that the legislation should be implemented long after he had gone from the job. Perhaps he thought he would have been promoted by now.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are accused often of not being constructive or of not having ideas.  We have our own policies.  We have a lot of support from back up teams.  In this case Deputy Woods and his colleagues worked extremely hard to bring forward legislation at this stage.  Were it not the urgency involved, we would have waited and included the legislation in our programme for Government later this year.  Because of the breakdown in law and order in both urban and rural areas we considered it necessary to bring the Bill forward now.</P>
    <P>The speech of the Minister for Justice exposed one basic deficiency in this Bill. The Larceny Acts, as he said, were designed to penalise dishonest behaviour.  This Bill if enacted would be no more useful than its predecessors in combating the type of intellectual dishonesty which pervaded the Minister's speech and which indeed has become the only consistent feature of his incompetent occupancy of his distinguished office.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was introduced, Fianna Fáil made it clear that it represented a responsible and constructive attempt to tackle the most prevalent type of crime which afflicts the people of this country. As was the case when we introduced the Conflict of Laws Reform Bill last November, we were willing to debate the proposal fully and consider any amendments which any Member of this House might propose.  Last November, the <Col N="1820" /> Government decided to reject our Bill and, by implication, two full reports prepared by the Law Reform Commission. They circulated instead a much more restricted and much less significant Bill, the Domicile Bill, 1985, which they have yet to introduce in this House.  But on that occasion, our initiative at least had the effect of forcing the Government finally to do something to end a blatant piece of discrimination against women of the type they have for so long ineffectually bleated about.</P>
    <P>On this occasion, however, the Minister has no lucky bag, instant whip proposal. On this occasion, unable to think up even a face saving alternative to our proposals for action against the criminals, he has instead resorted to the type of nitpicking approach which more usually typifies school debates than parliamentary proceedings.  In view of the fact that, in the annals of parliamentary democracy, his speech must represent the first occasion on which a Minister for Justice implied that the abolition of juries in personal injury actions was a more important priority to him than the protection of the citizen in his own home, perhaps the Minister should abandon his pretence at parliamentary debate and return to presiding over the school debates in which he would quite obviously be more at home.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the Larceny Acts are technical and complex and it certainly cannot be doubted that the Minister himself has found them to be so. Indeed, the Minister has quite obviously found even this short five page Bill to be so complex that, if his speech accurately reflects his own views, it can only be assumed that his comprehension of it does not extend past or even include the Long Title.  The Minister stated that the Long Title is misleading.  Quoting accurately from the Long Title, he pointed out that one of the purposes of the Bill is to reform the law in relation, <i>inter alia,</i> to the carrying out of robbery and burglary. He then stated that the Bill proposes, and I quote him, &ldquo;to make no changes in the law on the offences of robbery and burglary&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1821" /> The present law was enacted long before the criminals discovered the potential of the balaclava or the crash helmet as a means of facilitating the commission of robberies.  It was enacted long before the invention of the sophisticated equipment often used nowadays by professional burglars to detect and deactivate alarm systems.  It is not surprising that a law, enacted in 1916, should not be aimed at dealing with modernly equipped robbers and burglars and instead refers only to such items as pick locks and jackbits.  This Bill contains similar provisions to those introduced in England in 1968 to take account of the modern implements used to carry out robberies and burglaries.  The Minister, therefore, might perhaps reconsider &mdash; if, in fact, he himself ever considered at all &mdash; this &ldquo;technical and complex&rdquo; proposal.</P>
    <P>The Minister next stated as his no doubt learned opinion that there had been difficulties in the operation of the Theft Act of 1968 in England which he correctly identified as the source of many of the proposals in this Bill.  The Anglo-Irish Conference, if it achieved nothing else, could at least perhaps provide a vehicle for the Minister to communicate his insights in this respect to the British Government who are not apparently as informed as the Minister concerning their own legal system.  In fact, for his information, there have been amendments to the Theft Act since 1968 and account was taken of those amendments by Deputy Woods when preparing this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister then proceeded, in a complicated if not very technical way, to give a few examples of what he claimed were serious defects in the Bill now before this House.  For example, he compared and contrasted subsections (1) and (4) of the new section 28 we proposed to insert into the 1916 Act.  As subsection (4) would retain the offence of having house-breaking implements in one's possession without lawful excuse, the Minister felt that it was superfluous in view of the fact that subsection (1) covers possession of any article for use in the course of burglary etc.  The Minister then <Col N="1822" /> criticised subsection (4) for placing an onus of proof on an accused to furnish a lawful excuse for having house-breaking implements in his possession.  The reason why subsection (4) is not superflous is precisely because it is desirable that there should be such an onus on people found in possession of easily identifiable house-breaking implements whereas such an onus would place an unfair burden on a person charged with possession of an article which could be for innocent as well as criminal use.</P>
    <P>Also referring to the proposed new section 28, the Minister sought to suggest that the fact that under the Vagrancy Act of 1824 it is an offence for a person to have house-breaking implements in his possession in day time is a sufficient excuse for rejecting the portions of this Bill which propose to deal with the commission of burglaries and robberies in day time.  He has conveniently ignored the fact that the provisions of subsection (4) of section 28 of this Bill relating to the onus of proof, are not duplicated in the Vagrancy Act, 1824.  As matters stand, if a criminal is found at night with housebreaking implements he can be sentenced to five years imprisonment unless he has a lawful excues for having them. If, however, he is found with them in the day time he can only be sentenced to a maximum of three months imprisonment if the Garda can prove that he did not have a lawful excuse for having them.  If the Garda are aware of a person who has such implements, does the Minister think that they should wait until dusk, check their watches and then affect an arrest or does the Minister feel that three months is a sufficient penalty for such criminals?</P>
    <P>In approaching our proposal to deal with the handling of stolen goods, the Minister appeared to suggest that it might not go far enough.  Perhaps he is right and it is a great pity that rather than enlighten us as to his views and perhaps assist the Garda by proposing an amendment to strengthen our proposal, he suggested the type of further examination which viewers of the series &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo; will know is usually calculated to <Col N="1823" /> ensure inactivity, prolong inertia and conceal inability.</P>
    <P>The Minister also made several criticisms of certain peripheral aspects of the Bill.  Concentrating on the part of the new section 33 which deals with handling goods dishonestly obtained outside the State.  The Minister suggested that a person could be guilty, and I quote him, &ldquo;of handling stolen property in Ireland even though the property was not stolen at all under the law of the place where it was originally obtained&rdquo;.  It is hard to see how one could be said to handle stolen goods which were never stolen, but I assume that what the Minister was endeavouring to say was that handling goods in the State obtained in a way outside the State which was not illegal under the law of the place where they were obtained, could become an offence under Irish law.  Most extraordinarily, if the Minister were correct, this undesirable state of affairs currently exists, as our proposal merely modifies the existing law in this respect to take account of the new offence of handling, and the Minister has not made and apparently does not intend to make the simple but necessary amendment to rectify matters.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, the Minister is again wrong as the present law and this Bill do not and would not penalise a person for receiving or handling such goods if there was a lawful excuse for the handling or receiving.  Quite clearly the fact that the goods were not obtained illegally under the law of the place in which they were obtained would constitute such a lawful excuse.  The Minister can, therefore, be assured that even the present law is somewhat less defective than he seems to believe and that is just as well in view of his inactivity as regards rectifying the many defects in it which do exist.</P>
    <P>Most of the criticisms of this Bill made by the Minister were to the effect that a number of its provisions might be unnecessary or superfluous.  It will hardly be of much consolation to the tens of thousands of our citizens who fall victim to crime that the Minister for Justice intends to oppose a Bill containing measures <Col N="1824" /> which he agrees are necessary because it also contains measures which he thinks might be unnecessary.  Somebody should inform him that there is a Committee Stage process in this House. He has never served in Opposition and knows little about the regulation of the business of the House.  He does not seem to know much about a lot of other things as well.</P>
    <P>Even if the Minister were correct in all of his criticisms, and it is quite clear that he is not, he would be failing in his duty if he did not endeavour to ensure passage of this Bill in a form acceptable to him. It is not good enough to say that certain aspects of the Bill might be unnecessary or may be superfluous or do not conform to some stylised concept of drafting but the Department of Justice has not sufficient time or the Minister has not sufficient interest to table the amendments which the parliamentary draughtsmen might feel are necessary.  The suppression of crime may not be an immediate priority of this Government but it is certainly a priority for the people of this country and for the Fianna Fáil.  The Minister may well be, and I quote him, &ldquo;cautiously optimistic&rdquo; about crime; the countless victims of crime hardly share his optimism.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech represented a party political response to a constructive attempt by Fianna Fáil to facilitate the Garda in their fight against crime.  It constituted a narrow and selfish approach to a very serious national problem.  It attempted to excuse the Government's inactivity in this area by pleading that the Government did not have the resources to amend this Bill to their satisfaction.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was honest in the reasons he gave for opposing this Bill, I wish to make a proposal which should enable him to permit this Bill to go to Committee Stage.  In view of the Minister's comments, we are willing to reexamine the text of this Bill.  We are willing to re-consider it in the light of the Minister's criticisms.  If, having done so, we feel that amendments are necessary we ourselves will table those amendments. If, notwithstanding our efforts, <Col N="1825" /> the Minister is still unhappy he can then impose his whip and have the Bill rejected.  No &ldquo;valuable&rdquo; Government time need be wasted.  No &ldquo;vital&rdquo; Government legislation need be delayed.  No &ldquo;rigid&rdquo; ministerial schedule need be affected.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to withdraw his opposition on that basis.  I ask him to do so in the name of those who might thereby be spared the effects of crimes which this Bill might deter.  I ask him <Col N="1826" /> in the name of justice for those whom provisions of this Bill might bring to book.  I ask him for once, just once, to rise above party politics and put the people first.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister did not bother to come I am sure the Minister of State could accept those terms, allow this Bill to be read a Second Time and arrange Committee Stage for another night.</P>

      <P>Deputy Albert Reynolds has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 21 on today's Order Paper.  He has ten minutes and the Minister has five minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for giving me the opportunity of teasing out this problem which arose today at Question Time in relation to licences that have already been granted to Amble Resources Ltd., and another licence that is under consideration to be given to them.  I wanted the Minister to clarify some points today.  He did not clarify them too well and perhaps he will take the opportunity to state his position clearly and unequivocally here tonight.</P>
      <P>First, was he aware of the seriously misleading and inaccurate information given out by Amble Resources Ltd. to the Vancouver Stock Exchange?  The first instance was on 9 October 1985.  Unfortunately, in the time I have available I will have to be very short and make a synopsis of the main points.  The first was a news release on 9 October issued to the Vancouver Stock Exchange, quite clearly in an effort to lure investors to invest in this new venture which was to take place in Ireland.  It said:</P>
      <P>Amble Resources Ltd. in conjunction with Tenquille Resources Ltd., has an option to acquire Cliffbourne Mining Ltd., a producing anthracite mine in the Leinster Coalfield, Republic of Ireland.</P>
      <P>In addition applications have been submitted with favourable response for the balance of the Leinster Coalfield...</P>
      <P>Drill indicated recoverable reserves exceeded 10,000,000 tons of anthracite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1829" /> I take those two extracts as an example of the misleading and really false information which has been given.  In the first instance, to make a statement on 9 October that applications had been submitted, with favourable response, to the Department is clearly inaccurate.  As I understand it &mdash; perhaps the Minister will tell me if I am wrong &mdash; the Department did not receive applications until 28 October.</P>
    <P>Secondly, &ldquo;Drill indicated recoverable reserves exceeded 10,000,000 tons&rdquo; again is clearly inaccurate.  That figure should read 5.15 million tons.  There are other inaccurate statements and I have not time to go through them all tonight.  Those two are quite clear.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, on 19 December a further news release to the Vancouver Stock Exchange stated that Amble Resources Ltd. had recently completed the acquisition of prospecting leases in the Leinster coalfield near Kilkenny in the Republic of Ireland and that a recent telephone communication from the Department of Energy of the Irish Republic confirmed that other substantial areas and leases were to be made available to Amble Resources and negotiations were continuing. They repeated the measured reserves of 10 million tons.  Quite clearly they are carrying through the misleading information.</P>
    <P>I asked today if the Minister knew, when he entered negotiations, about the false statements they were issuing to the Vancouver Stock Exchange.  He appeared to indicate today that he knew but was not holding it as any obstruction in the way of granting licences.  Further, I asked the Minister today and I repeat the question here tonight, if he knew that another company called Boulder Mountain Resources Ltd. operated by Mr. Reid, who was the president of Amble Resources, had their dealings suspended by the Vancouver Stock Exchange last year.  Clearly this information is available to anybody who wants to look around the Vancouver Stock Exchange and public releases in Canada because those were public statements issued.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to clarify that <Col N="1830" /> at some subsequent date he became aware of and contacted Amble Resources Ltd. to clarify the position.  They say in a news release of 29 January 1986:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy is giving active consideration to an application by Amble Resources Limited for a prospecting licence in relation to a fourth area...</P>
    <P>Quite clearly licences for the three areas had been issued before 29 January.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us tonight when they were issued and what information was available to him when he issued them.  If the information I have read out here tonight was available to him, I suggest to him that it raises a serious question as to why they should have been given licences in the first place.</P>
    <P>No company should use the good name and reputation of the Department of Energy to try to convince people in Canada to invest money in this kind of proposition, giving wrong data and totally misleading information.  Does the Minister accept and agree with that?  If he does, why did he issue the three licences and does he still propose to issue a fourth licence?  Only last Friday the Department said that the Minister's readiness to give prospecting licences to Amble Resources Limited and to agree in principle to the assignment to Amble Resources of the Rossmore leases implies that he does not see any grevious fault.  I ask the Minister to explain how it is not a grevious fault to issue false information, not once or twice but three times, to potential investors on the Vancouver Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult sometimes to know what is happening on that stock exchange so it is important that the Minister should be extremely careful when dealing with these companies.  Despite what the Minister tried to intimate here today, it is quite clear that Mr. Reid, with his other company Boulder Mountain Resources, were suspended from the stock exchange. It also appears that the Vancouver Stock Exchange are interested in talking to Mr. Reid about the inaccuracies which occurred <Col N="1831" /> in these statements.  The Minister must now clear the matter once and for all and, if he does not, people will think that this country can be used to set up that type of deal and lure investments from Canada.  That will not do the Minister, me, this House, the country or the Department any good.  The company have issued statements such as the following:</P>
    <P>The leases have been confirmed by the Irish Government agencies and are in the possession of Amble Resources.</P>
    <P>That is an extract from a statement of December 19.  The Minister knows it is wrong and so do I.  What did he do about it?  Why did he issue licences to a company like this?  If he did not know the facts, why not?  If he did, perhaps he will explain why he continues to try to oppose the real facts of the situation which are available to anybody.</P>
    <P>There are other inaccuracies in the statement in relation to the amount of waste available in two of the early press releases.  These refer to a very considerable amount of waste which could be used in briquette manufacturing.  The Minister knows that there is no waste available in that part of the Leinster coalfield.  The waste that is available and could possibly be used for manufacturing coal briquettes is in other areas and belongs to a different company.  That clearly establishes that the company were trying to puff up the case to try to convince would-be investors.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister met Mr. Reid and perhaps other officials in the past week or so.  Perhaps he will clarify how he managed to give licences to this man, in view of the facts.  If the Minister does not know all the facts, I shall be only too glad to give them to him.  It is very curious that he sought during Question Time in the House to explain that a writ may be issued to stop any further discussion on this matter.  How would the Minister know that unless the Government are going to issue one?  If it is a second or third party writ, how could the Minister use that phraseology in this <Col N="1832" /> House?  Those are unanswered questions. The Minister has five minutes of uninterrupted time to clear the air and I hope he avails of it.  If he does not, that will raise more serious questions which will have to be confronted at a future date.  If it is a Government writ, I would be glad to hear it, but if not, the Minister should beware.  This could be his Westland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy opposite is very well informed.  I wonder about the source of his information.  I want to put this matter in perspective. We are talking about a mine in Rossmore which employs 52 people and is in serious financial difficulties.  A company called Amble Resources Ltd. became interested in acquiring the mining rights to this company and approached my Department.  Having considered the matter and with a view to ensuring that mining would continue in Rossmore, County Carlow, and with a view to ensuring that the 52 jobs would be preserved, I gave a conditional approval to the transfer of the mining lease from Cliffbourn to Amble Resources Ltd. That is a responsible thing to do and in the best interests of the workers and of ensuring continued mining in Rossmore.</P>
      <P>I am quite surprised by the attack launched by the Deputy opposite on proposed investment in the mining company in Ireland. We made diligent inquiries about allegations made against the firm in question, even to the point of consulting the Vancouver Stock Exchange.  As far as we can ascertain, there is no reason why they should not get the facilities that they have asked for to keep the mining project going and in relation to the prospecting licences that they should not be allowed a licence to prospect for further coal reserves in the area.  I cannot refrain from saying that in the normal course we in this House always make a point of welcoming investment, whether from Irish or foreign sources, especially in the circumstances which apply in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the people in Rossmore will <Col N="1833" /> take note of the unwarranted attack made by Deputy Reynolds on the new investors in their area.  We do not denigrate people or turn them away when we are satisfied that there are no good reasons for doing so, as I am satisfied in this case.</P>
    <P>What would happen to the efforts of the IDA and other development agencies if their clients were to be made the subject of such free for all abuse in this House or elsewhere at what appears to be the instigation of business competitors who are also being considered for mining facilities by the Department and who have no grounds for complaint at the way they have been dealt with.</P>
    <P>In relation to the statement issued by the company on the Vancouver Stock Exchange, I was not pleased with them and asked for a correcting statement to be issued by Amble Resources Ltd.  They freely issued such a statement to the stock exchange, with approval of the wording by my Department.</P>

      <P>If I may be allowed to continue, this is a technical word.  We understand that the &ldquo;halting&rdquo; is due to new information becoming available on the company's property which could be material to the share value of the company, probably in a beneficial way.  The purpose of the &ldquo;halting&rdquo; was to enable information on drilling results to be provided to brokers and so forth in accordance with stock exchange requirements. That is the manner in which they deal with their stocks on the Vancouver Stock Exchange.  I have been informed that this procedure is not out of the way.  It is simply as a result of new drilling information becoming available which may benefit the company.</P>

      <P>The Estimates provision of £13 million for bread subsidy for 1986 allows for a reduction of 4p in the rate of subsidy on the standard 800 gram loaf from 6 April 1986 and <i>pro rata</i> on other sizes.  The effect on consumer price levels will depend on the extent to which bakers recover the reduction in subsidy by way of price increases.  As the Deputy may be aware, the retail market for bread is extremely competitive with wide variations in the prices at which bread is available to consumers.</P>

      <P>On 28 January 1986 road grant allocations for 1986 totalling £159.7 million were notified to local authorities generally.  This represents an increase of 4 per cent relative to the record 1985 level of grants.  Paragraph 8 of the general memorandum accompanying the grant notifications indicated that &ldquo;Local authorities should try to maintain the level of employment of regular road workers and to avoid major fluctuations in the numbers employed throughout the year as far as possible&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The grant allocation to Laois County Council this year is £2,100,000 as compared with an initial allocation of £2,165,000 last year.  Figures are not at present available in my Department as to estimated road expenditure by the local authority from its own resources in 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to allocate any additional road grants to any local authority because the funds available in 1986 have been fully allocated.  My Department is monitoring progress on grant aided works during 1986.  If it should appear later this year that the <Col N="1710" /> grant allocated to a local authority will not be required in full in 1986, the authority will be consulted and any possible savings will be re-allocated to other authorities which require the additional funds and can spend the money involved this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The management of waste disposal operations in each area is the responsibility of the county council and county borough corporation concerned. Accordingly, decisions as to the methods and places of disposal of waste in County Dublin are a matter for Dublin County Council.  My role extends mainly to providing an appropriate framework of legislation and regulations for local authorities in the discharge of their functions in relation to waste.  I have no power to direct that any waste or any particular kind of waste should be accepted for disposal at any particular location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until recently, considerable quantities of asbestos waste were exported to the United Kingdom for landfill disposal. <Col N="1712" /> This outlet is, however, no longer available and I have brought to the attention of local authorities the urgent need to provide landfill facilities for the controlled disposal of such quantities of these wastes as arise in their areas.  Failure by local authorities to provide the necessary facilities could seriously prejudice trading and employment prospects in the construction and other industries and expose both public health and the environment to unnecessary risks.  Landfilling, either on specialised sites or in conjunction with domestic waste, is the internationally accepted method for disposing of asbestos waste.  I am assured that, subject to the observance of the appropriate precautions, there is no reason why such waste should not be accepted and disposed of on landfill sites.</P>

Payment was issued on her claim from 17 March 1980 to 21 August 1982, at half the single rate of disability benefit as she was in receipt of unmarried mother's allowance.  Her unmarried mother's allowance claim was disallowed as she had no child residing with her.  An overpayment of £1,463.55 was assessed in respect of unmarried mother's allowance paid from 2 July 1981 to 14 April 1982. Her disability benefit claim was authorised at the full single rate from 2 July 1981. Arrears of disability benefit of £795. 14 in respect of the period from 2 July 1981 to 21 August 1982 were withheld to be offset against the overpayment of unmarried mother allowance, leaving an outstanding overpayment of £668.41.</P>

      <P>The arrears of disability benefit payable to the person concerned <Col N="1717" /> were issued to him on 15 January 1986. He is not entitled to pay-related benefit as the amount of disability benefit payable in his case exceeds 75 per cent of his average reckonable weekly earnings in the 1983-84 tax year which governs his claim.  All benefit payable in respect of his claim has been issued to 29 January 1986, the date of the latest medical certificate received.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to pay-related benefit with flat rate unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that the weekly sum of pay-related benefit, flat rate unemployment benefit and income tax rebate may not exceed 85 per cent of the net average weekly earnings of a claimant.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 22 August 1985 and payment of flat rate unemployment benefit has been made at the weekly rate of £138.90, being the maximum rate appropriate to a married man with nine child dependants.  According to the Department's records, he is entitled to an income tax rebate of £36.91 weekly. The 85 per cent limit appropriate in his case has been calculated at £176.69 and as the combined total of flat rate unemployment benefit and income tax rebate amount to £175.81, the pay-related benefit to which he is entitled is limited to 88p.  Further combined weekly payments of £139.78 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>Eligibility for aid under the feed voucher scheme was assessed on the basis of the number of livestock and the amount of fodder on applicants' farms at the time of application.  The entitlement of the person concerned to aid under the scheme was calculated on the basis of the information on livestock numbers and fodder stocks declared on his application form.  The scheme was designed to provide assistance to farmers to enable them to purchase feed for their cattle over the winter and it was not intended to fully compensate for losses incurred as a result of the poor weather last summer and autumn.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the new services under advertising and publicity for 1986 estimated to cost £403,000 (A5) versus £310,000 (1985); and the cutbacks in services which will take place under A6 consultative councils, inquiries and reports due to the financial cuts from £73,000 in the 1985 Estimate to £39,000 in the 1986 Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1985 provision for subhead A5 (advertising and publicity) was £375,000 but the provisional outturn of expenditure is £310,000.  The underspending against the provision arose from a lower level of TV advertising than had been anticipated.  The 1986 estimate of £403,000 is based on the normal pattern of advertising and publicity activities for recent years with allowances being made for price increases and inflation where appropriate.</P>
      <P>The reduction in subhead A6 &mdash; consultative councils, inquiries and reports &mdash;for 1986 arises mainly from the fact that expenditure in respect of the Commission of Inquiry into the Thoroughbred Horse Industry will be greatly reduced this year.</P>

      <P>The amount of £61,000 is the actual expenditure in 1985 which was lower than expected due to delay in the recruitment of officers.  The 1986 provision of £135,000 is to cover the cost of the normal full complement of three officers employed under the scheme.</P>

      <P>The higher education grants scheme is administered by the local authorities (county councils and county borough corporations). It is understood from the local authority administering the scheme in the area of the student concerned that, although the annual rate of gross parental income has decreased in the present financial year, such annual rate still exceeds the relevant income limit prescribed in the grants scheme for 1985. Accordingly, the student continues to be ineligible for a grant on grounds of means.</P>

      <P>In the unabridged 1986 Estimates volume to be published shortly, a total provision of £5.332 million is being indicated for the employment incentive scheme &mdash; £1.832 million under subhead P (employment incentive scheme) and £3.5 million under subhead T (grant-in-aid fund for training and employment of young persons).  In addition a sum of £0.306 million will be made available from the employment guarantee fund.</P>
      <P>The total provision for 1986 is therefore £5.638 million, equivalent to an increase of £1.388 million or 33 per cent on the 1985 provision.</P>
