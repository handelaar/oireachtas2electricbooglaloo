    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture further to the concession which he granted to herdowners in disadvantaged areas, that is, that cattle disposed of direct to meat factories and sold through marts by herdowners prior to inspection for cattle headage schemes be included in the cattle headage subsidy scheme, if he will extend this concession as well to herdowners in disadvantaged areas who sold their animals direct to registered butchers on presentation of slaughtering certificates from the butcher for the animals concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Departmental officers working at marts and meat factories are in a position to verify particulars of any cattle sold or slaughtered at these premises.  It is not possible to <Col N="2456" /> apply the same level of control at registered butchers' premises and for this reason I regret that the concession cannot be extended to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West)</i>: Has the Minister any proposals in his Department to alter that situation and to ensure that there would be monitoring at slaughtering houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that two years ago I brought forward this proposal to help people with the condition that farmers would not have to hold on to their cattle until the read would take place.  This was acknowledged as being a very important factor in helping to offload cattle onto the market without creating a glut in the autumn as they used to have to.  This is the second year of this scheme.</P>
      <P>One problem in extending the matter further is that we have about 30 meat factories for beef, we have 121 marts, and the Deputy is only too well aware that those are staffed by officers of my Department all the time.  That is part of the operation.  The trouble is that we have well over 1,000, perhaps 1,200, butchers registered for levy purposes up and down the country and that would place an enormous strain from an inspection point of view.  At the moment I cannot accept that the problem warrants that type of programme.</P>

      <P>There are about 1.4 million tonnes of surplus butter in intervention storage, about 5 per cent of which is more than three years old and 21 per cent more than two years old.  So far as I am aware none of the stock is rancid and inedible but the oldest stocks are more suitable for processing rather than for direct consumption.  The high volume of stocks is a cause for concern and I have been pressing the Commission for the introduction of further effective disposal measures in order to restore the stock level to manageable proportions with minimum disruption of normal market activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 11, 16, 20, 22, 32 and 158 together.</P>
      <P>Under the exchange rate guarantee scheme the Government have provided £200 million in EMS currencies for lending to full time farmers and private peat producers who are in severe financial difficulty as a result of adverse weather conditions in 1985 and 1986.  The loans are being made available at an exceptional interest rate of around 5½ per cent for working capital purposes and for restructuring the existing debt of farmers who are in severe financial difficulties directly as a result of the adverse weather conditions in 1985 and 1986.  It is understood that £80 million has been credited to farmers' accounts to date and the rate of draw downs is in the region of £15 million per week.  The scheme is operated by the four associated banks and the ACC.  Applications may be made to any branch office of these institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the total funds available, a minimum of £65 million has been reserved for new working capital requirements of those farmers covered by the scheme initiated on 1 June last, i.e., dairy farmers with quotas of less than 25,000 gallons, pig producers, winter beef producers and <Col N="2467" /> cereal growers, as well as for other categories of farmers who are in severe financial difficulties because of weather conditions.  In the case of greatest hardship, loans of up to £50,000 will be granted and there will normally be a qualifying minimum debt of £4,000.  It is a matter for individual applicants to establish their eligibility for benefit with the lending institution concerned, which can provide them with the full details of the scheme.</P>
    <P>A second exchange rate guarantee scheme of loans of up to £35 million in EMS currencies is being provided by the Government for on-lending to farmers for new development purposes.  The purposes of this scheme include development of non-surplus products such as sheep, protein crops and vegetables; farming activities which, although non land using, can supplement income and provide employment for farm families; diversification into &ldquo;minority&rdquo; activities, e.g., horses &mdash; hunters and ponies &mdash; or deer farming.</P>
    <P>The terms and conditions of these schemes have been drawn up so as to ensure that the funds are allocated to those most in need of low interest capital in order to maintain their contribution to agricultural output and income.  The question of any amendments to these terms and conditions or of any change in the amount available will be considered in the light of experience in the operation of these schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that if this narrow category are excluded from <Col N="2468" /> the scheme they will be severely discriminated against, bearing in mind the crisis in the glasshouse industry?  They should have been one of the first categories to be included in the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that, after two of the worst years in living memory, a subsidised loan is of little use to agriculture?  The sum £200 million represents about 13 per cent of farmers' borrowings from the bank or the ACC.  It is an insult to the farmers.  Would the Minister consider extending the scheme for at least five years to give hope to farmers and to help them to get off their knees?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that it is an insult to farmers as it has been very much welcomed by farmers with whom I have been in contact.  Indeed, they are availing of the scheme on a daily basis and it has proved to be an enormous help to them, not merely to pay off some of their debts but to make provision for the coming year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will amend the farm improvement programme to ensure that farmers finding it necessary to re-adjust their uncompleted proposals under the farm modernisation western package or western drainage schemes, will not be deterred from proceeding with new or adjusted proposals under the farm improvement programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The completion of a development plan taken out under the farm modernisation scheme (FMS) is one of the main conditions of Directive 72/159 on which the scheme was based.  Failure to complete a development plan would result in the development farmer losing entitlement to grant aid under the plan and make him liable to repay any grants already received.  Any EC moneys received for investments carried out <Col N="2473" /> under the plan would also have to be refunded by the State.</P>
      <P>However, I am looking into the possibility of allowing farmers to participate in the farm improvement programme who have effectively completed their FMS development plans even though the plans have still some time to run.</P>
      <P>The same position applies under the programme for western development in relation to plans taken out under the orientation of agriculture production scheme.  Farmers who carry out work under the western drainage scheme are not affected as they are not required to take out a farm plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very disappointing news.  The Minister is still considering changing the scheme even though he has been requested very often to do so.  Would the Minister agree that because of the super-levy and the disease levy, particularly the money available for reactors, farmers have been the victims of super-levy quotas, have been suffering animal loss and have to readjust their farm patterns?  As a result, they cannot complete the development programme which they entered into originally.  Would the Minister consider amending the scheme so that they do not have to complete the old scheme and would he allow them to proceed with the new adjusted scheme?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is well aware in any new national scheme which is undertaken, such as the farm improvement scheme which I introduced earlier this year, it takes a certain length of time for all the little warts to be ironed out.

      <P>What is wrong with you guys is that the scheme is working too well.  As can be seen from the applications at the FDS offices around the country there is a live subsidy on the farm improvement programme.  For the information of the Deputies, to come back to a technical point, there is no need for plans under the western drainage scheme.  I am looking at a number of points <i>vis-à-vis</i> where a farmer was involved in the farm modernisation scheme in order to see what can be done to allow him to take part in the farm improvement programme.  There are a number of points currently under review and I hope to make an announcement shortly about some of them.  Some cannot be changed but some can.</P>

      <P>I should like to make it clear that all part-time farmers are not debarred.  The scheme operates on a 50 per cent time and income basis. Deputies will be aware that in most cases the income of the spouse is not taken into consideration.  The people over 55 years of age who were debarred heretofore are now entitled to apply for and get their grants.  Those criteria are very important as far as the west of Ireland is concerned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 162 together.  The EC Commission have indicated that they consider certain aspects of the operations of the Dublin and Cork milk boards contrary to the principle of the common organisation of the market in milk and to the Treaty of Rome.  My Department have responded that these arrangements are necessary and justified in view of our highly seasonal pattern of milk production. However, without prejudice to this view and having consulted with the trade interests involved, the Department have furnished to the Commission an outline of alternative arrangements which might be more acceptable to them.  Discussions on the details involved are expected to take place shortly between Commission representatives and Department officials.</P>
      <P>Legislation to repeal or amend the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Acts, 1936 and 1941 will be necessary to give effect to the new arrangements.</P>

It would be in the interests of the milk suppliers and, indeed, the householders that a satisfactory solution acceptable to the EC would be found.  One of the problems I could foresee in the future would be that if the chaos which seemed to be looming came about door-to-door sales of milk might be discontinued in certain areas and there might be a massive drop in milk consumption.  I am happy that our Department and the Commission are in close discussion at the moment and I hope a satisfactory solution will be found quickly.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will indicate in respect of a recent 12 month period, the extent to which butter consumption in this country has fallen compared with the immediately preceding 12 month period; the reasons for the drop in consumption; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Sales of butter for direct human consumption in the period July 1985 to June 1986, the most recent 12 month period for which definite figures are available, have fallen by 22 per cent or approximately 7,700 tonnes compared with the immediately preceding 12 month period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This fall in consumption is due to a number of factors including changing <Col N="2487" /> consumer tastes and the emergence of newly developed spreads on the market.</P>
    <P>While I am concerned at this decline in consumption it is primarily a matter for the dairy industry itself to ensure that the market for butter is maintained.  The National Dairy Council who are responsible for promoting the sale of butter on the home market have recently launched a major new promotion and publicity campaign to improve the position of butter.  It is hoped that this and recent technical innovations which have improved the spreadability of butter will lead to a reversal of the downward trend in consumption levels.</P>

      <P>I attended the launch of the NDC promotion campaign, together with Deputy Walsh.  We were impressed with the programme they have in mind which would involve quite a lot of publicity, including some television publicity, on the wholesomeness of butter.  It is true that there has been a fairly powerful campaign against butter.  With the current emphasis on health foods and pure foods, it should be stressed that butter is a pure, natural food.  That would be the most positive way to conduct a campaign. The spreadability factor was overplayed in relation to some of the spreads.  The spreadabilty problems of butter can be overcome very simply and this will be demonstrated during the next few weeks</P>

        <i>(Limerick West)</i> asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will make a statement on the report of the Committee on Public Expenditure on bovine tuberculosis eradication and on the admission he made in a television programme that funds are inadequate to a point where the scheme cannot function satisfactorily; if the Government propose to allocate adequate funds to the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Dáil Committee on Public Expenditure on the TB scheme, which was received on 5 November, is under study in my Department. A detailed response to the various points raised in the report will be made when it comes before the House for debate.</P>
      <P>While I welcome constructive criticism of the TB eradication programme I feel that in some respects the report may not have taken full account of the complexities and practical difficulties associated with eradication of the disease. There are also important errors of fact in the report.</P>
      <P>For example there is no basis whatsoever for the suggestion, underpinning important conclusions in the report, that my Department adjust the interpretation of tests to reflect the financial situation at any particular time.  I should also like to assure herdowners that the existing test, when properly used, is fully capable of identifying reactor animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central recommendation of the report, that a new scheme should be drawn up with guaranteed funding over five years and implemented by an executive agency, has many implications which will require careful consideration.  The report did not of course identify the extent of the funding required, and it is possible that some of its recommendations may well involve substantial <Col N="2490" /> additional expenditure.  As the Minister stated on television, it is a matter of regret that the allocation for disease eradication in 1986, which was necessarily limited because of the budgetary situation, did not allow us to undertake the volume of testing we would have wished.  Despite the very substantial costs of operating the scheme, every effort will be made to find the necessary resources for an expanded disease eradication programme in 1987.</P>

The Minister will be aware of a recent television programme which showed that in County Longford the incidence of TB is rising continually and now stands at about 12 per cent.  Does the Minister agree that what is occurring in Longford and in many other counties is a result of the stop-go policy adopted by this Government in regard to funding and that inconsistent testing is the cause of the widespread incidence of bovine TB?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 156 together.  Against the background of a serious imbalance in the milk sector, rapidly rising stocks and a critical budgetary situation, the EC Commission has recently made proposals to weaken the effectiveness of the Community's intervention mechanism, to cut the overall level of milk quotas and to apply the quota system more rigorously. While it is clearly in our interests that the problems of the milk sector be solved as rapidly as possible, I have made it clear that the present package as a whole is not acceptable to us.  In the negotiations I will be seeking to ensure that the Irish quota is not reduced on a permanent basis.</P>

Is he further aware that we are the only country who are under quota this year?  It is outrageous for the Minister to have suggested in recent public statements that in some way we should contribute to the lessening of this quota.

      <P>Of course I am satisfied. The Minister has been arguing that case, and Members are inclined to forget his success in this area.  During the negotiations on this scheme the vast majority of the Council made it clear in the most blunt terms possible that, in the light of the worsening milk situation and political difficulties which our 1984 deal created for other member states, they would not agree to any derogation for Ireland on this issue.  The choice was between trying to block this proposal which, if successful, would have blocked the whole price package and would have led to draconian action by the Commission aimed at reducing prices, or accepting it in the context of an otherwise favourable package. The latter was the only realistic option.  The scheme which was agreed provided that national quotas will be reduced by 2 per cent from 1 April 1987 and by a further 1 per cent from April 1988.</P>

I want to suggest that the appropriate way to deal with this is for the Government to give a reasonable amount of time to take this Bill.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Any Bill that is designed to improve services to the public is a welcome Bill.  This Bill is intended to streamline CIE to make the company profitable or, should I say, less costly to the taxpayer and more efficient.  With these aims I concur fully.  However, I do not agree with some of the detail of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since their establishment on 1 January 1945 CIE have served the country well. <Col N="2583" /> Without their existence many of the rural areas would have been cut off because no private enterprise would have operated a transport system at a loss.  In 1963 the &ldquo;pacemaker&rdquo; report stated that in a demand sector services can be provided at a satisfactory profit and in a need sector services cannot be provided at a satisfactory profit but that this lack of profit does not necessarily define the need sector.  That report went on to state that public transport which caters for the need sector cannot recover the costs from the demand sector and so must be subsidised. Twenty three years later the need for subsidisation is still necessary.  I would like to see the need sector defined in detail, as the Minister said, to make it transparent, not for the purpose of weeding out the need sectors or of closing them down but for the purpose of identifying public accountability.  In this day and age of computers and computerisation the information necessary to do that should be accessible.  It is important that Members of this House are given full and detailed information in relation to the expenditure of moneys collected from the tax paying public.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that under new measures introduced in June 1983 the Government devised a new basis for determining the CIE subvention which now limits it effectively to one-third of the board's expenditure.  This is not the complete picture because the subvention the Minister spoke of excludes payments made to CIE for the use of school buses, for travel by old age pensioners, for travel by members of the Defence Forces and of the old IRA.  These categories are paid for by the relevant Departments and the payments are treated as ordinary receipts by CIE.  For the purpose of full disclosure of the social element those payments mentioned above should be identified and included with the subvention. Such identification would enable a judgment to be made on the economic performance of CIE.</P>
    <P>Cross-subsidisation is an important issue because of the imbalances in our <Col N="2584" /> society, not least of which is the geographical issue.  Most services are financed, to one extent or another, on the principle of cross-subsidisation.  For example, posting a letter from Dublin to Dún Laoghaire costs the same as posting a letter from Dublin to Ballydehob, even though the costs incurred differ considerably. There is an acceptance of cross-subsidisation in most services. There is no reason the same should not apply to the transport field.</P>
    <P>From the results of CIE over many years, the scope for cross-subsidisation was just not there.  But there is a market where a profit should be attainable because the customers are there.  That market is in the Dublin or the greater Dublin area where one-third of the population live.  It is up to management to devise systems and organise themselves to ensure that they get the passengers they should get &mdash; and the passengers are there to be got if the proper service were given to them.</P>
    <P>Since 1980 the number of people travelling by public transport in Dublin has dropped from 175 million in 1980 to 137 million up to 2 November 1985.  That is a disturbing trend and will require a great effort on the part of management and staff to reverse it.  However, the ratio between the operating expenditure and customer receipts has improved from 1.23 to 1.21 from 1984 to 1985, and I look forward to seeing the figures for 1986 to see if the trend of improvement here is continuing.</P>
    <P>One of the new companies is to be named Dublin Bus.  Dublin City Services has operated autonomously over the years and the problems of reorganising it into a separate company should not be as great as those facing the reorganisation of the railway company and the provincial bus company.  Despite this the unions say that it will take up to two years to get Dublin City Services transferred and reorganised and working efficiently under the new company.  If this is true the problems to be faced in reorganising the national bus company and the rail company would take a considerably longer period to sort out.  Maybe it would <Col N="2585" /> be wise to delay their break up to allow difficulties experienced in the reorganisation of the Dublin City Services to be assessed.</P>
    <P>From discussions which I have had with employees of CIE down the country, I gather they are not too favourable towards the break up of the National Bus Company and the rail company.  Having studied submissions I feel it would be better if we did not split the rail side from the provincial bus services.</P>
    <P>Road passenger services feed into mainline rail services and <i>vice versa</i>, and this co-ordination was one of the company's principal attractions.  There are many examples of district managers, clerical, supervisory and operative staff attached to rail who have a direct involvement in road passenger services, and it is also a fact that in quite a number of provincial locations, control points, booking offices and other office accommodation and equipment are shared by road passenger and rail operative staff on the same premises.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, the same situation exists in relation to existing maintenance services provided by various provincial garages, and the division of all these services may cause great problems. Fear has been expressed with regard to the break up as to the effect of competition between rail and road.  Besides the internal difficulties already mentioned, empire builders or gloryseekers in one or other of the new companies could lead to the demise of the other.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that the parent board will adjudicate between rail and bus in the event of differences, but this would defeat the purpose of the Bill as I believe there will be many differences and the board will be continually involved in sorting out these differences.  The purpose of the Bill, maximisation of profit and efficiency, will be neglected by the board whose main function is, after all, comparing and reviewing general policy and organising finances.</P>
    <P>With possible duplication of services it is difficult to see how the new organisation would not result in raising instead of reducing the costs for the companies. <Col N="2586" /> I would like the Minister to explain how outright competition between the two companies will not damage one or other of the companies.  It is very difficult to comprehend how two organisations that have worked together and are then put at each others' throats will not damage one another.  The fear and suspicion of the workers is that the rail company will be damaged.  According to the Green Paper published in October 1985, the Government decided to retain the railways in the medium term and said that the breathing space provided by this decision would allow time to consider whether the existing railway network should be retained in the long term, whether retention should be on the basis of a reduced railway network or whether it should eventually be closed down and that the retention of a railway network would be dependent on continuing support from the Exchequer, and that the trade off between the costs and benefits of these alternative strategies was a matter which it was hoped the publication of that Green Paper would cause to be debated further.</P>
    <P>The White Paper is not out yet but from that statement the staff in the railway company are worried, and I do not blame them.  There are 6,800 people employed in the rail section.  From what I have been told the Transport Salaried Staff Association, representing mostly management, would find no great difficulty in dealing with the two companies rather than with three, that is, a joint rail and provincial bus service on the one hand and the city service on the other hand.  I would like to hear the Minister's comments, as it seems the Minister is the only one favouring three companies. The unions also hold that two companies would be the most sensible approach in the reorganisation of CIE.</P>
    <P>At present there is a need for the renewal of the school bus fleet.  It is most important to do something on this level as many of the buses carrying the children are draughty and not in a fit condition to carry children in.  Great concern has been expressed about the condition of the bus fleets throughout the country.  There is <Col N="2587" /> need for renewal of the school bus fleet, and this is very important.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us if he has any plans to re-activate the business of bus building here &mdash; I refer not only to school buses but those in general use as well as those for tours.  It would be of benefit to the country if the Minister would organise and set up a company to produce buses. Another field in which production would be useful is the training of apprentices. Many young apprentices got training in CIE during the years and that was of great benefit to the company.  I hope that under the new regime this role will be continued by CIE.</P>
    <P>The capital invested in the new coaches for the inter city trains and the continuous welded rail for smoother riding on trains have made a tremendous contribution to the reputation of CIE and I have no doubt this will ensure increased numbers of happy customers.  I am glad also to know that rail safety has been further improved by the extension of train radio to the total locomotive fleet and the installation of a continuous automatic warning system throughout the whole of the area covered by the new electronic central traffic system operated from Connolly Station. This has been extended over a large area of the national network.</P>
    <P>In the financial summary on page 3 of CIE's Annual Report for 1985 we find that the profit/deficit position changed dramatically between 1981 and 1985.  In 1981 there was a deficit of £9.45 million, in 1982, £13.423 million, 1983, £20.622 million, 1984, £.004 million, and in 1985 there was a profit of £6.79 million.  Of course, we should not allow ourselves to jump over the moon in ecstasy over the 1985 figure because there was an extraordinary item of £3 million in Government grant and exchange rate benefits. Despite that, the 1985 trend is encouraging.</P>
    <P>On page 10 of the report we see comparisons of ratios <i>vis-à-vis</i> operating expenditure and customer receipts.  The ratio has improved from 1:43 in 1984 to 1:39 in 1985.  A similar trend is noticeable <Col N="2588" /> in all sections &mdash; there has been an improvement in the operating expenditure compared with customer receipts. It is good to see this and I sincerely hope it will continue.</P>
    <P>The Minister's argument that because we will have smaller units of management industrial relation will be better and more efficient does not hold up, particularly because there will be new competition. He has not given any basis for his argument. Difficulties might be caused because there is bound to be cross competition between the railways and the provincial bus services.  It may take a long time to sort out the problems between those two companies if the Minister goes ahead with his present plans to break up CIE.  The Minister should change his mind and keep the rail and provincial bus services under one roof.  The Minister does not know whether the result of breaking up will be better services than at the moment.  The real competition for CIE is from private motorists and coach owners who have forced a rethink on marketing in CIE.  The Minister should tell us if he intends to introduce legislation with regard to private coach people.  Each weekend coaches carrying young people from Dublin to the four corners of Ireland are evident by the score.  Even during weekdays private coaches are bringing people to and from Dublin at cheap fares.  They may have made CIE more competitive and I hope CIE will be able to fight them, but not at the expense of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the three companies being set up by the Bill will be subject to the Companies Act, yet still be under the control of the CIE board, a statutory company.  I should like the Minister to explain in detail the reason for this.  Even though he has tried to set people's minds at ease in regard to possible liquidation, that it will be up to the holding company to liquidate and that none of the three companies could engage in voluntary liquidation, what would be the position if the creditors tried to liquidate one of the companies?  Will the Minister explain the implications of that?</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister not consider it <Col N="2589" /> feasible to reorganise CIE under a two-tier system and why should there not have been internal reorganisation?  In his opening speech the Minister did not clarify any of these matters.  He did not explain why three companies under a holding company should be the way in future for CIE?  Why did the Minister rule out other proposals before him?</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that great progress has been made in the road freight sector. That service for many years had not been a successful operation for CIE but there has been a turn about in the past few years.  I am sure the new managements in CIE will put new spirit into the company. Such a spirit was evident in the 1985 report.  I hope that anything the Minister will do will not deter that progress.  Going on his record, the Minister has not got a Midas touch and I hope he will keep his hands off CIE in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not often we get an opportunity under the Standing Orders of this House to discuss semi-State bodies. Dáil questions on the matter are disallowed and I appreciate that.  In this debate people and the Minister especially have tended to focus on the nuts and bolts of CIE without looking at the facts and the historical reality that ever since 1945 our whole transport policy has been based on propping up CIE, ensuring that they are protected by having a monopoly and refusing people in the private sector licences to haul and draw for charge because that might infringe on the position of CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like in this debate to touch on many issues.  The first I want to put firmly on the record is that CIE have lost more money than any other semi-State company in the history of the State.  Their record in that is second to none.  Above or below the line they have had an historical problem.  Second, the remarkable turning round in the fortunes of CIE since the arrival of Paul Conlon must be seen to be believed.  He deserves enormous credit in this House not only for his work in NET but also for his remarkable achievement in the turnaround in CIE's balance sheet, as Deputy Ahern said.  Apart from the <Col N="2590" /> hiccough of 1983 when they had a loss of £20 million he has moved from a loss of £10 million to a profit of £6.7 million.</P>
    <P>However, at times like this when we are talking about breaking up into three companies one must examine and scrutinise closely what is happening in relation to the balance sheet and to cross-subsidisation between different companies and the apportioning of capital assets to the different companies.  Perhaps the Minister when replying on Second Stage will tell us how the assets are to be apportioned in each direction and how liabilities are to be apportioned in the deficit carry-over to each of the three companies in terms of total borrowings to date.  The policy in relation to CIE for the seventies was a disastrous failure and between the social cost and the economic loss over 12 years it succeeded in losing something in the region of £1 billion, which is remarkable by any standards.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn to one aspect which represented a major possibility of turning round transport policy, the McKinsey report of 1979.  Apart from what it had to say about the railways it was an excellent report.  It went off the rails on the railway, but some of the things that McKinsey set out are enshrined in this legislation and their origins can clearly be traced back to McKinsey who recommended the disestablishment of the current CIE structure into three companies along the lines now proposed.  One thing McKinsey said that is forgotten is that policy functions relating to national roads infrastructure and service functions should be in the Department of Communications.  That has been completely lost sight of.  Also, some of the pivotal and central role of the Department of Communications in relation to all public transport matters has been delegated to the board of CIE. More especially, the way McKinsey represented his report was in terms of the needs of the people who utilise the transport sector.  Now we are talking in terms of the transport sector being an end in itself.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect of transport in relation to freight is that haulage costs <Col N="2591" /> represent 10 per cent of total production costs.  The average speed of rural traffic on the Continent is 44 mph and in Ireland it is 22 mph.  McKinsey tried to put all of this in context and laid down clear areas where sectors of CIE should go into the private sector.  McKinsey suggested that portions of CIE's rural bus services and freight services should be undertaken by the private transport sector.  The consultants argued that the dominant role of CIE which has been enshrined in legislation and the extent of the board's autonomy were no longer appropriate given the greatly diminished share of the transport market which is now served by CIE and in particular the reduced role of the railway. I am quoting from a much maligned document <i>The Way Forward</i> which was produced by the last Government, not for what it says about CIE but in terms of stating the facts of what McKinsey said.  All of that is lost sight of in relation to the development of our transport policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his speech that reference to privatisation was simply a red herring in the debate.  I disagree with that.  He has too narrow a view of the issues at stake here.  I ask him, and more especially I ask the board of CIE who are pragmatic and commercial enough, to reduce CIE's borrowings by entering into new joint ventures.  This can be done with the three new companies proposed under the auspices of the parent company CIE. I envisage joint ventures in such areas as looking at uneconomic routes.  Let CIE specify the uneconomic routes and see if they can do business with private operations to supply the services.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you come from a rural constituency as I do.  Very often I talk to third level students and people working in Dublin who come home for weekends and invariably they say at one time or another that they find that private operators who are giving a service home are cheaper and have their buses full while CIE often have more buses empty and charge twice as much.  Essentially the rigidity and inflexibility in CIE are <Col N="2592" /> difficult to deal with because of the company's sheer size.  I welcome the proposals here for breaking the company into three companies, but there are new possibilities that the Government might not have the resources in terms of sanctioning new capital expenditure for CIE where joint ventures could play a role.</P>
    <P>We must realise there is not a constituency where private bus operators are not running buses for bingo or for one private need or another and the capital investment tied up in those buses is often under-utilised.  Similarly the capital investment in CIE buses is under-utilised. Surely there is common ground for CIE to enter into joint ventures &mdash; not entering into further borrowing, not incurring further deficits, not having the huge liabilities they have to face &mdash; to work together with the private sector.</P>
    <P>Another element of privatisation surely relates to school transport.  I see no reason why CIE should be involved in this especially when, outside the urban areas of Dublin, Cork and so on, the majority of school transport facilities are provided by private contractors.  The Department of Education should enter directly into negotiations and I do not see why CIE should have a role in it.</P>
    <P>I turn to industrial relations in CIE.  A matter of public interest is the ridicule as demonstrated in the many jokes we have heard in relation to the reliability or otherwise of CIE.  I am taking on board the point that over the past few years there has been a very rapid improvement in CIE's performance.  In regard to industrial relations, the record shows that in 1983 there were 31 stoppages, in 1984 there were 15 stoppages and in 1985 there were nine stoppages.  That is a significant improvement especially bearing in mind that in 1985 only two of the nine stoppages were for over a period of one day. What is absolutely extraordinary is that in 1985 just when things were getting better there were 2,343 meetings between unions and employer management representatives and rights commissioners. By any standards that is an extraordinary level of hours tied up in something unproductive, which does not <Col N="2593" /> improve either the service to the public or the financial performance of CIE.  I do not apportion blame more to one side that the other but it is extraordinary that we had so many meetings in one year on industrial relations and I hope that something can be done about it.</P>
    <P>From time to time Dublin Deputies have come into the House asking for Army involvement at times of friction.  A way in which we could improve industrial relations which has been successfully tried in the UK is to try employee share-holding in the three new public limited companies.  CIE employees should have an opportunity to buy shares in the company and in that way they would be more committed to their work.  The Government have embarked on a policy of equity capital raising of funds through the business expansion scheme and through other means in the private sector, so I do not see why transport should be any different.  I am concerned at the level of meetings taking place in relation to industrial disputes and this will have to be improved in the future.</P>
    <P>The railways are very important for a number of reasons.  If the Government spend of the order of £505 million between 1984 and 1987 on a national roads programme, that gives some insight into what a greater utilisation of the railways could mean in economic terms.  If there is less wear and tear on the roads and less expenditure in maintaining and improving the national primary route network, a greater argument could be made for the railways, leaving aside social issues.  In 1984 the deficit on the railways was £1.8 million.  This had improved to £0.3 million in 1985.  In 1984 customer receipts under the railways was £56.8 million and in 1985 it was £62.4 million. Not only do we have an improvement in sales throughout and greater occupancy of seats and profitability but an interesting study carried out by the Leeds University Research Unit between 1971 and 1981 showed that there had been a 60 per cent increase in the productivity of the railways and that in 1981 our railways <Col N="2594" /> were more efficient than the railway networks in the UK, France and Germany. That is a striking finding.</P>
    <P>The railways have been much maligned because they have never been marketed properly on the basis of attracting customers with cheaper fares as has been done on the buses.  If for instance one wanted to take a return ticket to Dublin from Enniscorthy by rail or by bus one invariably finds the bus cheaper.  It is possible to fiddle the figures and rearrange the accounting system to present a certain point of view as is being done by the ESB for instance in their efforts to close down power stations.  We need a greater commitment to the railway system.  That is the only aspect of the McKinsey report with which I disagree. I would ask both the Minister and the board of CIE to give a categoric guarantee that the railway line between Rosslare and Dublin and Rosslare and Waterford right on to Limerick will be safeguarded. I would like to hear what marketing efforts will be made to improve its performance. The closure of a number of railway stations such as Ferns in County Wexford and many others has improved its efficiency.  With a better marketing effort I hope the passenger railway line performance can be improved.</P>
    <P>The most striking development in the railways has been the development of DART which had a huge capital overrun but which will be seen to be successful although costly.  It carries thousands of passengers each day and the feeder bus system is coming on stream well.  I am not an expert on Dublin city but since we do not have an underground system such as they have in many other capitals, the system needs to be extended to improve its viability.</P>
    <P>There is change taking place in the transport and haulage sector, which is a substantial shift away from own account transport.  The Oireachtas joint committee did a study on the retail and distribution sector and we found that a lot of companies doing their own deliveries were getting out of the line of business because it was not profitable and there <Col N="2595" /> was not the flexibility to be had in contract work and because of various industrial relation problems.  I see a great opening here for CIE in terms of rail freight if they aggressively market their freight services and try to ensure that they can pick up own account facilities. In the same way as feeder buses have worked for rail passengers we need to put more thought into an equivalent for the freight system so that there will be more efficient door to door delivery.  Unless we do that, given the programme for the replacement of diesel rail cars, the railways will be in jeopardy.  It would be tragic to lose the railway and they could never be replaced given the cost of the network, not to speak of the carriages. Will the Minister give a solemn commitment on the future of the railways?  In terms of the <i>Building on Reality</i> four point financial target, in terms of deficits and overruns, the CIE rail sundries and road freight services were to be discontinued by 1 January of this year unless they proved profitable in 1984 and 1985, but the improvement has been such that their future has now been assured.  They have come through that test and it is time to develop them into a vibrant, efficient and professional service, especially in relation to freight.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a few scattered points in no particular order in relation to CIE. Their pensions are appallingly low.  Many of my constituents who have 40 or 50 years' service are on the minimal level.  I ask the Minister to ensure that in future &mdash; I doubt if anything can be done retrospectively &mdash; even if contributions have to be made on a private basis, the system will be improved.  A number of people in my constituency have been made redundant by CIE on the basis of disability. Relatively young people in their forties and fifties feel they still have something to contribute.</P>
    <P>Hardly a week passes without its being mentioned on radio or television that the Dublin-Belfast line is closed due to a bomb being planted on the line, or a bomb scare.  It is happening so often that <Col N="2596" /> something needs to be done about security to ensure that people using the service can rely on it, which is not the case at present.  I should also like the Minister to clarify the tax position of CIE in relation to excise duties, VAT on oil, the licence fees on vehicles and how they operate their insurance.  One way to ensure that CIE do well &mdash; if you look at it in narrow terms &mdash; is by imposing crippling taxation on the motorist.  This is the case when one considers that capital allowances are restricted to £3,500 when a realistic figure would be £12,000.  High levels of VAT and excise duties on petrol and vehicles could also ensure that people use CIE. There needs to be a far greater integration of where we stand exactly in relation to the pricing policy of CIE and taxation on motorists.  Perhaps the Minister will give us some idea of how CIE's taxes compare with the private motorist's.</P>
    <P>Another specific incidence, which has been a source of complaint in my constituency, is damage done to livestock which have been killed or injured on the railway line.  CIE have a reputation &mdash; I will put it no stronger than that &mdash; for denying any responsibility for these accidents. Many farmers lost substantial amounts of money and were involved in years of litigation which was never resolved satisfactorily.  I hope CIE will be much more flexible in relation to damage done to livestock because many farmers allow CIE personnel on their lands to service lines and so on.</P>
    <P>Rosslare Harbour is very close to my heart.  CIE are the port authority.  In 1844 the strategic value of Rosslare's geographical location as the nearest Irish port to Britain and the Continent was appreciated.  In the Brunel report at that time the chief engineer to the Great Western Railway Company in England mooted a ferry service from Wales to Rosslare which are only 54 miles apart. In 1869 the Rosslare Harbour Commissioners acquired a portion of the foreshore and seabed near Greenore Point for the purpose of constructing a harbour. On 17 August 1886 the Dublin-Wicklow-Wexford railway had reached Wexford and a Government loan of £75,000 was <Col N="2597" /> procured to build the harbour.  By an Act of Parliament in 1894 the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbour Company were formed under which the harbour commissioners were disbanded and the Waterford and Wexford railway was vested in the new consortium.</P>
    <P>In 1895 the company were authorised to operate steamships between Rosslare and Fishguard and in July 1906 the Rosslare-Fishguard route was officially inaugurated.  The port and its ships have seen many difficult times, especially during the war.  However, British Rail, now Sealink, have operated in the port since 1906.  In 1968 the French company, Normandy Ferries, with two ships introduced the first car ferry link between Rosslare and the Continent.  In 1971 this service ended but in 1973 ICL, a subsidiary of Irish Shipping, reopened the route with the St. Patrick.  In 1978 ICL purchased another boat, the Saint Killian and inaugurated a route between Rosslare and Cherbourg.  Under the Act of Parliament in 1894, Rosslare is owned jointly but CIE are the acting port authority.</P>
    <P>The growth of Rosslare over the past few years has been spectacular.  At a time when other ports, notably Dublin and Cork, were struggling to survive, Rosslare was making very rapid progress.  In 1973-78 there was growth in Dublin of 4 per cent in terms of net registered tonnage of shipping handled through the ports.  In Cork the growth over the same period was 22 per cent but in Rosslare the figure was a staggering 145 per cent.  In spite of itself Rosslare is the fastest growing port in Europe and this year handled in excess of one million passangers.  Therefore, Deputies from County Wexford have been anxious to do everything possible to facilitate the development of this Euro port and to see that it yielded its maximum potential.</P>
    <P>Rosslare is owned and operated by CIE who employ approximately 110 people in the port covering clerical, supervisory, operating, technical and catering functions. They also provide a comprehensive customs clearance service for import and export traffic seven days per week.  There <Col N="2598" /> is currently a £5 million development scheme to provide a covered mobile gangway.  A new car-coach customs clearance building has already been built and, as in Ringaskiddy, people will not get wet because it will be covered in.  There will be proper facilities instead of force ten gales blowing across the harbour.</P>
    <P>A source of great upset to Oireachtas Members in County Wexford is the fact that each year in the Book of Estimates under the public capital programme an allocation of either £500,000 or £750,000 is made to CIE to develop the terminal building or to obtain a particular hydraulic gangway.  There was the clear understanding with CIE that they would start their £7.5 million development plan in 1986.  Low and behold, despite a meeting, a few months ago between the Minister, Deputy Mitchell, Mr. Conlon, the Oireachtas Members for County Wexford and representatives of the Department and CIE, CIE did not seek any payment from the Department to bring forward these plans.  Now they are one year late.  There is a very strong feeling in Rosslare and in County Wexford that the county and the country would be a lot better off with CIE out of the port. Various reports have been produced.  The Rosslare Harbour Development Committee produced their own report called &ldquo;The Way Forward&rdquo; and a subsequent consultative study was carried out by the SKC group.  All these reports stated that CIE were not allowing the port to develop to its full potential.  They suggested that CIE should be asked to get out.</P>
    <P>It was agreed in <i>Building on Reality</i> that in the long term a new port authority would be set up and, on an interim basis, a local representative body would be established.  I would favour a SFADCo type development superimposed on CIE. Either way, urgent consideration has to be given to CIE's removal from the port. I have no objection whatsoever to their working in harmony with whatever port authority might be set up.  I do not believe they are giving Rosslare the priority it <Col N="2599" /> deserves in the context of their huge overall rail and bus operations nationally and in Dublin.  Given the fact that CIE are the biggest loss makers of all the semi-State bodies in the history of this State and given their chronic performance between 1972 and 1982, it is interesting to note that they made a net profit in Rosslare in 1985 of £1.3 million on a total revenue of £3.6 million and in 1982 they made a profit of £85,000, that is, after all, the debt service for all the previous developments including the second berth etc.</P>
    <P>There is acute disappointment that senior individuals in CIE have not expedited the final stages of the development plan for the port.  I ask the Minister to renew his commitment to establish a new port authority, to consider bringing separate legislation into this House to amend the 1842 Act, and to pay whatever compensation is necessary to CIE and to any other relevant companies so that a new developmental thrust can take place in Rosslare Harbour.</P>
    <P>When this Bill went through the Seanad a number of amendments were made to sections 24 to 26 which relate to the terms and conditions of employment of the employees of the three new companies. I welcome that.  I notice that no new names have been given to the companies. There are plenty of good PR companies around who could suggest heaps of good names.  I hope vibrant and professional marketing images are put forward for the new companies.  In 1983, when legislation was passed in this House to establish An Post and Bord Telecom, specific provision was made to set up a user's council in both companies.  I do not see any similar provision in this Bill.  If there is, the Minister can clarify the matter later.  Since we are dealing with an almost monopolistic public transport operation &mdash; DART alone carries 55,000 passengers per day &mdash; people are entitled to have a proper complaints service.  If a person's freight was not delivered in time someone should be on the line in terms of discipline.  If people find they get bad catering facilities on a railway journey, if <Col N="2600" /> they find buses are dirty and not well kept, and if a driver or conductor is rude their complaints should be dealt with in a proper structure.  The basic belief should be that the customer is always right.  The only way to survive in a competitive market is to compete.  CIE have been short on competition over the last decade or more, although that is changing also.  I would like to see the establishment, therefore, of a user's council in identical terms to the ones which exist in An Post and in Bord Telecom so that people will have the opportunity to complain. People should be encouraged to complain so that the quality and reliability of service would be improved all the time.</P>
    <P>With regard to the financing of CIE in the future, this has become very sophisticated as regards above the line and below the line.  A subsidy above the line is either 50 per cent of the revenue or one-third of the expenditure.  This has meant <i>de facto</i> that it is one-third of their expenditure.  That is the wrong way to go about it.  If you tell people you will subsidise them to the extent of a proportion of their expenditure, it gives them a straightforward incentive to increase their overheads given that one-third of expenditure is greater than 50 per cent of revenue.  The Minister should declare very firmly &mdash; and there should be all-party agreement on this &mdash; that by 1990 no further subsidy will be paid to the Dublin City Bus Company or to the National Bus Company.  A special case can be made for the railways on the basis of their independent economic role in terms of preserving our roadways and expediting our national through traffic, especially container traffic.  The Minister should stop the tinkering and by 1990 only the railways should receive a subsidy.  They should know clearly that will be their single term of reference.  They should doctor their finances in such a way, whether through joint venture or otherwise, as to bring that about.</P>
    <P>It concerns me that foreign operators have control of the market in the haulage of dangerous substances in this country. This is very worrying.  I see no good <Col N="2601" /> reason why Irish operators, be they CIE or private companies, should allow this to be the case.  The Minister should ask Paul Conlon and the board of CIE whether on the freight side they could develop a dangerous substances transport service.  It is a growing area; it has great potential and consequently has great export potential.  While dealing with specifics I would also like to see the dismantling of the area management structure as it is very costly.  McKinsey also recommended its dismantling.  It brings about duplication and extra overheads which are unnecessary.  The service could be streamlined and the Minister should clarify whether the establishment of these three new companies will mean the end of the area management structure.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a passing reference to OIE, the Great Southern Hotels Group which, like the canal operation, have been removed from CIE.  It is a source of very deep frustration, almost anger, to the private hotels sector that almost £6 million of arrears of VAT, PAYE and PRSI was written off with one stroke of the pen by the Government of the day when the company was basically insolvent and was taken over.  Many hotels had been competing with the Great Southern Hotel Group.  I should like to acknowledge the role of CERT since they tok over those hotels.  I accept that CERT do not own them but there has been a vast improvement in the hotels.  I can recall attending many meetings in Rosslare when it appeared likely that the Great Southern Hotel there would close.  I should like to thank the Minister for his efforts to keep that hotel open and I should like to tell him that the subsequent investment in refurbishment has proved well worthwhile.  The management of the hotel are looking forward to a successful season in 1987.</P>
    <P>Very fundamental mistakes were made in relation to CIE in the past.  The first one was the monopoly, enshrined in legislation, given to CIE.  As a central part of our transport policy that must slowly be changed.  In so far as setting up the three public companies will facilitate that <Col N="2602" /> change, will facilitate new private sector involvement in joint ventures to give a better service in terms of safety, quality and reliability to the public, I welcome it.  I hope that the improvements made by Paul Conlon, and his team, which have been remarkable, will ensure that the company will return to full profitability when the three companies are set up.</P>
    <P>I hope the railway section of the business can be developed, particularly the freight side and that with new equipment and carriages the freight element will be marketed aggressively so as to avail of the shift away from own-account transport. I hope the farcical industrial relations position in the company improves.  I could not believe that in 1985, 2,343 meetings between employers and unions were held.  I hope something is done about that.  I commend the Bill to the House but I regret that many of the McKinsey recommendations seem to have been discarded.  I wish CIE well in the future and I hope they can put in a much better performance in the next ten years than they did in the last ten.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admired the contribution of Deputy Yates.  I listened to him carefully and what he said represented a thoughtful and comprehensive approach to the problems of transport here and CIE in particular.  Would that all contributions from both sides of the House were as well researched and thought out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say a number of things about transport.  We need an integrated transport policy here, not one for air, one for sea and one for land and, as it were, never shall they all meet.  The three should be pulled together in one policy. CIE will have to adopt a consumer-first philosophy if they are to survive the next decade.  Transport deregulation which is occurring in America and Britain is an ideal opportunity for us to subcontract, let out or put into the private arena some of the current activities of CIE.  With regard to the DART service I should like to call for a huge programme of marketing to get new passengers on to that line but I warn the company that if they <Col N="2603" /> do not do that the DART service will not become the glittering symbol of modern Ireland which we hope it will be but will turn out to be a financial disaster for the nation.  The Harcourt Street line, which was closed many years ago and is being reopened in part by the Government, should be privately funded and there is a way that that can happen.  The role of the semi-State bodies here will have to be radically overhauled if they are to meet the needs of the nation.  Their present structure and method of operation are not good enough and will have to improve.</P>
    <P>I should like to develop those suggestions. The Bill will help to make CIE, and semi-State companies generally, more accountable.  I join with Deputy Yates in welcoming Mr. Paul Conlon as the new chief executive and compliment him on his efforts in the last year or so. Certainly, there has been a clear sign of improvement in the company's approach, particularly in financial matters. He deserves the support and commendation of the House.  However, he faces the dilemma of how to cut the costs of CIE while at the same time running a social service.  One way of doing that would be to increase the transparency of the subventions, to make sure that all funding and losses are highly visible and that the activities of the company are equally visible.  Transparency is what is important when running and trying to subsidise semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>The 1958 Act imposed an obligation on CIE to run the company reasonably efficiently and economically.  That Act suggested that within five years of its coming into force CIE should be earning a profit but we know to our cost that that has not happened and, therefore, some fundamental reappraisals must be undertaken. In the course of his speech the Minister referred to the reliability of the service and the unpredictable labour stoppages.  It is one thing to talk about those matters but it is another thing to get proposals to deal with them.  Unfortunately, I did not detect any proposals in the Minister speech although he identified those two items as major problems. <Col N="2604" /> I do not think that the breaking up of the company into three pieces and changing the names necessarily solves the problem of unpredictable labour stoppages and reliability of service.  Shifting the numbers around will not solve the fundamental problem but I accept that this move is a step in the right direction.  What is needed in CIE is a consumer-first philosophy, putting the passenger first and the staff second, putting the passenger first and the company second and putting the passenger first and the internal affairs of CIE second.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I have yet to see clear evidence, in travelling by CIE, that there is an understanding that all markets are consumer led, that all profits grow from the marketplace, that the marketplace in this context is the consumer, that the serving of that consumer leads to the profits which are desired.  There is still an attitude in some parts of the company that it is not so much a pleasure to travel by CIE as an onerous duty which some members of that company feel they have to put up with.  I say bluntly to CIE that if they had a consumer led philosophy they would certainly make progress. There are signs that the new chief executive is getting a grip on that matter and that should be welcomed.  In that context, new services are to be developed, new marketing approaches and so on.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of DART.  The city is growing very rapidly and is now a modern capital city.  We are proud to have a service such as DART but, instead of being a glittering prize for the nation, it could turn out to be a financial disaster if we do not start looking at it honestly.  We are inclined to bow the knee to that service as a tremendous development, without examining too closely the facts and figures involved. Were we to start examining those now, we might save many headaches in five to ten years' time.  In reply to some Dáil questions which I put down in this regard, I was told by the Minister that the break even point was working out at about 80,000 passengers a day and that if you include interest you are talking about needing 100,000 to 120,000 passengers a <Col N="2605" /> day to break even.  You must then look very closely at how many passengers per day the service is carrying and the figure seems to be around 50,000.  We are thus carrying only half the number of passengers on DART we need to break even.</P>
    <P>If that continues for five, ten or 15 years, CIE will not be a problem any more, DART will.  It will just gobble up the finances of that company.  I support and want to keep and develop DART as much as anybody, but if it gobbles up scarce State resources, which perhaps could be used for employment, for developing industry, we must start asking questions. I suggest that the company should put together a very aggressive marketing plan to get people to use that service up to the desired number.  There is no point in having a gleaming service whizzing along the coast if it is only carrying half the number of people needed to break even.  Now that we have built it, the solution is not to close it or cut it back, but to get the requisite numbers travelling on it.  You will only do that if you go aggressively after the market.</P>
    <P>I am sure the figures for the feeder buses are available, but somehow that service has not caught the imagination. The notion of getting on a bus to get to the train to go to town is not adding up to the increased numbers which we thought it might.  CIE will have to have a brain-storming session to figure out how to get people to leave their cars at home and use the DART on a more regular basis.  I am sure there are experts available who can come up with some solutions. There is no point in crying about a financial disaster in five or six years' time.  Let us look at the situation now while we need the passengers and while we are still proud of the service.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a watershed in the management and financing of semi-State companies generally.  In that regard, CIE are a very good example.  Having said that CIE have made good progress, it must also be said that the public purse, the taxpayer, cannot go on paying out over £100 million a year to CIE.  I think the figure last year was £104 million.  It is important to remember that that amount <Col N="2606" /> could be used to develop industry, to provide tax cuts, to prevent health cuts, and perhaps in many other areas.  There is a huge onus on CIE and on all of us to make it quite clear that that is something we cannot go on doing.  We seem to have arrived at the notion that CIE are inherently loss-makers.  We are prepared to accept the notion that CIE should cost £100 million or more a year just to keep them going.  The day we accept that notion we will stop trying to solve the problem.  I am not impressed, either, by the notion that transport companies everywhere lose money, so why should not we?  We can let some of the business out to the private area.  We can examine the financing of the purchases and the assets of the company.  I warn against blindly accepting that CIE are loss-making. They should not be.</P>
    <P>There is a new trend around the world in deregulation, for example in the United States and the United Kingdom. Massive deregulation is going on not just in transport but in the whole area of financial servicing, banking and so forth. There are tremendous opportunities to put this country's transport right and to provide, as the 1958 Act said, a reasonable, efficient and economic transport service.  There are very good opportunities if we examine them very carefully. Deregulation can be difficult.  Many will go to the wall.  It can cause many headaches, but it is a wonderful opportunity and CIE should examine it on a private sector basis to see how they can avail of that opportunity.</P>
    <P>Transport today is a major cost for Irish industry.  I think Deputy Yates said it accounted for 10 per cent of production cost.  It is also obvious from CII reports that our transport costs are still out of line with European ones.  Transport is not just a way of getting around; it is a major cost for industry.  That is a tremendous incentive for us to get costs under control, and keep transport costs as low as possible. That is one way of helping Irish industry, apart from giving grant aid or other aids.  It is a very practical way.  I would like a more professional, vibrant <Col N="2607" /> freight business within CIE, in full competition with others in the same business, to develop a lively competition for transport business and, to bring down transport costs for industry.  CIE should systematically canvass the views of major companies which use public transport &mdash; Guinness and so on &mdash; to ensure that CIE are more responsive to Irish industry generally.  I wonder if that sort of consultation goes on.</P>
    <P>The capital re-equipment costs for CIE are absolutely enormous &mdash; the cost of trains and rolling stock generally.  I am convinced that a more imaginative financial instrument can be used to fund that kind of capital investment.  It is not good enough in this modern age of sophisticated financial instruments for the Government to lend or give money for the purchase of fixed assets.  Quite imaginative financial instruments are available.  I see no reason why we should be hung up about financing the purchase of some of the fixed assets in Deutsche-marks with a 5 per cent interest rate.  If the Government get their exchange rate policy right, there is little or no risk in doing it that way.  There is not a massive outflow of Government capital and the funding can be organised and structured in a much more reasonable way which keeps interest rates down for the company.</P>
    <P>CIE have to be aware of what is going on in the transport business.  I need only mention two things that happened recently and ask CIE if they have even noticed these events.  The first is the airline fare war.  Six months ago it cost £208 to fly to London; now it can be done for £74.  I am sure the airlines would have thought that was absolutely impossible if it had been suggested a year ago.  B &amp; I were charging £109 or £110 to go to Britain; now they are offering a fare of £29.  Is it still CIE's intention to pursue a policy of recovery of their costs by keeping high fares, not following the trends in modern communications?  Much has happened to Acr Lingus and B &amp; I because of competitors taking them on; it is a lucky thing for CIE that they do <Col N="2608" /> not have similar competitors &mdash; otherwise they too would have their rates cut in half in the years ahead.  I would say to CIE that they should try to move in that direction anyway in order to attract more passengers to use their services.</P>
    <P>If people feel good about using a service and it is economical to do so, the number of people using it will go up and the same income will be generated.  That is the philosophy being applied by the airlines and B &amp; I and there is no reason why CIE should not examine the matter. Certainly to ignore that trend would be highly dangerous even if they have a monopoly. For many years Aer Lingus thought they had a monopoly and did not do anything about their pricing structure. Now they can fly a passenger to London for £74, although it used to cost £208. B &amp; I can now offer fares which are less than half the amount they previously charged.  If CIE had to face competitors they would be bringing down their rates and making their business pay.  They should not wait for the day when some future Minister or Government will land that competition on their doorstep.  They should meet it half-way now and restructure their fares in an attractive way.</P>
    <P>I did not complete my remarks on the role of the semi-State bodies.  The role of the semi-State companies still needs much redesigning and a radical overhaul. The Devlin Commission rates of pay still apply in all the State companies, including CIE.  I see no earthly reason why these rates of pay should continue to exist in semi-State companies.  It is like saying to the chief executive of a semi-State company that whether he produces the goods or not he will still be paid the same. That approach is old-fashioned and it is not the way to motivate staff.  I should like the Devlin restrictions to be removed from the semi-State area.</P>
    <P>I should like to see CIE and all the other semi-State companies being allowed to open foreign subsidiaries but no legislation has been enacted to allow them to do so.  I see no reason why CIE could not have a foreign subsidiary doing consultancy work internationally helping <Col N="2609" /> other nations to establish transport authorities and earning foreign revenue.  I get quite annoyed when I think of the fact that 28 commercial semi-State companies are turning over £3 billion, while perhaps 90 per cent of that money is earned internally.  These enterprises on the high ground of Irish business are trying to earn their money internally.  A similar private group with a turnover of £3 billion would earn another £3 billion abroad.  I see no reason why Irish semi-State companies cannot earn the same type of money abroad as they are earning at home.  A close examination will show I am correct in that matter.  It can happen in the financial services area with ICC and Irish Life.  It is beginning to happen in Aer Lingus.  This is not perhaps the debate to deal with this matter in depth but I should like to see semi-State bodies being allowed to set up subsidiaries abroad to earn foreign revenue.  I should like to see Devlin removed and I am in favour of more joint ventures between semi-State companies and the private sector.  I am one of those people who believe in an increased private sector role in semi-State companies.  CIE should take careful note of some of the nonsense that went on in Irish Shipping where the lines of accountability were not too clear.  I would say to every semi-State company that they should avoid that nonsense and ensure that the lines are crystal clear.</P>
    <P>We need an integrated transport policy and a &ldquo;consumer first&rdquo; philosophy.  There are opportunities we should take up, foreign and domestic, in regard to transport deregulation.  I have been warning that the DART system will run into trouble unless we begin a massive programme to get people using that line.  I have asked for a radical overhaul of the semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to mention the Harcourt Street line which runs through the southern part of Dublin city.  I welcome the Government's announcement to put £8 million into that line.  I recently walked along the line and saw that little or no building on the line has taken place.  It is remarkably free and runs through the most heavily populated part of Dublin.  I <Col N="2610" /> believe it could be funded privately.  The Government are to give £8 million but it would cost £50 million or more to restore the train services.  I am aware there is private interest in it.  The population in the area would return to private investors a large proportion of their investment because there is tremendous public need for the reopening of this line.  I am not asking for State funds to be flung at it but I am asking for a logical and professional assessment of the finances needed and then an imaginative approach internationally and locally to find the private funding which is necessary.  Certainly I will be happy to make some suggestions as to how it can be done.  I have examined the matter quite carefully because the line runs through my own constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides for CIE to be retained as the parent body.  I welcome this because I have the utmost confidence in CIE.  The duty of a Government is to regulate a transport system which will be fair and give a reasonable service.  The Minister is hoping to make CIE more efficient.  I sincerely hope the Bill will attain its objective.</P>
      <P>I have reservations about the &ldquo;three company&rdquo; concept.  I hope it will not be the case that bus and rail will compete against each other for the same type of traffic.  I fear that the private operator will take advantage of that position and will add to the problems already existing. I realise the parent company will have all the powers necessary to control the activities of the subsidiary bodies and let us hope this will be a success.</P>
      <P>The impracticalities and the difficulties in separating the rail and bus services are almost too numerous to mention.  Many CIE bus and rail employees work very closely together and I would be afraid of any friction being created.  We must be careful that any changes made will not dilute this very essential co-operation because this could lead to a reduction in the very efficient handling services provided by CIE at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must examine the present system and how it operates.  While area road managers carry out their responsibilities. <Col N="2611" /> there are numerous examples of district and station managers on the rail side being involved also in the bus operations. For many years I worked in the transport company and I have experience of this great co-operation between the bus and rail sections in the Limerick depot.  I saw buses withdrawn from service, admittedly not during peak periods, to assist the rail section which may have been experiencing problems as a result of breakdowns or other problems outside their control.  To appreciate that co-operation, it was necessary to be involved in these operations.  The same applies to the rail workers.  Those involved in the rail section never lost an opportunity to co-operate with the bus service.  I fear that this very important co-operation may be damaged.  It must be made clear to the workers in both the bus and rail sections that they must not canvass for customers because this could result in a loss for both companies.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the service provided by CIE which carries passengers from one city to another.  The train takes them from their point of departure and delivers them to another city where a bus is waiting to take them into the city free of charge.  At the end of the day the bus crew collect these passengers at a predetermined point and bring them back to the station from where they are returned to their point of departure.  I fear that this type of service would no longer exist if the two bodies were independent. I cannot see an independent Dublin bus service co-operating with a rural rail service to the same extent.  That is one of my worries.</P>
    <P>The chairman of CIE, Mr. Paul Conlon, said that the outturn for 1985 was a profit of £6.793 million compared with a deficit of £.004 million in 1984.  He pointed out that every section of CIE had a progress report to offer.  It must be stressed again and again that the service provided by CIE is as efficient now as it was ten years ago in spite of the fact that staff numbers have been reduced by 6,000.  That is a tribute to management.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2612" /> Rail productivity has improved dramatically in recent years.  This is due not alone to CIE management but to the workers as well.  Research was carried out by Leeds University, and the report was published this year showing that between 1971 and 1981 Irish railways had a 60 per cent increase in productivity, have proved more efficient than the French, German or British railways, and have also shown a considerable improvement since 1981.  That is a great tribute to the workers and management of CIE who had to go through some very difficult times.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about the private carrier. He can provide very attractive rates because he has an advantage over CIE. He can be selective.  He is not committed to providing a national service, taking the bad with the good.  He does not have to think of employing approximately 15,000 people.  He has no obligations in this area. There are 14,000 people and their families dependent on CIE and we must protect these people.  I must pay tribute to the members of bus and rail services who provide such an efficient and courteous service.  In general CIE do a wonderful job.  I hope the provisions of this Bill will not dilute those outstanding services in any way.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 15 are designed to enable the board of CIE to operate the existing pension scheme.  I sincerely hope that the companies involved will be somewhat more generous in making provisions for pensions because until quite recently people who had worked in CIE for 35 to 40 years walked out with the large sum of £16.80 on the day of retirement.  One can only remark on the commitment and dedication of those men who, after all those years' service, walked out with so little. Were it not for the action of the present Minister the same conditions would have continued to apply.  At least that figure has now been increased to approximately £24 which, while representing something of which nobody can be proud, is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>When we talk of CIE making progress we should think back to the great work <Col N="2613" /> undertaken by many people who have now gone to their rest.  When this three company concept is being judged in the future I hope there will be more charitable reference to the pension scheme than is the case today.  I know also that the staff appreciate what the Minister achieved by way of increased pensions.  I hope he will endeavour to improve them even further.</P>
    <P>As somebody who worked with CIE I am proud to acknowledge their achievements and progress to date.  We should pay tribute here to each and every member, from the chairman down to the most junior porter employed because they are doing a fine job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> This Bill affords Deputies an opportunity to deal with the important proposal to divide CIE into three companies.  Our spokesman, Deputy Wilson, made it clear that Fianna Fáil do not agree with this.  The provisions of the Bill would seem not to be based on the overall recommendations of the McKinsey report but rather on part thereof.  I do not have great knowledge or experience of how CIE operate.  I hope the implementation of the provisions of this Bill will bring about an improvement in their performance and that the public will have more confidence in them.  Like Deputy O'Brien, I hope the provisions of this Bill will bring about more efficiency within the overall operations of CIE, more co-operation between management and staff, indeed better communication between them.  I believe such would lead to an enormous reduction in the number of industrial disputes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Willie O'Brien I hope the pension conditions of the ordinary worker will be brought into line with those of other staff members.  It is tragic that an employee can give 40 years' service to a company and retire on a miserable pension of approximately £16.  I hope that the provisions will lead also to a greater understanding between management and the workforce.  I should like to see a greater bond of interest in the <Col N="2614" /> overall organisation, the company being more concerned with their employees.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of a separate bus service for Dublin which I hope will lead to a more efficient service.  At present some Dublin districts have a very poor bus service.  There is also the problem of breakdowns when replacement buses do not appear to be available.  The public experience long delays daily awaiting buses, which are caused by congestion in the city centre and on roads leading into the city centre, especially at peak hours.  In England and other countries traffic seems to run more smoothly, possibly because there are greater restrictions on the numbers of private cars allowed to park within the vicinity of the city centre.  Traffic congestion in the centre of Dublin is attributable to a number of causes, the fact that heavy commercial vehicles are allowed to travel through the centre, especially at peak hours, the illegal parking of motor vehicles and the lack of a proper and efficient transport service in Dublin.  These are the reasons people have purchased private cars in which to travel to and from work.  I am confident that had we an efficient public transport, on which people could depend, there would be no need to bring private motor cars into the city.  Indeed people are fearful of taking their cars into the city centre at present because so many are stolen and damaged.</P>
    <P>There is need also for a central bus station in Dublin eliminating the present problems encountered with bus termini being located on centre city streets.  For example, the area around Parnell Square is constantly choked up with buses parked there daily.  There is another bus terminus located outside Trinity College which causes serious traffic congestion.  There are other bus termini on different parts of the quays and in Abbey Street and Parnell Street, all causing serious traffic congestion, the buses being allowed park there for long periods.  As a member of Dublin Corporation I know that the problem of oil leaking from these buses has been raised and discussed by members of the city council.</P>
    <P>I question whether there is anything <Col N="2615" /> in the provisions of this Bill that would compel CIE to build a central bus station. In most towns and cities in England there is a central bus station for buses travelling to and from all parts.  It is quite different for anybody coming into Dublin.  If one gets off a bus on the north side one has to walk to Trinity College to get a bus going to the south side.  If there was a central bus station, like Victoria Station in London, it would be easier.  If one goes to Victoria Station in London one is sure to get a bus to any part of the city of London.  A central bus station in Dublin would speed up the service.  At present buses have to go right across the city to get from north to south and <i>vice versa,</i> and are often held up for long periods in traffic jams.  I am amazed that CIE have never considered the establishment of a central bus station since they seem to have a lot of property in and around the city centre.  I have no doubt such a station would be of enormous benefit not alone to the travelling public but to CIE themselves.  It would greatly reduce the amount of time wasted in traffic jams.</P>
    <P>The closure of the railway lines in Dublin, particularly the Harcourt Street line which Deputy Séamus Brennan has referred to, was a dreadful mistake and was probably done without giving the matter much thought.  I am glad to hear the Government are making a contribution towards the opening of that railway line which now runs through a highly populated area of the city.  At the time it was closed many of the housing developments were not established and that may be one of the reasons it was closed down.</P>
    <P>It was a grave mistake, at any time, to give CIE a monopoly of public transport because they had no competition and took advantage of this.  They could withdraw or reduce a service from any area with little notice to the public.  That is one reason why the transport service here is so bad.  I worked in England for a number of years.  There were no long queues at bus stops and no queues waiting for a bus that never turned up because <Col N="2616" /> there was an efficient public transport service with private operators competing against the public transport.  Where private operators are allowed to complete people will not have to queue as long at bus stops as they do here.  There is nothing wrong with private transport companies being allowed to operate in Dublin and throughout the country.  It is the only guarantee of an efficient transport service.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not make much difference. It is just more of the same because CIE still have the monopoly and will not have to compete.  CIE are one of the largest semi-State companies.  They have come in for a lot of flak over the years, and I suppose they have earned most of it.  They are a powerful organisation employing a tremendous number of people.  Some of these people are good craftsmen with great expertise and have given a very good service to CIE.  That is why Governments have not allowed private transport companies to operate; they felt that if a private transport company were operating it would cause CIE to reduce their staff.  I do not believe that is so.  I believe if a private transport company were operating we would have a far better transport service, with the public company competing against the private company.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is no competition. At present private buses operate from Dublin to different parts of the country especially at weekends and at a much reduced rate &mdash; less than half the price that CIE are charging &mdash; and many young people from the country employed in Dublin avail of this service.  A single fare from Dublin to Cork with CIE is about £23 and it is about £10 on the private bus.  CIE do not claim to try to compete against these private buses.  I wonder why CIE have never, even as an experiment, tried to operate that type of service themselves.  Let us recall when Ryanair started to operate from Dublin Airport it caused Aer Lingus to reduce their fares quite substantially and the same happened in B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>The vast number of people employed in CIE have to deal with the public and <Col N="2617" /> it is quite a difficult job.  Bus conductors particularly come in for a lot of abuse, especially if the public have had to wait for long periods in bad weather for a bus. When the first bus arrives &mdash; although that bus might be on time &mdash; they may abuse the conductor although the delay was not his fault.  It may be that the previous bus did not run, possibly because the bus driver or the conductor did not turn up.</P>
    <P>CIE have had their fair share of industrial disputes which greatly inconvenience the travelling public.  There are far too many trade unions involved in CIE.  Many of the disputes are about trivial matters which one imagines could be ironed out between the trade unions and the management.  On occasions we have seen one-man pickets which have resulted in the stoppage of the whole bus transport service.  I recall one man in Clontarf garage going out on strike a few years ago because he was dismissed from CIE and felt that he had got an unfair deal.  He set up a one-man picket which the bus drivers, conductors and staff would not pass and eventually most of the CIE bus service in the city came to a standstill.</P>
    <P>Like other Deputies, I should like to compliment CIE on the DART train service. An extension of that service would be very welcome but I know there is a difficulty in providing it due to lack of finance.  However, there is a grave need to extend that service, particularly to Dublin Airport and to the Cabra, Finglas and Ballymun areas.  Such a service would relieve congestion in the city centre.  So far, it has been a wonderful service.</P>
    <P>CIE provide an excellent express bus service.  They have beautiful buses, particularly for tourists.  However, it is regrettable that the rail freight service has been virtually abandoned.  It appears that most freight is now taken by road in heavy commercial vehicles.  We hear complaints about them at local authority meetings and in the House.  They have caused great damage to many Irish roads whose foundations were never built to take such heavy traffic.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to ensure that greater use <Col N="2618" /> be made of rail freight transport.  Heavy commercial vehicles should not be allowed to move through the city centre. The Minister for the Environment should ban such vehicles, which are causing serious traffic hazards on narrow country roads as well as in the city centre.  I agree with Deputy Yates that a special rail transport service should be set up for the carriage of dangerous substances.  The present service is most unsatisfactory and there has been serious concern expressed about present arrangements.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will make CIE more accountable and that the company will change from their present loss-making role to a profit-making enterprise through efficiency.  I agree with Deputy Séamus Brennan who said the passengers should come first, with CIE in a secondary place. The passengers should be treated more courteously at all times, particularly senior citizens and the disabled.  One notices in other countries how bus conductors pay special attention to such passangers. I agree this is done throughout Ireland, but the occasional one does not seem to realise that senior citizens and people in wheelchairs require special attention.  If such an attitude were adopted by CIE staff it would be of benefit to the company as well as to the travelling public.</P>
    <P>The one-man bus operation got off the ground after some delay.  At present it is only being operated in a limited number of areas but it has been of particular benefit as a feeder service to users of the DART.  When the Bill becomes law I hope it will result in better services for the people of Dublin and throughout the country.  I particularly hope there will not be such long delays in the arrival of buses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Being an Inchicore man born and bred I have a great identification with Inchicore people, the Inchicore works and CIE in general. However, it is my view that CIE are among the least consumer conscious and employee conscious of the semi-State bodies.  The company greatly need to be modernised and brought into the 20th century, particularly from the point of <Col N="2619" /> view of consumers and staff.  I suggest the uses and misuses of the Inchicore works should be the subject of a ministerial inquiry.  In that facility anything could be built, aircraft, tanks, any machinery the country needs.  It is the best engineering facility in the Republic and comparable to anything in the heavy engineering sector in Northern Ireland.  However, it has been consistently misused, abused and under-used.  I remember when I worked there as a young school leaver a ministerial visit to the works was arranged.  All the timber in sight was burned so that it would not be there, looking unsightly for the Minister's visit. There was no timber left for any work to be done for weeks.  One hears stories from Members of the House of the grass there being painted green on the occasion of ministerial visits.  Some of the older people in CIE have told me about pits being filled in with machinery and about machinery being used for foundations, machinery which could have been sold easily at a profit.  I would guess that that works are being operated at about 10 per cent of capacity even though they now have the bus works which were formerly located at Spa Road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Inchicore works should be the specific subject of a ministerial inquiry The people there are very talented, able people and they should be engaged in constructive work.  Instead, we are importing carriages and buses built abroad.  When I queried this with the CIE chairman recently he told me the buses they have now on contract are of such a standard that they could not be built in the CIE works.  The coach-makers in that factory are following the tradition of people who made the coach which now draws the Queen of England through the streets of London, and the Presidential coach here which, sadly, has been scrapped. The workers there are enormously talented.  Those great craftsmen are not being given the opportunity to use their craftsmanship because of nonsensical managerial decisions.  Therefore, there should be an examination of CIE management. The company are top-heavy <Col N="2620" /> with management.  CIE management carry more passengers than their buses.  It is time the whole structure of the company was examined, specifically the role of the Inchicore works.</P>
    <P>I welcome the effort being made to bring CIE into the 20th century.  There is a &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; attitude between management and staff within CIE and largely that is the fault of the management there. For instance, take Inchicore works where managers drive into work and park their cars and drive out again while other employees must park their cars out on the street and yet are subject to being searched going out should the security people on the gate so decide.  That is a terrible imposition on people in this day and age.  It should not be allowed.  We can start from there and go right through CIE where the same &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; attitude exists between management and employees.  The system needs to be modernised. It does nothing for the morale of CIE or their capacity to meet their needs.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly that CIE do not respond to consumers' needs.  Buses are taken off routes and put on to other routes which, of course, are busy.  Naturally in places like Tallaght more services are needed, but that does not mean that when they take off or reduce services in some areas they have to cut out services to whole areas.  When CIE take off services it is a major achievement if they can be persuaded even to have adjacent services drive into the roads deprived of the service and back out again.  That is the kind of thing that needs to be pursued.  I took it up formally with CIE only last week. Regularly when people ring up to inquire about services they are told that their local TDs are the ones responsible for taking the buses off the roads.  TDs have no role in running CIE and the sooner that is realised the better.</P>
    <P>What is needed particularly is a consumer panel within CIE to allow consumers to be consulted by the people who run a monopolistic transport system and I am not talking only of consultation in relation to services that are being diverted.  Services still could be diverted <Col N="2621" /> in a way which meets the needs of communities like Walkinstown where the Tallaght bus must pass in any event.  The same applies to Crumlin and Drimnagh whose needs could equally be met by the same service, instead of CIE saying that the bus that goes to X cannot go to Y, that that is as it has been for 30 years and that because they have to make a change they are taking off a service and so it must remain.</P>
    <P>It does not have to remain as it always was.  A consumer panel is needed so that before bus service routes are changed and new ones applied they can be tested out and people can be consulted about their needs.  That should apply not just to bus routes but to related matters.  Another matter for consultation with such a consumer body would be whether CIE could put a bus shelter outside your halldoor. In many cases they come along without consulting the resident of the house.  They put an advertisement in the paper for planning permission but the resident might not see that.  He might be on holidays, for instance, and then they put a bus shelter outside the door where he may be planning to make a driveway at some time in the future.  This means that in many cases what they have installed in effect is a public urinal at least so far as after pub closing time is concerned.  All that is done without as much as an iota of consultation with the person who lives there.  There should be some formal arrangment for consulting people who have to endure such a situation for the rest of their lives and whose property is being devalued by it.  There should be a consumer body whom CIE must consult and who can tell CIE the policy that must be followed in relation to the installation of bus shelters, to changing bus routes etc.  That is needed very badly.</P>
    <P>The policy being pursued by CIE lacks a certain humanity.  They are recruiting apprentices who are paid apprenticeship wages and most of whom have no hope of being retained at their trade when they have served their time.  In many cases they are serving their time to trades which will be of little use to them outside CIE, like coach-making or coach painting, <Col N="2622" /> specifically related to transport, whereas in small companies they could be trained as electricians or something like that and could use those trades in other companies. In some cases apprentices are being trained on very low wages and at the end of their training they will get a job at their trade.  They may get jobs as labourers or busmen with CIE if they are lucky but times out of number they will get nothing at all.  CIE should be required to look at a policy which allows somebody to work for four or five years at a pittance, being trained for something which is not going to be there.  That is not good for the morale of the person serving his time or the person to whom he serves his time. It causes a great deal of cynicism.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes being made in this Bill.  I hope that the Bill will cause CIE to become more public spirited and shake off some of the cobwebs which have caused that body to lag behind in modernising their role in the community. I hope that the Minister will give consideration to the points I have made particularly in relation to the involvement of consumers in this very large authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to speak about the changes in CIE in freight and in transport, particularly in relation to the west.  The Dublin-Sligo line is the only line at present that has not an inter-city or supertrain service on it.  This is really a shame.  I had occasion not long ago to travel on a super train.  There is a vast difference between the super trains and inter-city trains and the trains that people going to Sligo use.  Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford lines and now the Westport line have all inter-city services or at least super trains but the Sligo line has a very poor transport system at the moment.  In this technological age our transport system must be fast, smooth, air conditioned, comfortable, punctual, competitive, reliable and clean.  It must meet the needs of as many people as possible as often as possible.  The quality of the service we use is often not up to standard.  The onus is on the management of our transport system to organise and motivate the entire personnel and <Col N="2623" /> resources at their disposal to achieve a standard of service second to none.  Those of us who have had the opportunity to use the inter-city service will know that it is excellent and combines speed, comfort, reliability, realistic prices, excellent and courteous staff and excellent dining facilities.  As an added bonus one arrives at one's destination fresh and relaxed.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, however, regions of this country are deprived of the right to use inter-city services because they simply are not available on the lines that serve these regions.  I refer to the Dublin-Sligo line and the quality of the rolling stock used on that line.  It saddens and annoys me that the passenger trains serving my constituency and a significant part of the Connacht-Ulster region have long outlived their usefulness.  At present we are using two types of carriages, Park Royal Carriages which are of wooden construction and have been condemned in parts of the country, and Craven coaches. Unfortunately if there is a festival in Cork or Dublin the Craven coaches are taken off the Sligo line and used on the Dublin-Cork line.  That is the way the West has been treated over the past number of years.  When the good carriages are taken off the route for a football match or a festival in Cork, they are not put back on the route again for perhaps two weeks.</P>

      <P>As the House knows my constituency is in the heartland of the disadvantaged areas.  Emigration has reached an alarming proportion here and the need to create employment is urgent. People setting up businesses in areas such as the north west must have access to a transport service that will make our area accessible with speed and comfort.  Industrialists who travel from here to Cork, Galway or Limerick using a good service and who then use the train to Sligo, would not come back a second time.  It is essential to improve services.</P>
      <P>Tourists must be enticed to relish the full scenic charms and other attractions of the north west by the provision of better transport.  The joy of their visit must be enhanced by a good train service so that they will come again.  In order to achieve this target the Minister should provide for the extension of the inter-city service to the entire mainland network of CIE and he should get rid of the outdated slow rolling stock which is continuously used on the Sligo line.  The Minister has said that that will be done at the end of the year and I would welcome the improved train service to Sligo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Middle management in CIE, such as station masters and chief clerks should play a greater role in the running of CIE. They are the people who deal with the public and know what the public want. Decisions should not be made at Heuston Station or from some swivel chairs in Galway.  Decisions were made to close the CIE garage in Sligo and transfer the jobs to Ballina and Longford.  They tried to close the school transport section of CIE in Sligo but that has not happened yet.  A large number of jobs were lost <Col N="2625" /> in Sligo over the last number of years because of decisions made in either Heuston Station or Galway.  If middle management were more involved in CIE that might not have happened.</P>
    <P>All stations which currently handle freight should be left open, particularly in the west because they are giving a great social service and creating a number of much needed jobs in the west.  Our roads are not fit for the heavy articulated lorries at present using them.  Now that we have a reasonable line to Sligo I hope people will be encouraged to continue using the freight services provided by CIE.</P>
    <P>When we get the new trains we should make provisions for disabled people. There should be a facility to allow wheelchairs on the trains.  I doubt if a wheelchair, unless it were folded up, could be used on a train at present.  I do not know why there has not been a better train service on the Dublin/Sligo line having regard to the fact that so much money was spent to provide the DART service in Dublin and having regard to the fact that it has been subsidised to such an extent by the taxpayer.  I travelled on an inter-city train for quite a long journey, and felt fresh and relaxed at the end of that journey. Anyone who travels from Dublin to Sligo and back on the same day will feel very tired on the type of train provided on that route.  I hope that in the not too distant future we will have an inter-city train service to Sligo comparable to that in other parts of the country.  We should be treated the same as people in Galway, Waterford, Limerick and Cork.</P>
    <P>CIE introduced a monthly ticket from Sligo to Dublin costing £13.50 and a day return for £10.  Unfortunately, it is not being availed of to any great extent, perhaps because people are scared to come to Dublin because of bomb threats. However, I hope that will not stop CIE from continuing this experiment because they have to compete with private buses who offer a ticket for the same journey for £6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are very important proposals in this legislation.  CIE have a long record of service in Dublin <Col N="2626" /> and the larger centres of population right across rural areas and they have balanced a commercial service with a social one.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with all the proposals in the Bill as, in some cases, there seems to be duplication or bad use of the resources, expertise and personnel available within CIE.  Section 7 proposes to create three companies, Iarnród Éireann, Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath and I cannot see the logic of having three separate companies, two of which will be dealing with the management of the national bus service.  We must have a specific company to deal with the Dublin metropolitan services <i>vis-à-vis</i> buses and another to deal with rural demands as you cannot compare like with like.  Rural areas have different needs and demands compared to Dublin and that is why it is important for Dublin to have a separate company.  However, the rail service starts in Dublin and serves the nation.  The same applies to rural bus services and that is why these services should emanate from the capital.  At least one million people are catered for in the metropolitan area and it needs special attention.</P>
      <P>I commute to Dublin every week and I often wonder why so many buses travel in convoy; often four or five are going in the same drection at the same time.  Yet, people are standing at bus stops.  What kind of planning exists to ensure that we get the maximum service and value for money from the fleet of buses in Dublin? A very large staff is involved and CIE should ensure that we get the best service possible.  Bus services in all the large cities throughout the world seem to lose money, which is hard to understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very impressed with the DART service which is making a major contribution to alleviating the traffic problems of the city and providing a service for people to commute from their homes to work in a very fast and safe environment. It was a very high investment for a specific area but, in time, it will prove to be one of the best investments made by the Government or semi-State bodies over the years.  I am sure it can be expanded to serve other commuter towns in the greater Dublin area and its <Col N="2627" /> environs.  We must ensure that everyone does not migrate to the one area which would create major social, planning and servicing difficulties.  I hope we will always take cognisance of the capacity of the DART service to make a contribution to the development of the city and the economy based on a positively planned constant observation of the need to adapt to the development of the greater Dublin area and the eastern half of the country. It is vital for a capital city to have that type of service which is used by so many people.</P>
    <P>CIE have played a major role over the years and the transport area contains about 12 per cent of the total economic gross output over the years.  That shows how vitally important transport is and the need for a properly structured commercial company or companies which will enable us to compete and to give a high level of service.  The taxpayers and those who use the service should get value for money and the State should also get value for money.</P>
    <P>I have the 1985 annual report.  It is vital for the accounts to be published clearly so that the ordinary layman can understand the exact position <i>vis-à-vis</i> all sections of CIE and their allied services.  There should be transparency and clarity in the accounts <i>vis-à-vis</i> the State investment and subsidy.  One would think from the published accounts this year and the statements emanating thereafter that CIE were a very profitable company rather than a company who have to receive specific State investment and subsidies. As a person from rural Ireland I acknowledge that CIE provide a social service in areas where that service may not have been available heretofore or where the demand for it was not great. On the other hand, CIE have dealt for many years with the lucrative areas such as the large areas of population.  I do not think that CIE have taken cognisance of the rapid changes which have taken place in our economy, in our environmental developments and in our road structure. There has been constant change and development.  It is incumbent on CIE to <Col N="2628" /> develop alongside those changes.  They have not developed sufficiently quickly to react to the various services which are needed.</P>
    <P>For the past number of years we have seen CIE compete with the private sector, particularly in regard to bus transport. I welcome competition.  I salute the people in the private sector who have provided a service where it was not available. CIE have reacted to those services sharply and quickly and have competed with them on particular routes.  I can appreciate how the staff and management of CIE may be worried that the secure position they had <i>vis-à-vis</i> transport services may not be so much under threat but may be eroded by the advent of the private sector coming into the transport arena.  There must be initiative from the private sector.  The State sector must be able and should be able to compete especially after the opportunity they have had to develop their own services to give the maximum service on the most lucrative routes and thus balance those services on the more social routes and on the less lucrative routes.  CIE have had ample opportunity over the years to ensure that they would be better placed than anybody in the private arena to provide those services.</P>
    <P>The private bus sector have made major progress in providing a positive, sensible and practical level of transport to the people of our country over the past number of years.  Obviously they are dealing with a specific sector of the population.  They cater in particular for young people who are working in Dublin and who commute at weekends.  One must recognise that over the years CIE have been charging very hefty fees, particularly for train services, to those young people who cannot afford them in the present economic climate.  Into that vacuum stepped the private bus companies who filled that vacuum admirably. They are providing a very sensible service. They are taking young people out of the city at weekends back to their own homes and environment.  Not alone are they providing a commercial and practical service, they are also providing a <Col N="2629" /> social service.  Because people go back to their home environment on a regular basis, some at least may stay on and settle down and make a contribution to the development of their own areas and communities.</P>
    <P>CIE should have been able to see the need to provide those services.  They should have picked out the various provincial towns, and the smaller towns and hamlets down as far as the rural parishes that need those services.  There is always a demand for such services and the private sector have made their contribution. CIE have had ample opportunity to fuse the social service with the lucrative service and to provide a fleet of buses to take younger people who work in this city, and adults and older people who come to the city to do their business back to their home environments.  They should have been able to fuse those two services together by being able to adapt to particular situations.  They should give the level of service which is expected from a national transport authority.  They were very slow to identify that market and, consequently, they must now compete with the private sector for those services. Competition is the life of trade.  It is best for the economy and the citizens of our country.  We must ensure that the maximum options are available to our people.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years we have seen a marked drop in the number of motor cars being purchased. That is a reflection on the economic situation in the country.  Many people cannot afford to buy cars at present because of the very high level of taxation.  They cannot afford to buy petrol because of the high level of taxation.  Many people, particularly young people, who own motor cars cannot afford to pay for insurance. Consequently, many of them have sold their motor cars and are now using transport provided either by CIE or private companies.  CIE must take cognisance of that type of development and they must be able to compete with the private sector in providing attractive options for young people in this city and for the people of <Col N="2630" /> the country so that they will avail of their services at all times.  The population trends, the social trends and the environmental developments in rural Ireland have not been taken into account by CIE in their planning of rail and road services over the years.  It is important for CIE to recognise that one cannot plan a State transport service to suit one's own staff and ideas.  If one is dealing with the public, if one wants to make money and if one wants to run a commercial operation on a viable basis one must plan, programme and schedule one's services for the commuter.  If CIE have failed in any particular area over the years it is in the area of planning, scheduling and programming.  I can understand the company, in their desire to run an efficient and fast commercial service, trying to cut corners to ensure they do not have to suffer a loss of income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the failure of the Government to provide essential health services for the old, the sick and the handicapped, and calls on the Government as a matter of urgency to ensure that the necessary level of services is provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government will go down in history as the most uncaring Government since the foundation of the State.  This week, for example, thousands of families are feeling the effects of the massive <Col N="2634" /> reduction in social welfare payments which the Government imposed following the introduction of the equality legislation.  Their lack of concern can be seen in the dismantling of the health services that have taken place in the past four years.  When the Government took office the health services provided for the needs of the people but since then there has been an unprecedented reduction in the level of service and financial chaos exists.  Those problems are the result of Fine Gael policies being implemented by a Labour Minister.  In 1975 seven of the health boards had a deficit but in 1986 all health boards will have a deficit amounting to a sum between £15 million and £20 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when asked a question in the House on 23 October, refused to say if health boards will have a deficit on the basis that he did not think it appropriate that Members should have that information because health boards might feel that he, the Minister, was going to take responsibility for the deficits.  The major voluntary hospitals will have a deficit of £1 million although in some cases it will be more than that figure.  It is unprecedented that one major hospital had a cheque for £500,000 returned to them from the bank.  That is an indictment of the policies the Government are pursuing.</P>
    <P>All health boards have had to seek increased overdraft accommodation this year and that will affect charges.  Is the Minister aware that the banks are putting pressure on the health boards to impose increased charges to cover the increased overdraft facilities?</P>
    <P>What does the Minister intend to do about those deficits?  Does he intend to allow the health boards and the voluntary hospitals run up massive deficits?  Is it his intention to spend millions and millions of pounds and leave the bill for the incoming Government, as appears to be happening in other Departments?  The Minister will tell us that there has been an increase in gross current expenditure since his term of office began of the order of 29 per cent but in answer to a question of 15 February last he told me there was <Col N="2635" /> a decrease in the allocation in real terms to seven of the health boards, the exception being the Eastern Health Board which received a small increase, 0.5 per cent.  It is easy to understand the need for that increase, the rapidly expanding population in the Dublin area and the fact that the Eastern Health Board provide national services for all health boards. That would seem to indicate there has been a decrease in the allocation to the health boards as was confirmed in the most recent report of the National Economic and Social Council issued last week.</P>
    <P>The cutbacks are causing serious problems for many people.  Wards have been closed for up to four months.  In other years wards were closed for one month during holiday periods or for renovation but now they are being closed for four months because of the cutbacks.  Would the Minister tell us how the Taoiseach could say in the House on 23 October that there was no need for ward closures at all?  Did the Minister or his officials recommend to the health boards that there should be ward closures.</P>
    <P>The waiting time has been extended for out-patient appointments and for admissions to hospitals and it is now at an unacceptable level.  I am aware of a man who possibly had a brain tumour. He had an appointment to see a neurologist on 5 August 1986.  A week before this he received a letter form the hospital stating:</P>
    <P>I regret your appointment to be seen on Tuesday 5 August has been cancelled.</P>
    <P>A new appointment has been arranged for Tuesday 21 October at 2 p.m.</P>
    <P>Trusting this arrangement will suit your convenience.</P>
    <P>That was a delay of 13 weeks, entirely due to the cutbacks for which this Government are responsible.</P>

      <P>I regret that your state of health does not allow of your continuing to be a member of the Council's staff and on behalf of the Council I wish to thank you for your valued service while in the employment of the Council.</P>

      <P>The longer waiting period means that the Department of Social Welfare are paying disability benefit, not alone to this man but week after week to people awaiting out-patient appointments.  There is more attendance with the family doctor through the GMS and the visiting rate is going up.  The cost to the GMS is going up and the Minister wonders why.  I believe it is above budget at present, although the Minister did not tell us so in the House when asked.  Can he defend, on human terms, the fact that a person with a potentially serious illness would have to wait so long for his appointment that his employment was terminated?  In economic terms, would he explain the cost-effectiveness of the cutbacks in the manner in which they are operated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Western Health Board are sending <Col N="2637" /> people to Dublin and Cork for a CAT scan but on budget day the Minister for Finance announced, as reported in column 944 of the Official Report, that money would be available for the commissioning of the CAT scanner in Galway.  We are now half way through November and that has not yet been done.  On 30 January the Minister announced the closure of eight hospitals. The first that patients, administrators and staff heard of this was on their car radios when they were driving home.  The Minister promised that when Sir Patrick Dun's hospital closed, facilities would be available in St. James's Hospital.  Are those facilities available?  I am aware of a doctor who was unable to get an urgent appointment in St. James's Hospital with a consultant from Sir Patrick Dun's something that would have been very easy to come by when Sir Patrick Dun's was open and working.</P>
    <P>The Minister believes in the shift from hospital to community care, both in terms of emphasis and of resources, and we fully support that policy but the community care services have also been run down.  There is now no dental service for any adult except an expectant mother, a handicapped person or somebody awaiting an operation.  There is no optician service for the elderly, people living alone who like to read or watch television. There is no replacement for public health nurses, even though more people are being discharged earlier from hospitals and in need of community care.</P>
    <P>The general medical services guidelines, according to reports that I am getting from all around the country, are now a rigid cut-off point for the medical card, irrespective of need.  This, again, is the direct result of the cutbacks imposed by the Government and the Minister knows that.  He knows that there is hardship being created and that his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Hussey, introduced payment for school buses based on the medical card, which is adding further burdens to unfortunate people who are unable to pay for their own health services.  Still the Minister asks us in his amendment to commend him for <Col N="2638" /> the way in which he is administering the health service.</P>
    <P>Cutbacks relating to the mentally handicapped are of 2 to 3 per cent, although I have been told that in some institutions they are as high as 7 per cent. Every Member of this House must be concerned to ensure that we have adequate and proper services for the mentally handicapped.  Last week in the House I raised the matter of the number of physically healthy young mentally handicapped adults who are going home to elderly parents who are unable, through age or infirmity, to look after them.  They are being sent home because the institutions are unable to maintain them due to lack of funding.  I appeal to the Minister to provide this funding.  He promises more beds for the mentally handicapped.  We want the places which are already there to be funded so that elderly people around the country need not live in a state of anxiety because young strong adults are being sent home to them and they are not able to manage them.</P>
    <P>Beaumont Hospital should have been opened two years ago.  The Minister now tells us that he will open the out-patients' department before the end of the week. Is he serious?  The people from the north city who will be using the out-patients' facilities will go to the out-patient clinic at Beaumont and then have to go to one of the centre city hospitals, the Richmond or Jervis Street for x-rays and blood tests. Their files will be scattered between many hospitals.  What sort of service does the Minister expect to be provided if that is to happen?  Would the Minister as a matter of urgency open Beaumont Hospital properly as a major teaching hospital for the north city?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach talked here about CEOs hyping up the problems of the health services and of the CEO of the Southern Health Board as producing knowingly fictitious figures.  That is not what we would expect from a responsible Government.  I shall leave the paper read at Dromoland Castle for another time.</P>
    <P>The amendment to our motion, on behalf of Fine Gael and Labour in the <Col N="2639" /> name of the Minister for Health, accuses Fianna Fáil of exploiting the fears and concerns of the sick, the elderly and the handicapped.  The Minister is wrong. Fianna Fáil have a long tradition of a caring social philosophy which they cherish and of which they are justly proud. The present Leader of our party, as Minister for Health and Social Welfare, was responsible for the development and improvement of many of our health services and some of the most radical and enlightened social welfare legislation in Europe.  In Government, we will abandon the present Minister's policy of confrontation and instead we will have consultation. We will discharge what is the responsibility of any civilised Government, that of ensuring that the necessary level of health services is provided.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil have a caring social policy.  We are committed to the promotion of good health and the prevention of illness; the development of community services; more opportunities for the elderly to be cared for and treated in their own community; the provision of an adequate dental and optician service; the implementation of the recommendations of the document on psychiatry <i>Planning for the Future</i>&mdash; this to be carried out in a phased programme of development over ten to 15 years.  We shall start with the first page, not with the last page as the Minister did.  We will carry out a review of the various drug schemes, the long term illness schemes, the refund of drugs scheme and improved out-patient facilities.  Much of this could have been done during the past few years without any major increase in expenditure had the Minister not adopted his policy of confrontation.  The members of our party are sensitive to the needs of the sick, the elderly and the handicapped.  We know that health care is expensive to provide and we are concerned at the high level of taxation.  In Government we will provide a proper and necessary level of services for the people.</P>

      <P>Once again we in Fianna Fáil are forced to highlight the plight of <Col N="2640" /> the poor and the needy and to put down a motion condemning the failure of this Government to provide essential health services for the old, the sick and the handicapped.  Our motion calls on the Government as a matter of urgency to ensure that the necessary level of service is provided.</P>
      <P>The total inadequacy of funding is reflected in every region and in every hospital, be it health board or voluntary. This is the fourth time we have tried to highlight the situation and prevail on this Government to make some effort to cater for the needs of the sick.  We are trying to draw attention to the plight of the poor and underprivileged and to the hardship being inflicted on them by this Government and &mdash; more astonishingly &mdash; by the Labour element of this Government.  The Labour Party and this Minister for Health would claim to represent the poor, the needy and the underprivileged, but surely they must realise that they are not making adequate facilities available to this sector, which must suffer as a result.  Perhaps we could understand this if it came from the Fine Gael Party alone, since they never claimed to cater for this group of our society, or from their potential partners of the future, the PDs, who cannot be seen by any stretch of the imagination to be committed to the underprivileged.  All of this coming from the Labour Party and a Labour Minister for Health is almost unbelievable.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister not see that he is being made a scapegoat by this Government? I and many others on this side believe the Minister was perfectly right to resist the Taoiseach's attempt earlier this year to remove him from his present portfolio.  The Taoiseach was at that time, as now, trying to saddle the Minister with the collective Cabinet decisions in relation to health, hospital closures and many other issues.  The Minister is still being made a scapegoat but he cannot see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer in passing to the outlandish statement made recently by the Taoiseach in this House when he suggested that the South Eastern Health Board and the Western Health Board <Col N="2641" /> had indulged in political hype.  Hype was the charge levied at the health boards for their efforts to provide a comprehensive medical service within their allocation. Members of the Western Health Board can speak for themselves but as a member of the South Eastern Health Board I should like to give the Minister and the Taoiseach a few facts in relation to the funding of that health board and their performance to date.</P>
    <P>The annual aggregate cost to run the acute hospitals of the South Eastern region is £2.5 million less than the national average.  In spite of a shortfall of £4 million in the allocation for 1986, there were no permanent ward closures in the South Eastern Health Board region.  The acute bed numbers in the South Eastern region are below the Department's norm, while I understand that all other health boards exceed the norm.  The South Eastern Health Board has one of the lowest consultant staffing levels in the country.  We have 20 consultants per 100,000 population, while the national average is 33 consultants per 100,000.  The staffing levels for junior hospital doctors is also one of the lowest in the country with 23 doctors per 100,000 while the national average is 53.  That information is sufficient evidence to prove that the Taoiseach's statement was an untruth and warrants an apology to the South Eastern Health Board and the Western Health Board.  I may add that we are still waiting for such an apology.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the situation which prevails in some of the health boards and voluntary hospitals throughout the country. In my health board region we are facing the most disastrous year of all time.  That is not political hype.  The original net expenditure needed for 1986, based on 1985 levels of service plus the residual effects of 1985 pay and allowance increases and estimated inflation, was £93.718 million.  This original figure was subsequently adjusted to take into account 1986 increases in pay and allowances approved and increased to £94.270 million.  When compared with needs, this allocation represents a shortfall of £4.780 million.  This is not hype but fact.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2642" /> Let us look at some of the measures taken by the South Eastern Health Board to try to live within the allocation from the Department.  They have saved a figure in the region of £80,000 on travelling expenses.  I would like to clarify that those travelling expenses do not, as the Taoiseach implied, refer to board members travelling to and from meetings. These expenses are incurred due to travelling by doctors, social workers, community care workers and many other workers in the health board going about their daily chore of catering for the poor and the ill in the community.  We have had to cut back on those expenses this year.  The Minister has always insisted that the emphasis should be changed from the hospital to the community.  How can we achieve that under these circumstances?</P>
    <P>We in the South Eastern Health Board hope to save about £400,000 on energy. All I can say is that we must hope for a good winter in 1986, otherwise we may have to advise our patients and their visitors to bring in extra blankets.  We have reduced subventions to nursing homes by £250,000.  This is surely counter-productive when one considers the fantastic service these homes provide for the poor and needy.  We will be forced to save about £50,000 on transport costs and the health board have been forced to designate pick-up points for patients travelling to hospital.  These people have to travel to a specific point to be picked up by an ambulance.  The people who are availing of the ambulance service are those who cannot afford any other mode of transport.  Some of them may have to travel five or six miles to the designated pick-up point.  Since they do not have transport of their own, they will have to hire a taxi to bring them as far as the ambulance.  Many of them cannot afford this and as a result they will not be able to attend hospital.  This will create the required savings but the Minister knows this is not the right attitude to health care.</P>
    <P>We also have to introduce another cost saving measure as a result of the inadequate allocation.  We had to abolish the <Col N="2643" /> free milk scheme.  A Labour Minister for Health has forced this step.</P>

      <P>We should be proud of ourselves.  There were many other attempts at savings but we are still faced with a shortfall of £4.780 million at the end of 1986.  That is fact, not hype.  We approved at our October meeting an overdraft limit of £3 million.  This facility had to be raised to £7.5 million at our November meeting.  To date we have had no correspondence from the Minister in relation to this matter but if he does not agree to this overdraft facility the salary cheques of the workers of the South Eastern Health Board will not be cashed by the banks in December.  That is the situation we find ourselves in and we are still awaiting a response from the Minister. Maybe we will have that response tonight.</P>
      <P>May I read the first paragraph of a letter sent earlier this year by some of the consultants in St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny?  It states:</P>
      <P>Stringent financial cutbacks are being imposed on the South-Eastern Health Board by the Minister for Health, Barry Desmond.  Specific proposals have been made at health board level to implement these cutbacks. These proposals have centred mainly on savings occurring from ward closures. Any closure, partial or temporary, of a ward facility in St. Luke's General Hospital will have immediate and serious repercussions for the emergency health care of the people of Carlow-Kilkenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are not my words; they are the <Col N="2644" /> words of the people responsible for providing the health care in the Carlow-Kilkenny area.  The letter also states:</P>
    <P>If we are to live within our financial allocations in the South-Eastern Health Board, we would have to have a reduction of £1.5 million in the general hospital area.  This would require a saving of £500,000 in Ardkeen Hospital alone.  To achieve this we would have to close the maternity unit permanently, close 36 of the surgicial beds for an equivalent of six months of the year and we would have to close the dialysis unit.</P>
    <P>That unit was provided and paid for by the people of the south-east.  Neither the Minister nor his Department provided one penny towards that facility but now, as a cost-saving exercise, he suggests we close it.</P>
    <P>The only reference to Waterford in the budget speech last January was a statement that funds would be made available to open, staff and equip the geriatric unit at Ardkeen which has lain idle since 1984.  No pre-conditions were laid down, just those facts.  The Minister said he would open, staff and equip the geriatric assessment unit.  It is now mid-November and we still have seen nothing, but two months after the budget a condition was imposed.  We were told these facilities, the staff and the financing would be provided conditional on the closure of St. Dympna's Hospital.</P>
    <P>Let us have a quick look at the other health board areas and see how they have fared.  Let us take the Minister's constituency of Dún Laoghaire.  Here I have a headline &ldquo;Hospital cutbacks worry Dún Laoghaire doctors&rdquo;.  The article reads:</P>
    <P>Dun Laoghaire doctors are to ask the Board of St. Michael's Hospital to meet with local politicians to explain to them the cutbacks situation at the hospital...</P>
    <P>... The hospital has announced that it can no longer provide physiotherapy treatment and has cut back on pathology tests.  Eighteen beds have also been closed. <Col N="2645" /> It was pointed out at the meeting that these restrictions while saving money in the short term could lead to more money being spent in the long term through increased morbidity.</P>
    <P>Local doctors have already joined with the hospital board in rejecting Health Minister, Mr. Barry Desmond's claim that St. Michael's Hospital was &ldquo;blackmailing&rdquo; him for extra funds.</P>
    <P>Let us see what can be said about the Midland Health Board.  The newspaper heading reads: &ldquo;Cash shortage blocks the second phase of hospital plan&rdquo;.  The article reads:</P>
    <P>The Department of Health says it doesn't have the resources to enable the second phase of the major development at Mullingar General Hospital to proceed as planned.</P>
    <P>The article dealing with St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, has the heading &ldquo;Hospital shouts beds for good&rdquo;.  It states:</P>
    <P>St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, has been forced to close down 45 beds indefinitely because of its continuing shortage of money.</P>
    <P>The Mater Hospital have been told to borrow £5 million.  The position is the same in all the health board areas.</P>
    <P>In the final few minutes available to me I would like to highlight the findings of a survey carried out on my behalf recently.  First, I will read the questions asked and then I will tell the House the results.  The questionnaire read:</P>
    <P>Over the last two years has underfinancing in the health area affected your patients' welfare?</P>
    <P>Taking the following headings as guidelines comment briefly &mdash; using statistics where possible:</P>
    <P>(1)  Decrease in the general level of GMS facilities.</P>
    <P>(2)  Access to general hospitals in your area (both in and out patient services).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2646" /> (3)  Access to teaching hospital and sub-speciality services, e.g. cardiac, paediatric and neuro-surgical, etc.</P>
    <P>(4)  Community care facilities.</P>
    <P>(5)  Administration, e.g. serious slowness in the processing of claims.</P>
    <P>(6)  National averages too rigidly applied at a cost cutting exercise, e.g. visiting rates, late calls, etc.</P>
    <P>(7)  Backlogged processing of drug refund claims.</P>
    <P>In this survey a sizeable number of doctors in the GMS were contacted and the following was the result.  In relation to the decrease in the general level of GMS facilities, 66 per cent of those who replied indicated a significant decrease in the level of GMS facilities over the past two years; 62 per cent replied indicating there had been a decrease in access to general hospitals in their areas; 55 per cent complained about difficulty in gaining access to teaching hospitals, and 64 per cent maintained that national averages were too rigidly applied as a cost-cutting exercise.  These are not my figures. These figures were the response I had from a survey conducted on my behalf.  What surprised me most in this survey was the number of doctors using unbelievable terms to describe what is happening such as, &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo;, &ldquo;frightening degree&rdquo;, &ldquo;health services crumbling&rdquo; and &ldquo;disaster&rdquo;.  These are just a few of the words to describe the degree of dissatisfaction felt by doctors throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Let me give a synopsis of some of the replies I received:</P>
    <P>If you look at the number of patients seen in our Out-Patient Departments, this was steadily increasing over a period of time, from the early eighties. However, due to cutbacks, we have had to cut back on the number of new patients to see us in general surgery, and also increasing the wait to have something done about their surgical condition.  The Board of Management of the hospital in its attempt to save money, has closed beds and quite <Col N="2647" /> simply the result of this is longer waiting lists, and a greater time spent with patients suffering.</P>
    <P>Another reply reads:</P>
    <P>The attempt by Administration to cut down on the number of admissions to hospital and also the overall stay of patients in hospital, has caused considerable difficulty, particularly the premature discharge of patients from hospital who are, sometimes, re-admitted within a few days with a recurrence of their symptons because they have not fully recovered on discharge...</P>
    <P>I am also aware of an attempt to reduce the number of patients seen in the Out-Patients.  This is a contradictory type of policy as the Department of Health wishes to have as many patients as possible investigated as out-patients.</P>
    <P>I feel that the whole situation is utterly chaotic and unless more money is provided for the health services, the present chaos will become worse and the situation will become totally unmanageable.</P>
    <P>I have an in-depth reply from a GP in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown who encloses a reply he got from St. Michael's Hospital in which they outline measures to reduce the level of hospital expenditure, such as the reduction in pathology services, a reduction in physiotherapy services and many other reductions.  Finally, I should like to read the final paragraph of a reply I got from a doctor in the south-west.  It reads:</P>
    <P>The real question is &mdash; Is underfinancing (<i>Fact</i>), compatible with maintenance of standards?</P>
    <P>In reply to that I have to say emphatically no.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Labour Party members of this Coalition to realise who they are and who they are supposed to represent in this Administration.  They could regain some self-respect by opposing any further effort to inflict misery on our old, our sick and our handicapped.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann commends the Minister for Health for continuing to provide comprehensive health services for all persons in need despite the severe overall limitations in exchequer resources; notes that the Fianna Fáil Government in 1982 provided £999 million for such services compared to £1,300 million, the estimated approved out-turn for 1986; further commends the Minister for Health's repeated assurances that the current resources allocated to the health services are sufficient with effective management to ensure the delivery of essential health services to the community as a whole; deplores the constant exploitation by the Opposition of the fears and concerns of the sick, the elderly and the handicapped about these services; and notes with concern that there has been no attempt by the Fianna Fáil party to be constructive about health issues in these difficult economic times.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to deal with a number of points raised by the proposer and seconder of the motion put down by the Opposition. First, Deputy Dr. O'Hanlon raised a question that &mdash; presumably &mdash; a constituent of his had been unable to have a neurological examination between 5 August and 22 October 1986 which he urgently required.  If I receive the relevant information from the Deputy &mdash; presumably in his possession as a member of the medical profession &mdash; I can assure him that I will have carried out a full departmental inquiry.  Also since the person concerned is a public employee &mdash; as was indicated by the Deputy concerned &mdash; and has, allegedly, lost his job as a result of his failure to have medical treatment this would warrant a departmental inquiry on the part of the Minister for the Public Service and the Minister for the Environment, on the assumption that he is employed in that area.  The Deputy may rest assured that a very <Col N="2649" /> detailed examination and a report to him of that case will be carried out, in public if necessary.  That sort of allegation should be dealt with immediately and put to rest.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by the same Deputy that the Mater Hospital had a cheque for £500,000 returned.  We met with the authorities of the Mater Hospital and discussed that incident in depth.  I do not think I could be accused of in any way betraying departmental discussions with a hospital when I say that the hospital, to say the least, was embarrassed about the situation.  To say the most, the hospital are now fully in accord with the cash management departmental system of the Department of Health.  That incident is not likely to recur and is unlikely, to say the least, to be manufactured again for particular purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>So they will have no deficit this year; is that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest it be the view of the Deputy that the activities of the Mater Hospital have declined in any way, I should say that when his own colleagues, Deputies Haughey and Woods were looking after the matter, the total bed days in that hospital in 1981 were 151,574 whereas the total number of bed days last year was 151,694.  I quote from the annual report of the Congregation of the Sisters of Mercy who are not known for putting erroneous data in their reports.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Ormonde's view about the South Eastern Health Board this is more of the same thing.  Really I do think that consultant radiologists should stick to radiology and let finance be dealt with by those who know something about financial procedures.  The existing overdraft of the South Eastern Health Board is £3 million, not £7,500,000.  That figure of £3 million has not been exceeded to date.</P>

      <P>I want to put on record that we have a formal request from the South Eastern Health Board that we maintain their overdraft level up to the end of November 1986 at £3 million.  That overdraft level has not yet been exceeded.  If, in the coming month, there is an excess required on that overdraft level, we shall discuss the matter with the board.  I am surprised that a consultant radiologist from the South Eastern Health Board area would come into this House and say that cheques will be dishonoured for several thousand staff in the month of December.  That is not true.  That is the kind of vilification and abuse of an extraordinary nature I have had to tolerate from the Opposition over the past three or four years.  The South Eastern Health Board will be looked after.  It is reminiscent of the kind of reply I had to give in the House to Deputy Denis Lyons only a few weeks ago in relation to the budgetary position of the Southern Health Board.  On 12 November Deputy Lyons posed a question about the overdraft of the Southern Health Board.  I should say that last year the Southern Health board said they would be £9,500,000 short.  Deputy O'Hanlon spent a couple of days hitting the Minister over the head because the Southern Health Board would be £9,500,000 short.  The <i>Cork Examiner</i> positively bled blood and lacerated the Minister because of the £9,500,000 last year that the Southern Health Board would be down.  I was the devil incarnate, <Col N="2651" /> putting old people out into the streets of Cork without a shilling being paid to the hospitals concerned.  What is the reality? The eventual excess for last year, as recorded in the abstract of accounts of the Southern Health Board, was £0.825 million.</P>

      <P>There was reference to St. Vincent's Hospital.  I can assure the Deputies here that I met the medical board of St. Vincent's Hospital last week.  I made very substantial funds available to that board. I do not propose to disclose the amount because it probably would not be believed, but the Deputy could go and ask them.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party have continually criticised me for allegedly failing to provide sufficient funds for the health services.  Yet the same party propose to have an overall 35 per cent tax band.  Equally that party have a view that the current budget deficit must be substantially reduced.  They come into this House and, time and time again, put forward proposals which are totally unsustainable in terms of the health services themselves.  Time and again the party trot into Leinster House and, like a chameleon, change their colours according to the way the wind is blowing.  One day we have Fianna Fáil Deputies claiming credit for a new hospital in Arklow.  The next day they want to have a fully fledged new maternity unit in Bantry.  Then they change track and, depending on who the leader of the party may have met in what hospital corridor, they want a new paediatric unit in Roscommon.  The day after that they must have another three surgeons and another two physicians in <Col N="2653" /> Monaghan.  The following day they want an extra £3 million for the Mater Hospital, money which was never even asked for but it does not matter because it is perceived to be a hospital of special concern to the leader of the party and he sheds public tears for the hospital, and then off it goes.</P>
      <P>Tonight we had it again.  Deputy O'Hanlon is a very sane, sensible and, without patronising him, an excellent spokesperson for his party when he is not under pressure.  That is the problem facing the Opposition these days. Nobody knows who will get what job in the event of any change, and the longer it goes on the less likely it is that these jobs will materialise.  Therefore, today we have a proposal that we should extend the long-term illness scheme by allocating £10 million for asthma sufferers and about £16 million for treatment benefit and dental and optical benefit for the spouses of insured workers.  All of that is done while Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, the totally separated member of the party from Tipperary, tells us in <i>Success</i> magazine &mdash; a rather minor magazine but a rather major prospective Minister for Finance &mdash; that he is going to slash the current budget deficit, cut public expenditure. Here we go, a party of multiple contradictions who have received over £700,000 in taxpayers' money to do basic fundamental research for policy, with not a shred of policy document yet in terms of real healthcare in the community.  I do not blame Deputy O'Hanlon for that. His party leader does not want policy documents.  He only proposes to expose them to the light of day for about three weeks of a general election; that precious flower can only bloom for three weeks and is not allowed to be examined or admired by any other politican on this side of the House for any longer period because it might wilt under the gaze of those who critically examine it.</P>

      <P>For a moment I thought I was at a flower show rather than in a political forum.  I want to get back to another allegation made by the Deputy here.  It is alleged I am cutting back on services for the mentally handicapped. This is a glorious one.  Nothing could be more emotionally contrived.  We have the friends of the mentally handicapped, the parents of the mentally handicapped, the unfortunate persons themselves, a caring Irish society, a political party with a long tradition of care for the development of the health services, and the big bad Minister with the finger of Fine Gael on him, and he himself at this stage almost related and married into Margaret Thatcher's family, here cutting the services for the mentally handicapped.</P>

The figures are that when the Deputy left office in 1981 expenditure on the mentally handicapped was £56.5 million or 6.6 per cent of total State expenditure.

To give a breakdown, at this stage we are giving about £73 million a year for care in the special homes for the mentally handicapped. For those in day care centres we are spending £8 million a year.  For the care of the mentally handicapped by health boards we are spending £29 million a year.  Throughout the country we are making very substantial contributions towards those who are mentally handicapped.</P>

      <P>It is expensive to care for a mentally handicapped person in a residental centre.  It costs on average £12,000 a year, although that can be substantially higher.  I do not propose to spend much more time on this because I find it nauseating that I have to pass through the city of Dublin and see, on a very costly Fianna Fáil poster, that the health cuts are hitting the handicapped. That is scandalous in terms of the upset it causes to the mentally handicapped who live in hostels in the Greater Dublin area who pass by such posters and may be able to perceive them; above all else, it is desperately upsetting to the families of those concerned, and it is a gross political travesty of the truth.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil would be better to desist from that kind of activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that there has been a spectacular growth in expenditure on the health services over the past decade.  In 1973-74 we were spending only about £144 million or 5.2 per cent of GNP.  Today, we are spending £1,300 million or well over 7 per cent of GNP.  We are spending 20 per cent of out net State expenditure on the health services.  For practical purposes there has been a reduction in real terms of 1 per cent, and that is all.  We have kept up the level of services and rather than a failure to support the services it represents a very firm basis for a rational development of the services in accordance with Government policy.  If the Deputies do not believe me, I will give them the straight figures.  In 1982 it was £999 million; in 1983 it was £1,091 million; in 1984 it was £1,156 million; in 1985 it was <Col N="2657" /> £1,245 million and in 1986 £1,300 million is the estimated outturn figure.</P>
    <P>This is a real level of funding of the health services &mdash; we have extended them in a real sense.  I have provided a new centre for a national transplant unit in St. Vincent's in Dublin.  We have renal dialysis centres, which will not be closed down, in Ardkeen and in Sligo General Hospital, in the Limerick Regional Hospital and the Letterkenny General Hospital.  I have seen the outstanding work being done by the staffs in these hospitals.  We have had a 100 per cent increase since 1982 in cardiac procedures in the Mater Hospital, accommodating 1,000 a year.  As Deputy Wyse well knows, in Cork Regional Hospital under an outstanding cardiac surgeon they have done about 140 cardiac procedures in a new unit.</P>

      <P>With an increasing ageing population we have new orthopaedic centres, one in Croom, one is being developed in Cappagh, one in Cork and a new regional unit in Tullamore.  We never hear a word about them because at grassroots level Fianna Fáil are grovelling with chagrin at the fact that we can produce that in a recession.  We have provided major geriatric and psychiatric units in Dundrum.  I will bring the Deputies to the hospitals in which we have spent tens of millions of pounds in magnificent new psychiatric and geriatric units.  We have transformed the campus at St. James's <Col N="2658" /> Hospital.  Any Deputies who visit St. James's Hospital will bear me out about the transformation there.</P>
      <P>Last year we spent £1 million on a successful measles vaccination programme through which 90 per cent of the targeted children were covered.  We have provided services for the mentally handicapped. We commenced the new St. Michael's Hospital and did major work in redeveloping St. Patrick's.  We have commenced the building of new residential accommodation for St. Joseph's.

During my period in office I have not indulged in off-the-cuff cuts.  However, I have cut much waste, much unnecessary expenditure on drugs.  I have tried to cut the £11 million on travelling expenses with health board ambulances criss-crossing county boundaries.  I have tried to <Col N="2659" /> control some of the unnecessary overtime. I can turn to Our Lady's Hospital in Cork where I tried to reduce expenditure to rational levels.  I have organised a system whereby I know from day-to-day the exact bank balances of each hospital, whether they be voluntary or health board hospitals.  I have cut out the cant and the hypocrisy.</P>

      <Col N="2660" /> In addition, I introduced legislation to cover the nurses, a dental Bill, the setting up of a National Social Service Board, clinical trials legislation and children care and protection legislation which is now before the House.  I have not been dominated by monetarism or any other &ldquo;ism&rdquo;.  All this needed to be done.  It has been done, it is being done and I will continue on doing this work certainly in the next 12 months and then I think we can do an even better job.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I know what it is like and I am on the Eastern Health Board and I know what it is like.  The Minister gets into his State car at night and drivers off to another planet.  He is not living in the same land as any of us because we are dealing with reality as we find it. The Minister never answered any of the questions raised by our spokesman, Deputy O'Hanlon, or our Deputy spokesman on Health, Deputy Ormonde.  He answered nothing about the banking facilities, the overdrafts, the Taoiseach's statement that there was no <Col N="2661" /> need to close hospital wards.  Talk about Stonewall Jackson.  This is stonewall Desmond.  How that man can stonewall, and he comes out looking great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the realities are that the people outside this House, the unfortunate people who are trying to keep up the services for the mentally handicapped, are not feeling so great.  I am identified closely with many of the organisations of which he spoke in such a despairing manner, saying &ldquo;the friends of this&rdquo;, &ldquo;the friends of that&rdquo;, this parents' association and so on.  It is quite disgraceful because I, working on some of these committees, know how earnest the people are in trying to raise the standards for the mentally handicapped under the institutional care that they are identified with.  For example, I am on the finance committee of Cheeverstown House.  Cheeverstown House is what I would call a dream come true.  It is a magnificent accomplishment.  Our then Minister for Health, Deputy Woods, turned the first sod for Cheeverstown House.  I venture to say that there is not a mentally handicapped complex anywhere in Europe, and you would be hard put to find one in the USA, that would measure up to this magnificent complex, but there are five units, five houses, and only two of them are open and three are still closed because of lack of finance from the Department.  They are taking people in on a daily basis, but there is a great need for full time care for many young mentally handicapped people.  The facilities are there for them.  Those of my colleagues who visited Cheeverstown House said when they saw it that these were the minimum standards required for the care of the mentally handicapped. The people there cannot even get off the ground for lack of funds, while the Department of Health passes the bill over to the Eastern Health Board, gives them the same amount they gave last year and tells them to run it, there is no extra money to open up these units.  I am glad that none of them was here tonight to hear the Minister describe the friends <Col N="2662" /> of Cheeverstown and the parents' committees in the disparaging manner he used.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister that when he came into office he assured NAMHI &mdash; the National Association for Mentally Handicapped of Ireland &mdash; that there would be no deterioration in the services for the mentally handicapped.  He gave that assurance to the top people there.  I have spoken to some of those people and they say that he has reneged completely on that pledge, that the services for the mentally handicapped have declined.  In this House in answer to Deputy O'Hanlon some time ago the Minister admitted that even in the grants to the health boards there had been a decline in real terms and he said that the only health board who had got an increase over and above what they got in the three years previously were the EHB who had got 0.5 per cent.  Our spokesman assures me that that is correct.  Yet the Minister has the gall to come into this House and say that they are all in real terms much better off than they were, when he knows that this is not true.</P>
    <P>I have been appointed to an association of health boards made up of representatives of all the health boards with the exception of the Southern Health Board, the only health board who did not join this.  The seven health boards who formed this association requested a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Desmond. He has refused on all occasions to meet those health boards.  Our deficit on the EHB is £6 million and we do not know how high that will be at the end of the year.  We have had to make cuts at every level.  One does not mind economising where one does not affect the services available, but even on that very valuable little service, the home health scheme, we had to introduce charges on people who found it difficult in the majority of cases &mdash; not in every case &mdash; to come up with money to pay for their home health service, which they had been getting free because they needed it badly.</P>
    <P>We have seen other wonderful organisations affected.  I do not have to tell any Member of this House about the <Col N="2663" /> wonderful work which organisations like the St. John Ambulance Brigade, the Order of Malta and so on do in a voluntary capacity.  If the State had to pay for them we just could not afford it.  They ferry people to and from premises and train young people in first aid.  In my constituency the St. John Ambulance Brigade were asked to pay £14 a night for the use of the health centre where they had been practising first aid.  The health board had no alternative but to make up the money somewhere.  I have made representations and I think the amount was cut down to £7 per night.  We should make facilities available to these people for nothing.  Now they are paying for the privilege of giving their voluntary services to the community.  This is wrong.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister decrying the advertisements which we have.  He can always refer them to the Department of Industry and Commerce to see if we are infringing any of the Acts in regard to wrongful advertising.  I am certain he would like to take us to task on this.  If he took us to court he might find that those advertisements which we have placed are quite justified and in accordance with the facts.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes in here and brazens things out.  Because he makes so few appearances maybe, he funnels all his courage into one great big front that he puts up.  In Dromoland his Secretary had to announce the policy of his Department. Never in my life before had I heard of a Secretary of the Department announcing policy in relation to the Department of Health.  I do not know if it was embarrassing for the Secretary of the Department, but it appeared to me and many others that the Minister was reneging on his responsibilities as a Minister. The author of that policy document was the Secretary of the Department. The document announced the prospective closure of the health boards, again a matter that the Minister should take up.  I had the feeling then that maybe the job was becoming too much for him and he was beginning to run away from it and leave it to others to do.  Certainly <Col N="2664" /> he has shown absolute contempt for the public representatives, for the health boards and for the members of the health boards.  It is disgraceful that he can come into this House and behave with such effrontery.</P>
    <P>I have covered most of the points that I had to cover.  I said to Deputy Ormonde that I would repeat for the record that a decision was made at last Thursday's South Eastern Health Board meeting to raise the overdraft facilities for £7.5 million and that this request had been passed on to the Minister.  The Minister denies any knowledge of this.  The facts are there and can be checked out easily enough.</P>

It appears that he is is not living in the world in which the rest of us live as far as the health services are concerned.  We all know that there have been shortfalls in the services in the last number of years.  If one goes back to 1981 and looks at the allocation provided and compares it with the allocation provided in 1986 it shows that in real terms the cutbacks in health have amounted to 25 per cent.  We cannot sustain a cutback of 25 per cent in the health services and maintain that the health services today are better than they were in 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully subscribe to the Minister's introduction to the report on the Health Services 1983-86 in which he says that the policies relating to community services place a major responsibility on the services provided in the community, that it is freely recognised that with this responsibility must go the funding to <Col N="2665" /> enable it to be born, that this is being done to an increasing extent and that what is expected is a return to the concept of caring and a cure in the community as far as possible.  Nobody would dispute that, but what is the present policy? People are being pushed into the community from acute hospitals, and there are no community services to provide for the needs of the people that have been taken out of the acute hospitals.</P>
    <P>As a member of the North Western Health Board I am fully aware of the difficulties being experienced by the board's management and employees because of the cutbacks that have taken place over the last number of years.  The funding to the health boards must be reconsidered.  The funding to the eight health boards is not equally reflected in each area.  The funding arrangements pursued in relation to the North Western Health Board have militated against the North Western Health Board.  The emphasis in cuts pertain in particular to the non paying section.  We in the North Western Health Board have not the number of acute hospitals they would have in other areas and therefore the pay section must suffer.  That has created a serious strain on the resources of the North Western Health Board.  This has led to great difficulties in a board which followed the policies advocated by the Minister.  We were ahead of most of the health boards in developing community services.  Now we have to cut back on the community services, the service which the Minister claims should be developed. The Minister says that we must cut back on the general hospitals and the acute hospitals and we are expected to transfer that money to the community services. That is not happening.  It cannot happen in the system of administration currently being pursued.</P>
    <P>In the community services, field worker services are more developed in our area than in others.  The cuts which took place last year in the central services was 10 per cent which affected the board of management which in turn affected the return and flow of information.  The <Col N="2666" /> geriatric services had reduced bed numbers and staff numbers.  The district hospitals had to be partly redesignated as geriatric units to allow a reduction in the geriatric hospital budget.  We had to discontinue all transport to the clinics which had a major effect in the north western region, because we depend on transport to bring patients to Dublin. That service had to be scrapped because there was no money to provide that service. That is causing major hardship for many people in north Donegal, north Leitrim and north Sligo.  In the general hospitals they had to reduce by over 100 whole time equivalent staff; one-third of the beds had to be closed for up to three months and whole departments had to be closed for three months resulting in longer waiting lists.  The standard of medical and nursing care and hygiene was reduced and we had to suspend the GP training scheme.  There were major cuts in the hospital staff in psychiatric hospitals &mdash; over 60 whole time equivalents. We had more patients and fewer ward units in order to cut nursing and staffing levels.  We had reduced catering and maintenance staff, all special services within this section were suspended and there was no development of community services.</P>
    <P>We all appreciate that there is a scarcity of money and that certain things have to be reduced but when we are dealing with health we wish to provide the best health service possible.  Unless there is a change of policy within the Department of Health many people will suffer.  Unfortunately, in the region which I represent there will be serious consequences for the people who depend on the health services.  I would refer the Minister to the <i>Dale Tussing Report</i> which states that in the Republic there are 5.59 beds for every 1,000 persons, that only the North Western Health Board is significantly short and that the additional 59 beds in Letterkenny Hospital, assuming no reductions elsewhere in the north western area, will have raised the area's bed total to 786 leaving the percentage ratio at 3.78 per 1,000 of the population.  The report goes on that the North Western Health <Col N="2667" /> Board have the largest proportion of population aged 65 years and over, which normally implies a higher demand on hospital resources and that therefore the north western region in spite of recent expansion is still underserved in hospital services.  The North Western Health Board area has the largest population over 65 and also has a large population of young children.  Unfortunately under the system which has been operated by the Department of Health over the last number of years, the north western region has suffered the most.  Their overrun this year will be £1 million.  We were not able to contain the budget within the cut handed down from the Department. I would ask the Minister to review the financing of the health boards.  It is criminal to penalise people in the north western region in this way having regard to the fact that they have developed the community services and have operated to a fair degree within their budget.  Unfortunately the only recompense they have from the Department is continual cuts, to the extent of 25 per cent since 1981.</P>

      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I was making a comparison between the failure of CIE to adapt, modernise, change and reschedule their whole programme of services with the development of the country over the years.  The private bus operators stepped into this vacuum and filled it admirably. Consequently, CIE must now compete. Of course competition is the life of trade, it is good for the consumer and for an efficient and effective service.  I have every confidence in the expertise and ability of CIE to adapt to this challenge and to give a good service to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school bus transport scheme needs <Col N="2668" /> a major overhaul.  My party's position is very clear in that regard.  With the advent of free education in the late sixties Fianna Fáil give a commitment and made a contribution to equality of opportunity for all the people, especially the young.  We also made a school transport service available which ensured that the children in the remotest areas would have the same opportunities as those in vast centres of population.  Our policy has not changed and we are and will remain committed to that service.  There has been much talk over the past few years of a change in that area.  Charges for school transport were introduced which put pressure on many families who could not afford them.  CIE inspectors should be given greater discretion in regard to day-to-day decisions.  We are fortunate that in my area we have excellent officers fronting the scheme.  Unfortunately, all matters must be referred to Dublin for a decision as they are operating the system for the Minister for Education and, therefore, are subject to the criteria laid down by the Minister and the Department. However, the people in the areas involved have a better knowledge of the problems than the Department.</P>
    <P>In certain cases people are prepared to pay for the school transport system but, on many occasions, there is a great delay in issuing travel passes to the pupils involved.  Indeed, sometimes they are not accepted.  The regional provincial staff know what is required in any given location and how to get the best value for money.  The school transport fleet is rundown and there is an urgent need for major capital investment to ensure that it is updated and modernised to meet the demands of a growing population.  Many buses have become obsolete and are not used any more.  Instead of providing new buses.  CIE provide the same service with fewer buses, leading to more runs being down by individual buses and drivers. The Government have not made funds available for new buses.  There is now an inequitable demand on the people who have to use these services.  Many children are picked up at 7.30 a.m. to be taken to school and they must wait in its environs <Col N="2669" /> for maybe the best part of an hour until it opens.  They are not covered by insurance until the school is officially opened.  All this creates problems which would be solved by expanding and modernising the fleet.</P>
    <P>Catchment areas need to be examined as they were drafted fairly quickly in the late sixties to meet the demand.  In many cases no cognisance was taken of the fact that parishes were divided and that sections were added to other areas.  The social and geographical structure, the traditional, business, economic development and the direction in which people went to do their business were not taken into account.  Pupils from the same parish could go to three different second level schools or to two different national schools because of the way the system operates.  This does not suit many families who have gone to the same school for generations.  There is not enough flexibility in the scheme in that regard.  My constituency in East Galway is long and sprawling and a number of areras around Kiltormer, Menlough, Ballybane, Monivea and Woodford experience these difficulties. These are big parishes and, in some instances, are fairly close to national schools in the next parish. However, they have traditionally gone to their own national schools and transport is not available to them although, in some cases, they are prepared to pay for it.</P>
    <P>Compassion is not shown to people who have medical problems.  I know of a case where one parent is seriously ill and who cannot provide a service for the children who have to walk a mile or so to be taken to school by bus.  This problem could be solved by diverting the bus to an alternative stop to pick up nine or ten children who live on that road.</P>
    <P>The top management in Dublin who make the decisions have always looked on the west as a drag on the rail services. The goods station in Athenry has been closed.  Tuam, Claremorris, Loughrea, Gort and several other smaller stations have also been closed.  The thinking seems to be that Athlone should become the distribution centre for the west.  I would like to say that so far as we in the <Col N="2670" /> west are concerned.  Athlone is in the midlands and we do not want any further downgrading of the services available to the people of the west.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind CIE that Galway city is almost 70 miles from the furthest point west in our county.  The Aran Islands are still further out.  They, too, have to do business.  They need a service.  We do not want the freight services terminated at Athlone.  Should that happen we would find ourselves having to take our goods from there on in by road.  There is an excellent railway station in Ballinasloe where there is tremendous potential for expansion and development. Athenry is a very good railway station on a junction.  A line which is now seldom used is the Limerick-Sligo line. There is no reason why along with the excellent facilities of Galway railway station we cannot do better business and ensure that the west receives its fair share of opportunities and services from the State.  We must ensure that investment in the national transport services is distributed evenly right across the country. The growing towns and cities in the west which is a disadvantaged area will, with assistance and incentives respond and create their own economic development. If the level of State service and investment is any way reasonable and positive we will respond to the challenge.  We will help to build our own economy and create opportunities for our people.  We have done that over the years and we have survived, but we do not want any further impositions or cutbacks in our efforts to improve our own environment and economy.</P>
    <P>There seems to be an attitude in CIE to close down some services that were available heretofore.  I am talking about services in the twenties, thirties, forties, fifties, sixties and into the seventies.  The company gave various commitments that alternative services would be made available but those alternative services were either not adequate or failed to attract a demand from the consumer in particular areas because they were not programmed and were not up to the level of service which was available previously.  For <Col N="2671" /> example, the Sligo-Limerick line and the Loughrea branch line closed down. Attymon station was a very important junction in the heart of County Galway. It serviced Loughrea which had its own line and which is still an excellent business and commercial town despite the ravages of the present economic climate and despite the fact that many factories and firms have closed down, in particular Tynagh mines.  Given any reasonable effort the town will expand and develop. When that branch line was closed down various commitments were given regarding bus services and alternative road transport services but at the first opportunity those services were taken away.</P>
    <P>Loughrea was left in a vacuum.  It was left without adequate road transport from CIE.  Into that vacuum has come the private bus operator.  As I said earlier, CIE failed to acknowledge the demand and then failed to preserve and sustain the alternative services to which they were committed when they closed down the original services.  As a result of those decisions they lost the goodwill of the consumer and because of bad scheduling and programming did not hold the consumer. Consequently, when another option became available the consumer took it.  One cannot blame the consumer for that and one cannot blame enterprising business people if they avail of an opportunity to provide an adequate service.</P>
    <P>CIE must re-examine their position and commitment and ensure that where they provide a service they can sustain, expand and retain it but if they take away one service the alternative must be good enough to satisfy the consumer and sustain and preserve the goodwill and the business of consumers in the area concerned. Attymon Junction, which is my local station, was a very busy junction over the years but very few trains stop there now.  Since I entered this House in 1982 I have been trying to persuade CIE to provide a better service in that area.  I am concerned that the plans CIE have for that area may denude the people of mid-Galway of services in the future. <Col N="2672" /> Attymon Junction serviced south, mid east and mid north Galway.</P>
    <P>I want to say to CIE that if they have plans in that direction we do not want to see them progress.  Instead we want to see an acknowledgement of the level of support which was given to them over the years in that area.  We want practical stopping times geared to getting the maximum number of people in that area to use CIE's services, westwards towards Galway city and eastwards towards Ballinasloe, Athlone and Dublin at the proper times.</P>
    <P>CIE have a major role to play in the industrial area.  CIE through DART provide a very good service in Dublin, as I have acknowledged earlier in my contribution. The CIE rail service have a good opportunity to carry passengers from Athlone westwards to Galway. Athlone is a very important pivotal point for CIE.  It is an area from which they could start to provide a service, passing through Ballinasloe and picking up many of the industrial workers and public servants from Woodlawn, Attymon and Athenry who work in Galway city.  CIE should consider this type of service.</P>
    <P>The time has come to use smaller trains in areas such as this, smaller buses in country areas and to provide a faster, more efficient and practical service.  If we examine this area the demand is there.  If the prices are right, CIE will attract the consumer and provide services in areas in which there are no services now.  The rail lines run from one area of high population to another.  They run through sparsely populated areas in which the private companies may not be operating so there would be a major opportunity for CIE to provide a service to those areas.  That would be to CIE's commercial benefit.  I would appeal to the management of CIE to consider that type of service in the future.  CIE have a role to play in getting such people quickly and safely to their work.  The company should direct their energies to providing services in rural areas.</P>
    <P>It is time that the company considered using smaller vehicles on rural routes. The bus schedules should be reorganised <Col N="2673" /> to ensure that workers in rural areas can avail of public transport to and from work.  I am aware that buses leave Galway city at 4.30 p.m. and 5 p.m. with very few passengers but if they waited for another hour they would be able to take people home from work.  It is important that the company make every effort to attract more passengers.  An early morning service would also be used by workers going to Galway city.  We must acknowledge, however, that the private operator has stepped into the vacuum and it would be unfair of CIE to deprive them of the routes they have built up.  CIE should not have a monopoly.  We must have private development with public service expansion.</P>
    <P>The Government pay a lot of money to private operators to provide a school bus service in rural areas and it is only right that it should be a good one.  CIE do not have suitable buses for such routes.  I note that in 1983 the Department paid £12.5 million to private operators for the school transport service and I presume that figure will rise to about £20 million this year.  Some of those operators have expanded and are now competing with CIE on ordinary routes.  It was unfair of the company to take some school runs from those private operators in an effort to put pressure on them to abandon profitable routes.  I do not welcome that development.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education should review the operation of the school bus service and arrange for all buses to stop at the schools the children are attending. At present the buses stop at centres in the towns but some children may have to travel a further mile to the school. Children are refused the use of that service because they are less than three miles from the centre although they may live more than three miles from the school. The maximum number of children should be permitted to avail of the school bus service.  I appreciate that those living within one mile of a school should not be taken on the buses but those living any further away should be accommodated. It is possible that the centres used by the buses were chosen because of the amount <Col N="2674" /> of parking available but it would be better if the buses were directed to travel to all schools.  The children in Loughrea should be brought to the school gates and not let off at the centre.  Those children have to walk up to half a mile from the centre to the school.  There are two excellent coeducational second level schools in that town and they are well attended.  The children using the school bus service to those schools should be let off at the school gate so that they can start their classes warm and dry.  I hope the Minister will review the school bus service.</P>
    <P>The school bus fleet should be modernised. I was disappointed to learn that work at GAC at Shannon, formerly Bombardier, who were building the CIE buses, is almost at a standstill.  That has had a drastic effect on the economic life of my area because many local firms supplied materials to that company.  There is a need to replace many buses in the school fleet and there is no reason why the company cannot be asked to build more buses.  We have the expertise to build better buses and the Government should provide the money for them.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me if I did not acknowledge, on behalf of the people in my area, the tremendous co-operation I got when dealing with the general manager of CIE, Mr. Higgins.  Since I was elected to the House.  I have been trying to have the rail service in my area improved.  I was the only public representative who sought an improvement in the east Galway area and I was happy when the threat that hung over the Woodlawn station was removed.  The service to that station is very good.  The decision by CIE in May to have the 6.25 p.m. train from Galway to Heuston stop at Woodlawn was a good one and we are grateful to the company for that.  I am sure a survey in the area will show that the service is being availed of.  I hope a similar arrangement can be made in regard to Attymon station on the Galway side. That busy junction station was closed when it lost the Loughrea branchline. However, I am sure the many people who work in local industries would avail of the rail service if that station was reopened. <Col N="2675" /> The population figures have been stable for many years and I am sure there is a demand for the service.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said that before CIE make drastic decisions such as the closure of stations or lines they invest a lot of capital.  These decisions are based on a high capital investment and low demand for service.  It is suggested that stations are upgraded, updated and modernised, often to be closed down in subsequent years.  I hope that never has been and never will be the situation.  I hope capital investment is put into the service and that the company will continue to upgrade and modernise their stations, having them looking attractive, which makes a contribution to the development of tourism and of the whole environment.  They are a national company, a semi-State body.  Over the years CIE station masters and many of their staff have made a personal contribution to tourism and the development of the country by the way in which stations have been maintained and the high level of services given.</P>
    <P>Finally, CIE have the capacity and capability to establish themselves as the national State transport company.  Two companies are adequate in order to reorganise CIE into the transport service they should be for the nation, that is, all rail and rural buses should be in one company and the Dublin metropolitan bus services in another.  They have the expertise and knowledge and given a positive, practical, vigorous approach and the necessary capital investment, with Government security and initiative, collectively as a semi-State body with State support there is no reason why CIE cannot continue to be the premier transport company in our land.</P>

      <P>Cuireann sé áthas orm cur leis an mBille seo, Bille Iompair (Córas Iompair Éireann a Atheagrú), 1986.  Is í an chúis leis an áthas sin ná go dtugann sé ócáid dom a rá gur thosnaigh mé mó shaol oibre le Córas Iompair Eireann i gCorcaigh.  Chomh maith leis sin, tugann sé an ócáid duinn féachaint siar ar cad a <Col N="2676" /> tharla ó bunaíodh CIE, cad atá ag tarlú faoi láthair agus cad atá beartaithe sa Bhille seo.</P>
      <P>Gan aon dabht tá go leor eolais le fáil a bhailigh daoine, muintir na gceard cumann, ach go háirithe, an Roinn, agus chuile dhuine nach iad, chun cur leis an mBille seo, chun tuairimí a thabhairt don Aire, don Rialtas, i dtreo an Bhille seo.</P>
      <P>The opportunity to speak on this Bill allows me to indicate at the outset that I began my working life with Córas Iompair Éireann.  Naturally, even from a distance, I always maintained that affinity, that sense of belonging to the national transport organisation.  There are many factors to be considered in this Bill.  Principal among those I would consider to be that the action proposed by the Minister will not create the situation, by fragmenting CIE, that we will have a less efficient service &mdash; a less efficient social service &mdash; and this is an aspect that we must keep in mind.  The Minister in his opening speech made reference to CIE being founded during the war period.  I do not know what relevance that has except historical relevance, but I am aware that the coming into being of the national transport organisation was to provide a service for all the people.</P>
      <P>From the record, from my experience in CIE and from the people who came in from the various companies, at that time the profitable routes were being diligently pursued by the private operators like a race track along some of the roads and, of course, the non-profitable routes were being totally ignored.  The Minister and people in Government at that time saw the need to co-ordinate the transport facilities into a national organisation. That was principally the basis on which Córas Iompar Eireann were formed.  It would be a retrograde step if the proposal now before us in this Bill were to cause that company to disintegrate into more units than are required to provide a transport service for the people.  There are many factors to be considered in this proposal, the principal one of which I have just outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also take into account the opinions of the workforce in CIE as <Col N="2677" /> expressed by all their trade unions.  We have read comments from the trade union movement, especially the unions in CIE, that having considered the Government's legislation on the proposed re-organisation of CIE, they support the ideal of renewal and improvement of CIE services.  They go further to say that in their opinion this Bill is not the best approach.  In their comments at that time they made reference to section 29, which has now to all intents and purposes disappeared from the Bill, having gone through the Seanad. This Bill was no different from the Industrial Development Authority Bill which I debated here with the Minister in that the negotiating for salaries, pay and conditions was to be taken out of the hands of the trade unions movement and handed over to the Government, or the Minister as nominee of the Government.</P>
    <P>It is a welcome sign that our earlier objections to that course of activity by the Government have been upheld and that that Government approach has also been removed from this Bill.  The trade unions made a statement to the effect that they were disappointed that the Government, in drafting the Bill, totally ignored the views of the CIE workforce. The views of consultants and reports from various people were sought, but the views of the workforce in the system were not considered by the Government.  That indeed is regrettable.  The trade union movement indicated that they were critical of the proposal to separate the various sections of CIE into independent organisations under the Companies Act.  I acknowledge their fear of that element of the Bill.  In the light of the experience of the taxpayers and the workers of, for instance, Irish Shipping, CIE workers see a possible parallel in the splintering off of the national transport authority into various companies under the Companies Act.  Therefore, they see a danger of some sections receiving the same treatment as Irish Shipping.  Their fears in that direction are well founded.</P>
    <P>The separating of the railway and the provincial bus service is not practical, in the opinion of the workers.  We on this <Col N="2678" /> side of the House also say that.  It has been the thrust of our spokesman's contribution that the provincial bus and rail services should form the nucleus of one company, while the Dublin metropolitan area should form the basis of the other. I share the view that it is not practical to divorce the railway and the provincial bus services.</P>
    <P>Perhaps people in the Dublin area are not aware of the situation in rural areas. They should at least be made aware of the fact that many of the services in CIE are joint facilities as between rail and bus.  I doubt if it is necessary for me to analysis or go into greater detail, except to say that in rural Ireland the transport facilities are shared by rail and bus services. If we have two separate companies, there will be costly duplication and an eventual deterioration of the service to provincial communities.  I hope the Minister and the Government will consider that aspect in their proposal to divide the provincial bus and rail services.</P>
    <P>I will deal further with the case put forward by the workers.  The splitting of CIE into a restructured form will lead to a duplication of many administrative services and will not be to the advantage of the company, its employees or the public.  There is a great danger in the proposed plan that subsidiary companies could be liquidated or placed in receivership. A package of retrenchment measures on the passenger rail side can only mean the closure of passenger rail services throughout the State.  There were closures of railway lines in the past and it was realised shortly afterwards that an error of judgment had been made. Branch lines are not being utilised to the fullest and there have been reductions in use, threatened closures and closures.</P>
    <P>The Cork-Youghal railway line going through east Cork conveyed sugar beet to the factory at Mallow.  Youghal is a seaside resort which was always accessible to the people of Cork city who could not go to the sun spots of Spain or Ballybunion because they could not afford it. Those times have come again because of unemployment in the city of Cork. Despite our best efforts to persuade CIE <Col N="2679" /> to open that line during the summer they failed to do so.  As recently as 24 October 1983, it was indicated to me in a letter that the summer Sunday season excursion trains were withdrawn because of the shortage of rolling stock in the system. Most of the stock was then 20 or 25 years old and, as the fall-out increased because of obsolescence, priority had to be given to the mainline services.  Consequently, the lightly-used and seasonal services had to be curtailed.</P>
    <P>It was in this context that the Sunday service on the Youghal line had to be withdrawn.  To alleviate any inconvenience to the Cork public, bus services were introduced between Cork and Youghal and the support for that service was very encouraging.  Let us picture ourselves getting on a train in Cork and going to Youghal for a day at the seaside, as many people in Cork did through the years.  I am sure we all accept it would be much easier for a father and mother and a handful of children to get on a train rather than use the bus service.  Nevertheless the bus service was well supported. How can we explain to the people of Cork that we could not afford to run the Youghal summer season excursions for want of rolling stock?  I doubt that the supply of rolling stock on that line would cost millions of pounds.  How is that perceived by the people of that area when we can spend many millions of pounds in other areas?</P>
    <P>The last paragraph of that letter said that in the intervening years there has been several meetings with public representatives on that matter but, as the availability of rolling stock continued to decline, the summer Sunday excursions on the Youghal line could not be restored.  What have we as public representatives from the Cork area to offer those people who want to avail of the summer season excursion?  What sort of guarantee can we give them?  What sort of hope can we give them that, by splitting CIE into two separate authorities, the train and the bus service, they will have a better transport service?  Where is the rolling stock we had when the new <Col N="2680" /> inter-city trains went on track?  I am asking these questions because they are very relevant.  Let what I am saying be taken as an example for other areas where it is being proposed, considered, or even forcast that there will be rail line closures.</P>
    <P>It is well known that a reduction in train services, coupled with no substantial investment in railways, will lead to the demise of the national rail system over a relatively short period.  We must guard against that eventuality.  I am glad this Bill gives us the opportunity to state the current position and the likelihood of what the future holds.</P>
    <P>Limitations on expenditure must, of course, impact on safety provisions in respect of railways.  I welcome the express routes.  There is a new emphasis on the development of this new efficient service but the question is often asked: at what cost to the existing services and to the rail system?  I just pose that question.</P>
    <P>CIE is a key factor in our economy because, as well as providing the necessary transport service in its global form, the social content is a very important aspect of the system.  They also provide thousands of jobs directly and indirectly. The failure to create a genuine transport policy with full and adequate investment damages national effectiveness; it impairs profitability; it reduces productivity; and it impinges on growth and investment.  I have yet to be convinced that the proposal before us in this Bill will go anywhere near creating a transport policy.  We have seen enough reports on transport and gained a great deal of experience in this area since 1944 when CIE were set up.  It behoves us to use our experience along the lines I have just mentioned &mdash; investment, effectiveness, profitability, productivity and growth. They are the key factors in any national transport policy.</P>
    <P>It is my honest opinion that the Transport Union, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the other unions in CIE have made very valuable submissions but it appears that the Minister has not taken a great deal of notice of what they were saying.  One of the fears expressed in one <Col N="2681" /> of their contributions was that the social aspect of CIE's operations, both urban and rural, would be neglected and that there would be no regard for the welfare or job security of the workforce.  That uncertainty existed in CIE when I began my working life there.  In the intervening period, right up to 30 April 1986, we still had not got away from that uncertainty in CIE.  I have yet to be convinced that the proposal before us will do just that, and I have grave doubts.</P>
    <P>The wording of the Bill conflicts with the promise given by the Minister for Communications to a Congress deputation at a meeting on 29 October 1985, and confirmed subsequently by letter dated 8 November 1985.  I hope the Minister's advisers and the Minister of State have taken particular notice of what I have just said and I would appreciate it if the Minister would give a specific reply &mdash; not a woolly, washy, diverging reply, but a specific reply to the points I have just raised.</P>
    <P>The thrust of our spokesman's contribution on this matter has been for the establishment of two companies rather than three and we are not alone in that view.  A communication I have had from the CIE trades union group secretary stated that the Congress amendment to alter the restructuring proposals to two companies rather than three was clearly intended to protect the strength and flexibility of the existing rail and road passenger services.  I want to reiterate the necessity to examine the remainder of the country outside Dublin, particularly with the establishment of the Dublin Metropolitan Authority.  I shall deal with that matter later and the involvement of the streets commission under the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>We must realise &mdash; and the Minister must take note of the fact &mdash; that road passenger services throughout the country feed into mainline rail services and <i>vice versa.</i> That co-ordination is one of the country's principal attractions for thousands of passengers.  While there are area passenger managers and their responsibilities, there are numerous <Col N="2682" /> other examples of district managers, station masters, clerical, supervisory and operational staff attached to rail having a direct involvement in the road passenger services.  It is a fact also that in a number of provincial locations control points, booking offices, other office accommodation, rest rooms, waiting rooms nad so on are shared by road passenger and rail operative staff.  How does the Minister propose to accommodate that co-ordination in the proposed division?  For example, does he intend to provide the same services for the two groups?  A similar criterion would apply to the existing maintenance services which is where I have the experience.  These maintenance services are provided by the various provincial garages.  It is an established fact that much of the savings and cost reductions achieved in recent times at provincial locations have been brought about because of the umbrella negotiation procedures applicable in the relevant districts and so on.  Perhaps the Minister has in mind closing down Capwell.  I would not agree with that proposal, even if only for the sake of sentiment.</P>
    <P>I contend that the present co-ordinated structure is more conducive to the resolution of such problems than having to deal with separate units and groups of staff.  If it is the Minister's intention to have outright competition between the two services it would be absolutely fatal to break up CIE since the company have a much better chance of competing as an integrated unit.  By that I mean an integrated unit, comprised of the bus services, provincial bus services, rail and road freight remaining as one company. If they are to be divided, has the Minister considered the position with regard to the existing jobs in CIE?  The unions have indicated they are prepared, to negotiate a major reorganisation of the existing management structure.  Indeed the chairman of CIE, Mr. Paul Conlon, has stated repeatedly that the key issue facing the Government is the recognition of the social role of public transport while ensuring that internal operational efficiencies are maximised.  I could not <Col N="2683" /> agree more.  I have said on a number of occasions that the social aspect of the formulation of CIE and its ongoing transport system are of the utmost importance. The maximisation of operational efficiencies will be welcomed by everybody. It is quite apparent that flexibility exists already in the company in that the road passenger function is well integrated with that of the rail function.  Also, the impractabilities and difficulties in separating the two are limitless.  Therefore, there is no valid reason that the revised reorganisation structures proposed by the consultants could not be amended to a two-tier subsidiary company structure plus, if wished, a holding company.  The transport salaried staff association who cater for management staff have indicated they do not envisage any major difficulty in negotiating a major overhaul of the present management organisation under that umbrella.</P>
    <P>The chairman of CIE is on record as saying that CIE are now engaged in an attempt to identify all of their social services and to quantify each in financial terms.  I agree wholeheartedly with that endeavour.  I am also to understand that the trade unions would contend that, that in accordance with the terms of reference of <i>Building on Reality 1985-87</i> the two firms of consultants, Messrs Arthur Anderson and Co. and Craig, Gardner, who drew up reports targeting for overall staff reductions of approximately 500 &mdash; most of which have already been achieved &mdash; were also required not only to make proposals for restructuring but to ensure that the new organisational structures were cost-effective.  Everybody in the country accepts there is a clear need for cost-effectiveness in what has been &mdash; and is likely to continue to be &mdash; this country's only transport semi-State organisation.  It should be stressed again that the services of CIE are operating at least as efficiently as they were ten years ago in which period we witnessed the shedding of almost 6,000 jobs.  This is a frightening thought.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that every public representative is familiar with requests to CIE.  I have a file on it from which I took <Col N="2684" /> a few random examples.  I have already dealt with one of them.  The second factor on which I wish to put emphasis is the public whom we serve.  This is the part of my contribution where I will become involved, not in a parochial sense but in a constituency sense.  I must indicate at this stage that in Cork there is an area manager by the name of Barry Kehoe who is second to none.  He goes out of his way to help to provide a service, in most cases a social service.  CIE have no trouble with the paying routes so naturally, they will stay.  The problems arise for CIE with the non-profit making routes which, as I indicated at the beginning of my contribution, were part and parcel, with the co-ordinating of the transport facilities which existed at the time of the setting up of CIE, of the principal reason for setting up the company.  What was being set up was a national organisation funded by subsidy from the Exchequer which would provide the social service, the service that was required along routes that were not paying their way.  It has been CIE's attitude in recent years, despite the subsidy, to discontinue the service in parts of rural Ireland because the routes conserned were not paying routes.</P>
    <P>I accept that the area manager and his staff in Cork, despite their best intentions and commitment to the people they serve, have run into financial problems in the operation of the services.  This proposal should guarantee that in future Barry Kehoe and his staff will be in a better position to provide the service that is required for people who do not have transport of their own.  That is the principal factor especially with regard to bus services.  When I realised that a bus service was taken off a route outside Cork city, in a place called Kerry Pike, I wrote to Mr. Barry Kehoe, the area manager. He replied:</P>
    <P>... I regret of course, that the withdrawal of the service will be a cause of great concern to the parents and children who use the service, but in view of the foregoing I regret having to confirm that it is not proposed to <Col N="2685" /> reintroduce the service on the reopening of schools on 1st September.</P>
    <P>The reason given in the earlier part of the letter that the bus service was not well supported despite an increase in housing in that area, that it was mainly school children who used the service and that the major factor was that only a very small number of children, normally between ten and 20, travelled from Kerry Pike and that this number was not sufficient to justify a service, especially during peak hours.  I quote from that letter to exemplify a situation in which a bus is removed from a route with no more than an expression of regret to the parents and children.  When we talk of treating all our children equally, we should mean what we say and not proceed to treat some more equally than others. In fairness to the staff, the service I speak of was reintroduced for a trial period. That is just one example of what happens when CIE, as they are at present constituted, are short of money.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer also to a bus service which served people going to Mass on Sundays.  It is in the Leemount area of my constituency.  I received a letter from Mr. Barry Kehoe on 21 May 1985 which stated:</P>
    <P>As you are aware we are under severe financial constraints to ensure that we remain within the Government Subvention for the current year.  As a result it has been necessary to effect economies and all services have to be looked at specially.  It was found that, particularly on Sunday mornings, the level of support for some services has been declining.</P>
    <P>That letter taken in this context alone might not mean much to many people, especially to the Minister and his advisers but what it means is that a service for people who do not have their own transport to get to mass on a Sunday morning has been discontinued.  I keep making the point that part of the setting up of CIE was to provide such a service.</P>
    <P>Lest anybody think that the cutting back in CIE's services applied totally to rural areas I would remind the House <Col N="2686" /> that a bus service was discontinued also in the Montenotte area of Cork.  After requests by local public representatives, including myself, the reply we received from Mr. Barry Kehoe was:</P>
    <P>It has now been decided to take into account the above area when carrying out a review of our services during the summer months.  I can assure you that the points put forward by you will be given every consideration.</P>
    <P>This is an old residential area of Cork city high up on the side of a hill but our transport authority, through lack of finance and despite the fears expressed by residents of the area, expect senior citizens in that part of the city to tramp up that hill.  CIE could not afford to run a bus up there.  In a reply on 8 March 1985 in connection with Parklands Estate, Commons Road, Cork, the Area Manager, Mr. Kehoe, said:</P>
    <P>I refer to previous correspondence and I am pleased to inform you that our plans have now been finalised.</P>
    <P>An additional service will depart Monday to Friday inclusive from Parklands at 11.30 hours and return from Patrick Street at 14.45 hours.</P>
    <P>Parklands is within the city boundary of Cork city and is a new mixed housing development consisting of private and local authority housing, and all CIE could provide is a bus going in the morning at 11.30 and returning at 14.45.  I wrote to the area manager again on 30 September and got the following reply:</P>
    <P>We have been monitoring the development at Fairhill with a view to an extension of the No.  3 service.</P>
    <P>The letter went on:</P>
    <P>However I am sure you will appreciate that with the present constraints on the Company's financial resources, additional or improved services must be self-financing and consequently we must be prudent before committing ourselves to additional costs.</P>
    <P>This possible extension on Fairhill would be of some benefit to Parklands <Col N="2687" /> residents.  The lay-out of the new area however is not yet suitable to allow us to consider the extension...</P>
    <P>This is a very hilly side of our city with hundreds of houses.  Because of financial constraints, CIE are unable to provide a public transport service to that area.</P>
    <P>Now, when the people of Cork city and the rest of the country read about the break-up of CIE, their uppermost thought will be whether there is any chance of a bus with the new crowd taking over.  To be honest, I could not indicate that the proposals in this Bill would give any hope to those areas.  The present CIE organisation are financially restricted in providing a social service for the people who do not have their own transport although they were set up to provide a satisfactory, cost effective transport service for areas that need it as a social service.</P>
    <P>There is already a shortage of financial resources in the city of Cork due to the devastation that has taken place there.  In fairness to Barry Kehoe and his staff they would, if there were no financial restrictions, provide a service to areas of the city that need it.  People in those areas, by virtue of the massive unemployment and the further cutdown in social welfare benefits as from this week, have no hope of paying for transport.  All that is available to them is to hire taxis.</P>
    <P>Other Ministers are making a hoo-ha about going to Cork &mdash; we had one on Friday and another yesterday.  Let the Minister or the Minister of State go to Patrick Street to see the unfortunate people who have not got a bus service to Fairhill or Parklands.  With their plastic bags of provisions they have to hire taxis &mdash; there are not even facilities for shopping in those areas and they must go into the centre of the city to do their shopping. Yet CIE because of financial restrictions, cannot provide a bus for them.  They have to hire taxis out of their meagre income and many of them will have that reduced as from this week.  There is no point in the Minister saying on the radio that some thousands of people will have more when <Col N="2688" /> the people of the constitutency I represent in Cork are not convinced of that.</P>
    <P>I indicated my affinity with CIE, having been an apprentice with them.  I will not accept statements made in and outside this House to the effect that Fianna Fáil in 1982 decided to adopt the McKinsey report, nor did our Minister in the Department at that time, Deputy John Wilson, so decide.  It is my understanding from his predecessor, Deputy Reynolds, that such a decision was not taken despite the fact that it was indicated that Fianna Fáil had intended to adopt the McKinsey report.</P>
    <P>The principal element that caused doubt in CIE over the years has been the financial aspect.  From my own time there and from ongoing contact with contemporaries, I know that if there is one decision to be made in the breaking-up of CIE it is in regard to eliminating that financial constraint and it will be difficult to do that.  If the Government can spend millions of pounds on one location not far from here and have no money to provide a bus to Fairhill, then the Minister is in trouble.</P>
    <P>There are four major requirements in regard to public transport: transport planning, budgeting, traffic management and the provision of public transport services.  I am of the opinion that the Bill will not meet any of these requirements. If there is to be any hope of success, the Minister should accept the views of those who have said that the dissecting should be in two parts rather than three because it is suicidal to divorce the railways from the bus services.  I said earlier I would not let this opportunity go without referring to the problems the other segment of CIE will have, that is, the Dublin Transport Authority.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission Bill will weaken the DTA.  In that Bill the Department of the Environment are making another grab for power in so far as transport infrastructure is concerned, all to the detriment of a developing, efficient and profitable transport company running the Dublin city services.  It <Col N="2689" /> is probably opportune, though undesirable, that the two Bills are before us at the same time.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the social welfare aspect.  If this Bill goes through we will require another Bill to ensure that the facilities introduced by the leader of this party when he was Minister for Social Welfare for our senior citizens &mdash; he made available to them free rail and bus services during cetain times &mdash; will be continued.  Can we be guaranteed that in the new transport set-up the same facilities will be applied to those people?  I said earlier there is a danger that the proposals in the Bill to set up bus and rail undertakings, involving the same dog-fights between the two services which culminated in the proposal to set up a national transport authority, will result in our older citizens being deprived of the facilities they now enjoy.  The same danger would not exist if we had only two instead of three companies involved in our public transport, namely, a joint rail and provincial bus service on the one hand and a Dublin city service on the other.  When I refer to a rail service I include freight and passengers.</P>
    <P>Recently the chairman of CIE laid stress on the proposition that rail sundries and road freight were on trial and he is reported to have said that if they had not made a profit by 31 December 1986 the prevailing thinking was that that section would be closed down.  In his introductory statement, the Minister did not say those services made a profit.  He said they were safe, that they would not be closed down.  Throughout my contribution I have emphasised the doubt that permeates CIE.  I hope the Minister will indicate to the Dáil unequivocally what is to happen in regard to road freight.  In his opening speech he said that CIE rail sundries and road freight services would have been discontinued by 1 January 1986 unless they had been profitable throughout 1984 and 1985. However, he qualified that by saying: &ldquo;I am glad to report that such is the improvement in these areas that their future is now assured&rdquo;, just a bit short of saying they made a profit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2690" /> Another matter I should like the Minister to deal with is staff recruitment. We all know that CIE have had a long tradition of holding a national examination for the recruitment of staff.  I hope this national examination is not to be suspended or abolished.  If so, is it the intention of the Minister that some similar equitable system of recruitment will replace it?  Until recently there was a tradition for the holding of a national examination for recruitment.  The idea was that people who had just sat their leaving certificate examination would be recruited, taking into account the academic attainment of the students, who would then go on for clerical training in CIE.  It is important that anything which the Dáil has a hand in should be seen to operate recruitment systems above reproach as far as fair competition is concerned. CIE have had a tradition for that. I want the Ministers assurance that that will be continued when this legislation, in amended form I hope, is put through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the reorganisation of CIE.  It is not very often that we have an opportunity to discuss the affairs of CIE in this House.  One reason for that is that when we try to raise questions to the Minister for Communications or the Minister for Transport as he was in the past, they are usually ruled out of order because they are matters pertaining to CIE.  Therefore, I welcome this opportunity to debate CIE and the affairs of the company on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not been convinced by any of the arguments I have heard from the Government benches or from the Minister as to why there is a need to have three new operating subsidiaries in this reorganisation.  The secretary of the trade union groups involved has pointed out clearly that they do not agree that the Government's approach is the best one in this instance.  They point out that there was no consultation and that, indeed, the workers were not even asked for their opinions on the legislation.  For that reason, it is regrettable that the Minister <Col N="2691" /> brought in this Bill without that type of consultation or discussion taking place.</P>
    <P>In rural Ireland in particular the role of the provincial bus services and the role of the railway system are compatible because the bus and train timetables can be brought into operation by the one company, and it is only right and fitting that that should remain so.  One feature in the west over the years has been the number of railway closures.  If what we hear now is true, that Athlone is to be the major distribution centre in the midland and western region, it is quite obvious that buses will be used more and more by CIE.  Therefore, we will have a great deal of duplication.  The rail and provincial bus companies will be using the same facilities in many instances and in particular the same premises and the same staff.  That duplication will not lead to an improved service.</P>
    <P>I will not go into all the points made by the group of trade unions because they have been highlighted very clearly by speakers on this side of the House but I would like the Minister, when replying to this debate, to give us some of the reasons he wants to have these three subsidiary companies under the parent company, CIE.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we have a Minister for Communications &mdash; I am talking about the office of Minister &mdash; who has taken over the mantle for all transport policy.  It serves as a good umbrella to have all these bodies involved in transport and communications under the one Minister.  In the past we have had a Minister for Transport and a Minister for Transport and Power.  CIE are a unique body in that they are responsible for the provision of all public transport in the State.  We have railways, electric railways now, city bus services provincial bus services, a major port at Rosslare, international tours and the Aran Islands ferry service.  CIE are unique in that they have responsibility for the provision of all these services.</P>
    <P>One of the very interesting points made by the General Manager, Mr. Higgins, in the engineering magazine which <Col N="2692" /> he produced about two years ago was that CIE had a very significant engineering input.  Out of the total workforce, 5,500 people are employed directly in the engineering department and they include 120 engineering graduates.  The role of CIE as a company who give practical training to apprentices and produce graduates is very important and I congratulate Mr. Higgins and the company on providing that training for apprentices and in particular for young people.</P>
    <P>One of the transport systems on which we must congratulate CIE is the DART which has been welcomed very much by the people using it, although at the time it was set up there were many question marks about the amount of money spent on the system.  As a Deputy living in the west I would have questioned that amount of money, but I notice in Mr. Higgins's report that the project provided employment for approximately 500 people and that every effort was made to maximise the Irish content of all the components of the project.  Computers from Galway were provided in the DART system.  However, it is worth pointing out there were over-runs in the costing, we are told due to inflation, the IR£ devaluation and something like £30 million in interest charges.  It shows how expensive the whole operation was, but for the people of Dublin it is of great benefit.  I hope we will have more such investment in other parts of the country for the railway system.</P>
    <P>In the west either railways were closed down or the passenger service was taken off routes like the Sligo to Limerick route.  These were mistakes made by CIE.  In the past they did not look forward to further development that might take place.  I can give one practical example in the west.  We had in the person of the late Monsignor Horan one of the greatest pioneers in the west.  The fact that he with his committee were able to set about opening Connaught Regional Airport &mdash; which was opened by the leader of our party earlier this year &mdash; indicates that it is very important that we have a rail service to feed into that airport.  Unfortunately, in 1976 the Sligo-Limerick line <Col N="2693" /> which had Claremorris, Galway and Tubbercurry on its branches was closed down.  It is regrettable that today we have no railway to feed into the airport.  One of the points made by the late Monsignor Horan was that he and his committee had to provide an airport in the Connacht region because of the very poor quality of the roads.  That could be said also in relation to the need for the railways.  The reasons for preserving the Limerick-Sligo line are valid today because of the state of the roads.</P>
    <P>The provincial bus services and the railways are interlinked.  Recently I was a guest of the Galway-Mayo Regional Development Board and CIE on a visit to south Connemara and south Mayo.  I visited the tourist amenities which we were trying to promote in the Galway-Mayo region, travelling on a very comfortable CIE bus.  However, because of the state of the roads the driver found it difficult to avoid the pot-holes and everybody on the tour agreed there was an urgent need to improve our road structure if we wanted to develop tourism.  We saw how important it is to have a good road structure and a good bus fleet.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that two Ministers deal with roads and with transport.  Local authorities in the past have sought more control over public transport but the opposite seems to be happening.  The local authorities can build roads but they have no say as to transport.  Because we have two Ministers dealing with roads and transport separately, there will be confusion.  The local authorities are providing a service in constructing roads but public transport is to be run as a business. The Minister will agree that CIE have a social role, especially in the west.</P>
    <P>The buses with which we are most familiar in rural areas are the school buses.  At this stage the Minister should investigate the possibility of carrying out a major overhaul of the buses as many urgently need to be replaced.  The same is true of the provincial buses.</P>
    <P>On the tour of the Connemara-Mayo region which I mentioned already, I spoke to a number of bus drivers who pointed out that they always required a <Col N="2694" /> bus to be on standby.  In many cases they had to ring back to Eyre Square for a replacement bus because of the standard of some of the buses and because the state of the roads did not facilitate drivers.  A point made by the area manager, who I compliment on the excellent work both he and his staff do in the area, was that there is a problem with the roads and with trying to get the rail service improved.  The service from Galway to Dublin has been improved greatly over the past number of years.  It takes less time now to get from Galway to Dublin although I would still question the standard of the train service.  There seems to be a better train service from Dublin to the south or to the north.  Hopefully the service to the west will be improved.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons given for discontinuing rail services is that the service is losing money.  This was the reason given for discontinuing the service on the Limerick-Claremorris-Sligo line.  The solution of replacing a train by a bus has usually failed to save money.  Closure of such lines do not save taxpayers' money. CIE give all sorts of figures to make a case for closing the railways, but I do not know of any railway line which saved money when it was closed.  The Minister may correct me if I am wrong in that. CIE have not been forward enough to realise that new developments affect the railways.  At the moment dangerous chemicals and toxic substances can only be transported safely by rail.  To close down a railway line, as happened in Tuam last year, is a very wrong decision.</P>
    <P>There is now a great interest in the preservation of railway lines and of the environment.  We have now a greater understanding of the social role of the railways and CIE.  In Galway we have a very active western preservation society who are arousing great interest in the county by putting a train back on the rails.  They are putting a service back on some of the lines from which passenger service had been taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter which has been the cause of great concern to a good number of my constituents in Doon, County Limerick.  Last night there was a huge meeting there attended by about 400 people led by the clergy and community leaders.  A motion was passed unanimously, which I undertook to convey to the House, calling on the Minister for Justice to transfer forthwith, without prejudice, on humanitarian grounds Michael Fitzgerald, Reenavanna, Doon, from Loughan House to Limerick Prison because of the danger to his health arising from his present hunger and thirst strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to hear, as I am sure the people in Doon are, that Mr. Fitzgerald has agreed to come off his thirst strike after 20 days and apparently will now take some milk.  Last night's meeting was very calm and balanced and it was recognised that Mr. Fitzgerald's record in this matter was not without blame in that he allegedly refused to have his herd tested by a departmental veterinary surgeon. Neither I nor anybody else in the community would endorse non-compliance with the law.  While we are naturally relieved that Mr. Fitzgerald has agreed to come off his thirst strike &mdash; I wish to express my appreciation and that of the community to the Minister for Justice for agreeing to transfer him to Limerick near his friends and neighbours where he may be more amenable to approaches from them &mdash; nonetheless it is a matter of grave concern that, because he feels so strongly he has been wronged, he is prepared to continue his hunger strike and indeed to lay down his life because of the level of his conviction.  I do not want to use emotive language but he maintains that he came off the hunger strike on two previous occasions under some understandings &mdash; I do not know <Col N="2696" /> what they were &mdash; which were not honoured. The very strong unanimous feeling at the meeting last night was that if some solution is not found to the present basic problem, he will continue the hunger strike causing danger to his life.</P>
    <P>I will read the statement issued to the meeting last night outlining some of Mr. Fitzgerald's problems as he sees them. Apparently, his herd was tested under the TB scheme in September 1982 by Mr. O'Neill of Cappamore and declared clear.  Cards are available as proof of this.  Mr. Fitzgerald claims that all his problems arise from that.  He made verbal application for a herd test and change of veterinary surgeon in September 1983 from Mr. O'Neill to a Mr. O'Driscoll, Doon.  Mr. Fitzgerald contacted Mr. O'Driscoll on numerous occasions between September 1983 and July 1984 about testing his cattle.  Mr. O'Driscoll informed him that he had not received authorisation from the Department. Mr. Fitzgerald believes that departmental officers were wrongly applying the restricted herd rules to him and were insisting on a Department test before a change of veterinary surgeon.</P>
    <P>Mr. Fitzgerald stated that he had no dispute with Mr. O'Neill but, as Mr. O'Driscoll was doing his private work, it was more practical for him to do the work under the TB scheme also.  Mr. Fitzgerald was prosecuted and sentenced to 12 months in jail or a £1,000 fine for refusing to have his herd tested.  He was arrested and taken to Cork jail on 18 July 1984. He then went on hunger strike and was released after 14 days.  On Saturday and Sunday, 21 and 22 July 1984 &mdash; this is the nub of the problem as he and the community see it &mdash; while he was in prison his herd was rounded up and 96 cattle were removed by a number of veterinary officers and gardaí.  No factory or office was open on Saturday and Sunday so it is hard to understand why they were removed on those dates.  The departmental officials state that they removed 89 cattle; the factory state that they received 86 cattle &mdash; a shortfall of ten from the 96 on his lands.  There was no representative of Mr. Fitzgerald present <Col N="2697" /> to ensure that proper procedures were adhered to.</P>
    <P>The total herd was slaughtered even though only a small percentage was infected and, if he had been allowed to test them when he requested it six months earlier, he might not have had any reactors. A sum of £8,331 was lodged to his account in the Allied Irish Bank, Doon, County Limerick, as compensation for his cattle.  To date he has not received an offer of further compensation and he has not been requested to sign any documents. Newspaper reports suggest that a sum of £27,000 to £34,000 is available to him.  He and the community want to know why this sum was not offered to him or why he does not qualify to receive it if that is the case.</P>
    <P>The Department closed down his farm and removed his stock.  They have not, to date, notified him that he can restock, depriving him of his livelihood since July 1984.  On his release from Cork prison he continued to protest that he had been unfairly treated for the following reasons: (1)  refusing to allow him to change his veterinary surgeon and to test his cattle to enable him to sell; (2)  statements in court that he was refusing to test his cattle when the same officers knew that he had applied for a test and a change of veterinary surgeon; (3)  he alleges wrongful imprisonment; (4)  closing down and slaughter of his herd and alleged irregularities between the number of cattle he had and the number admitted to the factory; (5)  inadequate compensation for his herd &mdash; £8,331 for 96 cattle; and (6)  he was deprived of his right to farm his land.</P>
    <P>Mr. Fitzgerald picketed the Department of Agriculture offices and the homes of local officers.  An injunction was granted restraining him from picketing but he continued to do so.  He was arrested and placed in Limerick jail for contempt of court.  He went on hunger strike on admission and he is now in his 20th day.  He has ignored the pleadings of his family and many friends to come off the hunger strike.  He states that the Department of Agriculture or the Garda have done nothing to solve his grievances <Col N="2698" /> since his release from jail in 1984.  I understand there is an agreement between the veterinary unions and the Department that no change of veterinary surgeon will be allowed if the farmer was assigned the veterinary surgeon without the Department doing the test in between.  Apparently, Mr. Fitzgerald contends that this was not explained to him and that he was not aware of such a condition.</P>
    <P>I further understand that the Minister has discretion in the withholding of grants amounting in his case to £27,000 to £34,000.  Everybody is at a loss to understand the secrecy surrounding the payment of these grants to him.  This was the major worry, after the hunger strike, which exercised the minds of the community last night &mdash; whether he would be given a proper level of compensation for his cattle.  Part of the lands and stock belonged to his brother who resides in England and he was also at a considerable loss.  It is obvious from what we were told last night that he does intend to continue with his hunger strike.  While nobody doubts <i>ab initio</i> he was wrong not to have his herd tested and I would be the first to criticise anybody who would endanger public health by not having their herd tested, nonetheless a stop clock is right twice in 24 hours.  I will not say that there is fault on both sides but there is confusion.  The reason why I have raised this matter is in the hope we will get some clarification as to how Mr. Fitzgerald might proceed in a proper, normal legal way to recover any losses he may have incurred in the matter.</P>
    <P>The questions I was asked to put on behalf of the community last night and vicariously on his behalf, were (i) the number of cattle loaded at Michael Fitzgerald's premises on the dates I have mentioned; (ii)  was an official or inspector from the Department present to supervise the loading?  It is the understanding of the community that it is a requirement of the Department that an inspector be present at that particular time: and (iii)  the number of cattle received at the factory and, equally, if there was a departmental inspector present at that time also.  Hunger strikes <Col N="2699" /> are not new to Doon in County Limerick. They go back over the last 150 years.  That consciousness is very strong in Doon.  I will not go down that road.  I put it to the House that any person who is prepared to undergo a 20 days hunger and thirst strike in the belief he is right must have his case looked at.</P>
    <P>My own profession are in the business of solving problems.  I put forward a possible solution to the problem at the meeting last night which was that some type of inquiry be held, not necessarily a public inquiry as I am afraid to mention such an inquiry after the Kerry Babies Tribunal which cost the State so much and out of which so little was gained.  Positing the idea of a public inquiry may allow Mr. Fitzgerald to come off his hunger and thirst strike.  Again, I express my appreciation that he has been transferred back to Limerick.  That is a definite improvement over the last 24 hours.  I am grateful to the Minister for that.  As I pointed out to the meeting last night, if both the Department and Mr. Fitzgerald maintain that they are correct, neither should have anything to fear by an impartial public inquiry.  The truth cannot contradict itself.  Somebody must be wrong and I do not care who.  As a result of such an inquiry &mdash; this inquiry could be carried out by somebody such as Mr. Con Murphy, the well known media and rights commissioner, who has knowledge and experience of farming-related matters and a background in the area&mdash;we might get to the position where we could establish what happened the ten cattle for whom this man is prepared to lay down his life.  He feels very strongly that he has been wronged.  Somebody took the cattle belonging to him.  While we would all accept that he did not behave properly in accordance with legal procedures from the outset, nonetheless he does have a major sense of grievance.  In the interests of common sense and humanity some <i>modus operandi</i> should be arrived at.  I would ask for guidance as to how best this could be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down a Private <Col N="2700" /> Notice Question this morning when it appeared that the situation had become very serious so far as this man's health is concerned, perhaps even his life in the circumstances.  The question was to ask the Minister for Justice if he would take immediate steps to transfer Mr. Fitzgerald from Loughan House Prison to Limerick Prison.  Happily, he has now agreed to do that.  The Minister is perfectly right and I was justified in putting down the question this morning.  The question was disallowed for the reason that what I had asked for had happened. I accept that the Minister for Justice has made his contribution in so far as he can.  He has limited opportunities in this matter.  This is a civil matter.  Mr. Fitzgerald is in prison on foot of civil orders in civil proceedings.  It is not a criminal matter and the Minister for Justice has no jurisdiction to release him, which he would have if it were a criminal matter. Now that Mr. Fitzgerald is on his way back to Limerick I would hope he will now desist from his hunger and thirst strike to enable some kind of discussions to take place with a view to alleviating his grievances and problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He does have a very serious problem. He was a relatively substantial farmer. He owned 96 cattle.  He now owns nothing.  He has very little apart from his land and a very small amount of money. Mr. Fitzgerald does suffer from a deep sense of grievance and feels he has been deprived of a great deal of money.  He attributes his problems in this respect to the Department of Agriculture especially for the way in which they enforced the regulations.  I do not think anyone would deny, even Mr. Fitzgerald, that he was in serious breach of the animal health regulations.  I do not condone that but at the same time I do not think, with a man who has a well developed and deep sense of grievance in regard to this matter, that the Department of Agriculture are right to take an entirely legalistic or bureaucratic approach to the matter as the problem may well start again if they do.  It would be unreasonable of them if they were to do that.  They will have to see it from this unfortunate man's point of view <Col N="2701" /> and try to come some of the way to meeting him in this regard.</P>
    <P>Dr. Ken Whitaker has described the bovine TB eradication scheme in this country as perhaps the greatest scandal ever in the Irish public administration and the greatest waste of money.  I am sure Dr. Whitaker is right but the Department of Agriculture are trying to make up for a couple of decades of lax administration in regard to a few people of whom Mr. Fitzgerald is one.  I had two long discussions with an official of the Department of Agriculture on the matter yesterday.  He has very courteous and explained the matter in full to me as they saw it.  They feel legally they are right to refuse him the money which he feels he is entitled to.  I do not doubt that legally they are within their rights to do this, but in my view their rights are only legal rights.  When one comes up against a man who has a clear sense of grievance &mdash; he may be a fairly obstinate man in this respect and inclined to go to great lengths to try to achieve his rights as he sees them &mdash; I do not think it is right to push one's legal rights as a Department entirely against him.  Some effort should be made by the authorities to meet him reasonably and fairly.</P>

I am perfectly aware that there is concern about this case.  Indeed, I have been aware of the case for some time and I was the recipient of expressions of concern by my colleague. Deputy O'Donnell, who rang me at my home on Saturday night.  I must say that I feel rather uncomfortable, to <Col N="2702" /> say the least of it, in being in the House discussing the personal affairs of a person who has been entrusted to my care by the courts.  The person in question is now in prison for contempt of court, a point the House might wish to bear in mind during its consideration of the case.  I am happy to be able to say to the House that, following consultations with his legal advisers, the person in question earlier this evening agreed to resume taking liquids, milk.</P>

      <P>My only function in the matter is to provide for the carrying out of the order of the court which is that he be lodged in prison until such time as he purges his contempt.  The substantive issues in the case which have been illustrated, not completely described, by Deputy Prendergast and Deputy O'Malley are a matter for the Minister for Agriculture. I will not attempt to go into that matter except to point out, in response to Deputy Prendergast's suggestion that there should be some type of inquiry, that the matter has already been the subject on several occasions of that form of sworn public inquiry which takes the form of a court hearing.  The House should be a little reluctant to go behind the findings of the courts in cases like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Prendergast asked for advice as to how the case might be processed from here or how the person in question might go further.  It is not our function in the House to give legal advice but I should like to point out that a change has been brought about in this matter following consultations by the person in question with his legal advisers.  It seems to me that that might be a course he could usefully follow again.  The final point I <Col N="2703" /> should like to make is to urge any and all persons who have any influence with the person in question to get him to desist from the course he is taking at the moment which is not related in any way to his being in prison or to the circumstances of his going there.  Those people should use their influence with him to try to get him to stop using an instrument which I have to say is totally disproportionate and out of place in a discussion of this kind.  I do not think it would be useful for me to say anything further than that.</P>

Where slats used were not made by an approved manufacturer, grant aid is normally payable only where samples are submitted to the IIRS for testing and the institute certifies that they conform to the standard. In the present case, the Department would be prepared to accept a certificate from a civil engineer which verified that, on the basis of a structural examination of a sample of the type of slat used, its construction and load bearing capacity are in accordance with I.S.

      <P>The statistical material necessary to enable me to answer this question is not <Col N="2498" /> readily available.  While a certain proportion of the food consumed in Ireland is imported, I should point out that the country is a substantial net food exporter. In 1985, food imports amounted to £994 million compared with exports of £2,200 million.  Export earnings from the food sector were further boosted in 1985 by transfers of almost £900 million from the European Community in respect of market support measures etc, bringing total export earnings from the food industry to more than £3,000 million for the first time ever.</P>
      <P>A number of reports on import substitution in the food sector concluded that the vast bulk of our food imports cannot be produced here for climatic and other reasons.  These reports concluded that only a relatively small proportion of food imports can be replaced by home produced products and that we should concentrate on those areas, such as the vegetable sector, where import substitution appears to be practicable.  It is Government policy to replace imports with home produced food and investment projects relating to import substitution are given very high priority by the IDA. My own Department has taken a number of measures, particularly in the horticultural sector, to bring about better organisation and marketing and to enable Irish suppliers to compete more effectively with imported produce.</P>

      <P>The reduced interest scheme for farmers in severe financial difficulty was administered by the Associated Banks and the ACC who also had responsibility for assessing the eligibility of individual applicants.  The administration of the scheme by the lending institutions is subject to audit by my Department and no State contribution is payable to the lending institutions in respect of cases found to have been improperly admitted to the scheme.  In such instances, where the State contribution has already been paid it must be refunded by the lending institution. It is a matter for the lending institutions to decide whether to seek refunds from the disallowed applicants concerned.</P>

    <P>* Covers TB and Brucellosis.</P>
    <P>In evaluating this expenditure, account must be taken of the essential role of the TB scheme in preserving market outlets for livestock and livestock products and of the effects on productivity in agriculture of the removal of tens of thousands of diseased animals together with prevention of disease spread.  On that basis I believe the expenditure has been necessary and worthwhile.</P>

      <P>I have more than doubled the headage payments on beef cows in 1986 and subject to EC approval for special weather aid, I propose to increase the rates on equines and cattle other than beef cows in the more severely handicapped areas by over 50 per cent.  I have also, of course, extended headage payments to the newly-classified and re-classified disadvantaged areas in 1986.</P>
      <P>As a result, the total to be paid under the 1986 disadvantaged areas headage schemes has risen from £41 million for 1985 to £73 million for 1986.  An increase of the magnitude of £32 million or 80 per cent in one year is a very considerable achievement.  To pay at the maximum rate, as suggested by the Deputy, would cost a further £32 million and would simply not be possible at present given the very large increase in payments this year and the severe constraints on Exchequer resources.</P>

      <P>EC Regulations do not allow for the provision of national incentives in addition to the existing Community scheme of aid to encourage the production of peas and beans.  The objective of the EC scheme is to promote the production of protein crops to replace imports from third countries. With the aid provided under the <Col N="2503" /> scheme, it has been demonstrated that, with good husbandry and management, peas and beans can be an attractive alternative cash crop.  Adequate drying facilities for the crop are already available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of specialised bodies and agencies already exist in Northern Ireland for the purposes of investigating complaints under the various civil rights headings.</P>
      <P>The Standing Advisory Commission for Human Rights was established under the Northern Ireland Constitutional Act, (1973), for the purpose of advising the Secretary of State on the adequacy and effectiveness of the law for the time being in force in preventing discrimination on the ground of religious belief or political opinion and in providing redress for persons aggrieved by discrimination on either ground.  In practice, the Standing Advisory Commission has also addressed the range of human rights issues in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fair Employment Agency was established under the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act, (1976), with the duties of promoting equality of opportunity in employment and working for the elimination of discrimination.  The Act outlawed discrimination in employment on grounds of religious belief or political opinion.  The Equal Opportunities Commission was set up under the <Col N="2506" /> Sex Discrimination (Northern Ireland) Order, 1976, to work for the elimination of discrimination on the grounds of sex or marriage and to promote equality of opportunity between men and women generally.</P>
    <P>The police complaints procedures in Northern Ireland are currently being revised.  Last July, the British Government published a draft Order in Council setting out proposals for a new Independent Commission for Police Complaints for Northern Ireland.  The proposed commission, which will supersede the present Police Complaints Board, will have extensive independent supervisory powers in relation to the investigation of complaints against the police.</P>
    <P>The independent investigation of complaints about public maladministration in Northern Ireland is handled by two ombudsmen, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration and the Commissioner for Complaints.  The function of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration is to investigate written complaints about maladministration within any of the Northern Ireland Government Departments.  The function of the Commissioner for Complaints is to investigate written complaints made directly to him by persons claiming to have suffered injuries through maladministration on the part of local authorities and boards.</P>
    <P>Each of the bodies mentioned above is an independent body.  Taken together, they cover most civil rights issues which arise in Northern Ireland and afford a wide range of advice and assistance to individuals with civil rights complaints. The safeguarding of the human and civil rights of all citizens in Northern Ireland is a matter of the highest concern to me. Particular human rights issues are taken up through the machinery of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  Furthermore, I follow the work of these bodies I have mentioned with close interest.  Under Article 6 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I am entitled, as Irish Joint Chairman of the <Col N="2507" /> Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, to put forward views and proposals on the role and composition of public bodies.  The article explicitly lists four of the bodies mentioned above:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Fair Employment Agency;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Equal Opportunities Commission;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Police Complaints Board.</P>
    <P>The question of a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland is presently under consideration in the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> In his letter of 18 July 1986 the former chairman of the PMPA stated that the administrator's estimate of claims liabilities at 31 December 1983 of £217.5 million was over-stated by £143.7 million because payments in 1984 in respect of claims from the period 1978 to 1983 totalled only £73.8 million.  In arriving at this conclusion, the former chairman ignored the 8,402 claims relating to that period which remained outstanding at 31 December 1984 and in respect of which reserves of £128.2 million were held for settlements subsequent to that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1985 audited statutory returns submitted by the administrator show that, compared with a figure of £57.9 million provided by the former management at <Col N="2508" /> 31 December 1982 for 1978-82 claims outstanding as of that date, payments on these claims in the years 1983, 1984 and 1985 amounted to £157.9 million with further reserves of £30.4 million being held against 1978-82 claims remaining to be settled.  The shortfall of £100 million which has already arisen in respect of these claims, together with the further reserves of £30 million being held, indicate the extent of under-provisioning for outstanding claims by the former management of the PMPA.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>The Road Traffic Acts provide a comprehensive range of parking controls on vehicles generally.  Included in these controls is the power to remove vehicles which are either left on a public road in such a position as to cause danger or to obstruct traffic or are abandoned. Responsibility for the enforcement of these controls including the removal of vehicles rests with the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parking in a dangerous position in a public place is specifically controlled by section 55 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as amended by section 52 of the Road <Col N="2516" /> Traffic Act, 1968.  In addition, road traffic general by-laws prescribe general rules for the parking of vehicles on a national basis.  Under these by-laws, a person parking a vehicle must, among other things, ensure that the vehicle is not likely to cause inconvenience, obstruct or endanger other traffic or obstruct the view of other road users at or near road junctions, corners or bends.  In addition, these by-laws also prohibit parking in such a manner so as to interfere with normal traffic flow.</P>
    <P>Parking controls are also provided for in local traffic and parking by-laws and temporary rules made by the Garda Commissioner with my consent.  These by-laws and rules provide for the implementation of a wide range of local parking controls such as clearways and double and single yellow lines etc.  In June 1986, traffic and parking by-laws were made in respect of each county in the country.</P>
    <P>While the above controls apply to all categories of vehicles, the question of the introduction of special measures to control the parking of large vehicles is at present under consideration.  I understand that in recent weeks specific proposals were being developed by the Garda in consultation with Dublin Corporation with a view to the introduction of appropriate controls in the Dublin area on a pilot basis for a limited period.  In view of the fact that section 33 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act, 1986, came into operation on 12 November 1986, the proposals will now be a matter for consideration by the Dublin Transport Authority.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there has been a deterioration in the condition of Lough Sheelin.  This can be attributed largely to the abnormal weather conditions during this and the previous summer.</P>
      <P>Cavan County Council who have statutory responsibility for water pollution control in the area, have issued notices under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, which prohibit spreading of slurry in the catchment between 15 November 1986 and 15 February 1987 and which also impose restrictions on spreading in the months immediately before and after this period.  The council applied similar controls in 1985-86.</P>
      <P>I am requesting the council to review the situation of Lough Sheelin, to consider what other measures may be needed to protect the lake and to advise me of their conclusions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Customs attendance is provided free of charge for long periods at frontier posts on bank holidays for the clearance of passengers and their baggage.  The Revenue Commissioners consider that there is no undue delay in clearing goods on bank holidays but it is inevitable that traffic delays will occur at certain times <Col N="2537" /> because of the large volume of passenger motor vehicles on land frontier roads on such days.  Every effort is made to keep delays to the minimum.</P>
    <P>The level of staffing and the hours during which attendance is given on bank holidays are determined by reference to previously established patterns of traffic flows through each post-station.  It is considered that the present arrangements for the clearance of goods are satisfactory and are the most economic in the present circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to open customs posts-stations on a 24 hour basis as the volume of traffic and the pattern of peak crossing times would not warrant such hours of opening.</P>

    <P>AIB agreed to subsidise the £100 million funding by an amount of £3.5 <Col N="2538" /> million per annum and the Central Bank also negotiated a special contribution from all licensed banks of £3.5 million per annum of which AIB is to pay £2 million, thus bringing the total AIB contribution to £5.5 million per annum.</P>
    <P>These arrangements made available to the administrator of ICI at a variable rate of interest linked to money markets rates (initially about 2 per cent per annum) a £100 million loan for up to 15 years which, in so far as it was not immediately required, could be used to earn revenue for the company and to make a positive contribution to its income.</P>
    <P>Since AIB did not borrow any funds from the Central Bank in connection with these arrangements the final part of the question does not arise.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the study of surgical facilities in Galway by Comhairle na nOspidéal was to determine how these services could be strengthened and improved. The comhairle concluded that a true regional service in surgery had not yet developed in Galway, mainly because a comprehensive range or specialist services had not been developed on a single campus.  It was recommended that a regional centre on a single site backed up by a full range of support services is essential to the long term survival of Galway as a major teaching cum regional specialist centre and to this end some surgical services should be transferred immediately from Merlin Park to the Newcastle site.</P>
      <P>These proposals were not put forward to downgrade Merlin Park Regional Hospital but rather to improve surgical services in Galway.

      <P>The current signing arrangements are governed by statutory regulations which provide that claimants to unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit must sign the unemployed register to indicate that they are available for and genuinely seeking work. Persons who reside within six miles of a local office of the Department are required to present themselves there to sign the register at least once weekly to prove unemployment.  Claimants who reside over six miles from the local office register as unemployed at their local Garda station and they are paid at their local post office on foot of a voucher sent to them by their local office.</P>
      <P>Up to recently unemployed persons residing in the Rathcoole area were required to attend at their local Garda station to have their declarations of unemployment certified and they were paid at their local post office.  However, since a new employment exchange was opened at Clondalkin on 4 November 1986, claimants in the Rathcoole area, which is within six miles of Clondalkin, are required to attend once weekly at the exchange to sign the unemployed register and they continue to be paid at their local post office in Rathcoole.  No claimant is required to attend at the exchange more than once weekly.  Those arrangements are not considered onerous and are in fact designed to keep any travelling expenses of claimants to a minimum.  If the Deputy has evidence regarding a particular case or cases perhaps he would furnish the revelant details so that the matter could be further investigated.</P>

Further proposals for the development of pensions provision will be considered in the light of the board's deliberations and of the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment benefit up to 1 October 1985, when he had drawn his <Col N="2549" /> maximum entitlement of 390 days benefit. In order to qualify for continued payment of benefit beyond that date he would require at least a further 13 weeks contributions paid at the appropriate class providing cover against unemployment. Weeks of employment since the date on which he received 156 days of unemployment benefit may count for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has been working part time during the period of his claim.  While Class A rate contributions had been paid in respect of the employment, following investigation a deciding officer, in view of the part time nature of the employment, decided that it should have been insured at Class J rate contributions. Class J contributions are not reckonable for unemployment benefit purposes.  He appealed against the decision ruling his employment insurable for Class J rate contributions but his appeal did not reach Dublin and appears to have been mislaid in postal transit. This only came to light recently.  He has now completed a duplicate appeal which is being submitted to an appeals officer for determination at the earliest available opportunity.  His entitlement to unemployment benefit will be reviewed in the light of the outcome of the appeal.</P>

Present indications are that the new station will be completed in mid-1987. Pending completion of that review and consideration of the findings, it is not possible to say what the Garda strength and deployment in the area or what the <Col N="2560" /> future status of Edward Street station will be.</P>

These amounts were allocated as follows by the board: In 1985, £9,575 was allocated to literacy provision and £8,425 to community education and in 1986 £27,026 was allocated to literacy provision and £14,474 to community education.</P>

      <P>The latest available figures show a total of 796 two-teacher schools in operation. These figures relate to the school year 1984-85.  The number of teachers in those schools was 1,592.</P>
      <P>With regard to the number of two-teacher schools that were built in the last century now in operation, this information is not readily available in my Department and its compilation would involve the expenditure of an inordinate amount of official time.  I am, therefore, not in a position to give it to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The pick-up and set-down times for the relevant pupils are not as stated by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of school transport vehicles operate more than one route and pupils at most post primary centres are required to wait some time at their respective centres before or after school. Pupils from the area in question have a maximum waiting time of approximately one hour per day.  This is a reasonable standard of service in the context of the general operation of the post primary school transport scheme.  In the circumstances the provision of an additional vehicle would not be warranted.</P>
