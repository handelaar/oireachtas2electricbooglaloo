      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 21, 22, 23 and 24.  By agreement, the Dáil shall sit later than 9 p.m. today and not later than 11 p.m. and business shall be interrupted at 10.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>Also by agreement, the proceedings on the remaining Stages of item 21 shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 1.30 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Communications.</P>
      <P>Also by agreement, the proceedings on the remaining Stages of item 23 shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 7 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Finance.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 48.</P>

      <P>They are not agreed.  I did not agree to the guillotine which is described now as agreement to complete all Stages of the Air Transport Bill by 1.30 p.m. with only amendments in the <Col N="2292" /> name of the Minister for Communications being taken.  I was not informed that there was any such proposal.  It is wrong that this Bill, which necessarily has had to be debated over a long period and to which a huge number of amendments have been made by the Minister as a result of various points I have made on the legislation in the past two years, should be killed off in this way.  It is inappropriate that the Bill should be guillotined in this fashion, whether by ostensible agreement or otherwise.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley made a point that there are amendments to the Bill. Surely that is what the whole process of going through Parliament is about.  I have sat for too long in this House observing Ministers coming in with Bills which are unalterable, just making a charade of going through Parliament.  Parliament is supposed to be a forum for discussing and improving legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, Long Title, line 13, to delete &ldquo;FOR THOSE PURPOSES&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that on Committee Stage on 4 December last at columns 1080 and 1085 to 1092 of the Official Report, Deputies sought to broaden the scope of section 5 in various ways.  I refused to accept those suggestions for a number of reasons but indicated my willingness to see if anything could be done on Report Stage to broaden the scope of the register.  Having considered the matter, I have decided that, as I will use the powers of approval in the Bill to regulate tariffs on scheduled air services, it will be useful to extend the scope of this Bill so as to incorporate in the register particulars of any application which I might receive for the inauguration of a scheduled air service to, from or within the territory of the State.  That is the purpose of these amendments.  In enabling interested parties to make representations to me in regard to particular air service applications, I believe this will assist the process of decision making in my Department in the area of scheduled air services.  The amendments to the Long Title are necessary now that the scope of the register extends beyond matters strictly related to the regulation of airline tariffs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>On this, I would like to reiterate the point I just made.  The whole nature of part of this Bill is being changed quite radically.  Various objects and objectives which the Bill had when introduced and read a Second Time are now being taken out and various things that I suggested during the debate are being inserted.  Incidentally, although the debates in this House were prolonged over a period of time, they were quite short <Col N="2298" /> debates.  The whole Bill has taken less than ten hours in this House even though it has dragged on now for 20 months because it was only ordered every six or nine months by the Government.</P>
      <P>Various suggestions I made in relation to the objectives of the Bill which were not in it as introduced and read a Second Time are now being put into it by the Minister and I welcome that.  I deplore the fact that two and a half hours from now the whole debate on the Bill including 27 amendments will have to come to an end under a guillotine agreed between the main Opposition party and the Government.  These objectives are different now from what they were when the Bill was introduced and read a Second Time.  Is it in order under Standing Orders and the precedents of the House to do this in this way without a direction being given by the House to the committee of the whole House that it can consider the Bill with different objectives and with a different Long Title?  The changes being made in the Long Title are not drafting changes but changes of a fundamental nature.  Major items which I objected to in the Bill are being taken out now by the Minister although the Minister scorned me for a long period and told the House that everything I said was stupid and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now in a position that very major amendments are being made, amendments which go to the root of the Bill and make it in many respects a different Bill.  I welcome that fact.  I am simply querying the procedure as to whether or not &mdash; as I have seen happen in similar circumstances &mdash; a direction has to be given to the House to reconsider the Bill with different objectives and with a substantially different Long Title, not just some minor or consequential amendment as is seen from these three, especially amendment No. 3 and the other two which are related.  On the <Col N="2299" /> assumption that the guillotine has to go through because the Opposition agreed to it &mdash; presumably they wish to curtail the debate as much as the Government do &mdash; by 1.30 p.m. the Minister will have made 31 amendments to this Bill between Committee Stage and the 14 amendments he put down today.</P>

That is an interesting commentary on the whole situation, on the genesis of the Bill and the way it has been dealt with since.

      <P>This amendment is related to amendments Nos. 26 and 27, whose combined effect is to remove an explicit linkage between tariff offences committed under this Bill and my consideration of applications for travel agent/tour operator licences under the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982. While lack of time prevented the House from considering this matter on Committee Stage in early December, I was aware of concerns which both Fianna Fáil and Deputy O'Malley had on this issue at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2304" />
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister speak more slowly, please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  It is, I believe, important to advise the House at this stage as to my motivation for including this explicit linkage in the Bill in the first instance.  Opponents of the provision have argued that the 1982 Act was never intended to be used in this fashion and that its only purpose was to provide consumer protection.  That is not correct.  The tour operators legislation has twin objectives: protection of the travelling public from stranding, etc. and the putting of the travel trade on a sounder footing.</P>
      <P>The sale of scheduled service air tickets forms a major part of any travel agent's business and it was because of the close link between that part of an agent's work and the tariff matters covered in the Air Transport Bill that I considered it appropriate that I should include an explicit link between the two codes by means of section 11.</P>
      <P>Section 6 of the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982, provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that the Minister shall refuse a licence to carry on business as a tour operator or as a travel agent if he is not satisfied, having regard to past activities, that the applicant is a fit person to carry on the business.  Convictions of a serious nature under the air transport code would clearly have to be taken into account by me in carrying out the statutory requirements of the licensing régime provided for in the 1982 Act, and it was only to make that crystal clear to the travel trade that I included the section 11 provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding this, the Bill already makes provision for significant financial penalties and this should be sufficient to deter any intermediary, such as a travel agent or tour operator, from persistent breaches of approved tariffs.  Indeed, I could only envisage a Minister resorting to use of the 1982 Act where either successful prosecutions had failed to be effective or where that intermediary's activities were having a disruptive effect on the market, thereby putting at risk the <Col N="2305" /> very viability of scheduled air services on the North Atlantic route, for instance, without which the Irish economy would suffer.</P>
    <P>It is relevant to add that even if, as a last resort, the Minister were to revoke or refuse to renew a licence granted under the 1982 Act for repeated breaches of this Bill, the intermediary concerned would have available to him the significant appeals machinery provided for in section 9 of the 1982 Act and would be entitled to continue trading as a tour operator or travel agent pending the outcome of his appeal to the High Court, provided that he had a valid bond to protect his clients.</P>
    <P>Subject to the clear understanding that my ability to take account in an appropriate case of a conviction or convictions under the Bill will not in any way be diminished in considering whether a person is a fit and proper person to carry on business as a tour operator or travel agent under the 1982 Act, I am prepared to delete section 11 from the Bill.  My purpose in so doing is to go some way towards meeting the concerns which have been expressed and to indicate that I would only envisage such action being taken by any Minister for Communications in exceptional circumstances.  However, I believe that it would be wise to keep that option open for any future Minister and, subject to this understanding, I am prepared to delete section 11 from the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain proprietorial interest in the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982, as I was responsible for putting it through the House.  I take the Minister's point that it was two pronged, but the protection of the consumer was uppermost in my mind and in the minds of my officials at the time.  I remember spending a very nervous summer when we could not put this legislation into effect, although we had it on the Statute Book, because there were some cowboys ranging around and some people who were unfortunate in business.  I remember sending a civil servant to one particular gentleman, who was a very dubious operator, to buy a <Col N="2306" /> ticket; but the bird had flown.  The girl said that all the tickets had been sold, but the fact was that the operation was very dubious and this was precisely the kind of operator that Act was put on the Statute Book to catch.</P>
      <P>Modestly, I claim that the amendment I put down to this Bill was the most important and substantive one.  I will be referring to this later.  My thesis is that the Minister should not at any time refuse a fare solely on the basis that it was too low.  That is essential to the operation of any Bill having regard to the first point the Minister made on this amendment, namely, that the protection of the consumer is paramount.  I mentioned at an earlier stage that the idea of coralling the tour operators and travel agents punitively did not find favour with very many people in the House and I am glad of any amendment which tends to remedy that.</P>

      <P>It was guillotined on Committee Stage also.  We did not discuss the latter part of the Bill on Committee Stage.  The total time devoted by the House to this Bill in the past 20 months has been about ten to 12 hours which is scarcely excessive.  More is spent on a sterile budget debate in one week.</P>
      <P>I welcome the amendment in the name of the Minister to take out one of the most objectionable features to which I objected strenuously on 27 June and also in passing on Committee Stage.  In the speeches I made, which were described by the Minister as of a Second Stage nature, several times I referred to my strong objection to this penal provision and I put down an amendment to remove it in its entirety.  I welcome the fact that it has now been removed in its entirety. It was one of the penal penalties which I found most objectionable from the start.</P>
      <P>Let us spell out the situation with regard to the penalties.  Three major penalties were proposed in the Bill against travel agents, airlines and others for selling airline tickets too cheaply&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The first was a jail sentence of two years for selling tickets too cheaply and that has been removed.  The second was the revocation of the licence and that has been removed.  The third was a fine of £100,000 which has now been reduced to £50,000.  I think we could give the Minister two and a half marks out of three, which is honours in anyone's terminology.  Some of the highly objectionable features and the ridiculous penal provisions in the Bill have been removed and if that is not a fundamental change I do not know what is a change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see how anything could be more fundamental, particularly when I recall the defence of the provisions made in June 1984 by the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon.  Now that the jail sentence, and the revocation of the licence are gone and the fine has been reduced, the only thing that remains is whether this proposed law making it a serious criminal offence to charge too little for <Col N="2308" /> an airline ticket will stand up in the European Court.  In these circumstances I cannot understand why the Minister persists in going on with the Bill when I understand that the decision in the <i>Nouvelles Frontiéres</i> case is expected in the next few weeks.  Does the Minister know what date the court will give judgement in that case?</P>

I understand that in November the court indicated that they hoped to give their judgment by the end of January.  We are now in the second week of February and that decision may be given in the next week or two.  As the House is aware, the Advocate General has given as his opinion, and his advice which he has suggested that the court should follow, that the French Government case is untenable and that French law on this matter should be struck down.</P>

Perhaps the Minister was not aware of it on Committee Stage until I drew attention to it.  Ireland is one of the few member states who have not entered an appearance in that case for some extraordinary reason because we are as much affected by it as other member states.  I have had discussions with the Commission and various other people. They cannot understand why this Bill is being pursued when the very point that is crucial to it will be determined finally by the European Court.

      <P>The Deputy has made that clear.  We have passed from that now.  With regard to amendment No. 4, I wish to make it clear that Standing Orders governing Report Stage will apply here.  It is suggested that amendments 4, 22 and 23 be taken together, by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 31, to delete &ldquo;mail or other cargo and the conditions (including in particular conditions as regards agency or other auxiliary services) or other terms on or subject to which those charges are to be paid or made;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of bringing under severe regulation mail or other cargo at this stage of the game in 1986 seems ridiculous.  No country that I know of attempts in practice to keep up the price of carrying cargo or mail; indeed, there are all kinds of interesting situations that may well arise, in the context of the European Community in particular, as to whether a country is entitled to force air carriers to set minimum tariffs for the carriage of mail and not allow normal, open, competitive, tendering.  Similarly, in regard to cargo there has been little attempt in recent years to specify and <Col N="2311" /> enforce rates for its carriage.  A provision such as this would be laughed at in any other country.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply to similar suggestions which I made in the past was that he wanted to have these powers, even though he might never use them.  That is not the right way to approach the making of law.  The 31 amendments that he has made or is in the process of making to this Bill &mdash; nearly all as a result of suggestions made by me &mdash; bear out the fact that there are certain things that you should not put into law even if you do not propose to use those powers.  This is clearly one of those situations.  It is a bureaucratic approach.  The Department concerned want to have everything tied up and to ensure that nobody can do anything in relation to aviation without their consent.  That is ludicrous in this country with 240,000 people unemployed, with our huge deficit and other problems &mdash; enacting legislation here for the purpose of prosecuting people for charging too little to carry Irish exports or Irish mail out of Ireland, or foreign mail into Ireland. Happily, he will not now take their licences from them or sentence them to two years in jail, but they could be fined up to £50,000.</P>
    <P>I think I am entitled to ask the House, have we any sense at all that we go on with these legislative proposals?  They can make sense to nobody except these people of a bureaucratic frame of mind who think it is ideal to have every little item tied up within a bureaucratic framework, so that nobody can look crooked without the permission of the Department in every respect and so that law of this kind could be used against people if there were some reason for doing so, perhaps not related to the actual carriage of mail or cargo.</P>
    <P>I am in the difficulty now that this is Report Stage and presumably I cannot ask questions as I could on Committee Stage.  I would like the Minister, when replying, to explain to me what the purpose is, at a time of such high unemployment, of enacting penalties against people for charging too little to take <Col N="2312" /> goods into or out of Ireland?  All of these phrases like &ldquo;conditions and other terms on or subject to which those charges are to be paid or made&rdquo; should also be removed. This is a way of trying to ensure that air fares, whether for cargo, mail or passengers, will remain unattractive into or out of this country and unduly high, when all these various conditions and other terms, as they are called, are put into the buying of the ticket.  Equally, these phrases should go because it is quite ridiculous that if people sell tickets for less than the recommended price they are committing an offence.</P>
    <P>On official British figures, 5 million discounted tickets a year are sold publicly, officially and legally in Britain. There is no effort whatever made by the British Government to move against anybody selling a discounted ticket.  We are told then that we are only reflecting the law and practice in other countries.  That so patently is not the case that it is a great pity that we should be making assess of ourselves, as we are here, by making ourselves the only country in the world which goes out of its way to prosecute people for charging too little for something and makes it a criminal offence here to do something which is a perfectly normal, laudable and commendable commercial practice in every other country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In keeping with his contributions throughout this debate, Deputy O'Malley has again stated as a fact something which is not a fact.  He has said that 5 million discounted tickets a year are sold legally in the United Kingdom. I presume that the Deputy will stand over that statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet again, Deputy O'Malley is factually wrong.  What surprises me is that throughout this debate a person of his standing, who is held in very high respect by many outside and inside this House has been, uncharacteristically I must say, repeatedly wrong not on matters of argument or judgment but on facts.  Here again he is factually wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2313" /> I explained already, on Committee Stage, my position in regard to the matters covered by the Deputy's amendment. The 1965 Act already empowers the Minister for Communications to control passenger fares and rates for cargo and mail.  The current Bill is simply reflecting that position.  The fact that currently I choose not to exercise these powers is neither here nor there.  I believe that it remains necessary for the Minister to have reserve powers in relation to cargo and mail in the event of predatory pricing on the one hand, or excessive pricing on the other.  One of Deputy O'Malley's repeated remarks &mdash; he is the lone opponent of this Bill in this House &mdash; is that this Bill provides for the jailing of people for selling tickets too cheaply. It does no such thing.  It is to control and regulate prices in the national interest as every other civil aviation authority do, including action against those who are charging too much.  It is a power to stop people charging too much and it is a power to stop people charging too little. Aviation history is littered with the folly of predatory pricing and the disaster that has followed of liquidations, closures, stranded passengers, etc.</P>
    <P>In the matter of conditions applying to particular fares or rates, it is equally as important to have power to control conditions as it is to regulate the level of a fare or rate.  A cheap fare of itself is of no benefit to, say, Irish tourism if it is so restricted as to have little appeal to the potential market.  Moreover, a debate on fares or rates is a little esoteric if you have no service.  Continuity of service is one of the pillars of Irish aviation policies, and no matter what Government come into power in the future, even if Deputy O'Malley becomes Minister for Communications, that would be the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer.  It is interesting that the Minister did not answer the question I asked him.  I asked him a very specific question but he chose not to <Col N="2314" /> understand why.  I asked him why, when 240,000 people are unemployed, does he want to make it a criminal offence to charge too little to take Irish manufactured exports out of this country.  He did not tell us, and it is not surprising that he did not tell us.  He made the point because I described the activity that is going on so widely in England with official approval and everything legal.  In a very technical sense probably it is not legal, but it is useful to quote, if I may, from a UK statutory committee report, the Air Transport Users Committee Annual Report for 1980, on this point.  Of course, matters have gone considerably beyond that situation since then.  Let me quote from that report of 1980:</P>
      <P>Many air travellers are now buying tickets at discounted rates from cutprice dealers colloquially known as bucket shops.  Although certain illegal dealings by airlines and their agents are involved in at least some of these offers, there can be no doubt that the passenger is not liable to prosecution in accepting them.  He is, however, taking some risk either that his ticket may not be accepted if he wishes to transfer to another airline or that, having paid for his ticket in advance, the agent will go out of business before it is delivered. He must weigh up these risks against the considerable discount he may get on the normal fare.</P>
      <P>The system is operated by the airlines selling off blocks of seats that would otherwise not be sold, at what are at present often illegally discounted rates, to dealers who can then offer them to the public at most attractive prices.  It is common practice for every manufacturer of consumer goods to dispose of surplus stock at a discount. This particularly applies to products with a short life, and probably the shortest life of any consumer product is an airline seat &mdash; once an aircraft takes off there is no way that empty seats can be sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is aggravated by the time gap between the sale of APEX tickets, ceasing up to three months <Col N="2315" /> before the flight and the sale of standby tickets within 24 hours of departure, during which the airlines cannot otherwise sell seats they know will not be bought at normal fares.  The system can, therefore, be regarded as being of benefit to both the airlines and their users and the Committee is in favour of legalising the selling of bulk fares for general re-sale by all travel agents.</P>
    <P>That was an official statutory committee in Britain describing the situation and making certain recommendations back in 1980.  To a large extent the position has developed since then in Britain and the official figures show that five million such tickets are sold with official approval each year.</P>
    <P>I have similar quotations from the 1981 and 1982 reports of that committee where they continue to make the same recommendations and say that this should be encouraged on a wide scale.</P>

      <P>But what is really needed is Government action that will make discounted tickets available to all, with any conditions attached clearly explained and firm guarantees that such tickets carrying no extra risk of the purchaser being stranded or losing his money...</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Minister during his speech.  I invited him to answer certain questions that I asked and he failed to do it.  It is deplorable when we have 240,000 people unemployed, when we need all the work and competitiveness we can get, that the <Col N="2316" /> Minister's response in a matter like this is simply to prosecute, to make it a criminal offence for someone to charge too little for taking cargo of manufactured exports out of this country.  That is pretty shameful.</P>
      <P>The provision relating to mail is probably in breach of EC law as the provisions relating to passengers appear to be, <i>prima facie</i> anyway, under the <i>Nouvelles Frontiéres</i> case.  For example, I would be very interested to hear what Commissioner Sutherland would have to say in a situation where those tendering for mail contracts within the Community were liable to prosecution for a criminal offence if they tendered too low.  This is the kind of thing Commissioner Sutherland wants to sweep aside, and properly so.  This is only part of what he has described in the whole air transport regulation system in Europe as the great black hole of the European economy.  This is the very sort of thing he wants to sweep aside, and he is going to great lengths to do so in the Commission and in Brussels.  It is a pity that he is getting so little encouragement from a Government he was once associated with in this way.</P>
      <P>The CII think that this provision making it a criminal offence to charge too little for cargo is ridiculous.  Virtually everybody who has been consulted can see no point in this.  The IDA, CTT and everybody else think that this is simply ridiculous.  Why is it being enacted into law?  Why is it a crime proposed to be a crime to charge too little for carrying Irish exports out of this country?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 34, to delete &ldquo;&lsquo;fare&rsquo; includes a fare net of discount;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments deal essentially with different aspects of the point I have been making on the last amendment, that is, they seek to prevent the prohibition now being brought in on discounted rates whether for passenger tickets, cargo or mail.  Apparently the Minister finds that the existing definitions of words like &ldquo;fare&rdquo; and &ldquo;rate&rdquo; are not sufficiently broad ranging and he wants to include in their meaning a fare or rate net of discount.  Apparently that was not the case up to now.  In other words, he wants to turn the screw further in order to regulate the whole system to the greatest possible extent and to criminalise the normal commercial activity of discounting fares or tickets.  It seems crazy that with all our economic difficulties we should constantly seek greater and greater State involvement in the normal commercial process, preventing market forces from operating as they do in neighbouring countries to a much greater extent.  The State's involvement is bringing the heavy, dead hand of bureaucracy down more heavily on those who would seek to operate air transport or travel businesses for the benefit of people here or of those who would wish to come here if they could get the opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth looking at much of the correspondence in the newspapers about the high level of fares into and out of this country, the difficulties of getting reasonable air fares and the appalling cartel situation which exists in relation to fares between here and Europe and especially the UK.  Many people speak in these terms from time to time and they find themselves slapped down by members of the cartel.  I have been accused of a vendetta because I deplore the efforts of cartel members to keep air fares so high. <Col N="2318" /> I have been told that it is a personal vendetta against our national airline.</P>
    <P>I read with interest the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Monday, 27 January 1986.  A very large headline stated &ldquo;Bruton Slams Aer Lingus on High Fares&rdquo;.  He got the kind of ritual response from Aer Lingus that he, like everyone else who criticises them, is entirely wrong.  But &ldquo;Bruton&rdquo; is not just a member of the public or an obscure Member of this House.  He is Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and he was wearing his tourism hat when deploring this situation.  He is a member of the same Cabinet as the Minister for Communications.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is right and everyone knows he is right, not least the Minister for Communications and his Department.  Why do we have to go on with this charade indefinitely?  Because we have to protect the British Airways-Aer Lingus cartel on the Irish Sea, we go on with a charade that potential tourists from Britain to Ireland are not being milked.  The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism deplores and regrets the situation which has arisen in tourism from Britain to here.  So do I.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, on discounts of fares and rates, which seems to go to the root of the whole question of the level of fares.  I am suggesting that these amendments be accepted.  The new definitions the Minister is trying to put in to cover discounts should not be inserted.  We should allow discounts in the normal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> contains a letter from a traveller who points out the constant difference in the fares from London to Dublin, London to Paris. <Col N="2319" /> London to Amsterdam and so on, showing that the Dublin fares are very substantially higher because they are kept up by a cartel and there is no proper competition.</P>
    <P>We have had one fortunate development in the past few months.  At least on one route to Britain there is an attractive fair, Ryanair are being allowed to charge a £99 return fare on the Dublin-Luton route.  If they are able to do that, how can it be suggested that the cartel fare of £204 or £208 is so attractive?  Why make it a crime for people to discount from that fare?  Can we now expect that the Ryanair fare of £99 return with no restrictions will be matched by the cartel members?  If not, why not?  Why should the public be deprived of that right?  Why should this cartel continue to be supported in the way it is?  What is the profitability of the cartel on the Dublin-London route?  Why has the London-Belfast route proved so successful?  Why has the number of passengers on the London-Belfast route increased from 700,000 to over 900,000 in the 18 months since competition was introduced?  Why is the number of passengers on the London-Dublin route falling?  Why is it that Aer Rianta have to express concern about the under-utilisation of Dublin Airport, while at the same time Belfast is growing enormously although Belfast could not be described in anyone's terms as an attractive destination?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very anxious that the House should get an opportunity to <Col N="2320" /> discuss all the amendments and I do not want to delay the House unavoidably.  I have stated my position quite clearly. Deputy O'Malley has gone on a lot about cartels.  Cartels operate on every international route.  Aer Lingus cannot go where they like in America.  They must get permission from the American Government.  We cannot go anywhere we like in Britain.  The routes must be governed by an agreement between ourselves and the British.  Our airline has to get British approval for their air tariffs. Flights between Britain and Amsterdam and between Britain and Rome are jointly regulated by the two Governments.  No Government abandoned the controls that Deputy O'Malley suggests we should abandon.</P>
      <P>In regard to cartels and prices I should like to emphasise to Deputy O'Malley, who has been praising the regime in Britain throughout the debate, that the British Civil Aviation Authority approved higher prices for the Dublin/London route than I was prepared to approve.  I got the price down.  That is why so much of what Deputy O'Malley has said in this debate is totally misconceived.  Many of the things he wants to achieve, such as lower air fares, more liberalisation and so on, are matters I passionately believe in and have been working hard to achieve since I became Minister.  We have had some success in that regard.  In the EC we are pressing stronger than any country for complete liberalisation so that Aer Lingus, or any other Irish airline, can have access to routes throughout Europe. The British withdrew freedom rights from Aer Lingus after the Irish company spent a lot of money developing routes out of Manchester at a time when nobody else was prepared to do so.  However, after the routes had been established, bang went the Aer Lingus right.  So much for liberalisation.  The French authorities took similar action in regard to the Lourdes and Rome routes.  No other company operated those routes with the exception of Aer Lingus, but when they were established Aer Lingus was chopped.  A similar decision was taken in regard to Geneva and Milan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2321" /> We are prepared to offer complete freedom of the Irish air routes to all-comers from Europe if we have complete freedom of the air routes in Europe.  That is the objective of Irish aviation policy and that line has been pressed strongly in Europe.  Aer Lingus will take their chances with the best in Europe provided the terms of competition are right. Deputy O'Malley is urging us to abandon our national interest in the mistaken belief that some other countries have abandoned theirs.  That is patently not so.</P>
    <P>I regret, therefore, that I am unable to accept Deputy O'Malley's amendments. The definition of &ldquo;fare&rdquo; to include a fare net of discount is aimed specifically at controlling discounting by airlines and intermediaries such as travel agents.  If this were not done a travel agent could perhaps sustain an argument in law that the Bill covered only the fares approved by the Minister but not the fare as discounted, the same consideration applies to the definition of &ldquo;rate&rdquo;, which is the term most commonly used for cargo services.</P>
    <P>If an air carrier wishes to amend or reduce its tariff in any way, it is completely free under the Bill to seek the approval of the Minister for such changes.  I will be prepared to consider under the Bill any special tariff submissions which an airline may feel it needs for advertising or other promotional activity; and, if I deem that such proposals are consistent with the criteria laid down in section 3, I will have no hesitation in approving them.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to read the extensive notes I have on this matter because I do not wish to delay the House.  Deputy O'Malley is proposing to take away from us power that the British and other countries have.  The Deputy read a long quotation from the air transport users magazine to the effect that passengers were not open to prosecution.  That is correct and the Bill does not propose to make passengers liable to prosecution. However, as in the UK and most other countries, airlines and their agents will <Col N="2322" /> be open to prosecution if they breach the regulation.  That shows the absurdity of Deputy O'Malley's opposition.  He is saying we should not have those powers but other countries should; that we should abandon our national interest while others do not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be interesting for somebody who has not heard all of this before to hear the Minister's reaction. The reaction has been the same for the last 18 months.  He spoke about the absurdity of my position.  That is pathetic. The Minister may believe some of what he has said but I do not.  The Minister moaned on at length about the necessity for us to have the same powers that other countries have.  In other words, he is saying that we must have the same power to prosecute people for discounting tickets. The Minister said that Britain has that power.  How many people have been prosecuted in Britain in the last five years for selling discounted tickets?  At least 20 seconds have elapsed since I posed that question but an answer is not forthcoming. Of course the answer is that no airline or travel agent was prosecuted.  Why, therefore, do we want to change the law to enable us to do it?  Why do we want to change the law to deal with something that is regarded as a commendable practice in other jurisdictions?  Why do we want to make it a criminal offence here to do something that 100 miles away in Britain, or less in Northern Ireland, is a commendable practice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quotation I referred to was not in the air transport users magazine but in a report by the Air Transport Users Statutory Committee, the official view of a statutory committee.  The Minister said that I am obsessed by the cartel and that there are cartels everywhere.  For example, he said that in going to the United States Aer Lingus has to form part of a cartel because it has to get permission from the United States.  That is not so.  I do not think the Minister understands what a cartel is.  There is no cartel on the North Atlantic route because the Americans would not wear it.  They would be horrified at the thought.  A person who <Col N="2323" /> tries to operate a cartel into the United States will be prosecuted by the US authorities for it, and very properly so, because it is a serious criminal offence under American law to operate a cartel. That is why such huge damages were awarded against British Airways, Pan-Am and other airlines recently.  They tried to operate a cartel to kill off the competition.</P>
    <P>There is no cartel on the North Atlantic or into the United States.  It would be a criminal offence to operate one.  But there is a cartel between Ireland and the United Kingdom, a serious and damaging one.  A cartel is not just an arrangement whereby two Governments licence the operation, as the Minister seems to think it is.  It is a secret commercial agreement on price and on sharing of the market, things that are explicitly prohibited by Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome.  It is done to the detriment of the consumer, is maintained to the detriment of the consumer and the profit that arises from it is enormous.  One of the major beneficiaries is British Airways and I would say that they cannot believe their luck that this is allowed to continue on the Irish scene.  For two years they have had to compete on the London/Belfast route. The cartel on that route was stopped and two other airlines, Dan-Air and British Midland, have moved in.  There is now genuine competition and all of a sudden the fares are well below what they were when there was a monopoly.  The fares are well below the London/Dublin route even though the London/Belfast route is longer and, therefore, more expensive.</P>
    <P>Those things go unanswered and it is not enough for the Minister to get up time and again and say that Deputy O'Malley is talking through his hat.  I am right and people know I am.  Every time one opens a paper one reads comments from various people.  I will quote a person of equally impeccable origin and genesis as the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Bruton, whom I quoted a few moments ago.  I quote Dr. Edward M. Walsh, President of the NIHE, Limerick who, as reported in <i>The <Col N="2324" /> Sunday Tribune</i> of 5 January last, said:</P>
    <P>It is absolutely vital that the Aer Lingus/British Airways cartel be broken.  If we want to develop service industry, software, consultancy, professional services, then one important Government initiative would be to break this cartel and bring fares into line with the norm.  Brussels should also encourage mobility, perhaps by subsidising fares.</P>
    <P>Presumably everyone who criticises this cartel situation and the abnormally high fares that we persist in maintaining here is, like myself, supposed to be totally wrong.  The country and the House are crazy to underwrite again in this Bill this mad system of deliberately keeping up fares.  We should have sense now and cut out the nonsense.  I have had calls to speak in recent weeks about pressure groups and so on, but here we find perhaps the most effective and professional of all pressure groups working successfully within this House.  It is an interesting study in relation to how such matters are approached that I am the only one to stand up here today and to call for what everyone in his heart knows to be right.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 41, to delete &ldquo;competitive airline tariffs,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;airline tariffs which are competitive in the fares, rates or other charges and in the terms and conditions applicable,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises out of our discussion on this subsection on Committee Stage on 4 December last, as reported at columns 1055, 1056, 1061 and 1062 of the Official Report.  It will be recalled that Deputy O'Malley wished to insert &ldquo;price&rdquo; before &ldquo;competitive&rdquo;, on the basis that airlines channel competition into areas, other than price, such as &ldquo;image building&rdquo; and &ldquo;artificial product <Col N="2326" /> differentiation&rdquo;.  I argued that this suggestion narrowed the scope of the provision and prevented the Minister considering in the interests of tourism the need for competition in so far as the terms and conditions of tariffs are concerned. An example might be where an unrestricted 1,000 French Franc one-way fare became available between Paris and a destination competing directly with Ireland for tourist business.  Once carriers on the Paris-Ireland routes filed a 1,000 French Franc one-way fare with me, even though its availability might be severely restricted I might not be able under Deputy O'Malley's formula to have regard to those restrictions, despite their adverse impact on the attractiveness of Ireland as a tourist destination.</P>
    <P>At the time I undertook to bring forward an alternative formulation which would enable the Minister to have regard to both the price and conditions elements of the airline tariff in assessing their competitiveness. That is the purpose of my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not enamoured with this amendment.  It misses the point I was trying to make at the earlier stage. It is very confusing to deal with a Bill that has been amended so heavily, though I welcome the amendments.  My recollection is that the phrase, &ldquo;competitive airline tariffs&rdquo; which the Minister is now proposing was itself an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It was.  The Deputy proposed that the word &ldquo;price&rdquo; be inserted but that would have had the effect of restricting&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was at my request that the Minister included the phrase &ldquo;competitive airline tariffs&rdquo;.  I was anxious to make it clear that what was involved was price competitiveness.  The Bill would be better as it stands than with the Minister's amendment.  He seeks to amend what was his own amendment on Committee Stage; but it can be argued that the new formulation is inferior because it affords equal status to price competition in what are referred to as <Col N="2327" /> fares, rates or other charges and to non-price competition &ldquo;in the terms and conditions applicable&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Competition in terms of non-price competition is a strong characteristic of European scheduled airlines or cartel airlines. They typically charge the same fares but engage in wasteful and costly attempts to secure product differentiation on the basis of, say, food or the image of the airline.  The tourist industry, to which this amendment is addressed, needs real price competition.  The Minister's amendment to his own Committee Stage amendment would equate competition with non-price competition.  Under the so-called non-price competition which exists between British Airways and Aer Lingus on the Irish Sea the number of air tourists to Ireland fell by 50 per cent between 1975 and 1983.  Therefore, the air traffic between Britain and the Republic of Ireland is falling; but where there is genuine price competition and not this illusory non-price competition in conditions and so on, is between London and Belfast.  An additional 210,000 people used that route in the first full year after the introduction of price competition. Therefore, I submit that price competitiveness is the important aspect and the Minister should not amend the Bill on lines that would give equal prominence to alleged areas of competition with such captions as &ldquo;We will give you champagne with your breakfast if you pay the £208 fare and will give you two rashers with your egg.  But the people at the back who are paying the Apex fare will be given only cold meat or something else&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this nonsense that goes on in attempts to sell the image of an airline is of no consequence whatever.  On a short hope from London to Dublin meals should not be served.  There should be none of that kind of nonsense.  Prices should be kept down in the way they are between London and Belfast.  That is the way it will be.  Yet we go through the futility of legislating for things that will be swept aside by market forces, and by the EC in any event.  Are we doing this simply to <Col N="2328" /> pander to the bureaucratic mind?  It will do nothing but harm to our national interest.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 4, to delete &ldquo;air transport&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;international&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment is almost the same as mine.  It was circulated late last night, obviously in reply to mine which was submitted yesterday.  I do not know why the Minister will not accept mine.  I wanted to delete &ldquo;air transport&rdquo; and to insert &ldquo;international&rdquo;, because we have to take account of all our international obligations.  Air transport agreements, which of their nature are international, should not be looked at in a vacuum.  It seems to me that the words &ldquo;or other international&rdquo; seem to be inappropriate because they give the choice of looking at air transport agreements or international agreements.  My amendment provides for all international agreements, which include air transport.  The Minister's amendment appears to accept entirely the point in my amendment.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for any air transport agreement for the time being in force. The defect I saw in that, and the Minister appears to agree, is that it is wrong to look just at air transport agreements and not at our general international obligations. Our primary general international obligation is to the Treaty of Rome.  Article 85.1 provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2329" /> The following shall be prohibited as incompatible with the common market: all agreements between undertakings, decision by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market, and in particular those which:</P>
    <P>(a)  directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions;</P>
    <P>(b)  limit or control production, markets, technical development, or investment;</P>
    <P>(c)  share markets or sources of supply;</P>
    <P>(d) apply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage.</P>
    <P>It is matters of that kind that should be taken into account.  That view is strongly held by the Commission in Brussels, not just by Commissioner Sutherland but by the Transport Commissioner, Mr. Clinton Dairs, who, in the October 1985 issue of the magazine <i>Euro Forum,</i> was reported to have said:</P>
    <P>If by next June, on the other hand, the negotiating process is not seen to be working we shall have no option but to use other weapons.  These weapons include direct action by the Commission against airline and Government practices which it believes are contrary to free and fair competition. Already, in order to give a warning of our determination we have taken a number of legal steps, but trying to achieve our objective through the courts is only a second best solution.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposals are contained in a memorandum which suggests relaxation of rules within the EC to allow enterprising airlines to bring in lower fares.  Therefore, I do not think we should <Col N="2330" /> be entitled to exclude major international treaties by which we are bound.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke about the international aspect on Committee Stage and earlier.  The House should welcome anything coming from the EC which will help consumers, but I should not like the House to think that there has been such rapid progress and general acceptance as Deputy O'Malley has suggested.  Peter Sutherland is the Competition Commissioner &mdash; he will have to major on that because he has been deprived of other parts of his brief &mdash; and in an interview in the February 1986 issue of <i>Irish Business</i> he gave his views on this.  He stated that he is committed to development that would make for more competition in Europe.  He went on:</P>
      <P>Some of the member states have traditionally argued that competition policy relates to all trading activity within the Community, with the exception of transport.</P>
      <P>This shows the difficulty he has in achieving his objective.  He stated that until a common transport policy is adopted by the Commission, the Competition Directorate has no right to interfere on transport issues.  I came up against that attitude in Education, particularly with the Danes who would not allow any advance in that field because they said it was not included in the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Sutherland said he rejected that kind of attitude or interpretation.  On Committee Stage, I pointed out that there seems to be an implication in some of what he said, and what the Transport Commissioner has said, that somehow or other the Commission will be able to do things that the Council of Ministers do not want done or have not decided to do. There has been a reference to Memorandum No. 2 which is important and will become increasingly important.  Mr. Sutherland said that court proceedings would be less satisfactory than progress by agreement and decision in the Council. It is important for the House to reflect on that.  Mr. Sutherland said that progress <Col N="2331" /> through the courts would be less satisfactory because Memorandum No. 2 allows for a structured development of the air transport field whereas if court proceedings are taken it can have the result of total deregulation which is not something which the Commission has been seeking as they have been looking for something less than the American situation of total deregulation.</P>
    <P>When Mr. Sutherland was asked quite bluntly what progress had been made he did not seem to have a great deal to go on but said that during the course of the last year there had been significant improvements and that there was a clear climate of opinion developing towards a liberalisation, and he then mentioned what the Minister and Deputy O'Malley have already mentioned, that bilateral agreements between the British and the Dutch and the British and the Belgians have been successful.  That is the sum total of what can be claimed in this field. The British, as Mr. Sutherland says, have been adopting a very liberal approach. That would go along with their Tory free market philosophy.  It is easy to see why we should adopt that philosophy.  I would emphasise that there is a tough enough furrow to hoe yet before significant advances are made in what is called the liberalisation of transport.  It is not just a one dimensional position and the House should be aware of that and take cognisance of it.  Mr. Sutherland also in that interview indicated that suggestions that more freedom means less safety and so on is not necessarily so.  My reason for rising on this point with regard to the amendment to include the word &ldquo;international&rdquo; is to indicate that there are two sides to the story.</P>

      <P>When I got to consider Deputy O'Malley's amendment in the early hours of this morning I thought there was some merit in what he had said. <Col N="2332" /> We could not accept precisely what the Deputy proposed but we are proposing to insert after &ldquo;air transport&rdquo;, &ldquo;or other international&rdquo;.  Deputy O'Malley is worried that that would give another option. The paragraph will now read:</P>
      <P>any air transport or other international agreement for the time being in force, to which the State is a party...</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley seems to be concerned about the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; but if he reads the whole paragraph there is no problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The words &ldquo;and which the Minister considers relevant&rdquo; should be omitted because if the Minister were perverse enough to form an opinion that the Treaty of Rome was not relevant or that some air transport bilateral agreement was not relevant, he could consider it irrelevant and then do what he likes even though it might be flagrantly in breach of the Treaty.  It is just commonsense that that should be left out.  It should not just <Col N="2333" /> be a question of whether or not a Minister considers it relevant.  If we are bound by these agreements we cannot consider them irrelevant.</P>

      <P>Deputies may recall that during Committee Stage at column 1882, Volume 358 of the Official Report of 22 May 1985 a suggestion was made by Deputy O'Malley that the requirement to file airline tariffs arising from the issue of a notice under this section might only be applied to some carriers.  I undertook at the time to bring in an amendment on Report Stage the effect of which would be to impose a duty on the Minister in issuing such notices not to discriminate between carriers.

Amendment No. 14 is obviously a midnight amendment in response to mine and I am grateful to the Minister.  The only difference between the amendments is that in amendment No. 14 the word &ldquo;decision&rdquo; is used and in amendment No. 15 I had &ldquo;submissions&rdquo; inserted.  There is a big difference between decisions and submissions.  It is one thing for the Minister to publish his decision which is either yes or no but the applications under section 3 are important. Why does the Minister rule out submissions and confine it only to his own decisions?</P>

      <P>I accepted a large part of the substance of Deputy O'Malley's amendment by inserting an amendment in the early hours of the morning to meet as much of his point as I thought possible or desirable.  I substituted the word &ldquo;decision&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;submissions&rdquo; because anyone who wishes to make a submission can publicise it if he or she wishes.  However, sometimes submissions may include confidential corporate information which it would not be appropriate to publish. For that reason, I cannot accept it.  The other point is that if the register is to be useful it should have merely essential <Col N="2337" /> information and should not be clogged up with irrelevancies.  The idea of sending in huge submissions could be used as a ploy to confuse the situation and to hide relevant information.  They are the reasons for not accepting Deputy O'Malley's precise amendment and why I tabled my own during the night.</P>

      <P>The submissions made are of crucial importance because if they are excluded and if decisions are made rather than applications and submissions, inadequate notice is given to the public or those in the trade who are interested in these matters.  There have been so many amendments made to the Bill that I am trying to trace one of the earlier ones.  Applications have been added to the register by amendment No. 13 which was one of the first taken today.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment is to replace that contained in section 5 (1) (b) of the Bill before these amendments were made because it is the same terminology. I cannot ask the Minister any more questions so the debate is a little pointless at this stage.  This is an unusual Report Stage because there are a very large number of amendments and some of them are fundamental to the Bill and will change its nature.  It is terribly difficult when I am only allowed to speak once on each amendment.  If I ask a question that is my time used up for that amendment. It is not a very meaningful procedure.</P>

      <P>I know but it is not satisfactory.  The whole purpose of this register which it is proposed to introduce &mdash; and I acknowledge that the Minister agreed with my suggestions that it should be more meaningful than proposed earlier &mdash; is to give information to the public, the trade and to consumers and consumer organisations about what is happening.  One of the awful features about applications for licences and services and so on is that it all goes on behind <Col N="2338" /> the scenes.  There are close relationships between certain civil servants and people in a particular airline, which is unhealthy to say the least and is condoned to a far greater extent in this country than in others&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This situation has existed for some time and it does not exist in other countries in that way.  It is better that more of these matters should be brought into the open and that the register should be as full as possible in the sense that the public will have the right to access to as much information as possible short of doing commercial damage to individual airlines.  I mean genuine commercial damage and not what they consider to be commercial damage.  My concern is that this register should contain the maximum amount of information compatible with that objective because it has been a totally closed shop and all kinds of things were going on behind closed doors.  It is in everyone's interest &mdash; not least that of the civil servants &mdash; that they can now point to a register that contains all the relevant information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I am making is that I do not <Col N="2339" /> think it contains all the relevant information although it will contain a lot of it. We now have a register which we did not have before the Bill.  The Minister put down an amendment to introduce it and he is now amending it further in response to my amendments and suggestions.  It would be in the interests of civil servants if more information was made available as is the case in other countries.  In some countries it is compulsory by law.  They cannot conceal these matters.  It would also prevent civil servants from being open to the innuendo's which inevitably arise &mdash; for example, the internal Aer Lingus memorandum which I quoted during Committee Stage &mdash; if they could point to documents which were freely available and to which the public and the press had access as of right.</P>
    <P>It is not enough simply to include the decisions because these are after the event.  What should be included are the submissions but the Minister would have the right, on the request of an airline, to exclude anything that might be commercially damaging if it were published. Some bits and pieces could be damaging because the airline would be giving private information which they might not wish to make public, and they would have the right to object to it being made public, but most of the submission should be published and subject to public scrutiny. This is taken for granted in other countries but we are very slow to move in this direction.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is concerned about civil servants, whom I am not impugning, it would strengthen their hand if negotiations did not take place behind closed doors and would not give rise to the kind of thing which caused a certain person in Aer Lingus to write the memorandum I quoted to someone else in Aer Lingus. There are other interesting references I could produce if they are needed to show that it has been less than satisfactory that these matters have been conducted in private.</P>
    <P>Between now and when this Bill is presented in the Seanad, I would ask the Minister to consider looking at this again. <Col N="2340" /> I know his amendment is almost the same as mine, with the exception of the publication of the submission, but I ask him to think whether the general public interest, and not least the interests of the people in his Department, might be served by publishing as much of this as is compatible with commercial prudence rather than as little.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 15 and 16, to delete &ldquo;not contained in&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;greater than&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 6 deals with offences and reads:</P>
      <P>(1)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a person collects, charges, makes, applies or imposes any fare, rate or other charge, term or condition to which this Act applies, and</P>
      <P>(b)  (i) the fare, rate or other charge, term or condition is not contained in an airline tariff previously submitted by or on behalf of the air carrier concerned to the Minister...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose that the change be made so that it will read that &ldquo;the fare, rate or other charge, term or condition is not greater than contained in an airline tariff ...&rdquo; In other words, if a particular fare level is approved by the Minister and someone wants to charge less, that would not constitute an offence, but if he charged more it would.  Originally such a person would lose his licence as a travel <Col N="2341" /> agent, get two years in jail and be fined £100,000.  Happily the licence revocation provision is gone, jail is gone and the fine is reduced to £50,000.  I am giving the Minister two and a half out of three for that because although he has got rid of two and a half of the three penal penalties. I still consider a fine of £50,000 for charging too little for an airline ticket a bit extreme.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting in this amendment that provided the fare charged is not above the approved level a travel agent or other person of that kind should not be guilty of an offence for charging less than the approved level.  That seems to be commonsense and, as I said, last year and the year before, five million such tickets were sold in Britain.  Tour operators in Britain and Northern Ireland have official encouragement to do this. Why should it be encouraged as a commendable normal commercial practice in Northern Ireland and be a criminal offence here to knock a pound or two off an airline ticket?  Now such a person may be fined up to £50,000 but happily will no longer be jailed or lose his licence in this jurisdiction.  This is the purpose of my amendment and would avoid a lot of difficulty, hardship and unfairness to which this Bill will give rise.</P>

      <P>The effect of the <Col N="2342" /> amendment would be to make it an offence only where a fare was sold at a level higher than the approved level.  We had extensive discussions on this on Committee Stage when the Deputy put forward a number of amendments advocating control in a maximum selling fare basis.  As I pointed out then, such an approach would be tantamount to deregulation of air fares.  Contrary to what the Deputy has said, it is not the case in Northern Ireland that air fares have been deregulated.  In an extreme situation it would leave the Minister virtually powerless in dealing with dumped or predatory prices.  Therefore, I must reject the amendment.</P>
      <P>This is the basis of the whole issue in aviation.  Predatory pricing has littered aviation history with many aviation corpses.  Airlines have collapsed and passengers have been stranded.  It is going for the short-term bargaining regardless of the long-term implications.  We must have some control over air fares so that that will not happen.  We must also have control so that people may not charge excessive prices.  I have used my existing powers on many occasions in the past three years to bring down air fares.  Even where increases have been approved by other civil aviation authorities, I have insisted on smaller increases.  That is the way the powers will be used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The cartel agree between themselves and seek an increase of 10 per cent.  They go to the British authorities who tell them that as there is no competition on the route they can have whatever they agree between themselves as a cartel.  When they bring it to the attention of the Minister here he tells them that 10 per cent is very high but he will grant them an increase of 5 per cent. <Col N="2343" /> He regards it as doing a great service to the Irish people but the fact is that the full cartel fare is already at an outrageously high level.  What the Minister should do if he wants to bring down air fares is to say to those people in the cartel that they must compete the same as happens on the London-Belfast route. Otherwise he should tell them he will allow in more people on the route.</P>
      <P>A fare is regarded as reasonable and one that cannot be reduced below a figure of, say, £208 but then a new airline comes along and offers to fly without any restrictions for a £99 fare.  Why can that airline operate on an exactly comparable basis for a fare of £99 while the cartel has a fare of £208?  One of the members in the Irish Sea cartel reduced its fares enormously on the London-Belfast route when there was competition &mdash; in this connection I refer to British Airways. Could they not reduce their fares on the London-Dublin route if they were subjected to competition on that route? Reducing the level of annual increase on the part of the Minister is not keeping air fares down and I do not think anyone other than a simple-minded person would believe that.  Air fares on the Irish Sea route could be slashed down to the Ryanair level or to the level of British Midland and British Airways on the Belfast route if the cartel were removed. One of the ways is to allow competition. We should not have an artificial cartel where there is no competition except in regard to items such as meals, the colour of the airline or the attractiveness of the staff.  These factors are not relevant to competition.</P>
      <P>One way to reduce fares is to start having some competition, but that cannot be done if we make it a crime to compete. This amendment is designed to allow people to charge the approved fare or less than the approved fare and not have to face a fine of £50,000.  If a travel agent wants to give a discount or if an airline wants to charge a lower price they should not be penalised.  It is not possible to have competition on the one hand while making it a crime on the other hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2344" /> It might be worthwhile reminding the House of the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission on this matter which was published last year.  Recommendation No. 9 stated:</P>
    <P>The inclusion of a provision in the rules of an association of tour operators and/or travel agents imposing on its members price maintenance requirements in respect of rates and fares on scheduled services, whether surface or air, should be prohibited.</P>
    <P>This Bill will make compulsory measures which the Restrictive Practices Commission recommended should be prohibited.  Here we have two agencies of the State pulling in exactly opposite directions.  The Restrictive Practices Commission say that the provisions in this Bill making it a crime to charge too little should be prohibited by law.</P>
    <P>Before this Bill was introduced the Irish Travel Agents' Association had an arrangement that they would not compete with one another below a certain level.  The Restrictive Practices Commission inquired into that and they said it should be prohibited by law.  They said there should be competition and that anything which did not lead to that should be prohibited by law.  In this case the direct opposite is being done.  Law is being enacted to make illegal the very thing the Restrictive Practices Commission said should be legal.  We are a mixed-up country.  We are a mixed-up House.</P>
    <P>In a sense this is the kernel of the matter.  Do we want competition or do we not want it?  Are we going out on a limb at a time when a decision is expected from the European Court with regard to a certain case, where the whole tendency worldwide is towards greater competition and freedom in these areas?  At this time we are making it a criminal offence to charge perhaps £1 too little for an airline ticket.  We are flying in the face of the recommendations of the Restrictive Practices Commission, of the White Paper on Tourism published by the Government last year and of the experience on the Belfast-London route.  In the <Col N="2345" /> first full year of competition there when the cartel was abolished the traffic grew on that route by 30 per cent.  It is now at 910,000 a year compared to under 700,000 before competition was introduced. Fares are lower as a result and services are better.  The Belfast-London route is now bigger than the Dublin-London route.  If we are seriously interested in promoting a competitive aviation policy we should examine the undoubted success of price competition on the Belfast-London route.  This amendment is crucial to this whole matter.  It would seek not to make normal commercial competition a criminal offence.  Therefore I recommend it to the House.  I see that Deputy Skelly wishes to offer.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 1 to 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to remove a subsection which would have the effect of making somebody other than the person who committed the offence guilty of the offence, even though that offence might well have been committed without that person's knowledge and even without any possibility of his knowledge.  It seems, therefore, that this provision is especially odious and onerous from the point of view of the criminal law particularly as the matters we are dealing with are not criminal offences in the normal sense of the word but simply efforts to prevent people engaging in normal commercial activity.  The effect of this subsection if it were to stand would be that if some travel agent somewhere at some time were to give even a minor discount on an airline ticket out of his 9 per cent commission, the air carrier concerned, even if they knew nothing about it and could not know anything about it, would still be deemed to have committed an offence. That is monstrous.  If this were not applied, say, to airlines, if it were applied to some company manufacturing some product and if the retailer of it were to give a discount of £1 or £5 or something off the price of it in a shop in some remote town or village without the knowledge of the manufacturer, there would be an absolute public outcry if the manufacturer was then going to be prosecuted for having committed an offence.  The same is true here.  It is one thing if it is an Irish airline, but if it is a foreign airline, American, French, British, German or whatever, why should they be made criminally liable for a minor discount given in the normal course of events by a travel agent in the normal course of his business? It is monstrous and would not be tolerated in any sphere of commercial activity and it would be disgraceful if this were introduced into our criminal law on the basis that people can be responsible <Col N="2347" /> in crime for acts that they could not conceivably know anything about.</P>
    <P>It is obvious where this came from. This was suggested by an airline in this country in order to get at an airline that was trying to introduce competition into this country.  Competition is frowned on by the powers that be here to the extent that it is made a crime if you compete. This is a monstrous provision and this subsection should be dropped.  I cannot think of any parallel for it in commercial law nor would any such parallel be allowed.</P>

      <P>It is one thing to protect Aer Lingus in these circumstances.  It is quite another thing when it is broadened widely to affect any person who even advertises the name of any other airline. The objective is to act in the common good.  If Aer Lingus represented the only common good there is in relation to airlines or air travel in our society, that might be acceptable, but we must consider the knock on effect and the tremendous damage that this provision and the previous one on which there was a vote could have on our economy.  The Minister must act for the common good, but this section and the last section in effect will block tens of thousands of people from travelling over here at reasonable rates in order to shop, tour or be entertained.  In my submissions to this House in the past I have made the point that one of the solutions to our huge unemployment problem, to the tourist industry's problems&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is on amendment No. 17.  One solution is to attract into this country huge numbers of people who by their spending power can provide large numbers of jobs.  I am thinking particularly of the Dublin area.  I addressed the Irish Hotels Federation not long ago on this topic and I suggested that Dublin could be turned into a tourist, shopping, entertainment Mecca for these islands. <Col N="2348" /> We should think of ourselves as a city in the midst of 60 million people.</P>
      <P>In case you think I am going off the subject, Sir, Aer Lingus and fares come into it by a link up with the shopping, entertainment, tourist and hotel facilities in this city and country by providing reasonable fares.  At present people who can go to Amsterdam for £49 will not consider for even one minute coming to Dublin at the astronomical fares they have to pay, not to mention the ordinary citizen here being totally blocked out of even considering making a casual trip in this country because of the high fares. The Minister should take into account the common good, the unemployment situation and the effect of competition being opened and fares reduced between Britain and here.  Let him consider the stimulus this would have on our economy particularly in the Dublin region where a third of our population reside.  If competition were introduced and this amendment accepted, it is possible that carriers would make available package trips in co-operation and conjunction with the Irish Tourist Board, the shops, the hotels and the entertainment business that would bring tens of thousands of people in here.</P>
      <P>Our trouble is that we have no confidence in the business community who want to do that at the moment; we will not allow them to do it.  I suggest that the Minister has a responsibility to consider this very carefully because we have our heads in the sand and we are protecting one airline.  Maybe we are keeping the air fare between Ireland and Great Britain high in order to protect Aer Lingus and, of course, it suits British Airways also, but by doing that we are doing enormous damage.  Maybe the Minister should hire an economist to find out how much money, how many tens, hundreds of millions of pounds we are losing by pursuing this course of action.  It is stupid.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. M.

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Planning Acts, applications for permission to develop land, and appeals to An Bord Pleanála, must be considered and determined on the basis of physical planning criteria. Moreover, where permission is granted, the permission attaches to the land and not to the person who applied for the permission.  The status or previous record of an applicant for permission could not, <Col N="2351" /> therefore, be made a material consideration in determining a planning application without changes in fundamental features of the planning system.</P>
      <P>In so far as the problem of unfinished estates is concerned, I am satisfied that existing planning law, if used effectively, should ensure that serious problems do not arise.  The acts expressly provide for the attaching of conditions to planning permissions requiring security for the satisfactory completion of development. Detailed guidelines have been issued to planning authorities by my Department in relation to the use of conditions of this kind.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the present bonding system because at times the amount is inadequate when a query is raised with a local authority?  Householders have informed me that they cannot dispose of their houses because estates are left undeveloped. Is it possible to make an arrangement to ensure that the bond is sufficient so that local authorities do not have to enter negotiations or have to try to beat developers into completing estates?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that greater care is being taken by planning authorities in formulating conditions attaching to planning permissions regarding security for the satisfactory completion of housing development.  More extensive and effective use is being made of the enforcement powers provided in the 1976 Act.  Penalties for planning offences were increased in 1982 and this ensures that the problems which arose in old estates &mdash; I believe the Deputy is referring to such estates &mdash; will be exceptions in the future.  I am satisfied that the circular issued in 1979 to bring to the notice of the local authorities their powers in this regard, and the advice given in it, has been taken into account by such bodies.  This has resulted in more attention being paid to builders in local authority areas and to getting them to comply with all requirements under the Planning Acts.  I am relatively satisfied with the present position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will explain the calculation of the Estimate shown for water and sewerage subsidy in 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The sanitary services subsidy requirement is affected by two main considerations &mdash; the size of the capital investment in sanitary services and the interest rates which apply.  The 1986 subsidy requirement is based on the loan charges on the capital already borrowed for sanitary services in the years up to 1986, and on the loan charges on the relevant part of the extra capital which will be borrowed by local authorities for this purpose in 1986.  I notified local authorities some months ago of a reduction of 3 per cent &mdash; from 13.5 per cent to 10.5 per cent &mdash; in the interest rate applicable to all local loans fund moneys borrowed since 1 November 1982 for sanitary services.</P>
      <P>Despite this unprecedented reduction in interest rates, the subsidy provision of £45.65 million for 1986 is up 4 per cent on last year's figure and is more than double the corresponding provision for 1982.  This is due to the very high level of investment in the provision of sanitary services in the past few years.  The extent of the expansion which has been taking place is illustrated by the growth in capital spending on sanitary services from £195 million in the three years 1980 to 1982 to £273 million in the past three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital investment in the sanitary services area is very welcome. I initiated some of this work when I was in the Department so I am very pleased that it has been continuing. Would the Minister not agree that the figure which represents an increase, according to him of 4 per cent, though the Book of Estimates figure is about 5 per cent, would suggest an arbitrary cut in the Estimate as distinct from the figure that should be shown?  The capital investment in this area in the past 12 months and in previous years would suggest a <Col N="2355" /> subsidy figure of the order of £5 million or £6 million more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree.  I am satisfied that the moneys being allocated this year to sanitary services will meet the needs for the programme we have set out which, as the Deputy has acknowledged, is a much expanded one.  As he says rightly, he was involved to some extent in steering the programme in that direction. This year's allocation will enable the programme to be continued at its very high level.  I would not agree with the Deputy's suggestion that what he refers to as a cut of £5 million is reflected in the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously we welcome the increased expenditure on the sanitary services programme in the past number of years but the question relates not to the amount of work that will be undertaken this year but directly to the subsidy that must be paid in respect of work that has been carried out up to now.  We do not take into account in this respect the work of 1986 but the volume of work that has taken place in previous years.  With the increased volume of work in the past number of years, I suggest that the subsidy figure as shown in the Estimate and not reflecting an arbitrary cut should be somewhere in the order of £5 million to £6 million higher on the basis of the amount of work that has been carried out in previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The growth in the subsidy provision from £21.42 million in 1982 to £45.65 million in 1986, significant through it is, does not give a true picture of the extent of the progress made in the provision of public water and sewerage schemes in the past few years.  The second element which affects the loan charges and, consequently the subsidy, is the rate of interest of the LLF.  With effect from 1 November 1985 the interest rate chargeable on all the funds taken out for sanitary services from 1 February 1982 has been reduced by 3 per cent.  The Deputy must agree that affects the amount paid in subsidy because it is <Col N="2356" /> decreasing the amount which could be demanded had the 13.5 per cent level remained for the current year and for a period in which the lower rate is now applicable.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I cannot agree with the Deputy that that has not had the effect of reducing the amount of subsidy required to cover the same amount which he seems to think would be needed without any reduction but which I say is covered adequately in the Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister reconsider that reply and bring forward his review of these loan limits?  Traditionally, the SDA loan scheme has been the backbone for certain categories of house purchasers in enabling them to provide a place in which to live but because the limits are so low, both in terms of loan and of the income level, increasing numbers of people are having to apply for <Col N="2358" /> Housing Finance Agency loans.  That scheme is meeting a need but in the long term these loans will impose greater burdens on houseowners who, for example, wish to sell their homes.  It is time for the Minister to alter the SDA income and loan limits.  When were they last increased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The loan and income limits for local authority purchase schemes were last increased on 1 February 1984.  The present limits are £16,000 for the loan and £8,000 for the income in the preceding tax year.  No income limit is applicable in the case of special category loans, the figure for which is £20,000. This is applicable to tenant purchasers who surrender their houses to local authorities.  It applies also to certain applicants on the housing lists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more than two years since that review occurred of income and loan limits.  Average house prices in that category are about £25,000, and surely it is a matter of urgency to improve the loan limit from £16,000 in view of gap between that figure and £25,000.  May I ask how is it thought that a would-be purchaser could save for a deposit out of an income of £8,000?  Surely we should be encouraging more people to be applying for SDA loans rather than forcing them into the HFA scheme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is great demand for SDA loans.  Those who are local authority tenants who apply for these loans get a grant of £5,000 which can be added to the deposit.  I am keeping the position under review.  I am aware there is a need to expand the limits in both cases and I am looking at it very seriously.  However, as a former Minister the Deputy is aware that when you change the limits you widen the group of people demanding SDA loans, and an increase in the limits would draw people away from the HFA scheme into the SDA.  We must look carefully at it to see what the effect would be from that point of view.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his Department will consider issuing guidelines or directives or will consult with local authorities and public utility companies, such as the ESB, Bord Telecom and New Dublin Gas, with a view to reducing the frequency with which streets and roads are dug up by these companies.</P>

      <P>My Department are not normally involved in problems arising in respect of road openings, which are seen as matters related to the day-to-day functions of the local authority.  The difficulties in Dublin have been related in the main to the large volume of work being done on upgrading the telephone system and converting the gas system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1981 the Dublin Transportation Task Force, which is representative of the Departments of the Environment, Communications and Justice, the Garda and Dublin Corporation, laid down procedures for the co-ordination of road works and road openings and these are operated by the Traffic Department of Dublin Corporation.  Under the aegis of the task force, a meeting took place <Col N="2360" /> recently involving Dublin Corporation and the statutory undertakers at which improved co-ordination arrangements were agreed with a view to minimising traffic disruption.  These arrangements are now in place and will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>Section 40 of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill, which is awaiting Committee Stage in the Dáil, when enacted, will give the authority power to issue directions to statutory undertakers and local authorities as to the period during which, the times at which, and the manner in which road works may be carried out.  In using this power, the authority will have to have regard to the need to co-ordinate the execution of road works, the necessity to minimise traffic disruption, the urgency of the road works and the extra cost, if any imposed by the direction.  In view of the improved co-ordination arrangements and pending the enactment of the Bill and the bringing into force of the new legislative provisions, I would consider it inappropriate to issue any guidelines on the question of road openings.  I can, however, assure the Deputy that I will keep this issue under regular review and will take appropriate action if I consider it warranted.</P>

      <P>The Local Improvements Scheme relates to farm road projects eligible for EC aid under the Western Package.  The Western Package covers the western region of Ireland designated as less favoured under EC Regulation 75/272.  In 1985, the area of the country designated as less favoured as extended under Regulation 85/350. Recently, the Department of Agriculture made a request to the EC Commission that the area assisted under the Western <Col N="2361" /> package be expanded to include these additional less favoured areas.</P>
      <P>The 1986 Exchequer provision for the Local Improvements Scheme is £2.15 million.  On 29 January 1986, allocations totalling £2.06 million were notified to local authorities.  A breakdown of these allocations is being circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Allocations to local authorities under the scheme are generally decided on the basis of a broad assessment of needs and the extent of dependence on the scheme over the years.  I do not propose to change this system.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that this scheme is one of the most important in rural Ireland from the point of view of job maintenance and potential job creation?  In view of the 240,000 people unemployed, one would think that the amounts allocated to this scheme would have been increased this year. However it is the same as last year, no increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Western Package applies to the western region, and is basically funded by the EC.  Other areas which benefited by the scheme in the old days maintained the scheme so that the full EC aid would be attracted to them. We endeavoured to get an expansion of <Col N="2362" /> EC allocations for other areas such as Meath, Offaly, Tipperary North and South, parts of Cork and Limerick.  If those areas areas added to the 11 others, when funds are available from the EC, the Department will be required to match the amount.  Naturally, this fund will be expanded if and when it is agreed at EC level for the additional areas in the other counties I have just mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have specific information about that, but the backlog of applications held by local authorities is not a satisfactory criterion on which to base the distribution of funds.  It is a matter for each council to decide on the manner of recording applicants for grants and the system of distribution of grants allocated in their area.  Some councils keep a register of applications in date order of receipt and deal with them in that order, others adopt varying procedures for example, in the selection of applications on an area basis by councillors, and some do not invite applications regularly.  It is within the ambit of the local authorities not to over encourage the schemes when they know the limited amount of money available for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a delay of between six and ten years in some areas with regard to the application of funds to these schemes? This being so, would the Minister consider adding to the amount available for the local improvement schemes now, seeing that, as he has stated, total funding is from the EC and prior to EC money becoming available a substantial fund was spent on these schemes?</P>

      <P>While they are eligible for EC funding, surely that depends on the amount of the applications sent to the EC.  If it is a £ for £ situation, as I understand it, surely if the Government were prepared to invest more in this scheme the equivalent amount would be available from EC sources.  The Minister indicated that if extra counties were to be included, extra funds would be required. Surely the extra funds could be used in the 11 counties that are less favoured at the moment.  There is need for extra investment in improvement work; it is creating jobs in a climate of 240,000 people unemployed, so surely it makes good economic sense rather than having people signing on the dole in rural areas to have them involved in LIS schemes, and that depends on the Government being prepared to allocate cash.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that any money we can secure from the EC is not constrained by the amount of money we are prepared to apply to any scheme in this area.  The limitation is a result of what the EC decide are the schemes which they are prepared to fund. In this year their total funding amounts to £0.85 million.  From the figures I have read out the Deputy will see that my Department are paying the lion's share of the amount of money spent in this area.  Other areas benefiting from the LIS scheme some years ago have had this withdrawn from them and these areas which I mentioned are now the only areas which have the benefit of these schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give an assurance that there will be no revision of the differential rents scheme in 1986.  The intention was indicated in the national plan that rents should be raised progressively to a level more in line with the actual costs of the dwellings.  Changes in the rent levels would, however, be made within the framework of the differential rents scheme which ensure that rents are reasonable in relation to family incomes. I can assure the House that it will be a priority in any review of the rent scheme to ensure that rents are reasonable in relation to family income and do not bear unduly on those with low incomes.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the number of local authority houses he expects to be built in 1986; and the difference between the national plan estimate and the figure that appears in the published estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect that about 5,500 local authority houses will be completed in 1986.  The number of houses becoming available for reletting is expected to be over 4,000 allowing the target set in the national plan of providing accommodation annually for 9,000 households to be met comfortably again this year.  <i>Building on Reality</i> did not contain separate projections of expenditure on local authority housing.  Total public capital expenditure on housing in 1986 was projected to be £397 million. The actual capital provision for housing this year is £409 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's answer related to the total expenditure on housing but the specific question relates to local authority expenditure.  In <i>Building on Reality</i> the Government claimed to recognise the importance of adequate housing and said that a sum of £200 million had been spent on local authority housing last year.  Working on a sum of £200 million for 1984, surely the Minister will accept that the sum of £178 million is totally inadequate for 1986?  <i>Building on Reality</i> also mentioned a figure of 6,000 local authority houses being built each year but this figure has not been met as is obvious from the Minister's reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously we can pick bits out of <i>Building on Reality</i> to suit our arguments, but it said that we would provide accommodation annually for 9,000 households on the waiting list by <Col N="2368" /> building 6,000 new houses each year and by seeking to ensure that about 3,000 houses from existing stock would be available for reletting.  That would ease the demand for local authority housing by retaining the present range of incentives to private housing which cater particularly for people on local authority waiting lists and by promoting a number of new measures to facilitate local authority tenants to avail of private housing.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that 9,000 households will be removed from the waiting list and provided with houses.  During the past two years we exceeded the figure of 9,000 by over 1,000 in each of the years and it will also be exceeded this year.  It must be obvious to Deputies that there has been a rapid drop in the number of people on the housing lists in their areas because of the availability of houses for prospective tenants on the waiting lists. This is more obvious in the city and county of Dublin where waiting lists have been considerably reduced over the past two years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware of the deepening crisis in the building industry; and the action he proposes to take to reverse the decline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties facing the building industry, but I do not accept that there is a deepening crisis in the industry, as the Deputy's question implies.  On the contrary the evidence available to me indicates that considerable progress will be made this year towards ending the decline in the industry's output, providing clear evidence that the Government's policies in relation to the industry are now beginning to pay dividends.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy has been twofold &mdash; to maintain public investment at the highest sustainable levels and to create the general economic environment, providing appropriate incentives, that will lead to increased private investment in construction, which is essential for a soundly based expansion of output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Government took office, public capital investment in construction, <Col N="2370" /> for example, in the roads programme, has been maintained at high levels despite the difficult financial climate; this year it will show an overall increase of 3½ per cent compared with 1985.  In relation to private investment.  I would refer the Deputy to the package of employment, taxation and financial incentives announced by the Taoiseach on 23 October last. The package is particularly important to the construction industry as it includes major incentives for the development of the Custom House dock site and of designated inner city areas in Dublin, Limerick and Cork, a generous new scheme of house improvement grants and grants for the provision of community, leisure and other facilities in areas of social need.</P>
    <P>I would also direct the Deputy's attention to my recent announcement that a construction industry development council are to be established within the next few months.  The council will be representative of all interests in the building industry and their main function will be to consider and make recommendations on matters related to the performance of the industry.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these measures, as I have outlined them, will provide a substantial boost to the industry and will result in additional output and employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister reassess his opinion that there is not a deepening crisis in view of the fact that cement sales have fallen by 17 per cent in the past two years, employment is exactly one half of what it was in 1980, the number of houses completed in the past three years has fallen by 25 per cent and VAT has increased from 5 per cent to 10 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>We can all get into this game of pointing to figures and statistics. I have my statistics here which I hope refute what the Deputy is saying.  The following pre-budget forecasts for the construction industry output in 1986 were published by the Central Bank, Jerome Casey and Company Limited and the ESRI.  The Central Bank suggested that <Col N="2371" /> there would be a 1 per cent fall in output in the construction industry; Jerome Casey also suggested a 1 per cent fall; and he ESRI said there would be an increase of 2 per cent.  That is the basis for some optimism for a turnaround in the industry.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years the output volume changes which were declining in 1983, 1984 and 1985, were showing a lesser decline each year, from minus 15.3 per cent in volume in 1983 to minus 8.1 per cent in 1984 and an estimated minus 5 per cent in 1985.  That is a reason for optimism and a basis for me to say there is not a deepening crisis.  The opposite is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the Minister's figures that there is likely to be a 1 per cent increase, or something of that order, these figures were arrived at using an extremely low base and as such are doing little more than holding the situation. Would the Minister not accept, as the whole country accepts, that there is an unemployment figure of 17 per cent and in the building industry that figure stands at over 40 per cent?  Those two figures have to be the bottom line.  I do not think they are disputable and as such that has to amount to a crisis.  If 40 per cent of workers in a certain industry are unemployed, that has to be a crisis and steps will have to be taken to remedy the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister define a crisis?  There is a crisis in the building industry because employment is almost half what it was in 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>At no stage did I say there was not a problem for the construction industry.  I took issue with Deputy Brennan when he said the crisis was deepening.  I was trying to demonstrate from the figures I have that the crisis is not deepening.  The action being taken by this Government is beginning to reverse the situation &mdash; admittedly the numbers unemployed were very high in the year quoted by Deputy Andrews, but <Col N="2372" /> there has been a decline since then &mdash; and to show that the deepening effect has been sharply cut back over the past number of years.  This has been to a large extent the result of the amount of money being devoted by this Government to the building industry.  Almost 70 per cent of the money spent in the construction industry is provided out of capital sums for Government construction.  I am sure you, a Cheann Comhairle, do not want me to go through a long list of what has been done in the past three years, but if I may, I would like to reflect on what we have been doing in that period.</P>

This kind of meeting goes on all the time between the trade union movement, the CIF and those involved in the industry.  These are all cosmetic changes. There is nothing new.  We are not getting to the root cause of the problem.</P>

I intend to set up the board immediately the Finance Bill has been approved so that the board can get on with the business of vetting the various construction and financial proposals which will be applicable to these areas.  I can assure the Deputy that already some very effective proposals are coming before us and, as soon as the Finance Bill is passed, work will be started in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not at any stage tried to say that the construction industry is not in a very difficult situation.  I have been saying that the actions taken by this Government, over the past year or so, particularly since 22 October when the Barretstown package was announced, <Col N="2374" /> and the amounts of money we have made available through the capital programme, show that we are making a very big effort to back up that industry.  On the private side, there has been a large fall off in the construction area.  The amount of money being made available from the public sector is at the highest level possible in these very difficult times, and I have demonstrated that, because of the initiatives we have taken, unemployment is slowing down and one very important agency has said that there will be a turnaround in this industry this year.</P>

      <P>I must make a very strong objection to the fact that I am losing out on my priority time.  The Minister had completed his reply.  How can he square this circle?  He has 36,000 applications for reconstruction grants and only £24 million in the kitty to pay those grants this year.  He said that not all the applications have yet been approved. Assuming only 24,000 of the 36,000 applications are approved and taking the average grant to be about £1,000, that would amount to £24 million.  How can the Minister say there is enough money in the kitty this year when we are now only at 12 February?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither the Deputy nor I can make an accurate estimation of the value of each application on hand. The value of the grant is determined by the inspector on the ground.  The number of inspections carried out to date is 12,500 and the number of approvals is approximately 5,000.  The Deputy should adjust his attitude to the amount of money he thinks should be made available.  Many applicants apply for more grants than they are entitled to.  Some applicants may be debarred if they have received a grant in the past seven years or less.  This can only be determined by checking the <Col N="2378" /> records.  Notwithstanding what I have already said, it is much too early even to hazard a rough estimate of the value of applications on hand, given that we are not yet in a position to establish the relationship between applications, approvals and payments.  This can be attempted only when the scheme is in operation for some time.  This question is undoubtedly premature.  The Deputy might care to table it again in a few months.</P>

      <P>Based on the fact that 5,000 grants have been approved out of a total of 12,500 inspections, it appears that about 18,000 applications will be approved, roughly 50 per cent.  The grants vary from £800 to £4,000.  I was taking a very conservative figure of £1,000.  The value of the applications to date will be about £18 million.  The annual figure in the Estimate is only £24 million. How can the Minister justify putting in such a derisory figure when he is claiming this grant scheme to be such a success? Does it mean that grants will not be paid?</P>

One Deputy from over there has opened an office in his constituency. A total of 120,000 applications forms have been sent out.  The country has been saturated with them by Deputies and other people have applied directly. Returns have been coming in since before Christmas and we have probably received the bulk of applications for the whole year.  The provision of £24 million is a realistic estimate.  As the year progresses we will see which of us is right.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The provision in the Principal Act was that the export charges laid down in that Act will in future be fixed by regulations made by the Minister after consultation with the trustees.  The charges which were in operation when charges ceased to be collected are, of course, insignificant in present day ratings.  Is there a likelihood of those charges being re-introduced?  If so, will the amounts be determined by the trustees with the approval of the Minister for Agriculture?  Does the Minister envisage any instance in the future when these charges will be reintroduced?  I understand that they were there solely in the event of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease; but, with our entry into the EC and the changing of the regulations there where we have not this disease free status as laid down by the EC, how relevant will the charge as outlined in section 4 of this Bill be with regard to the <Col N="2446" /> scale of charges?  I will come back again on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The collection of the export levies has been suspended since 1973.  Since then the amount of money in the compensation fund has exceeded the £40,000, which was the level considered in the Act as being sufficient to meet any charges which might be expected to be paid out of the fund.  Payments from the fund when last made in 1963 were very small.  The scale of charges which would be applicable if the levies were reintroduced are those fixed in the 1928 Act &mdash; that would be 2½d for cattle and 1d and ½d respectively for pigs and sheep.  This section merely amends the 1928 Act by providing for the fixing at a realistic level of any new charges by ministerial order.</P>
      <P>I would like to add that it is most unlikely that levies will be introduced in the near future.  As mentioned, the compensation fund exceeded £40,000 in 1973 and this sum has been earning interest over the years.  The balance in the fund at present is in excess of £132,000.  The livestock trade are satisfied that even after the purchase of the office premises, which they will be able to do under the Bill, there will be more than enough money in the fund to meet any unforeseeable payment.  Deputies will be aware of the steady decline in the level of live cattle exports to Britain in recent years.  The last outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Britain was in 1981 in the Isle of Wight and before that the last major outbreak occurred in 1968.  While one can never be dogmatic about disease outbreaks, it is reasonable to assume that with the present veterinary certification disease tests and import controls the likelihood of another foot and mouth disease outbreak in Britain is rather remote.  The compensation fund, therefore, is more of an insurance safety net which can be used in the unlikely event of a disease outbreak causing losses for the Irish cattle exporter.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Minister is right.  Nobody can be <Col N="2447" /> dogmatic about the likelihood of an outbreak. I know that it pertains only to live cattle, but in the event of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Britain the compensation fund at the moment, at something in excess of £100,000, surely is inadequate to meet any emergency that may arise.  Therefore, is it envisaged then that, in the event of the fund being inadequate to meet the demand in the event of an outbreak, the charges will be increased subsequently and that the people who suffer will be recouped subsequently, or is any regulation made for that?</P>

      <P>To go back on a point the Deputy made, the amount of the fees will be determined by the Minister after consultation with the trustees.  On the other point mentioned by the Deputy, our Department have been in contact with the trustees on this.  The number of live cattle on the way to the UK at any one time is relatively small.  If there were an outbreak we would there and then stop all exports.  We anticipated that the Deputy would probably make that point. We are happy with the situation.</P>

    <P>Does it not occur to the Minister that the Minister for the Public Service appears to have undue powers which do not really concern him?  His powers seem to override those of the Minister for Agriculture who, in the final analysis, should be the best judge of the situation at any time.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) states: &ldquo;Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, the Trustees shall not assign, surrender or otherwise dispose of their interest in any premises acquired or taken on lease by them without the prior approval of the Minister.&rdquo;  The Minister would have a say not only in the winding up of the trustees but also in the disposing of their assets.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The original Act did not make provision for the winding up of the trustees or for the termination of the employment of the secretary to the trustees. All this section does is to empower the trustees to wind up their affairs, either on foot of a direction given by the Minister or, indeed, a decision taken by them with the concurrence of the national executive of the livestock trade.  We have included in this section a mechanism by which the trustees may terminate the employment of their secretary &mdash; obviously if they were going out of business &mdash; on terms agreed between themselves and their secretary with the concurrence of the Minister for the Public Service or, failing such agreement, on terms determined by the Minister for the Public Service.</P>

    <P>This will ensure that, if the secretary is not satisfied with the terms offered by the trustees, he or she can refer the matter to the Minister for the Public Service who will then determine the appropriate terms.  It is well to remember that the Slaughtered and Detained Animals Fund was set up at the request of the livestock trade.  It is wholly financed by the trade. <Col N="2450" /> It is only reasonable to make provision for the winding up of the fund and the ending of the employment of the secretary whenever the trade decide that they no longer require the system.

      <P>This is a lengthy section and looks difficult, but there is really not much in it.  Where a direction is given or a decision taken to wind up the affairs of the trustees, paragraphs (i) and (ii) require the trustees to prepare a final account for the period of their existence <Col N="2451" /> beginning on the first day of the financial year in which such direction was given or decision taken and ending on a date after the expiration of the period laid down for the receipt of claims for compensation against the trustees.  Paragraph (iii) lays down a time limit of six months for the making of claims for compensation.  Paragraph (iv) requires the trustees to publish a notice specifying the final period during which claims for compensation will be entertained.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (v) (11) provides for the repeal of those sections of the 1928 and 1932 Acts concerned with the appointment of trustees, scales of charges, methods of payment of charges and the making of rules by the trustees.  Paragraph (v) (1) provides for the repeal of section 4 (2) of this Bill which is concerned with the fixing of the scale of charges by Ministerial order.  Subsection (2) requires the secretary to the trustees to submit to the Minister a copy of the final account together with a copy of the auditor's report thereon.  Subsection (3) requires that the final audited account be made available on request to persons engaged in the livestock trade.  This provision merely provides for the technical steps to be taken for the winding up of the affairs of the trustees.  The trustees must prepare final accounts and deal with outstanding claims.  Certain provisions of the Acts will be repealed and the final accounts will be made available to the Minister and the livestock trade on request.</P>

      <P>Under this section the national executive of the Irish Livestock Trade are required to give advice, if so requested, as to how any moneys remaining in the fund on winding up should be disposed of.  However, the prerogative will rest with the Minister whether to seek such advice or, if sought, whether to accept such advice; and in either case the trustees are required to comply with the Minister's direction in the matter of disposal of residual money.  This provision is to cover a situation where funds may remain in the compensation fund after it has been wound up and after the trustees have discharged all outstanding liabilities.  It may of course happen that there will be no residual moneys remaining. In that case no problem arises.  However, if some funds remain the national executive of the Irish Live Stock Trade can advise the Minister as to what should be done with these funds.  If no advice is sought, or if he does not accept that advice, the Minister can determine what should happen to the money.</P>

      <P>On 11 December when we last discussed this Bill, I was making the point forcibly about the genuine fears among the manufacturing, industrial and commercial sectors regarding the section to which the amendment relates.  I was supported in my view by Deputy O'Kennedy. On that occasion I made a few straightforward points which were not accepted by the Minister.  I said that the whole processing industry, especially in the co-op area, as well as many other types of industry, would be under severe pressure if the Bill were to go through as introduced.  I said then, as I had said in July, that I could not understand the attitude of the Minister to the Bill and to the effects it would have on our whole industrial base.  He seemed then to disregard the points made.  It was difficult to understand the advice he had been given in relation to the damage that I believed genuinely would be caused if the Bill were to be enacted as it was then.  We shall not talk for the moment about the imposition of rates on the industrial and commercial sector, the only sector paying rates.  I could not understand the introduction, by a backdoor method, of a huge imposition of further rates on this sector which is the productive base of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last July the Minister would not accept that there was a fundamental change being effected by way of the Valuation Bill.  He told us that the Bill would not have the effect we were claiming it would have.  He told us we were being alarmist and opportunist.  However, from what has transpired in the meantime it appears that we did impress the Minister and made him aware of the very serious view that was being expressed in the industrial and commercial sector about the damaging effects the Bill would have.  I am glad <Col N="2456" /> that finally the Minister has accepted our point of view in the form of the two amendments he is putting before us today.  Those amendments by and large meet the points we were making on those earlier occasions.  We were told then by the Minister that our whole industrial base was expanding and not contracting as claimed by us.  So far as the Minister was concerned everything we were saying was inaccurate.</P>
    <P>Only yesterday, in reply to a question I tabled to the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism the following stark facts were revealed: in 1983 there were 369 factory closures, the corresponding number in 1984 was 372, and in 1985, 410.  The Minister told me that those figures came from the IDA but that no official statistics are available.  I asked him also about the total number of liquidations and receiverships that were notified to the Registrar of Companies during those three years.  The figures in respect of liquidations were 522 in 1983, 584 in 1984 and 632 in 1985.  The figures in respect of receiverships were, 136 in 1983, 584 in 1984 and 632 in 1985.  The figures in respect of receiverships were, 136 in 1983, 112 in 1984 and 165 in 1985. These figures do not include factories that were not grant aided by the IDA so we do not have figures for the many small independent factories that have gone to the wall.  We only hear about the large concerns.  However, the stark fact is that in the three years in question there were 1,151 closures that we know of, there were 1,738 liquidations and 413 receiverships. Is that not a damning indictment of the financial policies being pursued by the Government and of the Minister in what he tried to misrepresent here both in July and in December last when he said that our industrial base was expanding? Clearly that was not the case.</P>
    <P>However, I am glad commonsense has prevailed and that the Minister has acceded to our request to introduce sensible and pragmatic amendments on Committee Stage.  We welcome the concession on the part of the Minister to this side of the House in that respect.  We recognise that there may have been a <Col N="2457" /> little more time required than was envisaged at the beginning by the Minister in realising the difficulties that would have arisen in the event of his proceeding with the legislation as introduced.  We shall never know why the Minister was not prepared on these earlier occasions to accept the points we were making, but we are grateful for his conversion on the road to Damascus and for taking steps that will mean there will not be an acceleration of the fears we expressed in relation to another contractor of our industrial and commercial base which is the only base producing the wealth that sustains our economy and employment.</P>
    <P>On both those other occasions we reminded the Minister that if he were prepared to concede on the points we were making, the Bill could be finalised in a matter of hours.  We are grateful to him for having acceded to our request.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the belated but very welcome acceptance of our position as incorporated in the ministerial amendments which are in almost precisely the same terms as those we put before the House on the last occasion. In relation to accepting amendments a Minister is always at risk of being criticised one way or the other but I should like to put the record straight.  We on this side of the House battled at length in July 1985 to have included a more precise definition of plant and of the limitation of the extent of the valuation base, to have these so clearly defined as to exclude certain processes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who were in the House then and those who were in the Gallery would have been clearly conscious of our arguing at great length that if the Minister acknowledged that, for instance, plant which is moved electrically as well as mechanically should be excluded from the valuation base, we would have been happy. But no such reassurance was forthcoming. When we returned to the subject in December last, the Minister's intention was signalled to us beforehand.  I am convinced that was a genuine and honest attempt to give effect to the suggestions <Col N="2458" /> we had made, but when we indicated to him that the amendments in his name would not have that effect we had to prolong the debate as Deputy Reynolds has indicated.  That prolongation has been worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The Chair has announced that a series of amendments are to be taken together, among them amendment No. 8 in my name.  In the amendment we try to exclude constructions which induce or impact upon a manufacturing process or actively participate in the manufacture of a product.  I proposed that at length in December, having given advance notice in July but on that occasion the Minister could not see fit to accept our case.  I am glad the Minister has now seen fit to acknowledge our case, as will be seen from amendment No. 7:</P>
    <P>In page 4, in the matter contained between lines 15 and 16, after &ldquo;current&rdquo; in column (2) to insert the following:</P>
    <P>including any such construction which are designed or used primarily for storage or containment (whether or not the purpose of such containment is to allow a natural or chemical process to take place), but excluding any such constructions which are designed or used primarily to induce a process of change in the substance contained or transmitted.</P>
    <P>That is the Minister's amendment and I am glad to see that he is now prepared to accept our amendment, which is only slightly different from his.  I welcome the fact that the prolonged debate in December proved to be worthwhile.  The Minister made the case that the practice has been to exclude these matters.  All we were concerned about was the terms of the legislation, not the practice.  Now we are happy.</P>
    <P>An Opposition can do much, and I hope we will have the same degree of success with the Finance Bill when it comes before us soon.  I hope the Minister will then listen, as he has done in this case, to the proposals we will make.  I welcome the fact that the processes which <Col N="2459" /> were outside the traditional base of valuation will now be outside the base with statutory guarantee.  This is a matter of great reassurance to the whole industrial sector, particularly the indigenous domestic industries which have been under very serious pressure in the past three years.  An extension of the valuation base when the rate of impact is already considerable would have been disastrous.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to prolong the debate, but I should point out to Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Reynolds that the pat they are giving themselves on the back should not be too hearty.  From the beginning it was perfectly clear from the Bill what the intention was.  I pointed out on a previous occasion that a detailed examination of six industrial plants, chosen by a major industrial interest group, demonstrated on the ground that the Bill would do what I said it would when I introduced it in the House.  That has not been altered in any way by the amendments which the Deputies are prepared to accept and which have been rendered in a more parliamentary and elegant formulation.  We could have decided this last July.  In December the Deputies seemed to have some difficulty in accepting the objective demonstration of the effects of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Because we are now making progress, I will issue an invitation to Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Reynolds to join me in the Members' Bar for a drink after our discussion here, during the course of which I will expand a little on the reasons why I was not going to prolong this debate.</P>

      <P>It is a pity to interrupt this cosy mutual exchange of pleasantries being passed from one side to the other. This amendment appears designed to be a further assistance to manufacturing companies in Ireland and to assist them and relieve them of the burden of paying what might be an appropriate rate to the local authorities from whom they draw <Col N="2460" /> their services, assistance and so on.  I would have thought that the manufacturing institutions were already well mollycoddled and catered for as a privileged body from the tax point of view.  It seems to me that if they paid their rates they would have a credit against income tax they might be liable for, if they are paying any income tax.  Those manufacturing companies come in here and use the facilities and grants awarded to them and it might be better if they paid reasonable rate contributions to the local authorities and retained some of their profits in the country as a small recompense for all the facilities given to them from the Central Fund and from local funds, rather than contributing to the black hole by repatriating their profits.</P>

I do not know what sort of economy the Deputy thinks we are living in when he tries to make a case like the one put forward.  In relation to the profits the Deputy thinks are supposed to be made in this country I would ask the Deputy to go back and look at the facts, the fact that there is a 1 per cent gross return on sales in native manufacturing Irish industry.</P>

If the Deputy has the answer to that, we will be glad to hear it, but the Deputy should not come in with nonsensical statements representing an ideology that is being found to be wanting in every part of the world.  If that is the sort of ideology the Deputy believes the Irish people want, he should test it in an election. The recent opinion polls should have given the Deputy his answer.</P>

Deputy Taylor continues to make a case on the basis that this particular exclusion, which is essential, is a good reason for arguing about whether manufacturing industry generally pay their proper share in rates.  That is outside the scope of these amendments.  If you want to have a full argument as to where the source of revenue for local authorities comes from, tell us we can do so and we will launch into it.</P>

Could the Minister explain the logical position &mdash; if indeed there is one &mdash; under which if one takes the position that the manufacturing industry is to be further mollycoddled and privileged above any other service industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should the manufacturing industry be in a privileged position over any other service industry which also creates and provides employment?  They already have an advantage in regard to income tax and are now apparently to be helped further.  What is the basis for picking out this industry?  Why not go the whole hog?  When the goods are manufactured and stored in containers, they are subject to rates but the machine which produces them is not.  Could the Minister explain the logic of this artificial, nice distinction?  The proper course would be to pay rates in the normal way to the local authorities.  Storage capacity is just as important as machinery.  After all, if they did not have storage space they could not manufacture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The intent of the Bill, contrary to what Deputy Taylor seems to have concluded, is to put beyond doubt the valuation base we have had up to now and to protect it.  Without straying too far from the terms of the discussion, I am sure Deputy O'Keeffe is perfectly aware of some of the dangers in this regard for one particular local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 7, which I think is the one Deputy Taylor is more concerned about, does not provide for any new exclusions from the valuation base.  This amendment makes even clearer &mdash; although I have my own feelings as to the necessity for that clarification &mdash; the distinction that has always existed in our valuation <Col N="2470" /> base between plant on the one hand, as further defined in this Bill, and machinery on the other.  The base of our system up to now has always been that plant, as defined for the purposes of the Valuation Acts, is that part which attracts a liability to rates.  Machinery does not attract a liability to rates.  This Bill is intended to put a number of matters beyond doubt to avoid a situation which has arisen on a number of occasions in the past where interpretations have been given to the term &ldquo;plant&rdquo; which have brought within the scope of an exclusion items which were originally intended to be part of the valuation base.  The effect of this Bill is to preserve the valuation base, not reduce it.  That is essentially the point which I think Deputy Taylor was worried about.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into the judgment of a reasonable contribution because that is not my concern at the moment.  My concern is to put beyond doubt the base upon which the contribution, whether it is regarded as reasonable, unreasonable, excessive or exiguous, can be based so that we are not in any doubt as to where we start from when we define the base upon which the contribution is made.</P>
    <P>With respect to the question Deputy O'Keeffe asked, again I point out that in the Bill and in my amendments we have provided beyond any shadow of a doubt the basis for the distinctions that are made between plant and machinery.  A pipe attached to a piece of plant is valued with the plant; a pipe attached to a piece of machinery, which is a part of a piece of machinery or which links one piece of machinery to another, is machinery and therefore is not subject to rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may not be able to answer this question offhand, but would it be possible to give an estimate of what the loss of revenue to the local authorities would be arising from the exclusion in his amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Deputy immediately what the loss of revenue to local authorities will be from that exclusion &mdash; it will be nil because what I am doing is putting beyond doubt the distinction <Col N="2471" /> which has always been operated between plant which is rateable and machinery which is not.</P>

      <P>In page 3, lines 1 to 4, to delete subsection (2).</P>
      <P>Section 3 reads:</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister may by order amend the Schedule to the Act of 1852 (inserted by this Act), and may by such an order add to that Schedule a category of fixed property specified in the order, or vary the description of any such category.</P>

    <P>(3)  The Minister may by order <Col N="2472" /> amend or revoke an order under this section.</P>
    <P>Since the amendments which have been accepted clear the ground to a very considerable extent, I am not as concerned about this amendment as I was.  There is another reason for our stand.  The Minister will recall that on the last occasion I asked why there should be such a provision which would mean that the Minister could come here and make an order which would extend the category of, say, rateable properties.  I made that point because of the position as it was then.  I recognise that that particular subsection cannot be interpreted as if there was absolute freedom for any Minister to add categories which are not there.  The only basis on which any additions can be made will be within the base of the rateable hereditaments as defined in the Acts.  On the basis that the base of the hereditaments so rateable is clarified to our satisfaction, I am not pressing this amendment because I do not believe the legislation would suffer by the inclusion of the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MyraBarry" hpid="Miss M. Barry Miss M. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the function of a backbencher automatically and without question to row in behind the Government on the budget.  However, much that is in the budget is encouraging, particularly the relief for PAYE workers and the selective VAT cuts.  It was a fair achievement to reduce PAYE taxation without having an inflationary effect or <Col N="2477" /> having an effect on normal family income.  One had to look to another source for revenue and the Government looked to the financial and corporate sectors which was a move in the right direction.</P>
      <P>The selective VAT cuts on hairdressing, laundry, meals, cleaning services, repairs to electrical goods and on the price of admission to cinemas and fun fairs were welcome because they are all in highly labour intensive areas.  The Minister could extend the selective VAT cuts to other labour intensive areas.  We realise that in future we will have to look to the services area as well as to the manufacturing area for the provision of jobs.</P>
      <P>Many people were disappointed with the social welfare cuts, where long term benefits were increased by 5 per cent and short term benefits were increased by 4 per cent.  We have all become used to 20 per cent rises in order to keep increases on a par with the inflation rate.  It is good that social welfare payments should increase on a par with the level of inflation. The fact that we cannot give a greater increase is part of the overall attitude in the budget that we must all carry the can.  The fact that every sector was giving out about the budget was a good thing; if only one sector were complaining it would imply that other sectors had done well.  In that sense the budget was fair and just.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to a few policy trends.  I would not be honest if I did not question some of these matters. I will ask specific questions on specific policy matters.  Regarding the whole area of taxation, I should like to ask the Minister where the Government stand in relation to the reports of the Commission on Taxation.  Have the Department of Finance done a further analysis on these reports?  Does the Minister know what the flat rate of taxation would be as envisaged by the commission?  However welcome an adjustment of allowance or tax bands may be, it is no substitute for long term structural reform.  I have made this point before and will do so again.  Every honest person in this House will realise <Col N="2478" /> that with a borrowing figure of over £20 billion, there is not room to have a major cut in PAYE taxation, but the Government should state their long term policy objectives so that the PAYE sector could look with hope to the future when there would be a much greater easing of the tax burden.</P>
    <P>We must take a serious look at the whole area of public expenditure if it is to be reduced as a proportion of GNP. Each year every Department sets out a certain figure and seeks to gain an increase of 4 per cent or 5 per cent.  We never question the original figure.  Each Department should be made accountable for every item of expenditure.  It should not be agreed automatically that there will be a percentage increase in a certain amount of money.  We need more accountability in each Department for every item.  Then and only then will we get effective cutbacks in public expenditure. A cut in public expenditure must be very well planned.  One would have to go through the whole budget and consider every item of expenditure.  The onus of proof should rest with every Department for every item of expenditure.</P>
    <P>Will the business expansion scheme be expanded beyond 1986-87?  If so, for how long?  I suggest that the scheme is not long enough in operation to judge its economic effects and I urge that it be continued for the next four or five years so that venture capital companies and investors could be allowed to plan in the medium term.  This would result in increased employment.</P>
    <P>I would add a word of caution regarding the taxation of savings.  As a result of this budget all interest will be taxed at the rate of 35 per cent.  My fears are for the aged, the widowed and people with redundancy payments.  These people will not be enabled to save.  Let us take the case of an old age pensioner in receipt of a contributory pension and getting, perhaps, another £100 a month from the local creamery or the Department of Forestry or some other source.  Not only will such people have to pay tax, but they will also have to pay PRSI as well, although the latter contribution could have no further <Col N="2479" /> relevance for them.  They will also be above the eligibility limit for a medical card and all the other perquisites.  The people who try to save will be hit again in an unfair and unjust way.  The same will apply to widows.</P>
    <P>In the matter of redundancy payments, a person is allowed to have £10,000 before paying tax.  The British equivalent is £25,000.  The lump sum is taxed and a person is all right for the first year while receiving unemployment benefit and payrelated benefit.  After the first year, however, when a person applies for unemployment assistance he or she is assessed on means and income.  The people who saved their lump sum are assessed on it for the second time.  Those who gambled the money or spent it on drink will have no problem in satisfying the social welfare officer that they have no money in the bank and they will be entitled to full unemployment assistance.  Now the people with the redundancy money are being hit a third time because they will be paying tax on the interest gained on the redundancy sum.  It is most unfair.</P>
    <P>I often wonder if the old stamp system was better.  Under the existing system once a person has made a year's contributions he or she is entitled to the maximum benefit in every area.  On the other hand, a person who had contributed for 20 years but had made no contributions in the previous year would be entitled to nothing whatever.  Some people are taking advantage of the system by working for a year; when the benefits run out they go back to work for another year until they have made enough contributions to take advantage of the system again.  People who are not taking advantage of the system cannot benefit other than by unemployment assistance if they do not have sufficient contributions.  Often these people have big families and they are not able to cope.</P>
    <P>According to an article in today's edition of the <i>Irish Independent</i> there is to be a welcome change and savings certificates are to be tax free.  The article states:</P>
    <P>Three Government sponsored <Col N="2480" /> savings schemes are to be exempt from the new retention tax announced by Finance Minister Alan Dukes in the Budget.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dukes revealed last night that Savings Certificates, Savings Bonds and the National Savings Scheme will not be liable for the new tax measure.</P>
    <P>The move is seen as bringing the Government backed schemes to a more competitive level with those offered by financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The retention tax will also not apply to interest on savings with credit unions, or interest paid on Government securities.</P>
    <P>The significance of Mr. Duke's clarification of the new tax laws will be examined by financial institutions today.</P>
    <P>In a statement Mr. Dukes said he was revealing some of the details of the retention tax in reply to comments made about the effect of the tax on small savers.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All savers, including investors not currently liable to tax, therefore have available to them a significant range of options to which the retention tax will not apply.&rdquo; he said.</P>
    <P>While this is a very welcome change, I see one problem.  Government-sponsored saving schemes are not competing on the open market.  I am totally in favour of savings and against taxation on them, but this will create unfair competition in the market-place.</P>
    <P>We face the huge problem that 17 per cent of our workforce are unemployed.  I listened to the Leader of the Opposition speak on this matter last week.  In anger and frustration I got up and left.  While he made the very valid point that the Government were wrong in their projections for unemployment in the national plan, he went from calling us all liars to crying from the bottom of his heart about emigration.  It is about time that we were all honest about unemployment.  It is too big a problem to be bandied about.  There are 240,000 people unemployed.  Where are they to get jobs?  No man in the world has found a solution.  With increased <Col N="2481" /> mechanisation and automation, with our structure of population, with such a large young population, we cannot find productive jobs for all our people.  Our growth rate is far too small, about 2 per cent if we are lucky.  It is time we all stood up and said that we cannot see in the immediate future or, indeed, in the future, where these 240,000 jobs are to come from, and then asked what we are going to do about it.</P>
    <P>Many young people have emigrated over the past few years.  Many went from my town to Germany, or the US, or wherever and came back.  Their experience was beneficial and when they came back their employability had improved and they could find jobs.  I heard Charlie Haughey saying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MyraBarry" hpid="Miss M. Barry Miss M. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the Government have failed psychologically, economically and morally.  He is going back 50 years, waving the green flag again, saying that if anybody emigrates from here the Government have failed.  People should have a choice to emigrate if they so wish.  Many people emigrate for experience or for financial reasons and they are happy to do so.  If people want to emigrate when we have not the jobs to offer them, why should we stop them, particularly if they want to emigrate in the short term?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One problem is that many young people are emigrating and staying in countries illegally.  Once they get inside the US they feel they cannot come out because if they come out they may never get back in.  We have a problem with green cards and visas.  With our friendly, hospitable and good connections with the Americans at present, we should be able to tell them that we have a huge problem here with our young people unemployed and unable to get work experience.  We should ask the US to raise the quota of permits to go from Ireland to America for a few short years, even five years, after which each and every permit <Col N="2482" /> holder would have to return.  We need not be ashamed to do that.</P>
    <P>We are not forcing people out of this country, but we should not put a barrier in their way if they can get jobs and good experience and it is worth while for them economically and in other ways to go.  I resent this emphasis on emigration and bringing back connotations of the Famine.  We are gone from the Famine and the sooner we realise that the better.</P>
    <P>However, employment creation has been the greatest area of failure on the part of the Government.  We have far too many agencies and the number could be cut back by at least half.  I share the feeling that the Government are not giving enough attention and effort to the area of employment.  While a reduction in PAYE taxation, selective VAT cuts etc. will help, they will put only a very small dent in a huge problem.  I heard Deputy McCreevy suggest in this House yesterday that the answer is in small business and small industry.  Of course, that will help but it will not make a big hole in the figure of 240,000.  If we are serious about small business and small industry and about encouraging the entrepreneur, then we should make some concrete provision for that.  We have not done so. Charlie McCreevy gave the example&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

      <P>Deputy McCreevy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MyraBarry" hpid="Miss M. Barry Miss M. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy gave the example of a person who starts up his own business and takes all the risks and ends up bankrupt.  The alternative is to set up a limited company to ensure that you will not find yourself in a situation where your debts will not be paid etc.  However, if one person sets up a small limited company he has to pay PAYE tax and corporation tax at 40 per cent.  This is double taxation on someone who could have been on the dole.  Instead of making a profit which would give him an opportunity to expand and employ other people, he is penalised so much with taxation that it is all he can do to keep himself going.  In this area more <Col N="2483" /> jobs could be created.  People will have to sit down and thresh this matter out.</P>
      <P>Three or four years ago here in the Dáil suggestions were made by many people, including me, about being honest and facing up to the problem of unemployment. We said we had not enough work for all the people so we should decide on how to divide it.  Suggestions were made of job sharing and job splitting.  As far as I am aware, Aer Lingus started off with a few in the job sharing scheme.  The Department of Social Welfare started such a scheme also and I would like the Minister for Social Welfare to give us an up-to-date report on job sharing in his Department.  How many people are availing of the scheme there?  I think the numbers are very small.  We could be doing much more in this area.</P>
      <P>I am fascinated by revenue inspectors. Small business people with one or two employees can have two revenue inspectors coming out to look at one book. Travelling expenses etc. must be paid to the inspectors for the day.  On the other hand, we have not many inspectors to deal with Social Welfare frauds.  If we are serious about public expenditure and cutbacks we need to look at this area, particularly in the cities where people are drawing unemployment benefit, deserted wife's benefit or whatever in two, three, four or five centres.  Nobody seems to be doing anything about that.  Does anybody intend to do anything in this regard?  The public service is big enough to deploy people in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite all the talk of doom and gloom which everybody hears all around, sometimes I wonder.  My area has seen a good deal of public and local expenditure over the past two years.  A sewerage scheme in Fermoy is costing £3.3 million and it is in progress for completion in 1986.  We have looked for this sewerage scheme for 20 years and it came to fruition only under this Government.  A water scheme is in progress in Mitchelstown costing in the region of £1 million.  St. Patrick's Hospital, Fermoy, is being refurbished and reconstructured, including the provision <Col N="2484" /> of a lift.  National schools have been built in Bartlemy, Ballygiblin and Ballyclough. A new vocational school costing £1 million is about to start in Fermoy and the Patrician Academy in Mallow are undertaking major reconstruction work costing another £1 million.</P>
    <P>This Government have a record second to none in the area of housing.  Since we took office three years ago we have not cut back in any way on the provision of corporation or county council housing. We have 40 new houses in Mitchelstown, 40 houses in Fermoy and houses in Bartlemy, Ballynoe, Conna, Glenville, Killavullan etc.  We increased the £1,000 grant to £2,000 and we have a £3,000 mortgage subsidy.  We introduced a new £5,000 grant for people prepared to transfer from a county council house to a house of their own.  We introduced the Housing Finance Agency.  Our best record probably is in this area.</P>
    <P>Particularly over the last few months, people in the Cork area have been very impressed with the provision of precancer and cancer treating equipment in the Regional Hospital, Cork.  Many who have suffered from the early stages of cancer have been successfully treated there.  However, it is obvious that new equipment is needed if this work is to continue.  My understanding is that the Minister for Health is not forthcoming on this.  I appeal to him on Ash Wednesday, no smoking day, to provide the necessary equipment which would create a sense of stability and a confidence that we in Cork can look after ourselves and not always have to be dependent on Dublin.  If the new equipment is not provided, we are back to square one and all the patients of the Cork area will have to be treated in Dublin, with the ensuing problems of transport and shortage of accommodation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I would like to say something about the general nature of this budget and the way in which the Minister for Finance aproached his task. The Government are suffering from a severe case of economic paralysis.  This, the fourth budget in succession produced <Col N="2485" /> by the Coalition Government, is almost totally devoid of any development strategy. One of the first requirements of a budget is that it set out for the people proposals for economic and social development for the year ahead.  That has been wiped out of this budget altogether.  We have now a one-sided tinkering with the finances without looking to see where the country is going and what the economic development strategy should be.  It is not as if it were this Government's and this Minister for Finance's first budget.  The people are finally beginning to see what we predicted at the beginning of the reign of this Coalition, that there was no intention of having any development strategy within the budgets of that Coalition over the years and the fourth budget shows this very clearly.  It is also very clear that we have got the worst of both worlds.  The Government have failed quite patently to curb the national debt and the budget deficit.  They cannot now say anything further about these figures.  They are stark and realistic and represent a total failure on their part.</P>
      <P>The Government based much of their pre-election propaganda on the magic wand that they could wave and that if people accepted the harsh measures they would bring in this would lead to a reduction in the national debt and that as a result everything would be well and they could then get back to considerations of employment, better welfare benefits and so on.  The fact is that they have clearly failed in relation to the national debt.  It has risen from £12.5 billion to £20.4 billion &mdash; a difference of £7.6 billion in just over three years, or a 60 per cent rise. That is the reality of the position of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had the lectures, hardships, hairshirts and depression traditionally associated with Coalitions.  We have had the worst from that point of view but not of the best, even accepting all that hardship.  We in the Opposition were prepared to go along with the Government in accepting that times were difficult.  The trade unions also accepted this and moderated their demands.  They said that if the Government thought that keeping <Col N="2486" /> pay demands down and accepting moderate, very small increases in pay demands and social welfare would help, they would agree to this and not disrupt the economy by having strikes.  By and large, that is what the trade unions have done.  Having accepted all that hardship in good faith, we are worse off at the end of the period. Our national debt has gone up, as I say, by 60 per cent which is an even greater restriction on the Government and the Minister in their activities now.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, we have experienced the concomitants of this policy anticipated by us, which were unemployment and emigration.  I am sorry for Deputy Barry that we have to mention and remention emigration because that has become a major part of our life.  Even Deputy Barry indicated that it was a problem and that the reality could be found every day in the community.  Families have been devastated by these four budgets but, above all, our youth have been neglected in a cynical way.  Apart from a few palliatives such as short term courses and short term work, they have cast our youth aside.  We hear echoing from the Government side that nothing can be done about emigration and unemployment. I know that the Coalition cannot do anything about these two problems, but this side of the House can and will if given the opportunity.  Hopelessness is endemic in this budget.  Therefore, the Minister for Finance makes no provision for development in the proposals which he has put before us.</P>
    <P>The Coalition are now trying to extract blood from a stone and are finding it impossible.  With all the acceptance of low standards of living and hardship, the people cannot accept the position any more.  It is quite clear that the Coalition have no ideas.  They are unable to tackle the problems of the country today and should face that reality.  In each of the last three budgets tax revenue has shown a shortfall.  In 1985 it was short by £123 million, in 1984, £40 million and in 1983, £49 million.  What let the Minister down each time?  The tax revenue was not there.  Blood would not come from the stone.  The ordinary people have no more <Col N="2487" /> to yield.  They need leadership, strategy, investment in development.  They need, above all, a new sense of confidence. How can we expect 1986 to be any different? It is incredible for the Minister to suggest that having had shortfalls in tax revenue in the last three budgets he will not have a shortfall in the present one.  It is even more likely that there will be a greater shortfall this time.  That stone has been drained completely.  The Government are trying to squeeze taxes out of the economy faster than the economy is growing and that is not possible.  Indeed, in the meantime the public capital programme has shrunk from 15½ per cent of GNP in 1982 to 10 per cent in 1986. That is a clear indication of the Government's withdrawal of resources from the economy.  Eventually, it will have an effect on the revenue the Government hope to collect from the economy.</P>
    <P>What does this mean?  In simple terms it means that the Government have failed.  That is clear in the figures I have given, in the Minister's statement and in his budget proposals.  The Government have failed the country.  They have only tinkered with our problems in the budget and not tackled the core of our problems. The strategy from the beginning was an abysmal failure.  The Government did not deal with the problems from the outset and did not have any proposals for the future.  Midas may bury his few shillings in the ground and return to look at it every so often but he is protected in the sense that interest is not running up all the time.  The Government have cut back, held down initiative and are not using their talents, as the Bible would have advised them to do, to make something extra.  Clearly, they have failed. They have robbed a little here and given back a little somewhere else.  The budget is full of cosmetic manipulations but lacks a development plan.  The people were prepared for hardship provided the resources were put to some constructive use but that has not happened.</P>
    <P>The budget is similar to those introduced in the last three years by the Coalition. <Col N="2488" /> It lacks any semblance of a development plan.  At one time Ministers for Finance were very proud of their development role.  Economic development was so important at one time that it was decided to establish a separate Department to deal with it.  The development role of Departments of Finance is questioned by some people because the Department is expected to carry out two functions, control spending and at the same time exercise a development role. The development element in the Department of Finance has withered under Deputy Dukes.  He has let that function die.  Now we do not have a development strategy in the Department.  We have lost everything.  The Minister for Finance has become the national liquidator who cynically and without mercy stands over the liquidation of companies. If we had a Minister for Finance who was prepared to take some risk those companies would have been given a chance of survival in these difficult times. However, we have to cope with the cold, merciless approach of the Minister who appears to take pleasure out of such liquidations.</P>
    <P>There is another way to approach these problems and that must be contrasted with what is in the budget.  There is a need for a coherent and balanced economic strategy.  The need has never been greater than today.  However, for the fourth year in succession the Coalition have produced a budget devoid of any semblance of economic development. They are preoccupied with expenditure cuts and reductions in services and this has resulted in a complete lack of investment in new products and market development. The Government have failed to provide any stimulus for enterprising investors or the many young, highly qualified people now being forced to emigrate.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have pointed to the urgent need for investment in our natural resources, the construction industry, agriculture, horticulture, mariculture, tourism and industrial and scientific technologies. Another approach could be adopted at this time but it has been ignored by the <Col N="2489" /> Government.  The construction industry has been crying out for investment.  I was disappointed that the Minister did not reduce the level of VAT on that industry. He must be aware of the tremendous difficulties the high VAT rate caused to that industry in the last 12 months.  The decline in activity in the industry in 1985 &mdash; it is still continuing &mdash; was contributed to in a significant way by the doubling of the VAT rate in last year's budget.  At that time I suggested that it would do damage to that sector particularly in regard to the building of new houses. There was a decline of 15 per cent in the number of new houses built in 1985.</P>
    <P>A reversal of the VAT measure introduced last year would have given a major boost to activity in the construction industry.  We are all aware that that industry is the big provider of employment in the Dublin region, an area where most of the unemployed live.  That industry was also affected by a reduction of £25 million in the public capital expenditure programme.  There have been cuts in sanitary services amounting to £4 million, £3 million in the case of schools, £3 million in respect of house purchase and improvement loans, £3.2 million in the case of the farm modernisation scheme and a cut of £3 million in IDA grants. The impact of those cuts will be extensive throughout the economy and they will further deflate the construction industry which is so important in the creation of employment.  We can afford to invest in that industry because money spent in it amounts to an investment in our future. When we invest in roads and housing we have something to show for it.</P>
    <P>Other ideas have been put to the Minister but he has ignored them.  Those involved in the association that represents small businesses have said that their studies indicate that steps could be taken to create an economic climate that would generate between 60,000 and 70,000 additional jobs in that sector by 1990.  It is not as if the Minister did not have proposals for job creation.  We have suggested the development of marine culture and developments in the area of science and technology.  We have indicated <Col N="2490" /> where new jobs can be created in those areas but the Minister turned a deaf ear to our proposals.  It is interesting to note that there are only 13 indigenous companies in the food, electronics, chemical and pharmaceutical sectors which employ more than three research people. We have 15 such companies in the country as a whole.  We could beneficially employ up to 1,000 extra researchers and technological personnel to develop new products, services and markets.</P>
    <P>During the course of the year in various debates we heard a lot of talk about the highly qualified people we have but we could create 1,000 jobs for such people in the area of science and technology. They should be associated with the universities and put into industries that are almost devoid of development and research work.  If we do not have such research work going on we will not develop our indigenous resources.  There is a tremendous need for this kind of development but, instead of using the resources we have in terms of our people, they are being forced to go to America or elsewhere where their technology will form the basis of economic development in those other places.  The loss is not only on the part of those who must go away. The loss is ours as a country, too.</P>
    <P>Of all our indigenous companies only 15 have three or more researchers.  This indicates how low the level of technology, development and research is within these companies.  Many of our indigenous companies have no researchers.  We are talking about areas in which there is much potential for development.  I suggest that those indigenous companies who have a capacity for science and technology development should be helped by way of the Minister setting up a scheme to appoint 1,000 additional researchers and technological personnel who would help to develop new products, services and markets.  These should be people who are associated with the universities.  Some of our universities are extremely good in undertaking these tasks and they are only waiting to be given support, assistance and encouragement from the Minister for Finance.  If he developed a scheme which <Col N="2491" /> would encourage the companies to take on the researchers and which would encourage the universities to place the personnel with the companies, we would have the linkage that is necessary to develop new products and indigenous scientific and technological products.</P>
    <P>The universities and other third level institutions should be encouraged and assisted financially to become involved in such a development programme while industry should be given the incentive to participate in such a scheme.  It is the function of the Government to stimulate and promote the capacity of industry to innovate.  The NBST have indicated clearly the potential in this area and yet the Minister's proposals are devoid of any development strategy and there is a sinister deafness in relation to the problems our young people are experiencing.  In other words, the Minister has ignored the potential that is available.  If he fails to take up my suggestion, the resources that could be used now in terms of our proposals will not be available within a short few years because these people will be using their ability and expertise in America and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Because the Coalition have no hope, they offer no hope.  Consequently, unemployment, emigration and national indebtedness continue to grow unchecked.  The Government are trapped in a downward spiral of self perpetuating gloom.  Unless this cycle is broken by a new and positively balanced approach the country faces massive unemployment, increased emigration and widespread depression.  In relation to emigration it is clear that, as indicated by the CSO and as suggested by the passenger figures for 1984, there is a new massive loss of people to the country. There is argument as to whether the annual figure is 15,000 or 30,000 but we know that it is very substantial.  Deputy Barry posed the question as to why we should complain if people wish to emigrate. We do not object to people moving around Europe or elsewhere if that is their wish and if they have the opportunity <Col N="2492" /> to do so.  What we are complaining of is the enforced emigration of so many of our people and particularly young people.</P>
    <P>We are one of the best equipped countries in terms of youth and of their ability and their capacity to help to develop this economy.  All that is required is the leadership and the assistance necessary to enable them to put those resources into practice.  We will continue to be angry so long as the Government ignore our people and what they have to contribute.</P>
    <P>The Coalition policies in this, their fourth successive budget, have failed manifestly with the people and particularly the young.  The most positive step the Government could take at this stage is to recognise this failure and to make way for a Fianna Fáil Government who would introduce a balanced programme of national reconstruction.  In the past the people have looked to Fianna Fáil in times of depression and we have never been found wanting on those occasions, because we have always believed in the ability of our people and were prepared to stand by them and to enable them to develop the country that is theirs.  We will do our utmost to prevent emigration.</P>
    <P>So far as the budget is concerned one would be forgiven for thinking that crime was not a major problem.  As I have pointed out, there is no evidence in the budget of a strategy for economic development. If one were studying this budget from an academic viewpoint one would have to say that the Minister for Finance has dropped the concept of social and economic development.  One can think of the different approaches in this area in previous years.  At one stage there was a Minister for Economic Planning and Development, for instance, while in the Lemass era the economic and development role of the Department of Finance was moved into high gear.  That was what the people wanted at the time but this Minister is not moving economic development into high gear.  He has dropped it totally.  At best it is being put into neutral but possibly into reverse so far as the Minister's commitment is concerned.</P>
    <P>The figures relating to indictable crime <Col N="2493" /> show an increase from 62,000 in 1978 to 99,700 in 1984.  That was a decrease of 2½ per cent from the peak figure of 103,000. In the light of the size of this problem one would have expected the budget to have indicated that the major problems are unemployment, taxation and crime. That is the ABC of living in Ireland today.  Let us consider what the Minister has to say in the budget on the matter of crime.  The budget will have no effect in terms of easing the problem.  There are no special provisions to tackle the widespread incidence of crime and vandalism. There are further cutbacks in the provisions for the Garda to the extent of £2.25 million.  Therefore, one may expect that this will result in less Garda overtime and consequently in reduced availability of gardaí on the beat.</P>
    <P>What is the point in Members from the Government side saying that there should be more gardaí on the beat when in practice the Minister is taking them from that role by way of reducing overtime?  We know that already there has been a serious reduction in overtime for the Garda with the result that there are not enough gardaí available for duty at shopping centres, banks or at blocks of flats. We have gone into that matter here repeatedly. The Minister for Justice may say that when the problems arise more gardaí will be made available.</P>
    <P>If that is the case we are only codding ourselves.  The Minister is cutting back the amount in that case and he is cutting back on prisons.  Does anybody think that our prisons will have fewer residents in the coming year than last year, or that the prison officers will be working less overtime?  We lost one prison completely last year: it was wiped out, destroyed. Where is the policy on prisons?  The Minister cannot come back later in the year and tell us it is up to the Minister for Justice to deal with the problem.  This budget takes away resources from the prisons.</P>
    <P>Let us look at some of the other things &mdash; for instance, criminal injury compensation.  The amount for that is to be cut by £1.3 million, or by a third, from April.  The Minister announced this cut <Col N="2494" /> after the budget in the midst of all the budget noise and fuss when a number of Ministers were rushing in to make their case briefly.</P>
    <P>How will the Government reduce this allocation when more people are being mugged, attacked and assaulted and when there is no indication there will be a reduction in the general crime rate? The Minister is removing the pain and suffering clause from the compensation. It was appalling to see the Government doing that when we remember the experience of the victims of rapes and muggings. That reduction is typical of Government thinking.  This is a mean petty Government who are making mean petty cutbacks.</P>
    <P>Women suffering from rape attacks were given compensation under that clause.  What a mean thing to cut it out. The old folk will suffer.  We saw a photograph in a newspaper recently of an elderly lady in the west who died following attacks.  Her face cried out from the newspaper page.  The Minister is taking away compensation for those people.  That is one of the ways the Minister for Finance will make his miserable saving from 1 April.  I was amazed to see that cutback in the midst of such violence and when physical assaults are rampant.  Surely the Minister must realise that the solution is to stop crime and punish the criminals.</P>
    <P>Today we have seen further reductions in the resources to fight crime and criminals. I have just been referring to compensation for the victims of pain and suffering following attacks.  The criminal compensation scheme has been adjudicated on by a tribunal, not by juries. Therefore, the Minister cannot say that juries have been awarding exorbitant rates of compensation.  If he could have said that, he would probably have abolished juries.  Average claims under this scheme have been approximately £4,500, and of course there will have been claims for £300, £400, £500 and £600.  Yet we find the Minister cutting some of that allocation at the expense of people who have been the victims of pain and injury, whose property has been vandalised, the weakest in our community.  From 1 April, <Col N="2495" /> a woman who has been raped will not get anything for her pain and suffering.  Up to now she would have had compensation.  It would not have been much and would not represent a drain on the resources of this great State.</P>
    <P>What has the Minister to say about all this?  I asked him a question and he replied that the scheme is proving very costly for the Exchequer, and following a review the Government have sanctioned changes in the conditions of the scheme &ldquo;which I will announce in detail shortly&rdquo;. The £1.3 million for pain and suffering is to go on 1 April.</P>
    <P>The malicious damages compensation system is being vandalised by the Government. They are about to virtually abolish it, except for damage done in riots and subversive activities.  It will have very little effect in some areas, like Dublin 4, but it will have a major effect on Dublin Central and the people and business communities there.  It is from there that the Minister will save his few shillings.</P>
    <P>The budget is a strategy for crime, not for crime prevention, but the Government display general complacency in relation to it.  There is no dynamic policy to tackle crime.  The Minister for Finance has made selective reductions in VAT in certain services.  The reduction has been from 25 per cent to 10 per cent in cases like contract cleaners.  The strategy in this was aimed at bringing down the black economy operators.  But the security industry is labour intensive: employment in it is estimated to be 3,000 in the recognised companies and about 2,000 in unregistered firms.  Those employed include people with double jobs and people who are working and on the dole.  The Minister had an opportunity in the budget to assist such an industry.  Surely the security industry is an industry that should come to mind when thinking about selective reductions in VAT in certain circumstances. By reducing VAT here the Minister would bring more jobs onto the market and bring some jobs in the black economy out into the open and increase the contributions to PAYE and PRSI which registered companies are making. <Col N="2496" /> By applying this reduction from 25 per cent to 10 per cent one could bring 1,000 new jobs onto the market.</P>
    <P>Already alarm installations are rated at 10 per cent, but the security services provided by people do not have the 10 per cent rating.  The Minister should look at that in relation to changes he is making in that area.  Lower VAT would result in more people using security on their premises.  When one thinks about removing the malicious damages claims system one will need to provide more security and insurance.  All of that would be assisted by the lower rate of VAT on the provision of security.  I am reliably informed that approximately 50 per cent of the turnover of the security, guarding companies goes back to the State through contributions in tax, PRSI and levies. The State gets money from those, but not from the black economy.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the Government are dangerously complacent about the level of crime and that is why we see no measures in the budget to deal in particular with crime.  The measures in the budget will worsen the crime situation. The Minister for Justice claims that the problem of drug abuse has plateaued out when it is quite obvious that he is unable to control the abuse of even controlled drugs in the prison system, notably in Mountjoy.  Drugs like cannabis are now widely available in the community. Because of complacency, the Minister for Finance has reduced expenditure on overtime in the customs service in the ports and airports.  Vigilance in relation to the importation of drugs has been reduced.  That is a result of the general complacency of the Government in relation to crime and the fact that they are trying to make people believe that crime at the existing levels is something we have to accept.</P>
    <P>It is similar to their approach to unemployment. They cannot be expected to do anything about it.  They leave the gardaí short of the resources to do the job and they leave the customs agents short of the staff and overtime to carry out proper surveillance of the ports and airports.  In <Col N="2497" /> 1985 a total of 1,424 people were treated for drug abuse in Jervis Street.  That compares with a figure of 1,454 for the previous year and that is why the Minister says the figure is plateauing out.  The Minister has failed to recognise that drugs are still a very serious problem and that new people are being affected by drugs all the time.  As far as crime is concerned this budget will have only a negative effect.  In relation to the economy and employment the Government are failing and in relation to crime the budget will worsen the situation.</P>
    <P>On the question of social welfare this is an uncaring, inhuman budget.  It would match anything that Cumann na nGaedheal ever produced in their heyday when they took the shilling from the old age pensioner.  At that time it was a terrible thing to reduce the old age pension from ten shillings to nine shillings.  It is hard to imagine the mentality that would produce that sort of thing.  Yet in 1986 we have a Government so uncaring and inhuman that they give social welfare recipients a 4 per cent increase but nothing for their children.  For the first time in history the children of the unemployed, the widowed, the handicapped and disabled get nothing.  What have they done to the Government to deserve this punishment? What Cumann na nGaedheal did was hardly as bad as making no provision for children in the present circumstances. What could we expect from a Government who took 25 per cent off the extra week for old age pensioners at Christmas?</P>
    <P>By making no provision for the children the Minister saves £9 million in one year.  The Minister did away with the £100 tax allowance, the last vestige of special allowance provided for children in middle income families, and saved £30 million. On children alone the Minister has saved £39 million in this budget.  The Minister will say he gave an increase in children's allowances.  However, in 1983 there was no increase in children's allowances; in 1984 there was an increase of 7 per cent delayed until August; in 1985 there was no increase; and in 1986 the Minister gave an increase in children's allowances and <Col N="2498" /> expects us to cheer.  The Minister is only giving the money he took in the past three years.  The money would not even equal what should have been provided for children if the provision were made each year.</P>
    <P>Added to that, food subsidies will be halved, which means that the price of bread and butter will go up shortly.  The Minister put 2 per cent on the bulk of the supermarket items, the standard items which families must buy each week.  How can the Minister be surprised when people say this is an anti-family Government and that this is another in a string of anti-family budgets?  The miserable little increases are not much good to the old age pensioners, the widows or the unemployed. The Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment said they are happy that the Government have continued their good record in looking after people in receipt of social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>A budget is about the transfer of money, but money is not being transferred to the unemployed or the welfare groups this year.  Money transfers are being reduced systematically by this Government.  The Minister says that each of the increases given in the Government's earlier budgets has exceeded the following year's increase in the cost of living.  That statement contains an awful lot and suggests that the Government are now trying to change the base on which these calculations are made.  I was Minister for Health and Social Welfare and I had to prepare this sort of thing for budgets.  However, one always prepared it on the previous year's inflation rate so that people were compensated for what they had lost that year. Now the Minister for Finance, through sleight of hand, is compensating for the inflation he expects in the year to come, which means that people lose out.  That is a subtle change and people have not noticed it because they do not really care. Members of the House will not suffer as a result of the Minister's actions but the unemployed, disabled and genuinely in need will suffer severely.</P>
    <P>In relation to the poor, elderly and <Col N="2499" /> unemployed there is one reprehensible measure in the budget, the confiscation of the savings of old age pensioners and children which arises as a result of the 35 per cent retention tax.  There are good effects as a result of this tax being imposed but not as far as children are concerned. The Minister has become a piggybank robber, taking the Holy Communion and Confirmation money.  The poor children have no way of getting this back. Not satisfied with that, he also comes down on the elderly who have meagre savings put by to give them security. Anyone who knows an elderly person realises that this money means a lot.  I should like elderly people to be allowed to have a sum of £10,000 outside the reach of the Department of Finance.  The Minister is now raiding these savings which is tantamount to confiscation because, heretofore, they would have been able to claim under exemption limits and tax.  He is literally confiscating part of their savings.</P>
    <P>These people are old and insecure and are hurt and confused by what the Government are doing.  The elderly were originally asked by the Government to trust them and to put their savings in the banks and post offices to help to reduce crime and the risk of burglaries and mugging. They did so in good faith and then the Government take this mean action. Can you blame anybody for sending money out of the country?  Those who have the opportunity to invest their money elsewhere are doing so because they do not trust the Government.  Many TV and radio programmes featured the Minister for Justice and the Garda Commissioner telling old people to take their money out from under the bed and to invest it.  I call on the Minister to change his policy in regard to the retention tax and to come up with some scheme designed to exempt children and those over 65 from this tax, either by non-confiscation in the first instance or by restitution.  He has a duty to do one or the other. Responsibility for the budget deficit should not be placed on the shoulders of the leanaí or na daoine aosta.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2500" /> It is not surprising that the Minister for Health and Social Welfare announced the closure of two major psychiatric hospitals the day after the budget because he needed a smokescreen to divert attention from the greatest clawback in children's allowances in the history of the State.  A cut of £5 million in the health area was announced in the budget.  Beaumont hospital was handed over in July 1983 and since then has cost £100,000 per month to keep it going.  In the meantime, Jervis Street and the Richmond are working away at full blast using up all the resources.  Beaumont hospital is costing almost £1.3 million per annum.  The Minsiter for Finance announced cuts in awards to victims of rape and mugging but if he had opened Beaumont hospital when it should have opened he would have had more than enough money to compensate people.  The Richmond and Jervis Street hospitals should have been closed by now and if they had been closed, a sum of at least £3 million would have been available to put back into the health service.  I would have insisted on such a course but that may not be the case nowadays.</P>
    <P>The only person holding up the opening of the hospital is the Minister for Health.  It is a public scandal.  It is a major hospital for the north side of Dublin and I call on the Minister for Finance to hold an inquiry into the scandalous waste of public moneys involved and to stop misleading people about the reality of the situation.  When I was Minister I worked out an agreement with the consultants, which included a 1.3 acre site, to build and pay for themselves a private hospital in association with Beaumont.  When the Minister, Deputy Desmond, came to office he revoked this agreement between the consultants and the Department of Health.  We have now seen the results of that policy.  I should also like to mention the effect that the 35 per cent tax will have on many charities and voluntary organisations by bringing them into the tax net.  I hoped the Minister would have some new proposals, but there are no new proposals or ideas here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2501" /> As regards multiple sclerosis or cystic fibrosis, there is an anomaly in the granting of the constant care allowance to some of these families.  A small percentage of patients registered have been refused the allowance based on the recommendations of the local officers. The Minister for Finance could say that such allowances would cost only buttons and that the allowance could be granted straightaway.  We used to make a list of things which cost very little but were a great help, and I am very sorry to see that in this budget there is no such list. There is nothing here for people badly in need.  There is no strategy in this budget for employment or development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome a few items in this budget which I have been asking the Minister for Finance to take into account for some time.  The 1 per cent income levy has been an irritant which last year brought in £47 million.  It was introduced in 1982 when the Government did not have enough measures to bring in revenue. I am glad to see that it has been only a temporary imposition.  The 10 per cent cut in income tax is the most significant measure to have been introduced in the last number of years and some of the things which had to be done to pay for this 10 per cent cut are valid.  I particularly welcome the reduction from 23 per cent to 10 per cent in VAT on cinemas, fun fairs and particularly meals in restaurants. This was one of the sectors which had no VAT on input but had a 23 per cent VAT on service.  A retailer buys certain commodities and pays VAT. When he sells his products the VAT is included and then he claims back the VAT.  Since there is no VAT on food there was a clear anomaly here because restaurateurs had to pay the 23 per cent VAT out of their profit margins.  This reduction in VAT has been very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has taken the <Col N="2502" /> recommendation of the small businesses committee to increase VAT on parts from 23 per cent to 25 per cent and that the rate for labour for repairs of everything from shoes to television sets and motor cars has been reduced from 23 per cent to 10 per cent.  If a person on the dole does a nixer and is in direct competition with a garage owner, the person on the dole has the advantage because the lower the VAT on parts the less need there is for him to register, and the higher the VAT on labour the more uncompetitive the registered contractor will be.  The measures in the budget will combat that and force the man doing the nixer to register.  This will make the registered contractor more competitive.</P>
    <P>The trend to reduce the current budget deficit is very desirable and later I will itemise areas where I think public expenditure can be cut more effectively and with a lot less pain than some of the cuts we have seen already.  I also welcome the child benefit scheme, particularly the change which allows parents a tax covenant of up to £600 especially by way of education grants.</P>
    <P>In the mid-seventies a tax amnesty was introduced and now we are reintroducing that amnesty.  I do not believe it will be adequate just to give immunity from prosecution to people to declare their sins.  We have to look at how much companies owe in the areas of PAYE, PRSI and VAT, not people who are refusing to pay their own income tax.  There should be a six months, or even a two months, amnesty for companies.  If the Minister or the Revenue Commissioners told such companies they could write off the interest they owe, I know many companies would be willing to pay their arrears.  The difficulty is that if a company is on the brink of insolvency and has huge revenue arrears, the last thing people taking over that company want to know about is that they will have to deal with those arrears.  We must help people to take over these companies by granting an amnesty.  In this way the Revenue Commissioners would get the principal because, under present company law, it would pay companies to go bust rather <Col N="2503" /> than to pay their tax debts because of the high interest owed.  I realise that the Minister and some civil servants were very much against an amnesty and to get them to concede anything in this area was very difficult, but we must deal with this question of interest.</P>
    <P>I welcome the equal treatment provision in the social welfare code and the farm modernisation scheme, with particular reference to the benefits for young farmers.  The instalment premium for which Macra na Feirme and others have been lobbying strongly will give a welcome boost to young farmers' confidence. The current budget deficit must be tightened by increasing tax on the old reliables and making income tax changes for financial institutions.  That broad approach is one which will meet with support from the majority of people who are paying very high income tax and are complaining bitterly that it does not pay them to work overtime, to be promoted and to work harder because a higher proportion of their income goes on income tax.  There has been a welcome shift in this area in this budget and I prefer it to some of the options put forward by the Commission on Taxation, some of which I consider to be wholly unworkable.</P>
    <P>I would like clarification from the Minister of Labour about certain cuts which have taken place in relation to Teamwork and the work experience programme.  There seems to be an embargo on Teamwork and a quota arrangement for work experience in regional offices.  Young people are not being taken on until April or May because there are already a certain number of people taking part in this programme.  May I remind the Minister that there is a 75 per cent job placement rate here and there is a vital need to bridge the gap for young people between school and work?</P>
    <P>When we talk about long term social welfare payments &mdash; unemployment assisstance &mdash; we should include disabled persons' maintenance allowances.  I will deal with this in more detail in the debate on the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare <Col N="2504" /> Bill.  I want to deal with the VAT threshold of £20,000 for the sale of goods. This has been at that level for three years and is a disadvantage for people with small shops &mdash; those selling sweets, bread, milk and so on.  They now find themselves with a very high VAT liability and this can be costly in terms of overheads.  I hope the Minister will consider keeping the level at what it was, in real terms, by increasing this threshold to £22,000.  There is a precedent for this. In the seventies it was not announced in the budget that the threshold would be increased but it was announced in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I will deal now with retention tax. There is no basis in equity whereby one can deduct 35 per cent from someone's income if he does not have an income tax liability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This is something we cannot argue.  It is a matter of equity and justice. I favour putting the banks, the financial institutions and the building societies on the same footing.  I actively sought for non-disclosure in the banks even if it meant a prepayment of tax.  The fact that there are seven million deposit accounts speaks for itself.  I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that on average the tax liability of most deposit holders is in excess of 35 per cent.  There are people who have retired having sold their shops or farms and there are others whose sole livelihood depends on their investment income or on their savings in the financial institutions.  It is unfair that 35 per cent of their income should be confiscated when they may not have an opportunity to exhaust their tax-free allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the different saving schemes operating in the Post Office &mdash; they have a net 9 per cent rate of return which is most attractive &mdash; and the credit unions, both of which institutions have been exempt from tax.  However, there must be a facility to allow people to declare that they have a nil tax liability or they must be allowed to exhaust their tax-free allowance.  That <Col N="2505" /> will not represent any loss in resources. As a matter of equity that concession will have to be conceded in the Finance Bill because it is patently unfair and unjust to the weakest sections.  Many people speak in an emotional way about old age pensioners. I appreciate that many elderly people put money aside for their burial expenses.  However, I have often commented that an old age couple will get a social welfare pension of £84 per week while a husband on unemployment assistance will get only £54 for himself and his wife.  I am not saying that old pensioners are well off but often when we talk about them we lose sight of a greater injustice, namely, the treatment given to people whose sole income is derived from their savings and investment.</P>
    <P>As always, I try to put forward constructive ideas in a debate like this.  In previous years I spoke about PRSI exemptions for new employees, grants for the construction industry and many other matters.  A serious anomaly in respect of the incentive to work arises for large families.  A person on social welfare who has more than four children knows it will never pay him to get a low paid job.  It will never pay him to get the job of an agricultural labourer, to be employed at the minimum pay rates or to work in the general labour grades.  We must ensure that people with more than four children are allowed to have a certain ongoing payment from the Department of Social Welfare if they get a job.  Otherwise it does not pay people with children to work.  I know of families in my constituency who have eight and ten children.  I know of one woman who had her 15th baby the other day.  It would never pay her husband to work.  We must consider giving a supplement to large families to give them the necessary incentive to go to work.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of employers' PRSI contributions.  I appreciate the concession made regarding new employees. I understand that on 23 October the Government announced they had asked the NESC to review PRSI rates in different sectors of industry.  For example, for a business with a low labour intensity <Col N="2506" /> and a high capital intensity their rate of PRSI payments as a percentage of their operating surplus could be 10 per cent. On the other hand, a textile manufacturer or a construction firm, both of whom are labour intensive, will have to pay 40 per cent of their operating surplus on PRSI.</P>
    <P>The employers' PRSI is a payroll tax. The more people a company employ the more tax they pay.  This is a fundamental factor in creating a climate in which companies do not want to employ people. They get jobs carried out by contract and they do this with some justification.  I understand that when this point was put to the NESC they were not prepared to unscramble the whole business of one sector not being willing to pick up the tab.  We must look at the experience of the United Kingdom and consider what Chancellor Lawson has done with regard to employers' PRSI.  He has abolished it. Up to now our Minister has always said we had the lowest rate of employers' PRSI in Europe but I think we must reconsider the matter now.</P>
    <P>Even if we cannot afford to abolish employers' PRSI a method adopted in Holland might be employed here.  It would not mean a loss to the Exchequer. The scheme in Holland levies PRSI on the firm but not per employee.  I have seen this work in relation to certain companies. If PRSI were levied as a social security tax to meet our health and social welfare bill of £3.6 billion that would be effective.  The NESC may say that they cannot reach agreement in relation to the employers' PRSI.  The Government should set up an interdepartmental committee actively to pursue the feasibility of paying people with more than four children to go to work and, secondly, to levy PRSI per firm, not per job.</P>
    <P>There is a major problem in relation to the employment of people who do casual work.  If a farmer, a builder or hotelier wishes to take on a person on unemployment assistance for casual work three days per week, that person would have a hole in his head if he accepted that job. First, his unemployment assistance <Col N="2507" /> would be cut.  Then, when he signs at the exchange on the following week for the two days he did not work the social welfare officer could take three weeks to administer the claim.  Their practice is to pick out the gross earnings and divide by 50.  If the person concerned earned £100 they will deduct £2 per week for the next year from unemployment assistance.  A person would be made to take on part-time work.  We must adopt a system to allow for flexible casual work.  It should be possible for an employer to go to the exchange, to tell them he wants a certain person to work for three days and that he will pay them the money.  What is needed is a new definition of work under the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>We must look at major fundamental administrative changes such as defining work and considering the whole matter of PRSI contributions.  We must consider the matter of category H contributions which involve fewer than 18 hours work per week.  The scheme must be revised and we must have a flexible arrangement as is the case in Denmark.</P>

    <P>Dáil Éireann notes that following the announcements of the Government decision in Dáil Éireann on 29th and 30th January last, the Minister for Health has commenced the process of consultation with the authorities of St. Dympna's Hospital, Carlow, St. Patick's Hospital, Castlerea, the District Hospital, Roscrea, the Isolation Hospital, Killarney, Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, Dublin, the Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, Cork and St. Patrick's Infant Hospital, Blackrock to give effect to the policy decisions relating to these hospitals and further notes the assurance given by the Minister that the best interests of the patients and the rights of the staff in these hospitals will be fully taken account of in the implementation of these essential <Col N="2509" /> measures to develop and improve the delivery of the health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>After many efforts to raise this matter by way of Private Notice Question and on the Adjournment, I am glad at last to have the opportunity to speak in support of the motion put down by our spokesman on health, Deputy O'Hanlon, calling on the Government to rescind their decision to close the hospitals mentioned until they have full consultations with the health boards on all aspects of these closures.</P>
      <P>I will address my remarks to the hospitals in my own constituency, St. Dympna's in Carlow.  This is one of the most cost-effective hospitals in the country.  It has given a lead in psychiatric services over the years and is one of the few psychiatric hospitals which has opened itself to the community.  The nurse-patient ratio in this hospital is one of the lowest and it serves a catchment area of 114,000 people from counties Kildare and Carlow.  It has pioneered community nursing for the past 25 years and has been thoroughly integrated into community life.  This is in line with the spirit of the document Planning for the Future.  We have heard much about this document recently but it is actually one of the most abused documents that has ever been produced.  It has been accepted by the staff of St. Dympna's and by the South-Eastern Health Board as a progressive document, but it has been used by the Minister for Health in a very selective manner to provide quotations in support of his argument.  It is pointed out throughout the document that community care cannot be introduced except on a phased basis.  Some people have mentioned a time of ten to 15 years, during which period necessary resources would have to be made available to the health boards in order to provide these community services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The document states that the decline in importance of the psychiatric hospitals should take place gradually and as part <Col N="2510" /> of a planned progression to community-oriented service.  It goes on to say that the psychiatric hospitals must not become forgotten places and that despite declining numbers they will be needed still for some years and must therefore be adequately maintained.  Well developed community services are a prerequisite to achieving a decline in the hospital population. It is recognised that it will not be possible to rehabilitate all the patients for independent living in the community and it is considered that patients who cannot be rehabilitated to this extent should be allowed to spend their remaining years in the hospitals where they now live.  These points are made throughout the document by the eminent people who drew it up, but none of this has been taken into consideration by the Minister in making this announcement.  He used selective quotations from the document in support of his argument.</P>
    <P>I have not yet met anybody who disagrees with the views put forward in Planning for the Future.  It deserves great attention and its recommendations should be implemented as soon as possible. In order to achieve that, resources must be made available to the health boards.  In his allocation to the South-Eastern Health Board the Minister gave £1.86 million to St. Dympna's Hospital. This amount will keep the hospital in operation for six months and it will have to close at the end of June, although no alternative arrangements have been made for the 343 patients resident there. The Minister says that it is his intention to provide community-based services. Those of us involved in the health services know that it can take up to ten years between the planning and completion of a project.  The overall allocation to the South-Eastern Health Board for 1986 will be reduced by £6.35 million.  How does the Minister expect us to provide new services when we will not be able to maintain existing services?  The Minister has deliberately made this announcement now to divert attention from the reductions in the allocations to health boards and we will have more to say about this at a later time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2511" /> The impression has been given by the Minister for Health, and by the Minister for Finance who attended a meeting in Carlow last night, that this decision was in some way brought about by the South-Eastern Health Board.  I categorically deny that.  Under no circumstances was there any consultation with any member of the South-Eastern Health Board or with the chief executive officer.  The chief executive officer may have been one of the people who sat on the committee which drew up Planning for the Future but that does not mean that he or any members of his board are responsible for the proposed closure.</P>
    <P>Professionals in the psychiatric services have all opposed the Minister's decision. The community infrastructure must first be developed.  Patients must be prepared for rehabilitation and the community must be prepared to accept patients back. The Minister's decision is irresponsible. We are asking that there should be no movement of patients out of the hospitals until such time as proper community-based psychiatric services are available.</P>
    <P>I was glad of the Minister's indication last night that he would be prepared to have a local inquiry held in each area where the health board do not agree to a hospital closure.  I can assure him that the health board will not be agreeing and therefore a local inquiry will be held in Carlow.  If such an inquiry is held, the outcome will ensure that St. Dympna's Hospital will not be closed.  Twelve hundred responsible people came to a meeting last night in Carlow to voice their opposition to his decision.</P>
    <P>Members of the parties opposite have an opportunity tonight to register their vote against this decision and to save the hospitals in their respective areas.  We know they have party loyalties but they also have a duty to their constituents. This is their opportunity and I call on the Members for Carlow-Kilkenny to oppose the Minister in this decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Pattison) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Pattison)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to begin by correcting the false impression some <Col N="2512" /> people have, and some people may be trying to create, in relation to this Fianna Fáil motion that the vote to be taken at 8.30 p.m. is about giving or not giving the Minister for Health the power to close hospitals.  Of course, that is utterly untrue.  There is no power in that vote to do that.  The vote tonight, no matter what the outcome of it will be, will not be a vote either to close or not to close any hospital if only for the reason that has been pointed out on a number of occasions, that a hospital cannot be closed without the necessary local inquiry.  Some years ago when I was in Opposition a motion I moved in this House was passed by this House but the Fianna Fáil Government of the day decided to ignore the motion and I found that nothing could be done about it.  Since then I have been very cynical about motions in this House and what effect or power they have, as a result of that experience which a number of Deputies will recall.  I do not rise to the bait, as Deputy Aylward put it, because this motion is purely and simply a political ploy such as is used by all parties &mdash; I am not being critical &mdash; particularly parties in Opposition.  It is used to exploit to the greatest political advantage the misfortunes of the Government of the day.  I state that not as a matter of criticism but as a matter of fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like most party politically conceived motions, this one has many defects.  It tries to please everyone and to promise everything, and in the process it does less than justice to the hospital I am interested in, St. Dympna's.  It does less than justice to their case because it puts St. Dympna's on a par with some of the hospitals mentioned in the list and it does not deserve to be put on a par with those hospitals.  In many ways this motion, in the way it is worded, could be harmful if it really meant anything.  I will admit that other hospitals in the list in the motion each have a case, but I hold that the case of St. Dympna's is a very special one and it suffers from being contained in the motion.  For that reason I express the hope that this motion and this discussion tonight will end the political point scoring on this and that the five TDs and two <Col N="2513" /> Senators in Carlow-Kilkenny will join together with one purpose in mind, that is to get the best deal possible for the patients and staff in St. Dympna's.  We should be united on that issue because we have a strong, good case to make and we will not make it if we are going to continue political point scoring off one another.</P>
    <P>I support the Government amendment. I am glad to note from the amendment that the process of consultation has commenced with the South-Eastern Health Board in relation to St. Dympna's.  I want to put on the record of this House the assurances which the Minister for Health has given me in relation to these consultations.  These assurances are that the purpose of these consultations is not only to ensure that there will be no diminution of the services available to patients but that the quality of the service will be improved.  Furthermore, I want to put on record that the Minister has confirmed to me that the employment entitlements of all of the staff will be fully respected.  Again I emphasise that all of these consultations are taking place and must continue to take place in the context of the document <i>Planning for the Future.</i></P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that, while I have no reason to doubt the sincerity of these assurances, if I find there is any departure from the undertakings I have received I will be taking what some people might describe as drastic action.  I am aware of the sufferings that the patients and their families have undergone and of the anxiety of the staff since the announcement was made, and I am not prepared to tolerate any further imposition of hardship on any of these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to close St. Dympna's Hospital came as an absolute shock to me and in particular to my constituents not only in Carlow but also in Kilkenny.  The patients and staff of the hospital were particularly distressed by the proposed closure.  I ask the Minister if this is a cost-cutting exercise.  If so, then it should be resisted fiercely by anybody and everybody who prides himself in the <Col N="2514" /> promotion of improved facilities for the weakest sector of our economy, the mentally handicapped and the psychiatrically ill.</P>
      <P>The Minister last night referred to the rationalisation of the hospital services to provide another example of how the freeing of resources would permit a necessary development.  What is the necessary development associated with the closure of this long established psychiatric hospital in Carlow which has at present 340 incare patients and a nursing staff of 140? The Department claim that that could be as high as 150; nonetheless, it is still a small staff.  It is the least cost effective hospital of its type in the entire country. I suggest that the Minister look at some of the other institutions of a similar nature in other health board areas, and then perhaps he will have a different view.</P>
      <P>The year 1981 saw the commencement of the important task of drawing up planning guidelines for the future development of the psychiatric hospital services culminating in what I regard as an excellent report, <i>Planning for the Future</i>.  The Minister is now, as he states, endeavouring to implement that policy out of an adamant personal conviction, and in that he has my total and absolute support and I am confident that he has the support of every Member of this House and most people across the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night the Minister referred to the hospital as a 19th century building and not a pioneer in the development of psychiatric services.  I would like to point out to him that it was the first institution of its type in this country which shed the high concrete walls and barbed wire effect and ceased to be regarded locally as a lunatic asylum.  If that is not a pioneer effort, then somebody might tell me what is.  I visited this hospital since the bombshell of the proposed closure hit it last Thursday week, and now I can stand here and tell this House publicly with conviction how moved I was to experience the excellent level of nursing care which all the patients of that hospital enjoyed. Many of the patients have come to regard it as their home.  Some of them pleaded with me to ask the Minister under no circumstances to allow that hospital to <Col N="2515" /> close and thrust them out on to the street. I have to support the view that the Minister holds, that his intention was never to throw anybody on to the street, least of all that section.</P>
    <P>This year we are spending £1,276 million on health and related services.  That by any standard is an enormous expenditure of taxpayers' money, and the Minister not only has responsibility but he has an obligation to ensure that we get the best value for our money in terms of hospital care.  In that way implementing this report will have the absolute and fullest support of all of us.</P>
    <P>I take issue with the Minister over the stark announcement of the elimination of St. Dympna's Hospital in the light of the report on future planning.  That makes neither good psychiatric nor economic sense.  I am firmly convinced that there is need for the continuation of an institutionalised care centre such as St. Dympna's in the Carlow area.  I would go further and say that in the interest of psychiatric care generally and in line with what is in the report, there should be more of these smaller sized institutions around the country.  In that way we could provide a better service.  We embarked upon a rationalisation programme resulting in bigger factories, bigger hospitals, bigger schools, but this brought about many problems.  Will anybody deny a few extra shillings in income tax to the psychiatrically ill?  If so, let them stand up and say so.</P>
    <P>To some extent the motion before the House is political.  Of that I have no doubt.  In my view the amendment is no different.  That makes it easy for me to support either the motion or the amendment. In the amendment there is mention of consultation.  I urge the Minister to continue the process which he has now commenced in connection with psychiatric care institutions.  Having entered into dialogue with all interested parties, I am sure he will come to the conclusion that not only should the present institutions remain open, but that he should encourage similar institutions around the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the time limitation, I shall confine my remarks to the proposed closure of the Isolation Hospital, Killarney.  To say that I was surprised when I heard the announcement on the RTE evening news would be an understatement.  Because certain innuendos and statements have been bandied about in an endeavour to damage my integrity, indicating that I had prior knowledge of the Minister's decision, I want it clearly put on the record that, no more than any of the other Members, I had no previous knowledge.</P>
      <P>In 1986 nobody would quarrel with the closure of an isolation hospital which was built for the treatment of infectious diseases. Medical science has long since eradicated these diseases and society is very grateful for that.  However, the Isolation Hospital in Killarney cannot be put into that category.  It has filled a vital role and served on many occasions as a safety valve in the accommodation of patients who could not find accommodation in the local district hospital.  In evaluating the decision to close the hospital, four fundamental principles should be critically examined.  The first deals with any disruption of the existing patients and the local economy; the second with continuity of employment; the third with continuation of full availability of hospital services; and the fourth with financial implications. I suggest that there is ample and good evidence that the Isolation Hospital in Killarney should continue to serve hospitalisation needs in south Kerry.  There are 44 beds in the local district hospital.  If you evaluate any town the size of Killarney, with an urban population of 8,000 and a perimeter population of approximately 4,000 because of extended housing, you will find that the decision to close this hospital would not be in the best interests.  The town of Mallow has a slightly lower population and is 20 miles from the Regional Hospital in Cork, and Killarney is 20 miles from Tralee Regional Hospital.  Mallow is maintaining a very substantial general hospital, however.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2517" /> The State contribution to the Southern Health Board this year is £145,650,000. The impact of the cost of the isolation hospital is less than £360,000 &mdash; less than one quarter of 1 per cent of the total budget for the two counties.  I suggest that endeavouring to find cuts over the wide range of the budget should be relatively easy.  That £145,650,000 is the direct input from the taxpayer.  The local contribution from the self-employed &mdash; which should represent something in the nature of 60 per cent of the population of Cork and Kerry &mdash; represents £202,000.  If that represents 1 per cent of the profit income of those who are availing of hospital services in those two counties, then there is room for a substantial improvement there.</P>
    <P>I am supporting the amendment on the grounds that discussion and dialogue will continue in connection with the points that I have made, with a view to continuing the services of the Isolation Hospital in Killarney for the benefit of the patients and the hospitalisation services in south Kerry.</P>

      <P>As the Minister is well aware and as we indicated on a previous occasion in the House and in discussions with him, the announcement of the closure of St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea, came as a shock to all of us, in the sense that we were left in difficulty as to what precisely would happen to the 240 patients there.  I was delighted yesterday evening to hear the Minister say that he had begun negotiations with the Western Health Board about the future of the patients in Castlerea hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all appreciate that a number of those patients will be transferred to the new centre in Swinford.  That centre was built for the purpose of dealing with mentally handicapped patients and I agree with the Minister that that is the proper place in which to have those patients treated.  What concerns me more now, and has over the last fortnight, is the position with regard to the other approximately 200 patients who are in St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea.  I was glad <Col N="2518" /> to hear the Minister say yesterday that he was prepared to make adequate provision for those patients who were in a position to be discharged into the community, supervised or unsupervised hostels, or under a community care programme.  It is only right and proper that those who are able to look after themselves should, where possible, be treated in the community. This view is shared by many and has been given in all the documents published on psychiatry over the past number of years.  I was delighted to hear the Minister say he is prepared to make the necessary provisions to have those people cared for in their local areas whether in Boyle, Ballaghaderreen, Roscommon or Castlerea.  It is important for the patients, and their relatives, to know they will be catered for in their own community.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that many of the staff will be utilised in this way.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the other 100 patients many whom have been in the hospital for between 20 and 30 years. The hospital has become their home and I do not think they can be discharged to hostel accommodation supervised or unsupervised.  Those people should be cared for in the Castlerea hospital.  It is of vital importance to the patients, and their relatives, that they are left undisturbed in Castlerea for the rest of their lives. It would be irresponsible to disturb them in any way.</P>
    <P>A report on the psychiatric services was submitted by the officials of the Western Health Board to the Department recommending the opening of an acute psychiatric unit in Roscommon. I appeal to the Minister to examine that proposal carefully.  He should not stop the acute psychiatric service in Castlerea until there is alternative accommodation in Roscommon.  The people of Roscommon county will not tolerate the closing of the acute unit in Castlerea if an alternative unit has not been opened in the county.  I might add that the report prepared by the officials has not been considered by the members of the health board.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the special hospitals <Col N="2519" /> committee of the health board I was surprised that the report which contains a five year plan for St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea, was only given to me recently. The proposals in the report are broadly in line with modern thinking in regard to psychiatric services.</P>
    <P>I must stress that I am very concerned about those who cannot be moved to hostel accommodation.  The Minister should ensure that they are treated in St. Patrick's.  As was stated by a previous speaker, the motion before us is a political one to try to cause embarrassment to certain Members of the House.  Having listened to the Minister last night, being aware of his concern for the patients in St. Patrick's and knowing that discussions will take place with the Western Health Board on the future of the institution I have no hesitation in supporting the amendment tabled by the Minister.</P>

      <P>The psychiatric services are more sensitive than the services in any general hospital because many of the patients in those institutions have been there for many years.  In some of the acute wards patients have been there for 30 or 40 years.  I am aware that it is a traumatic experience for patients in those wards if their bed is moved even one foot. We should not make sudden decisions to close wards.  I was pleased to hear that the Minister has agreed to have consultations with the boards concerned.  Tonight I hope he will go a stage further and announce that, in regard to the psychiatric services in Carlow and Castlerea, he will not put a time limit on the closure.</P>
      <P>The report on the psychiatric services points out in chapter after chapter that the services can only be phased out, that there should not be a cut-off point.  I am sure the Minister realises the importance of that statement and in view of it I ask him to give a commitment to the House to phase out the services.  It will not be possible to close St. Dympna's in 1986 although the Minister has withheld half of the funds for that hospital for this year. He paid the South Eastern Health Board funds to cover the first six months but the funds for the remainder of the year are being withheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Members will accept that St. Dympna's will not be closed this June, or <Col N="2521" /> in June 1987.  I am aware that the decision is not a cost-cutting exercise but the implementation of recommendations in the report on the psychiatric services.  We should take serious note of the recommendations in that report.  It states clearly that services must be phased out and that monitoring committees should be established to supervise the phasing out of psychiatric services in institutions.  The Minister, and those involved in the psychiatric services, accept that there is a need for change.  I should like to pay tribute to those who work in that service. As a member of the South Eastern Health Board from its inception up to last June I was aware of the great work done in many psychiatric hospitals, including St. Dympna's.  I have always admired those who work in such hospitals under difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's efforts to change the scene in regard to psychiatric services and I am sure those who work in psychiatric hospitals will give the Minister their full support in his efforts to introduce community services.  But it is not possible to close down these services overnight.  In defence of the South-Eastern Health Board who have been the subject of some criticism from the Minister, the board have five small hospitals within their area.  These hospitals are very well run and the board should not have been criticised by the Minister.  I served on that board for 15 years and I know that they run a tight ship and are short of staff and facilities.  In better times when the goodies were handed out, that board did not seek anything.  They worked to a very tight budget.</P>

      <P>With a patient population of 350 and staff compliment of 280, St. Dympna's is one of the most economic hospitals in the country.  The patient-staff ratio is the lowest of all our psychiatric institutions.  The hospital's record in pioneering psychiatric advances leaves in the shade many of the more widely known establishments.  The commitment, dedication and professionalism of the staff there would have to be seen to be believed.  It is regrettable, though typical of this Minister, that he has never seen fit to visit that hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In announcing the decision to close St. Dympna's Hospital, the Minister is putting into practice what is obviously agreed Government policy, that is, to cut expenditure at any cost.  While the Minister may try to deny this, the Minister for Finance has said in public that this <Col N="2523" /> is the position.  This callous action by so few has far-reaching implications for many, for the families, for the patients and the staff concerned.  The Minister should admit his mistake before he compounds matters by endeavouring to implement his closure proposals.</P>

      <P>The Minister should discuss his interpretation of Planning for the Future with the interested bodies, the health boards, the unions and the hospital staff and try to find some formal agreement on his plans for the care of the patients of all the institutions in question. In his precipitate, rash and impetuous action, the Minister is acting out the role of the wild west cowboy who shoots first and asks questions later.  The Minister should admit he has been wrong.  It is dictatorship for a Minister to decide unilaterally to close any hospital but particularly a psychiatric hospital of the standard and standing of St. Dympna's.  It is Government by diktat.  Contrary to what the Minister has stated, there was no prior consultation with anyone about the proposed closure of St. Dympna's Hospital, Carlow.</P>
      <P>Last evening the Minister for Finance attended a public meeting in Carlow.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The actions of some people in the past fortnight bring that into question. Regarding the Minister's interpretation of Planning for the Future, that document which he continues to misquote, he said on television recently that he was entitled to close any hospital he wished, that he was merely implementing the recommendations in the plan.  He quoted from the plan the recommendation that each health board should draw up an outline plan for the psychiatric service.  He failed to read the next line which is that this should include targets and objectives to be reached in ten to 15 years time and perhaps in five year phases.</P>
      <P>What are we to think of a Minister who in his speech on the budget announced that overnight he was to close eight hospitals? The Minister has misused on many occasions this fine report on the psychiatric services.  In the past few days he has quoted selectively from it to support many of his actions while failing to quote relevant features of the plan when it suited him not to quote them.  He has discredited and belittled this fine report. The timespan in that report in respect of the targets and objectives is between ten and 15 years and not within six months as is the case in regard to St. Dympna's. The financial allocation allows that hospital to operate up to the end of June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us, Government, Opposition, health boards and staffs agree on the direction and the thrust of the Planning for the Future document but if various Government Ministers continue to bend, twist and wrap the findings of this report to suit themselves and their plans, the time and money spent on drawing up this very valuable document will represent <Col N="2525" /> another case of the misspending of time and money.  I support totally a policy of community care for the mentally disabled but that kind of policy cannot be put into practice overnight and it must not be one on the cheap.  To implement it suddenly and on the cheap would have disastrous effects.  We must ensure that those people suffering from a wide range of mental disabilities receive care that is at least as good as the care they are receiving now and preferably better.  This would involve a lot more than reducing the number of hospital beds.  It would involve the creation of wide ranging and varied alternative facilities.  It would involve the provision of supportive services for those thousands of very vulnerable people who are mentally disabled and who have little contact with the rest of the community. It would require also the redeployment of thousands of skilled, partly skilled and unskilled staff and a switch of capital resources.  None of these provisions is cheap and I urge the Minister to bear that factor in mind.  Provided the necessary funds are released there is every reason to expect steady progress towards the concept of community care in the next few years.</P>
    <P>In justifying the closing of St. Dympna's, the Minister said, among other things &mdash; he was speaking in an RTE interview &mdash; that the nurses were using outmoded practices, such as day on, day off rosters, segregated nursing and lack of open door policy.  The staff in that hospital have never worked such a roster.  A comprehensive integrated nursing service has been the norm since 1968. St. Dympna's complex provides maternity, general and psychiatric care, plus X-ray facilities, out-patient clinics and optical, dental and child care clinics.  The hospital has pioneered community nursing for the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he wants to move the patients out of high walled three storey institutions.  Carlow was the first institution to take down its high walls.  Some of the patients go about the town of Carlow like any other citizens.</P>
    <P>I take issue with the Minister for the <Col N="2526" /> manner in which he announced the closure of this hospital, coldly in the course of a budget debate.  I would have thought that the 50 years of tradition which that hospital represents would have merited at least a personal call to the CEO of the South Eastern Health Board, a man of considerable attainment and ability, which was proved by his inclusion in the study group appointed in October 1981 by the Minister's Labour Party colleague, Deputy Eileen Desmond.</P>
    <P>It is economic folly to suggest closing such a fine institution, having invested so much money in it in the past number of years.  This heartless and hopeless Minister for Health stands indicated not just before the people of Carlow: he stands guilty of gross mismanagement in front of the people of Ireland.  While he proposes to close St. Dympna's Hospital, his Department are financing a new £3 million geriatric hospital in the grounds of the same hospital.  What kind of management is this?  There is neither sense nor reason to that type of carry-on, and that is all it can be described as.</P>
    <P>The selfrighteous posturing of this Minister is doing himself and the Government no good.  I call on the Carlow-Kilkenny Deputies to stand up and talk with their feet: they have an opportunity tonight to show the people that they are serious about it by voting for our motion.</P>

      <P>It was customary in schools years ago to use proverbs for headlines. One of them was: &ldquo;Health is better than wealth&rdquo;.  It is a headline, obviously, that the Minister for Health and the Government would not agree with, because I am certain that the overriding consideration which led to the closures of these hospitals was concern for money.  The Minister can put any gloss he likes on it, but we are well aware it was budgetary considerations that led to this announcement of the necessary pruning that had to be done.</P>
      <P>The areas listed in our motion will suffer.  Deputy Pattison accused us of being the people who put St. Dympna's on a par with other areas.  We did not read out the litany of closures.  It was the Minister who read out that litany, which included St. Dympna's.  When Deputies there go through the lobby tonight they will be voting &ldquo;amen&rdquo; to all those closures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been talking about planning for the future.  These closures are a reaction to the present.  At a meeting in Carlow last night the Minister for Finance made that clear when he said that the <Col N="2528" /> closure of these hospitals would release resources.  That would enable carrots to be dangled in front of people, such as an acute geriatric unit, a psychiatric unit in Naas, a 20 bed-unit to replace the 230-bed unit in Carlow, something else for Kilkenny, something else for Waterford. Punts, not people, were the consideration when this decision was made.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health did not follow us to Carlow last night.  I hope his party colleagues tell him that the seething fury of the people there at the closure announcement was the death sentence for his party there.  The feelings of the people of Kildare, Laois, Carlow and Kilkenny are prompting them to say that Dympna's will be there long after Desmond has gone.</P>
    <P>The closure of this hospital must be condemned first because of the manner of the announcement, but especially because of its consequences.  Why was the decision announced without full consideration? Our motion calls for full consultation. Perhaps there will be negotiations, but will the Minister discuss the matter with an open mind?  If St. Dympna's is to be replaced, has he the resources or the physical structures to replace the hospital?  It is obvious to anybody with concern for health that there will have to be hostels, sheltered workshops, smaller units.  We will have to integrate people into the community.  Not alone will the patients have to be conditioned but the public must be conditioned as well.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said the closure of these hospitals would release resources.  Is the Minister big enough to admit that he has made a mistake?  In his sudden, insensitive announcement he said that there would be no hardship to the patients or the staff.  What competence had the Minister to say how the statement by itself would affect people's health?  Even the manner of the announcement would have caused hardship to the patients.  I know patients who have been in Carlow for years.  It is their home; they have nowhere else to go to.  To take them out of that environment would hurt them.  There are 330 patients in St. <Col N="2529" /> Dympna's, 2,000 more out-patients, and a history of short-stay patients.  Last year, 182 new patients were taken in.</P>
    <P>The whole tone of treatment in St. Dympna's is in line with modern thinking. It was set in train by Dr. Blake who initiated a programme well in advance of his time, of de-institutionalisation and rehabilitation to get patients back into the community.  St. Dympna's was a pioneer in that.  From the point of view of economy, cost efficiency and the ratio of nurses to patients that hospital comes out on top.  People who will not respond to treatment there will need a haven in Carlow for the rest of their lives.  I will tell the House about an 80 year old lady left on her own in Kildare town who rang me to ask what will happen to her son who has been in Carlow since he was 28 years when the hospital is closed.</P>
    <P>It is no use telling us that finance will be made available.  That is an unbelievable statement because the finance will run out in June. Suitable alternatives cannot be found in six months or in six years. The deanery in Kildare, which we purchased in 1977 to provide 20 adult places for male and female handicapped people, is still there.  The Minister would not meet us when we sought a meeting.  For 19 years we have been looking for an extra unit in Naas Hospital without success. The Minister must admit that he has been wrong.  If the Minister thinks about the good of the patients he must ask himself when and where he can provide a better service for them.  If the health boards embark on providing that service, will the Minister provide the money?  The Minister has an obligation to answer the question that many will ask &ldquo;What will happen my son when the hospital is closed?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider the Minister's action akin to that of a member of a junta Government rather than a democratically elected Government.  The Minister's announcement last week was that of a despot.  The decision to close St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea, and St. Dympna's was both crude and cruel and was flagrantly in breach of section 38 of the 1970 Health Act.  The Minister was prepared to direct the health board to close that hospital.  Only last night he had the audacity to tell the House that he will now request the co-operation of the health boards in holding local inquiries so as to give effect to his decision in relation to both hospitals.  The Minister has sent a circular to the Western Health Board reminding them that he will invoke section 31 of the 1970 Health Act if the chief executive officer of the board is prepared to continue with Castlerea Hospital and thereby cause overexpenditure. That is the misuse of the law which the Minister is employing to support his wrong decision to close this hospital.  We on this side of the House do not have short memories and we recall that the Minister showed scant concern for the law in another situation.</P>
      <P>The Minister's decision was cruel in that he attacked the most vulnerable and weak in our community.  Last week, in a most offensive and ugly manner, the Minister publicly offensively described my colleague and I on national television as squalidly and politically posturing. Both Deputy Leyden and I consider it our public duty to defend people who are without a voice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The psychiatric patients in Castlerea do not have a voice and we will not tolerate the Minister bearing down on them relentlessly, displaying a lack of understanding and knowledge as to what is really required.  We are aware of eminent psychiatric opinion about the phasing out of this type of institution. <Col N="2531" /> There is no conflict there.  But it is not possible to close this hospital immediately without making the necessary arrangements for the patients.  The Minister must be prepared to give great increases in the allocations to the health boards to ensure that we can provide the necessary framework for community care.</P>
      <P>At the moment we have far from adequate community care in the catchment area of St. Patrick's.  In one institution, because of lack of finance, a community care centre was opened in the old sanitorium in Roscommon.  Within a matter of days the roof collapsed and the staff had to return to St. Patrick's Hospital and the patients had to be removed. After spending an inadequate amount of money for some work, unsuitable accommodation was made available so that the centre could be used for the purposes now proposed.  In all the other centres throughout the county there is confined accommodation, no toilet facilities and so on.  There is a totally inadequate number of centres and it is impossible to provide centres between now and 1 July, the date on which the Minister proposes to terminate the services in Roscommon.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister really understand what community care requires?  Is the Minister aware of what must be made available to those people?  Has the Minister taken into account that the community must be educated to accept and understand these people?  Does the Minister recognise that many of the patients in Castlerea see it as their home and depend on the staff, whom I compliment on their dedicated service to the psychiatric patients against all the odds?  The reality is that there is not a proper facility to provide for these patients if the hospital is closed down immediately.  If the Minister is seriously concerned about providing a service for the psychiatric patients in Castlerea he must take into account that the requirements in the document <i>Planning for the Future</i> must be fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2532" /> I challenge the Minister to publicly deny that he has sent out officials from his Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to canvass for space in other psychiatric institutions so that he could relocate patients from St. Patrick's and St. Dympna's.  I challenge the Minister to deny that those officials are unwilling to proceed with the type of decision he is enforcing on them and attempting to implement without discussion.  I understand the Minister has suggested Swinford as possible accommodation for psychiatric patients with a mental handicap. Swinford was intended for mentally handicapped patients and it is not appropriate for patients with a psychiatric condition. The Minister will deny that that is his intention, but my information is that there is really only one patient with mental handicap suitable for accommodation in Swinford.  Let the Minister do the honourable thing and not leave a £12½ million centre in Swinford closed.  Let the Minister provide the money and open it to accommodate the mentally handicapped and let the Minister provide the necessary finances to accommodate psychiatric patients in community care.</P>
      <P>The other night the Minister waved a document in a way in which only a dictator would and stated that the document was approved by the Western Health Board.  That document had not come before the members of the Western Health Board or come before the committee of which I am a member; but the Minister was prepared to present it as fact when that document had not the acceptance of the staff nurses in St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea.  I understand from some of the nursing staff in Castlerea that they believe that the Minister did not want any consultations with them because he does not have trust or confidence in his own unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment to this motion and I have listened carefully to what the Deputies on all sides of the House have had to say on the issue of hospital closures and their effects on the health services.  I have also, at the weekend, listened to the honest views of my constituents and to the media debate on this issue.  I am also fortunate in my position as Minister of State at the Department of Health that I have had an opportunity to hear the well informed views of officers of my Department, whose prime concern is with the advancement of health services in this State. Despite the conflicting views I have heard from some sources, I am confident that the changes to be made are in the best interests of the health services and that I can, in conscience, support the move to close some of our out-dated institutions in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In listening to the debate in the House, I have noted that the majority of contributions centered on the closure of the two psychiatric hospitals in Carlow and Castlerea.  I comment on this for two reasons.  Firstly, it suggests to me that, <Col N="2534" /> broadly speaking, the need for some rationsalisation of acute hospital services in this country is, by and large, accepted by Deputies.  It indicates that there may be some light at the end of the tunnel in regard to the incessant demands for more and more acute hospital services without any reduction in the services they are designed to replace.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it has been on all too rare thing, in my experience as a Deputy and as a Minister of State, for interest to be expressed in the psychiatric services or in the plight of patients in our psychiatric hospitals.  Apart from the occasional glare of adverse publicity, they have largely been forgotten in the competing, and more vocal, demands of other sectors for attention.  The debate has at least focused attention on the needs of psychiatric services and on the <i>Planning for the Future</i> report with which I am sure many Deputies are, for the first time, becoming familiar.</P>
    <P>The decision to close Carlow and Castlerea is not a matter of taking panic action but a statement of intent on which definite plans can be made for the future of patients and staff.  I expect that very good plans can be drawn up between the Department of Health and the health boards to make sure that these closures are brought about with due care and consideration and that the next six months will see approval from this House and from the public for the steps being taken to implement these closures.  The fact that the closure of Castlerea hospital will mean the opening of the new £12 million purpose built centre for the mentally handicapped at Swinford will also be seen as a major bonus to the west when the dust has settled on the all too hasty reaction which has come in response to these well thought out closures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that shortly.  Coming from a rural western constituency I appreciate the economic importance of the hospitals at Castlerea, with an annual budget of £4 million, and Carlow with an annual budget of £3.7 <Col N="2535" /> million, to these towns and their spinoff effects on the livelihood of the local people.  This is why I have been at pains to stress that a change in the type of services to be provided does not mean an end to the flow of Government funds to these areas.  The interests of staff, I have been assured, will be looked after in making arrangements for closure.  With community care, the money available will be spread more widely in the catchment areas.  However, the benefits to patients must take precedence over economically dominated opposition to an end to institutional care.</P>

      <P>Finally, I should address myself to the concerns of patients in Carlow and Castlerea hospitals and their relatives throughout the surrounding areas.  I know that in the past two weeks they have been at the mercy of media hype and political opportunism in trying to find out what is to be their future.  I know they fear that people may be turned out of psychiatric hospitals, possibly to return home, without any preparation for the new life style that this will involve.  I am sorry that these have been encouraged by some poorly informed sources in the media and in politics.  The people who work in Castlerea Hospital and in St. Dympna's and the patients will be looked after.</P>

        <i>The Irish Medical <Col N="2536" /> Times</i> of 14 February 1985 opens its editorial by saying that any fool can close a long stay hospital but that it takes more time and trouble to do it properly and compassionately.  I am not here to defend long stay hospitals as my colleagues on this side of the House have done it adequately and well.  I am here on behalf of the hospital about which very few people know.  It is a short stay hospital, St. Patrick's, Temple Hill, run by the Sisters of Charity.  It surprises me to hear Government Deputies whingeing about the motion before the House being a political one.  Of course it is a political motion, we are in the vocation of politics. That is what this House is all about and I respectfully suggest that we should not be running down the vocation of politics. I am proud to be a politician.  Of course it is a political motion and the amendment is also political.  So be it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health represents the constituency of Dún Laoghaire in which St. Patrick's hospital is situated and he has represented that area since 1969.  He knows the wonderful work done by the staff and the Sisters of Charity since the mid-forties to the present.  St. Patrick's Hospital caters for the children of unmarried mothers.  The editorial in <i>The Irish Medical Times</i> encapsulated the purpose for which the hospital was set up.  It said that the 90-bed infants' hospital at Blackrock, County Dublin, had only a 50 per cent occupancy for the last few years. Most of the babies in the hospital are the children of single mothers and are left there pending adoption or until their mothers reach a decision on their future while they are re-organising their lives to enable them to care for the babies themselves.  The hospital is owned and run by the Irish Sisters of Charity and totally funded by the Department of Health which, last year, gave it a total of £590,000.  It is run in conjunction with the Society of St. Patrick's, an adoption society in Haddington Road and also works in conjunction with the Catholic Protection and Rescue Society.  The administrator at St. Patrick's said that they would be holding talks with the Department of Health on the future of <Col N="2537" /> the hospital.  She said they would like to keep it open if they got money but she did not know if the Irish Sisters of Charity could provide this money.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to keep St. Patrick's Infant Hospital open.  If the use for which it was intended has now diminished by fewer children being placed there, it could be utilised by a combination of child care and care of the elderly.  There are all sorts of uses to which the hospital could be put.</P>
    <P>I should also like to pay tribute to the trainee nursery nurses.  In the main they have another one and a half years to do to complete their course.  There is a tremendous need for nursery nurses and it is very unfair of the Minister to deal with the Order and the nurses in the way he has.  He closed the hospital and then talked about consultation.  He said that he had commenced the process of consultation with the authorities at St. Patrick's Infant Hospital, Blackrock, to give effect to the policy decisions relating to these hospitals.  It appears to be particularly undemocratic of the Minister to announce the closure of a hospital and then to enter into consulations about its closure.  If the Minister's decision is final, it appears to be worthless to engage in the sunburstry of pretence and entering into consultations when, at the end of the day, the conclusion will be that the Government decided to close the hospital and therefore it will be closed.  I am asking the Minister to take account of the alternatives, the need to protect the staff, the facility itself and the Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Government speakers and they failed to justify this Government decision.  I listened to two Ministers of State and three back benchers criticising the Minister tonight. They expressed their concern and opposition to what he was doing.  The Minister himself and his Minister of State are the only two Members who defended the action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil have presented a very worthwhile case in a very reasoned and objective way, without any bias.  As <Col N="2538" /> Deputy Andrews said, this is a political motion.  It is important to recognise that we are not playing party politics with this motion because it is not an occasion for party politics.  The welfare of patients is at risk and there are people in this House tonight whose livelihood and jobs are at risk.  I appeal to Government Deputies to consider the patients and the staff when they vote on this motion because the amendment is very clearly in favour of closing the hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Donnellan, said many people did not understand what was happening, and I certainly agree with him.  As an example of why we do not understand what is happening, I will quote an answer from the Minister for Health to a question in this House one week before the closure was announced. On 22 January on Question No. 13 the Minister was asked what financial provision he had made for the implementation of the report on the psychiatric services, <i>Planning for the Future</i>.  He said:</P>
    <P>The health boards are now developing detailed plans for their areas in accordance with the guidelines given in the report.  The present stage in planning is concerned with determining the location and types of facilities which will be required to provide a service which is essentially community based. The capital and other requirements will depend on the outcome of this planning process.</P>
    <P>That announcement was made one week before the Minister came her to make his announcement, and one day after the budget.  I am satisfied that this is the result of a decision made at a Cabinet meeting. It was a precipitous decision without any care or concern shown for patients, relatives or staff.  This is very obvious because one week after giving that answer the Minister came here and told us he was closing these hospitals &mdash; not a change of use.  The Minister showed no concern for the patients or their relatives in the catchment areas of the eight hospitals concerned, and for people throughout the country.  Now people are afraid <Col N="2539" /> because they do not know which hospital will be closed next.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Minister I will say this: he went out and defended what was a Government decision at a time when Fine Gael Members and Fine Gael councillors the length and breadth of the country were saying that a Labour Minister did this; it was not a Fine Gael decision. It was a Government decision and the amendment makes this very clear: it states that this is to give effect to policy decisions.  The Minister says he is entering into consultations but this amendment is to give effect to policy decisions, and the policy announced here by the Minister on 30 January was that these hospitals were due for closure in 1986.</P>
    <P>He reiterated that last night when he told us he was funding these hospitals for the first six months of this year.  In other words, these hospitals will have to close at the end of June 1986.  That is the Minister's decision.  He also told us last night that consultation meant there would be no change.  That is the most serious attack on democracy I have heard since I came into this House.  It is a dictatorial attitude. We have a Bill before this House in the name of the same Minister which will give him the power to close any unit or any hospital he likes without reference to anybody.  We must bear that in mind. That is another good reason why Government members should support our motion.</P>
    <P>My colleagues, in a very unbiased and balanced way, have dealt with the various hospitals, including St. Patrick's, Templehill, but there was no answer from the Minister.  He had no answer to our questions about the hospital in Killarney, not even a question of change of use.  It too is going to be closed.  Roscrea hospital, whose patients should be integrated into the community, will also be closed. The psychiatric hospitals, which are of major concern, were dealt with admirably tonight by Deputy Leyden and by a number of speakers from the catchment areas of those hospitals.</P>
    <P>No alternative arrangements have been made.  No alternative arrangements <Col N="2540" /> can be made before the end of June, and that was pointed out by Government speakers, Deputy Crotty in particular.  I ask the Minister to remember that a very important study on schizophrenia is being carried out in three hospitals in this country, two of them being St. Patrick's, Castlerea, and St. Dympna's, Carlow. This is another very good reason why the Minister should not have interfered with these hospitals.  As I said, no alternative arrangements have been made, except that 30 patients out of over 200 will be catered for in Swinford.  That is the only alternative which may come on stream in 1986.  Last night the Minister told us alternative arrangements were made in relation to Carlow, but he did not tell us what they were.  We know there are no alternative arrangements made for Carlow.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil fully support this document, <i>Psychiatric Services &mdash; Planning for the Future,</i> and Government members said they too supported it. Everything the Government are doing at present is in total conflict with that document.  On radio and television the Minister quoted two lines of that document saying that the programme should begin immediately.  Of course it should, but under the programme the first step is to set up community care facilities which are vital and necessary before discharging patients from hospitals.  There is not one word in what the Minister or his Minister of State said there to night to show they are doing anything, apart from providing 30 places in Swinford.  That is the only alternative arrangement made for 600 patients who will be thrown out of hospital before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Not only members of Fianna Fáil, Government backbenchers and the two Ministers of State who spoke here tonight, but members of the health boards, the hospital staff and many members of the public who have shown their support at meetings held throughout the country all support that document. Nobody is complaining about the closure of these hospitals in the future, in ten or 15 years when alternative facilities are provided.  If it is a question of party politics, <Col N="2541" /> why are all of these other people complaining?  This document suggests that there should be a phased programme of development over ten to 15 years, and we fully support that.  When the programme is in operation we will be prepared to close the hospitals, but we must make sure that people who have been in hospital for 15 or 20 years will remain in the same hospital for the rest of their lives.  That is recommended in the report.  Nowhere does the report say that hospitals should be closed this year.</P>
    <P>Various Government speakers support our motion and I ask them to vote for it because, as I said, the Government's amendment is very clear.  They are asking for time to negotiate with the health boards and to give effect to their policy decisions.  Their policy is to close these hospitals.  That is what the Government <Col N="2542" /> have decided and it is what their amendment states they will do.  There is no point in Members coming in here and saying they were delighted to hear the Minister say last night that he would negotiate. What he said last night was that he was funding the hospitals for six months only.</P>
    <P>I ask Members on the other side to come into the lobby with us to ensure that this vicious decision of the Government will not be implemented and to ensure that we do our duty in caring for the mentally ill and the other patients in the hospitals concerned.  It will not bring down the Government.  They can have a vote of confidence after they are defeated, but Members will be doing justice to the less privileged in our society.</P>

      <P>I want to give Deputy Foley time as well.  Before Private Members' Time, I was putting forward ways in which the Government could create jobs. I was suggesting that a special supplement be paid to men with more than four children for whom at the moment under the social welfare code it would not pay to go to work.  I was suggesting that PRSI should be levied on firms instead of on employees so that it would not be an effective payroll tax and disincentive to employ more people.  At the moment there is no facility for people on unemployment assistance to be taken on a two or three day week basis.  There would be huge administrative problems and they would be cut off unemployment assistance for the subsequent few weeks.</P>
      <P>There are not 250,000 unemployed. My understanding is that there are 26,000 farmers drawing unemployment assistance and they are not available for work. Similarly, I understand that in Cork alone there are something like 1,600 women credit signing for optical and dental benefits.  From those two examples alone there are areas where people are allegedly on the live register and part of the unemployment problem when in the case of agriculture it is an income supplement problem and a very bad way of dealing with their particular income needs through social welfare officers who often have a bias against them and assess notional incomes where no such incomes exist.  All these combine to form a major disincentive to recruiting people for work.  People will not take on staff.  They will simply get somebody to do the work on a contract basis.  In that way they do not have the fixed overheads of such employment.  Unless we redefine administratively the structure of work, there will not be a major change.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Government will act on the NESC report on designation.  It sets out very clear, succinct criteria.  It is most unfair that Roscommon, with the lowest level of unemployment, should be designated as a higher aid county and Wexford, the second highest in terms of unemployment, is not so designated.  It is patently unfair, the NESC have reported on that and I hope that the situation will be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn now to another proposal which has been very effective in creating jobs <Col N="2549" /> in the United States.  It is called the job tax credit.  If an employer takes on any extra employee, he gets a credit of $1,000 in the first year and $500 if he retains that employee for the second year.  Basically, that is a credit against any of that company's tax liabilities, whether net VAT payments, employers' PRSI, profits tax or corporation tax liability.  It is adminstratively possible at the year end to give such a credit for those who take on extra employees.  The principle has already been adopted in terms of exemption of new employees for PRSI.</P>
    <P>Two sectoral cases can be made that are irrefutable and one is tourism.  Our tourist industry has enormous potential over and above any other sector because we have an opportunity to get an increasing share of the international market. Also, this will be the largest industry by the turn of the century.  There are two levels of growth &mdash; growth that we can have within the overall breakdown of the sector nationally and growth even further in terms of the industry internationally. Furthermore, it should be remembered that it is estimated that 45p of every £ spent by a tourist, when meals, drink, accommodation and so on are taken into account, goes back to the Exchequer. This is not a business that can be done by robots.  It is labour intensive.  I very much welcome the changes made in the budget.</P>
    <P>It is almost verging on criminal that our tourism policy should be dictated by seven people in the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism with, as their head, a principal officer with the same ranking as legal metrologist in that Department.  We are giving the same priority to encouraging people to use litres and metres as we are to a £1 billion industry which is not a service industry but is wealth creating because of the overseas revenue it brings in.  I am strongly of the belief that Bord Fáilte are part of the problem here.  Even in the public service Estimates we see that the £28 million spent on tourism last year is down to £26 million this year by virtue of the fact that Bord Fáilte are a defensive, verging on paranoid, organisation that <Col N="2550" /> are self-sustaining and are not prepared to act like an IDA for industry to knock heads together in the Office of Public Works, local authorities, forest and wild life parks and many different areas and become a central arm in Government thinking that decides tax policy and expenditure policy.  Real jobs can be created there.  The changes in terms of VAT on meals and VAT rebates for tour operators must be welcomed and there was also the grant scheme last year.  We must grasp the vital and vibrant issue.</P>
    <P>The other area is construction.  We have seen a drop in the output of construction from 18 per cent of GDP to 11 per cent.  There are 60,000 people fewer working in the construction industry than seven years ago.  I do not go along with the theory that we pump money in for the sake of doing so.  The reality is that the ESB's programme is over with Moneypoint, that the accelerated development programme with Telecom is over, that we have a glut of office accommodation, that there will be 43,000 fewer pupils in our primary schools between 1984 and 1994, a drop in the primary school population of 7½ per cent.  Let us not pump in money for the sake of doing so.  We need to diversify into other areas such as much needed community facilities and country roads &mdash; these are in a desperate state in my own country, with a 32 year resurfacing cycle.</P>
    <P>We have a construction guarantee of a minimum of 12 per cent to 14 per cent expenditure.  This will be productive infrastructural expenditure that will give a long term rate of return.  It is very important that we utilise that vehicle to get instant jobs, which give a great return to the Exchequer in terms of the tax contribution.  The industry is labour intensive and will respond immediately to our job needs.  Given those areas of expenditure, I should like to outline some areas from which we can get this money. I do not feel that we can get extra tax anywhere else.  There are cuts that can be made without the painful consequences that we have seen with regard to some of the decisions made.</P>
    <P>It is appalling that for every £100 which <Col N="2551" /> the State gives out, it spends £260 to administer that expenditure.  I see no logic in it; I cannot understand it.  If we go through the Book of Estimates we see on the current side expenditure of the type I have cited in the examples I have quoted.  Take the disease eradication programme.  In 1984 the total expenditure there was £37.09 million and in 1985, £46.2 million.  The expenditure, not to vets, or farmers who lost stock, or for hardship funds, or out there in the field where it was needed, not in research, but in administration was £15 million per annum.</P>
    <P>Whether or not we cut reactor grants or do a double round of testing that fixed overhead of £15 million needs to be cut down.  SFADCo will spend £3.9 million in dealing with £6 million of grants this year.  Údarás na Gaeltachta will be spending £3.2 million to administer £6 million of grants.  I have picked those examples out of the productive sectors.  I am not against those State agencies.  I do not know the waste in the health boards or the other areas, but I am assuming that the ones I have chosen are the most efficient because they are business orientated.</P>
    <P>Eight years ago the IDA had a ratio of 3:1 of personnel who were in the field helping small businesses to get started but now it is the other way round.  It is now a ratio of 3:1 in favour of administration. The reality is that it is top heavy in administration.  The IDA have a budget of £23.5 million in their ivory tower in Wilton Place, beautiful offices, to spend £156.8 million in grants.  The position in regard to CTT is very interesting.  They spend £12.6 million to administer £11 million of grants.  Those agencies were set up to give incentives and aid and we should not let the money get fixed in administration where one cannot be flexible in terms of changes in schemes one wishes to operate.  A rigorous analysis of absenteeism, management performance and all aspects of personnel management in the public service would reveal savings and potential for redeployment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2552" /> I note that the pay bill for the Revenue Commissioners for this year will be £87 million.  That is an awful lot of wages. Sometimes I wonder if there is proper work efficiency there.  The Office of Public Works will spend £63 million on administration and this year they will not be responsible for doing any work on primary schools, a role that has gone to the primary education section of the Department of Education.  However, it appears that there was not any cutback in that Department.  The Office of Public Works are primarily there to push paper. Therefore, we have on one side this expensive bureaucracy and on the other side people having to justify their jobs by creating a problem for every solution. How many TDs hours and man days are taken up trying to unravel this bureaucracy?</P>
    <P>There is another tier where money can be raised and the Government need to bite the bullet on this.  It is something that is very important and novel in its outlook.  I am referring to our semi-State sector.  At the moment we have 19 semi-State companies such as Irish Steel, NET, INPC, Irish Life, ICC, ESB, CIE, the Sugar Company, Ceimicí Teoranta, An Post, B &amp; I, Bord Telecom and Bord na Móna.  During the summer I did a study of those companies and discovered that 18 of them were set up between 1927 and 1947.  Any company has its own business life cycle.  It has a start up stage, an expansionary stage and then it stands alone on its own commerciality.  My argument is that the losses incurred &mdash; I admit that the Government have done a great job to try to improve the balance sheet performance of these companies &mdash; have been staggering.  For example, the Irish public sector debt as of December 1984 amounted to £22.5 billion.  Semi-State bodies accounted for 18 per cent of that figure, equivalent to £4 billion.  Their accumulated losses between 1979 and 1983 were £1,036 million, an absolutely staggering loss.  I should add that that loss was just for six of the semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the balance sheets more carefully and compares them to an ordinary <Col N="2553" /> business one will see that the debt equity ratio in those companies is crazy. Usually a 1:1 ratio is good but the debt equity ratio in those companies, because of their over-dependence on borrowing, is very weak indeed.  If they were not State companies many of them would be in financial difficulties.  My belief is that if we could look at a systematic change of policy in dealing with those companies we could raise £800 million over ten years without selling a majority shareholding in any of them.  One can value a company in many ways, its net worth on a balance sheet, its net assets versus liabilities and when borrowings are repaid but I do not think that would be a fair book value. The way a company is valued on the Stock Exchange is somewhere between five and eight times its profit in the last trading year.  Using that minimum conservative value of five times the profits of the ones that did make profits, one will see that there is a potential to sell companies.</P>
    <P>The first category of companies would be Aer Rianta, Bord Gais Éireann, the ICC and Irish Life.  For those alone there would be a market to float 49 per cent. The State could retain 51 per cent but the company would then be standing alone on its own commerciality.  Even if we did not wish to do that to get the £800 million, we must remember that many of those companies will be queueing up seeking equity injections from the Government as we saw recently with ICC and ACC who made valid cases for that capital injection.  For example, Aer Lingus need to replace their trans-Atlantic and European fleets.  Why not let somebody else come up with this money?  The saving could be used by the National Development Corporation to set up a new cycle of State industries.  We should not let the existing lobbying and vested interests take any money that is going.</P>
    <P>We do not have to look to Maggie Thatcher who did partial sales of British Telecom, Britoil, Sealink, Amersham, British Rail Hotels, British Aerospace, National Freight, British Sugar and who has BP on the line shortly for further privatisation.  We can look at socialist Governments in Europe.  We can look <Col N="2554" /> at Sweden where the Government sold Luxor, PK Banken, Sodra and other companies.  In France they sold a 12 per cent subsidiary in General D-Electricite by way of public flotation.  In Italy ENI sold 20 per cent of the subsidiary, Sapiem.  My proposal is realistic.  The consequences for full privatisation would be politically unacceptable but the consequences for going along as we are cannot be afforded by the taxpayer.  However, joint venture is a realistic option.  If we take the case of Aer Lingus it is worth mentioning that KLM Airways in Holland are 55 per cent State owned and 45 per cent privately owned while Deutsche Lufthansa are 82 per cent State owned and the rest privately owned.  There is a real opportunity there to raise resources.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Department of Finance call in the ICC who have a record going back many decades of bringing companies to the market to float them to discuss this.  As the State's merchant bank, the ICC should be asked to carry out a thorough analysis of the potential of the companies I have listed, those who can go in three to five years time and those who need a little more restructuring of their balance sheet and can go in ten years time.  That is a realistic way of raising a lot of money without much hassle.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to another area that is very dear to my heart, the way we can get the productive sector working.  There were many references in the Minister's speech about getting investment into the productive sector and out of the secure financial institutions. He mentioned incentives for R and D, changing the mechanisms between investment in capital versus investment in labour.  I should like to put forward a very simple proposal which would get the layman's money into industry.  I am not talking about money from stockbrokers or complicated money but the punter's money.</P>
    <P>I propose that in conjunction with the research and development tax relief the Government should set up a small business fund in units of £500 and that this should not be linked to manufacturing.  It would be called the SDB and would work <Col N="2555" /> along the lines of the business expansion scheme.  If, for instance, you became aware of someone in Cavan who was setting up a small industry where farmhouse cheese would be made and if there was a scheme on the lines I am advocating you could buy ten of the bonds for £5,000. Normally your tax would be 48p or 58p in the £ on that £5,000 of your income but in a scheme on the lines of the business expansion scheme the Revenue Commissioners would refund that tax to you.  In other words, they would be underwriting the proportion you would have paid so that your net investment would be the amount you would have got after tax.</P>
    <P>What I am proposing is a tax led investment scheme.  This scheme could comprise a simple prepaid contract whereby one could approach the person setting up the industry and have the bond registered through the NDC or through the IDA with the money going into the company where it would be fixed for a five year period.  The Exchequer could determine that there would be a maximum of £10 million tax relief in any one year, that no one could invest more than £10,000 and that the maximum per company that could be invested would be £50,000.</P>
    <P>There are many people with lots of good ideas for setting up small simple businesses, businesses that might not set the IDA on fire, or that would not improve dramatically our balance of payments, but which would create self employment and other jobs.  We need a simple structure to respond to the investment needs of such people.  I am suggesting that the small business bond would be an ideal way of setting up that structure. I would have in mind an arrangement whereby there would be an option to convert the bond to equity after five years and the idea would be that the <i>entrepreneur</i> would put forward the proposed project with simple details of his plan, of the prospects of the market place and of his own experience of finance.  The application would be vetted by, say, the IDA and if passed the person would then go to the Revenue Commissioners and make his arrangement with them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2556" /> Unfortunately the experience with the business expansion scheme, though the scheme is very welcome, has been that there has been too much bureaucratic involvement, too much red tape in order to qualify for the tax relief.  That is why something on the lines of the US debenture would be a pragmatic and practical response to that situation and it would result in the direct creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State at the Department of Fisheries and Forestry is present, I would urge that the type of simple bond scheme I have outlined should apply also in the case of forestry. This would enable grandparents or parents to invest bonds of £500 for children. In that way the Department would be enticing the small savers's money into a long term investment but one that would appreciate because forestry involves a long waiting period in terms of a return.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to the question of the financial sector in general because there are major ramifications in this area. For instance, there are the changes in life assurance taxation, the change in section 84 lending, the change in terms of capital allowances and the changes in the area of the retention tax.  If we are to have growth in the economy we must first have the right climate and then we must ask ourselves how we can attract investment in order to prime the pump.  When we consider investment in the productive sector we find £1,000 million is required annually to maintain manufacturing output at 8 per cent to 10 per cent growth rate.  Unfortunately, the current investment rate in Irish manufacturing industry is of the order of between £600 million and £700 million, in other words, a £300 million shortage.  Therefore, this Legislature and the Government must respond to the need to attract more investment to the productive sector.</P>
    <P>We need badly to extend the 1984 business expansion scheme into the trade of tourism.  We need also in the Finance Bill to simplify the legislation and we should allow companies to buy business expansion shares.  The new development of over the counter dealing in shares on the <Col N="2557" /> Stock Exchange which is a much simpler method than applies to the equity market now is welcome, but this development should be eligible also for business expansion scheme relief.  In addition, we must realise that if we are urging people not to invest in banks or in Government gilts, we must relate that to the way we tax dividends from equity investment.  If we urge people to invest in the productive sector and if we do not get the desired response, we must ask why.  One would have to come to the conclusion quickly that because of our tax rates in the form of corporation tax and the income tax subsequently payable on dividends, there is no incentive for investment in the productive sector.</P>
    <P>In Ireland corporation profit tax varies from between 8 per cent to 50 per cent so that in manufacturing industry 64 per cent of dividend income is payable by way of the combination of corporation tax and income tax.  In non manufacturing industry 71p is payable in every £ by way of taxation.  That is a real disincentive to investment in that sector.  If the Government are saying we must alter the tax bias and must alter the investment bias in order to create jobs, to improve growth output and to improve our exports, they must amend this area.  A very logical step forward in this direction would be to follow the Canadian example whereby the first $1,000 of dividend income is tax free.  We should allow a similar tax credit for both manufacturing and non manufacturing industry.  All the arguments point clearly to the fact that advance corporation tax with its small yield of £5 million has not been a way of screwing money out of wealthy companies but has been effectively a disincentive to people to invest in companies.</P>
    <P>In the light of the effort in this budget to tackle the financial institutions, we should go a step further and provide incentives for people to invest in manufacturing industry in a way that would yield real income.  To that extent I urge that the Canadian concept be examined and that we reconsider the matter of advance corporation tax.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal now with an area that is very close to my heart, that is agriculture. <Col N="2558" /> This industry is experiencing a very difficult period.  This is because Europe is self sufficient in food and because there are surpluses in many areas.  Regardless of what Joe Rea or anyone else may say about the Government, the fact remains that the CAP is falling apart and that is the root of the evil.  However, farmers should take solace from the fact that at least they do not have to contend with high inflation of the kind that would put them in the cost price squeeze they were in when Fianna Fáil were in office.</P>
    <P>We need to consider some of the sectoral problems in agriculture.  In particular we need a proper marketing authority. Bord Bainne have done a good job in the marketing of milk but in the areas of horticulture, of beef and of sheepmeat, our efforts have been fruitless.  I understand that the stamp duty exemption available for family farm transfers is not available where people avail of the installation premium within the farm modernisation scheme.  I trust that arrangement can be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>I would like to make two points in relation to agriculture.  I should like to note the change in the land tax.  I predicted it would happen, but unless there is self-assessment there will not be results until the turn of the century.  Farmers know what their adjusted acreage is and if they want to get that scheme going let them adjust their acreages.  If they are above or below it they can be refunded or pay back tax.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to capital allowance restrictions.  Section 26 of the 1974 Finance Act put a 30 per cent restriction on capital allowances.  That is unfair and is having a negative effect.  In manufacturing industry there is 100 per cent capital allowance.  Under section 26 one can write off only 30 per cent of capital expenditure and it is hitting the agricultural machinery industry and the construction industry particularly.  At a cost of only £2 million we would have a worthwhile step forward if we removed that restriction.  I assure the Government of my full support in their resistance to the proposals on the CAP.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to a very important <Col N="2559" /> area in which I do not think my party in Government are getting their way.  That is in relation to offshore oil exploration, quite a complex matter.  Offshore exploration is in a very formative stage in Ireland and I should like in simple terms to explain the dilemma of oil explorers as to why the third round was so unsuccessful and exactly what needs to be done.  It does not mean less of a State take in oil wells.  Basically, it means a slight modification to ensure that we will get drilling.</P>
    <P>There are two potential drillings off the coast in my constituency and I suggest that we must grasp this opportunity.  I hope, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that you will listen to this point and convey it to your party leader.  At the moment, if you and I are oil explorers and we want to drill off the coast, we must first take the value of a barrel of oil.  At the moment it is $20.  The State's royalty on that would be 10 per cent, two dollars out of the 20 dollars.  The operating costs &mdash; putting up the drill, paying the employees, and all the day-to-day expenses &mdash; would be five dollars out of the 20.  The depreciation on big equipment would be six dollars. That leaves seven dollars out of the 20 per barrel.</P>
    <P>The 1975 White Paper produced by the then Deputy Keating, as Minister, provides that the State may at its own discretion take 50 per cent participation. If the State took 50 per cent participation, of the seven dollars left out of the 20, you are left with 3.50 dollars.  Out of that you have to pay 50 per cent profits tax, leaving you with 1.75 dollars out of the 20p.  In those circumstances the State would take 80.6 per cent and the licensees 19.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>If we looked at it differently and the State taxed the licensee to the hilt but did not take a stake in the well, instead of 1.75 dollars being left after paying all taxes, the licensee would be left with 3.50, the State getting 5.50 dollars out of the 20 dollars.  Then the State take would be 61.1 per cent and the licensee would get 38.8 per cent.</P>
    <P>Under the White Paper, the Minister would have discretion.  Therefore, if oil <Col N="2560" /> companies find a field that has 75 million barrels, the minimum for commercial drilling, the licensees would be quite happy if they were to get some clarification as to whether the Government would opt for a 50 per cent participation.  If the potential reserve is 200 million barrels the licensees would be quite happy to let the State in.  I am suggesting that the Minister would turn around and opt for a sliding scale.  The oil people just want the rules defined and clarified.  They do not want the State to write off a national public asset.</P>
    <P>We could compare the current position in Ireland and in the UK.  At the moment, if we found a field of 50 million barrels, the development cost would be 400 million dollars.  The State participation would be 50 per cent, tax would be 21 per cent and royalties would be 6.5 per cent.  That is in Ireland.  In the UK, the same field at the moment would allow the licensees to get 65 per cent.  Would any offshore oil explorer in his right mind opt for exploration off Ireland when he can get that kind of arrangement in England? If we look at a larger field in Ireland, of 200 million barrels, with development costs at one million dollars, the licensee would be left with 21.2 per cent, but in the UK would be left with 40.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>My point is very simple.  Here, the licensees are left with 21 per cent whether the field is 50 million barrels or 200 million barrels.  The economics of the comparable oil fields are completely different.  If there is a lot of gravy going around it is in the licensees' interest that the State would give the maximum so that they could get on with the job.</P>
    <P>The people's interests are served not only by the tax revenue but by the pocket of oil revenues.  The important thing is that it would improve our balance of trade beyond all imagination and put us in a very healthy surplus position <i>vis-àvis</i> our current £300 million deficit.</P>
    <P>I beseech you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to use your good offices with the Tánaiste to say this is not an issue of giving the explorers a bonanza, not a case of the State saying we will write off a <Col N="2561" /> public asset.  What we want is to lay down clear guidelines.  At the moment it is at the discretion of the Minister, and businessment do not go into an open-ended situation, because it would be bad business. The fact that we are not getting oil ashore is bad for the country.  I do not think the Department of Energy have served the interests of my constituents well in this regard.  I hope the review now taking place will prove to be fruitful.</P>
    <P>The bottom line of this budget table is that we are providing £8 billion for current expenditure.  We cannot do anything about 20 per cent of that because it is debt re-payments.  Fifty-five per cent of it is for basic social services, health, social welfare, housing and so on.  We cannot cut there.  Deputy Woods and other Fianna Fáil spokesmen called for cuts in taxes and for increased expenditure. They did not look at the last page of the budget table.  They would see that we are spending only 8 per cent of total current expenditure on the productive sectors of the economy.  That is the dilemma which must be overcome.  It is a scandal, for instance, that we spend £250 in administration costs to give out £100 in grants. That does not make sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the budget.  I cannot recall on occasion on which a budget could be so clearly identified as a direct outcome of a political situation; nor has there been any occasion when such detailed political background has been known to the general public.  It was obvious that the budget was decided on the basis of a political compromise formula rather than on the basis of what the economy required.  The political battle began around the Cabinet table with regard to cuts in current expenditure and raged through an unending series of Government meetings until it became clear that nothing could be agreed.  This is why we have a budget without a strategy and without financial objectives.  It is a political compromise which does not respond to the needs of our economy.  Action could not be taken to deal with our economic problem because we have a divided Coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2562" /> Nineteen eighty five was one of the most disastrous years in the history of the State.  Unemployment stands at 240,000, investment has fallen, the building and construction industry is at a standstill and consumer spending has also declined. The endless procession of factory closures has seriously undermined our industrial base.  To some extent this development resulted from the worldwide recession but that recession was greatly assisted by the mistaken policies pursued by this Government in their 1985 budget.  The Government policies inflicted widespread hardship, which has persisted in the community.  The policies have been particularly severe on social welfare recipients and on lower income families.  Middle income families were affected for the first time.  These families were faced at every turn with increased taxes, higher prices and many local taxes, such as water and refuse collection charges and so on.  There was an attack on living standards so that for all but the small privileged sections of the community the struggle to make ends meet became a grim everyday reality.  All the unemployment and hardship was endured for nothing.  The whole book-keeping exercise turned out to be one of the greatest mistakes in our economic history.</P>
    <P>The targets set out in <i>Building on Reality</i> were not met and have now been abandoned.  The national debt has increased out of all proportion.  The damage done to the economy by the strategy pursued in the 1985 budget has been clearly expressed in this present budget. The unemployment figure of 240,000 dominates this budget.  In his Budget Statement last year the Minister for Finance said that unemployment, taking account of the impact of special employment measures should begin to level out and that given moderation in pay developments there should be some pick up in employment.  At that time the figure stood at roughly 225,000 unemployed. The position has since worsened.  We must face the situation, for instance by setting up an all-party committee to formulate a new strategy to set the country back on the road to economic recovery.</P>
    <P>Because of the numbers of business <Col N="2563" /> closures, their impact on employment has been disastrous.  We need a complete review of the present system with a view to formulating a programme of action to help firms which could be helped in order to keep them open.  If we had a committee to investigate the various companies from time to time they could earmark companies getting into difficulties with a view to implementing an early warning system.  When Fianna Fáil were in Government there was an early warning system to assist and advise firms heading for trouble.  If the Government adopted this principle it would eliminate unexpected closures in many cases, it would help industrial relations and help to reduce the massive unemployment figures.</P>
    <P>A feature of this budget was the introduction of the withholding tax of 35 per cent which applies to interest paid on deposits in banks and in financial institutions. This is not a new tax on the banks but a direct tax at source on the general public who have already paid tax on their investments.  This is an unreasonable proposition as it only means bringing forward revenue in the form of income tax that would normally be paid in the following year.  We saw the result of this decision, since the budget, in increasing bank and building society interest rates.  A feature of this tax is that it will affect children with investments and many old people with savings.  Most old age pensioners, from July next, will have in the region of £5,000 a year for a husband and wife and a tax allowance in the region of £6,300 which means that they would have a surplus allowance of £1,300 which should not be liable for tax.  The Government should set a ceiling on such deposits without delay as many of the people concerned, especially the weaker sections are worried about it.  I hope for an amendment shortly in this area.</P>
    <P>A disturbing feature of the budget is that the VHI board will in future be compelled to disclose personal financial information about patients and doctors.  The VHI provide an excellent health service and the basis of their success was the <Col N="2564" /> confidential basis on which they operated.  The VHI board will now have to disclose the private medical history of a patient to the Revenue Commissioners on request.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced a new child benefit scheme to replace children's allowances but this does not represent an improvement because the weaker sections of the community are again hit as the 4 per cent increase does not extend to child dependents.  The £100 child tax allowance has been abolished; the increase of 4 per cent is an insult as it will not be paid until the third week in July. It is a 2 per cent increase over a period of 12 months.  A reduction in food subsidies is contemplated in April which will mean a further increase in the cost of living.  Overall, the weaker section of the community deserve better.</P>
    <P>VAT on new houses has been increased from 3 per cent to 10 per cent since 1982 and private house building has dropped.  Employment in the construction industry has reached an all time low. Fianna Fáil have given a commitment that, on return to office, they will invest an additional £200 million in the building and construction industry to get it moving and the building industry have responded by giving a guarantee that they will create thousands of jobs within a very short period.  This would take many workers off the dole queues.</P>
    <P>Roads throughout the country are falling apart through lack of finance.  Many local authorities have appealed to the Government for extra funds, even for remedial work.  Bad roads are a serious drawback in all counties but particularly in tourist areas such as Kerry.  Tourism, which has the greatest growth potential for job creation, has not received the attention it deserves in the budget by way of funding which would encourage many hoteliers to carry out worthwhile refurbishing and raise standards.  There was a further setback in the last few days by the announcement that the Cork-Kerry region will not have a ferry link this year. That is very unfortunate because it affects the whole economy, not just that of Cork and Kerry.  I hope that the Government <Col N="2565" /> will try to secure a ferry service next year. Tourism is the only industry which has been penalised in every possible way. There are special concessions for export manufacturing by way of favourable income tax rates.  Exports are exempted from VAT yet exporters are subjected to high labour costs and PRSI.  I welcome the Minister's decision to reduce VAT on meals as from 1 July.</P>
    <P>Due to ever increasing overheads, including taxes, the tourist business was forced to economise and to cut back where possible and one of the areas in which there were cutbacks was in staffing which is one of the reasons for the problems in tourism not being highlighted. There were many closures and those who did not close were forced to reduce their staff.  It is obvious that some of these cutbacks have meant a reduced service to visitors which will have a damaging effect on customer satisfaction in the long term and on the public relations element in tourism which is a major factor in encouraging repeat business.</P>
    <P>Since the budget, the Minister for Health announced that he intended to close some psychiatric hospitals.  He went on to say that this would cause less emphasis on the 24-hour service and that he intends to replace it by day centres and out-patient therapy.  The Minister for Education announced the closure of that fine institution, Carysfort College.  I welcome the news that it will remain open for the next two years and I hope that the position will be reconsidered at the end of that time.  The Government's idea of public spending is not accepted by the public, even by those who support them.</P>
    <P>There has been a 2 per cent increase in the standard rate of VAT and this is an indication of an anti-family budget because all household items will be affected.  I was disappointed that VAT on hurleys was not reduced as strong representations had been made in this regard over the last few years.  Hurling is a traditional Irish game which is played throughout the country and the cost of hurleys is a tremendous strain on clubs, <Col N="2566" /> schools and parents.  I appeal for a reduction in the VAT rate from 25 per cent to 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The budget has failed to tackle the problems facing the country, especially unemployment.  I should like to see an all-party committee set up to carry out an in-depth study and to bring forward positive proposals which would set a programme in train to reduce the massive unemployment figures and, in so doing, guide us to economic recovery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity of making a few observations on the budget.  I should like to make a number of suggestions which I hope, with respect, the Minister for Finance will adopt.  The budget should be marked down as a serious attempt by the Government, in very difficult economic circumstances, to begin the process of rolling back the burden of personal taxation.  We are all in favour of reducing personal taxation but we are not clear as to who should make up the shortfall.  In that context, the Government have made a courageous start.  I do not have the slightest doubt that the burden of personal taxation is a major inhibiting factor for commercial and personal initiative and I hope we will move quickly towards a simple taxation model.  My personal preference is for a system with self assessment built into it but with the rider, which does not operate at present, of extremely severe sanctions for fraud or evasion.  The best system should be self-regulatory and should ensure that the community respond naturally and spontaneously to the propriety and integrity of the system because we know that if we fall foul of it that there will be severe consequences. The underlying reality of tax evasion and fraud at present is that it enables people to evade and avoid one's legitimate liabilities. There is an artificiality about that taxation environment because a figure of £600 million to £700 million is floated as that which is owed by the self-employed which is made up of assessments based on largely spurious grounds, 95 per cent of which are under appeal at any given <Col N="2567" /> time and the net yield of which is precisely one-three hundredth of the accumulative assessments made.  It is not simply a question of logistical inexactitude on a massive scale; it is an inherent structural weakness in our tax collection system.  I do not see any reason for it.  One inducement for continuing evasion, avoidance and non-compliance with the tax laws is that it is a positive economic advantage so to do.  Therefore, it was with mixed feelings that I witnessed the tax amnesty in the budget because obviously it meant that some people had again got away with it.</P>
      <P>The sooner we move towards a comprehensive but simple tax system the better, preferably with self-assessment, trusting in the integrity of the Irish people, their ability to respond to a fair system, and insisting that those who fall foul of that system will fall foul of severe punitive sanctions, not just of a monetary nature but of a more serious nature. There are models in existence for such a tax system.  Rather than tinkering around with our tax system, as we are prone to do, we should take a look at these models.  We have to more than consider the work of the Commission on Income Taxation.  The time has come for many of their recommendations to be taken on board.</P>
      <P>There was an echo in the debate surrounding the budget which disturbed me a little.  Some speakers referred to moving the burden of taxation from the individual to the financial institutions. That is a handy belief and appeals to an instinct in many of us, particularly many of us representing urban working class constituencies, but on examination in detail we will find there is an inherent fallacy underlying that belief.  We must feel apprehensive about some of the concerns expressed, particularly when they appear to take some glee from what was alleged to be an attack on the financial institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial services industry in Ireland is highly labour intensive employing 45,000 people, a substantial number more than are employed in the microtechnological <Col N="2568" /> industry which is often praised.  The financial services industry has a potential for further development provided it is encouraged to operate in a climate which is not hostile to the development of that industry.  Not only is it a highly labour intensive industry, but it generates high added value and employs high level skills which are important, not just domestically but internationally in terms of trading services and international commerce.  In short, it is an internationally traded industry which generates foreign earnings.  It is important that nothing in the budget should be open to the interpretation that we are attacking financial institutions, as if there were some ideological advantage to be gained from that.  Instead, we should seek to develop internationally traded services as part of the mainstream industrial development strategy of this small island economy.</P>
    <P>I would remind the people who heralded this initiative that the 35 per cent withholding tax on deposit interest payments and the 15 per cent tax on the gross investment income of insurance companies essentially represent a tax on individuals. In a sense the financial institutions are, for this purpose at least, somewhat sieve-like and no corporate body blow is being suffered by anybody because the taxes ultimately are a tax on individuals.  How could a tax on insurance companies, which are made up of investors large and small, policyholders and so on, be deemed to be a major step forward &mdash; although I personally would not take that view?  I do not believe either of these taxes could be described as a tax on financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The third element of taxation attributed to financial institutions is the continuation of the bank levy.  The Central Bank of Ireland, the public authority directly responsible for the regulation of banks, have described the bank levy as &ldquo;unjustifiably inequitable&rdquo;.  The Central Bank of Ireland also stated that bank profits are not excessive.  Leaving aside the last point which is open to argument, even the expression &ldquo;excessive profits&rdquo;, could lead us into a philosophical argument <Col N="2569" /> which I do not intend to go into, there seems to be a hint of inequity latent in a tax which is levied annually without regard to the capacity of that sector to handle that levy or perhaps to handle more substantial tax yields.  If bank levies are to be maintained as part of the tax gathering framework, I suggest they should be rationalised and pinned to sensible criteria relating to the ability of that banking sector to pay the taxes and relating to criteria based on common sense, logic and economic underpinning rather than a fairly arbitrary approach which appears to be the trend at present.</P>
    <P>The budget emphasises the importance of investment in industry, in people and in infrastructure, cost competitiveness in relation to public sector services used by industry and control of Government expenditure.  All these things are implicit in the budget to some degree or other but any budget, particularly a fourth budget, has to be seen in that four to five year context.  It would be less than rational to expect some form of radical new approach in a budget four years into Government.  In that context, significant steps were taken in this budget to deal with these areas &mdash; incentives to industry and personal taxation.  We are all in favour of a higher level of investment in productive projects and we know this is essential in order to create more jobs and improve living standards, but what we are not clear about is who is going to pay for all this.</P>
    <P>Our overriding concern continues to be the difficulty relating to our collective incapacity to roll back public expenditure. The huge appetite of public expenditure continues to grow apace.  Despite the concern of everybody in this House and many people outside, I am not sure that there is the necessary capacity to do something about this.  This is a huge problem and I echo to some extent what Deputy Foley said when he spoke about some kind of united approach by this House.  We should lay aside the spears and arrows not of outrageous fortune but of political party politics and face up honestly to this incredible economic <Col N="2570" /> problem.  This will take some extremely courageous Government and leadership.</P>
    <P>In that context I want to tell the Government that they should not lose their nerve in following through on a job which the country knows intuitively has to be done.  I hope they will continue to press forward in this area, changing methods, if necessary, relating to the degree to which people are involved or consulted.  Perhaps we should take the people more into our confidence.  I would argue that we have not adequately informed or involved the public and presented to them the limited number of options which are available.  There is a belief among the public that there are tough options and easy options.  There are no easy options and that message has not got home.  The belief which goes right to the top of the business community that there are easy options is a major underlying factor in the popular success of the latest political party.  There is a belief that there is a crock of gold at the end of the rainbow and that harsh measures are not necessary.</P>
    <P>In our democracy I do not believe the problem can be tackled by edict.  It will require the collective wisdom, courage, support and co-operation of society.  If we want the man in the street to support us in our efforts we must come clean with him, present him with the evidence, show him the available options and ask him to some extent to point out the choice.  It cannot be done by a group of people, well intentioned though they may be, operating in isolation from the people, arguing rationally and logically but without involving and informing them sufficiently.</P>
    <P>I am struck by the fact that one still gets incredibly naive arguments from people in the professional organisations, people who should know better.  In the debates at the moment on education and industrial development the one common feature is that everyone has the hand out for more.  That is not unreasonable but I think that approach would be tempered if we engaged in a process of national dialogue.  I should like to see the publication of a document called &ldquo;The National <Col N="2571" /> Options&rdquo; that would have as a basis for discussion, not just in this House but among groupings at every level, the topic of where this country will go in the next ten or 20 years.  It is in our hands to make those decisions.  The only way we can succeed is to go to the people and to ask them for their active support and co-operation. We must also speak to the commentators; I am talking in particular of the popular commentators who are sometimes somewhat glib about these matters.  If we take that action we have a chance.</P>
    <P>The budget has to be seen in the context of our national output which continues to be massively managed by the State, where our borrowing requirement is still extraordinarily high, where the room for manoeuvre and discretion is limited and where the public sector wage bill and pension liability absorb an incredible amount of our resources.  Yet, this Government found it possible to make some degree of improvement and progress in these areas and that must be commended.</P>
    <P>It is in the area of real economy rather than in the area of money illusion that progress has to be made.  Jobs and living standards are earned through the high added value output of manufactured goods and services.  Living standards for individuals depend on purchasing power for those goods and services.  In the final analysis, jobs and living standards depend entirely on the real output of the economy which is achieved by enterprise in the private and public sectors and in the manufacturing and service industries. All the rest of us live off that output.  It is the output of the country, the wealth generated, that sustains all of us.  If that output is not able to compete with out neighbours and in the international marketplace we will suffer.</P>
    <P>Any budget must be judged to some extent on the basis of what it has contributed to the climate for growth of the real economy; in other words, what it has contributed to the creation of jobs and living standards as a result of improving <Col N="2572" /> the climate for productive enterprise. This enterprise is latent in every individual. We must encourage it at every opportunity, turning our backs on the automatic response of many people, including young people, to rely more and more on somebody else.  Every person has a talent and ability and it is the job of the State to create the environment in which that can flourish.</P>
    <P>By dint of happy international circumstances relating to international oil prices, we have an added opportunity to go one better in the area of dealing with public expenditure.  One of the most important economic factors from the viewpoint of industry is to keep the rate of inflation as low as possible relative to that in our international competitor countries.  It should go on the record that in the past three years this Government has managed to reduce inflation to a level which many of us did not think was possible. The rate of inflation here is at the lowest level for many years but this must be looked at in the context of what is happening in our competitor countries.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of 1986 the calculations made in the EC forecast an average inflation rate of 3.9 per cent.  In recent weeks that forecast has been revised downwards because of the significant fall in oil prices.  The fall in oil prices within the EC, if the price level is to remain at about $18 per barrel for the remainder of this year, will reduce the average inflation level by 1.5 per cent to about 2.5 per cent.  The price is now $16 and still falling. If an average inflation of 2.5 per cent or even less is achieved within the EC, this will have extremely serious implications for Irish cost competitiveness in view of the projection of the Minister for Finance in his budget speech that our inflation rate will be about 4.5 per cent for this year.</P>
    <P>Circumstances have changed significantly since the Estimates for the Public Service were published last December. These Estimates were based on a 5 per cent increase in current public expenditure during 1986 over 1985.  It is reasonable for us to exhort the Government to revise the public expenditure Estimates <Col N="2573" /> in the light of the current projection of 2.5 per cent inflation or less on average within the EC.  Otherwise there will be a further significant re-allocation of real resources from the productive base of the economy to the Exchequer.  What might appear at first to be an economic victory in terms of a record low inflation rate might well turn out to be a Pyrrhic victory simply because the goalposts have been moved within the EC.  Therefore, this affords us an opportunity to look again at the public expenditure Estimates.  One of our major underlying problems is the extraordinary demand placed on the Exchequer by public expenditure.</P>
    <P>In the budget we should welcome a certain number of specific elements aimed directly at stimulating the level of investment in industry.  For example, there has been a reduction in the rate for long term capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 35 per cent.  This is a positive initiative that will help to create economic activity.  There is also the statement by the Minister that the taxation of dividends will be changed so as to allow the benefit of the 10 per cent corporation tax to flow through to the shareholder. Again, this is a sensible move to encourage initiative and investment.  There are also the tax incentives for investment in research and development partnerships. In that context I urge that special measures be taken in the area of marketing. Investment in marketing is extraordinarily productive in terms of real jobs. We are quite deficient in marketing our goods and services.</P>
    <P>There may be some inequity, and perhaps the Minister would deal with it in the Finance Bill, in relation to the advance corporation tax, specifically relating to a number of small indigenous Irish companies. They invested significantly in the past and will not have a net corporation tax liability for some years because of the accumulation of allowances to cover the <i>bonafide</i> business cost of amortising their capital investment.  These companies are subjected to a retrospective tax which they could not possibly have been expected to foresee when preparing the cash flow projections for the investments. <Col N="2574" /> There may be a case for introducing a transitional period for advance corporation tax which would effectively mean that the ACT would not operate until all capital allowances outstanding as at the date of introduction of the principle of ACT are fully utilised.  This is not an unreasonable request for companies who have embarked on certain financial structuring in the light of what they had reasonably expected to be the climate likely to obtain.  I know that some areas of industry are a little unhappy about the changes in the rules of capital allowances and the special 12 per cent duty on section 84 loan interest, about reductions in the funds available to the IDA and CTT and changes in relation to leasing.</P>
    <P>If progress is to be made in dealing with the economic problems facing us, it should not be judged on the basis of who shouts loudest.  Whenever any of the semi-State organisations are touched directly or by implication, there is an automatic defence mechanism designed to convince all of us, often by very high powered professional public relations methods, that this or that semi-State body or agency is indispensable, although there is unquestionably a substantial degree of waste, overlapping, duplication and unnecessary expenditure of public moneys involved.  There is need for rationalisation of dozens of semi-State bodies, many of them doing duplicatory work.  I am not sure how that will be dealt with.  It is relatively easy to bring a new semi-State body into being but almost impossible to apply even the most humane of humane killers.  Somewhere along the line that nettle will have to be grasped.  I have never yet met anyone working in any area of the public sector who would admit openly that a programme which was commenced was no longer relevant or necessary or that an agency which had been set up for a specific purpose was no longer relevant. I would urge the Government to apply the kind of rigours which were applied in Britain when a type of internal scrutiny was introduced into agencies and companies which forced people to answer questions about the relevance of the job <Col N="2575" /> they were doing.  The taxpayer is burdened by an increasing clamour of demands for money for agencies and semi-State bodies, the relevance of which is open to question in some cases and the need for which should be examined.  I have not the slightest doubt that there is massive room for rationalisation and that some of them at least should go.</P>
    <P>The budget began the process of rolling back personal taxation.  That was the main positive feature from the point of view of the ordinary man.  The very high rates of personal taxation, particularly the high marginal rates, have always been a disincentive and have given rise to a brain drain of highly skilled internationally mobile personnel and a massive disincentive to the ordinary person to work or to work overtime on occasions.  I welcome the reduction in the highest rate of income tax from 60 per cent to 58 per cent and also the removal of the income levy.  We should also express our pleasure that the indexation of tax bands is continuing. We all hope that move can be continued but there is no point in simplistically making demands if we are not willing to accept that a shortfall in the area of personal taxation must be made up somewhere else.</P>
    <P>Regarding the public capital programme, the Minister might speak of the implications of the budget for this programme.  The argument might be that certain viable capital programmes are being postponed.  I wonder what the <i>rationale</i> is.  For example, the allocation for new road construction which was projected in <i>Building On Reality</i> to amount to £140 million in 1986 has now been reduced to £130 million in the public capital programme.  I do not see any social justification for that and I am not clear what the economic justification is.  It may simply be that the money is not there. There is a common view that investment in this area would be extremely productive in a number of respects and that there are a significant number of viable road projects which would not only benefit the economy but could also attract low interest loans from the European <Col N="2576" /> Investment Bank, grants from the European Regional Development Fund and grants from the EC Transport Infrastructure Fund.</P>
    <P>Unemployment in the construction industry is currently about 45,000 persons and many of these have skills of a civil engineering nature which are required for new road construction.  All of the materials which would be used for new road construction are available within Ireland and the plant which would be used is already in the ownership of Irish contractors.  The fact that there would be little or no import content in relation to new road construction and the fact that there would be money available in many cases from the EC makes it difficult to understand why viable projects which in some cases are already planned must be postponed.  It is possible there is some dimension to this discussion with which I am not familiar.  I am clear that the Government have committed themselves for the first time in the history of the State to medium term planning in relation to investment in capital projects in the context of <i>Building on Reality.</i></P>
    <P>The second area of capital development which could successfully utilise a higher level of investment is the national gas grid.  The Government announced the extension of the national gas grid to Limerick and Waterford and this work should be completed in 1986.  Many of us feel that there is potential for expanding the grid to other towns such as Drogheda and Dundalk.  I gather that money has already been allocated by the EC for this latter project.  The public capital programme is an area which must be looked at carefully in terms of its potential yield for the economy.  It is obvious that it will be necessary to invest considerable amounts annually to cater for business expansion in the area of telecommunications. However, the public capital programme has reduced investment in telecommunications from an outturn of £148 million in 1985 to a projection of £128 million in 1986.  That reduction may be because of some essential once-off investment which Bord Telecom would have to pursue in their initial <Col N="2577" /> work on infrastructure and cabling.  I trust that is what is concerned because otherwise it would be difficult to understand such a reduction.  Investment in telecommunications should be commercially self-financing.</P>
    <P>The degree to which Ireland must catch up on other member states of the EC in the field of telecommunications is obvious from the statistics given in the IPA Yearbook and Diary 1986 which show that Ireland has 235 telephones per 1,000 population in contrast to Greece which has 336, Spain with 345, and the United Kingdom with 524.  It is fair to put on record that incredibly large strides have been taken in the past decade and hundreds of millions have been invested, initially by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and latterly by Bord Telecom. It is an area where investment appears to yield a high return and to be self-financing.</P>
    <P>The area of waste disposal is another which deserves a major capital investment programme in order to provide infrastructure essential for some types of industrial development.  The public capital programme in 1985 allocated £1.25 million for this purpose but only £335,000 was actually used.  The allocation for 1986, therefore, is £205,000, which is not all that startling in the light of the expenditure last year.  This area of essential infrastructural development has to a large extent been ignored in the past as is evidenced even from the recent discussions in the Dublin County Council area relating to the disposal of asbestos.</P>
    <P>Further areas which merit consideration in terms of public capital are sanitary services and housing.  In the case of housing I urge that the Government look far more closely at the contribution which can be made by joint venture and share equity housing and essentially by reexamining the massive public contribution which now goes into housing and seeing whether we can get better productivity and greater yield from it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ned O'Keeffe has sought and been given permission to raise on the Adjournment of the House the failure of the Minister for Health to provide funds for a building to house the radiotherapy unit at Cork Regional Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to thank you, Sir, for making time available to me and also to apologise if I inconvenienced you in any way over the last few days when I was looking for this permission and you found it difficult to get to me to allow me to speak on such a very important subject.  With your permission, I have agreed to divide my time with my colleague from Cork, Deputy Denis Lyons, and our spokesman on Health who is a medical doctor and very much aware of the problem identified with the subject I am speaking about, Deputy Mac Carthy.</P>
      <P>Cork Regional Hospital is one of the most modern in western Europe.  It has been in operation since 1978 and in that time it has given the city and county of Cork an excellent service, with first class nursing staff and medical profession all doing their best for the care, well-being and health of the people in the area.  It is a 500-600 bed hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A hospital today, no matter how modern it is from the structural point of view, is of very little use if it has not got modern equipment, and that is one of the problems that the hospital service in this country faces today.  No matter what type of equipment we have, it has an age span of only five to six years after which it is out of date and requires updating or further equipment, even if it is only the motor car we drive that takes us to our work.  I want to speak about the radiotherapy unit at the hospital.  People have gone out of their way to give large subscriptions voluntarily for the purchase of this much needed equipment, and the problem has arisen because there is no building or facility to house or take care <Col N="2579" /> of that new equipment.  As well as that, one or two staff are required.  My information is that the Minister for Health has not given the necessary permission.  Also some small amount of funding is required and that has not come forward.</P>
    <P>I understand further, that this whole problem started about 1982 and has continued up to now with no action being taken.  An amount of £300,000 is lying in the bank or somewhere.  I understand that it has been subscribed voluntarily. Going over some old ground, I say that it should be free of VAT.  Anything done voluntarily in the care of people's health should have the incentive of being VAT free.</P>
    <P>About 1,200 new patients suffering from cancer are admitted to that hospital each year over and above people who were there previously who may have to come back for further treatment.  Six to eight of those patients have to be flown to London to get specialist treatment which could be available here if this equipment was installed or erected in the hospital. Those patients cost £8,000-£10,000. Therefore, it is costing about £80,000 per annum to take that number of patients to a London specialist hospital for the type of treatment we are looking for.  We are all aware that cancer is a dreaded disease which needs urgent treatment.  We cannot neglect it.  We must have our priorities right.  Cancer hits many a family and very few families are exempt from the experience of a member suffering from that ailment.  I do not want to be alarmist because I understand the anguish people feel when a member of their family is looking for that type of treatment with often only a short period left before that person goes to meet his God.</P>
    <P>The source of the funding has dried up recently.  Many more pounds could be added to what is already there if the Minister would provide some incentive. The people who subscribed the moneys and the voluntary committee gave of their best but they have become annoyed and soured and they have failed to continue. All they have kept going is an <i>ad hoc</i> committee to monitor the situation. <Col N="2580" /> Now the existing unit is out of action for repairs even though it is old.  It has been there since 1968.  It is the old treatment unit that was in St. Finbar's Hospital and was brought to the regional hospital when that was built in 1968.  This is 1986, so we realise the age of the treatment unit which needs repair and updating.  It is now out of action and 40 or more patients this week will not get treatment which they may need urgently.  That puts those patients back another week.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of any Government or Opposition must be to save life and to reduce suffering and pain substantially. We have the power to do that in this House by making this contribution to the Cork Regional Hospital which is servicing one of the largest areas in the country outside Dublin.  For that reason I am making a personal appeal on behalf of my constituents and the people of Cork county and city.  I ask the Minister to come to our aid and give us the modern equipment that is necessary for the health care in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for affording me the opportunity to contribute to this Adjournment debate which I sought yesterday by the three means available to me, Private Notice Question, on the Order of Business and Adjournment Debate.  Regrettable thought it is, the collapse and dismantling of the cobalt unit in the regional hospital in the past week has probably encouraged the Ceann Comhairle to acknowledge, by allowing this question on the Adjournment, the urgency of the matter not alone of that cobalt unit but of asking the Minister, as he has been asked over the years, to provide a building for more modern equipment, the money for which has been collected voluntarily to the amount of £300,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to relate, blow by blow, this sorry saga of this whole affair and relate the stubbornness of the Department and the Minister on this matter in the regional hospital.  The cobalt unit that I have spoken of was transferred in 1979 from St. Finbarr's to the regional hospital and in the same year <Col N="2581" /> an equipping meeting &mdash; what a lovely term &mdash; was arranged between the Department officials and the Southern Health Board.  In May 1980 a request was made to the Southern Health Board to seek from the Department the necessary simulator that was required in the fight against this dread disease of cancer.  That request in turn was made by the Southern Health Board to the Department.  In July 1980 St. Luke's Hospital requested and were granted in principle modern equipment. They raised £100,000 for this equipment by voluntary subscriptions, and I put a conservative estimate that £50,000 of that came from the Munster area.</P>
    <P>We move on because time is limited. In October-November 1982 a sub-committee were formed by the Department to examine the future of radiotherapy in this country.  In January 1983 the Minister opened the simulator at St. Luke's, to which I have referred, and promised them there and then a further £400,000. Meanwhile the Southern Health Board still awaited a reply.  Dr. Hurley then suggested to that board that a public subscription be launched to provide money for this equipment.  Out of that was born the organisation known as ACT &mdash; Aid Cancer Treatment &mdash; of which I am a patron.</P>
    <P>In June 1983 the Minister met representatives of ACT of the regional hospital who indicated what was required, what progress had been made and what the programme was to be.  In October 1984 a request was made to the Minister for £40,000 to erect a building to house the simulator for which £300,000 had by then been collected by the voluntary committee.  There was still no reply from the Department or the Minister.  At that stage Deputies from Cork and Kerry were enlisted for their support.</P>
    <P>In January 1985 St. Luke's Hospital notified Dr. Hurley that no more patients from Cork would be treated there due to a long waiting list at that hospital.  There was still no reply from the Minister or the Department.  In February 1985 the Minister agreed to meet a deputation of the Cork Deputies on 25 March, but not <Col N="2582" /> before because he had then some matters to go into, the details of which he did not disclose.  That meeting promised by the Minister by letter to us never took place. Nothing has happened since.  St. Anne's Hospital in Dublin got a new cobalt machine in August or September of 1985. In November 1985 the Minister indicated in the Dáil that the situation at Cork Regional Hospital was, in his own words, &ldquo;under review&rdquo;.  I impress on the Minister the need for his approval for £40,000 to put up a building to contain the equipment whose cost has been subscribed to and collected by the people of Cork in particular and Munster in general for the treatment of cancer.</P>
    <P>My colleague has indicated the cost to this country and to the Southern Health Board of sending patients to Britain where they have the most sophisticated equipment available and where this sensitive machinery is available to treat patients who cannot be treated in Cork.  The money is already there for the equipment and why is there continuing delay?  I appeal at this late hour tonight to the Minister to approve the cost of the building for the Southern Health Board so that the machine may be put into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank my colleagues, Deputy E. O'Keeffe and Deputy Lyons, for giving me an opportunity to say a few words in an appeal to the Minister to make a firm decision in relation to the provision of proper equipment in the radiotherapy unit at the Cork Regional Hospital.  At the outset, let me say this is not just a parochial problem which affects Cork city alone.  The radiotherapy services as provided from Cork Regional Hospital service Kerry and Cork, part of Waterford, South Tipperary and South Limerick. They deal with a catchment area of approximately one million population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clearly obvious that the old cobalt plant which was used until a few days ago is outmoded from the point of view of providing proper treatment.  It is at present out of service for a short time for repairs and in the interim all treatment which would relate to the use of that <Col N="2583" /> machine has been suspended.  In June 1983 the Minister met the authorities and the experts in Cork who deal with this matter.  Unfortunately, he has deemed it proper not to meet them since.  The radiotherapy unit at Cork which deals with the cases which need this treatment would cost approximately £400 to £500 per annum.</P>
    <P>As someone who has some degree of knowledge of medicine and has worked in the past in our National Cancer Hospital, St. Luke's in Dublin, and involved himself in cancerological research for a number of years, let me say that people who suffer from certain types of cancer which need radiotherapy treatment have the right to the best possible technological and scientific treatment available from a radiotherapeutic point of view. All one need do is go to the major cancer units in any part of the world and, if one wants to cross the water, see what equipment they have in Christie's in Manchester. They have simulators and accelerators of all sorts.  They recognise that this is the most accepted form of treatment to give the best opportunity of a permanent cure.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister realises that using an ordinary cobalt machine resembles shooting with a gun and aiming blind.  It is a hit or miss job.  If one uses a simulator &mdash; for which type of machine money has been collected &mdash; one can fire the treatment at a particular area as from a rifle. If one wanted to go even further and provide an accelerator, it would identify the area to be treated with telescopic accuracy.  Let there be no doubt that people are dying because of the inferior treatment available in Cork at present.  I do not want to sound an alarmist, but it would be unfair, unjust and remiss of me to let these facts pass by.  As my colleagues have said, it is a fact that voluntary groups in the area of Cork and going towards Tipperary&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>And Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;yes and Limerick and Waterford &mdash; have raised over <Col N="2584" /> £300,000 to purchase a simulator.  It is estimated that the cost of this machine would be approximately £240,000.  They have, in fact, collected in excess of the cost.  However, they badly need two items which I hope the Minister will provide and which he has ignored in the past, the first of which is a building which it is estimated would cost between £40,000 and £50,000 and the second, to pick up the tab on the 23 per cent VAT on the cost of the simulator.  It would be unjust that those who collected this money to save many of their friends and others in that catchment area should have to shoulder this burden.  This is the job of the State and the State cannot ignore it. They must provide money for that VAT payment.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say that two people would be needed to operate this machine and that is so.  We are not talking about big money when one sees how money is squandered in many areas, but one cannot quantify in terms of cost the saving of a life and that it what we are talking about here.  There has been blatant discrimination against Cork.  The Minister and his Government have involved themselves in politics of the Pale which we have seen practised in every area over the last three years.  It certainly should not be operative within the area of health care.  The Minister may or may not be moved in the reshuffle tomorrow but he will long be remembered as the person who did his utmost to close down our health services.  He has stood like an immovable arrogant tank in the way of progress in the health services.  Even at this late stage I hope he will accede to our request to provide the type of treatment that is necessary for poor unfortunate people who are suffering from cancer.  They deserve the best treatment that can be provided by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Cork Regional Hospital has at present a radiotherapy unit which is equipped with a cobalt machine.  Last year this unit provided radiotherapy treatment for about 500 in-patients and about 5,000 out-patient attendances.  To get the facts <Col N="2585" /> across on health is very difficult but I should like to make the point that last year only ten patients had to be referred to Dublin for more intensive radiotherapy treatment.</P>
      <P>On Monday, 10 February the existing equipment was decommissioned to enable repairs to be carried out to the treatment couch.  The decommissioning was planned, patients were told in advance and any necessary alteration in their treatment schedule was made.  It is expected that the repairs will be completed this week and that normal treatment will resume on Monday next, 17 February.  Frankly, I think the head of the cancer treatment centre, the consultant radiotherapist in question, would be better employed doing his work in the hospital rather than frightening the patients, and the public, in order to obtain a piece of equipment which I accept would be very valuable to Cork but which is not on the current priority list of the Southern Health Board.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2586" /> With due respect to Deputy McCarthy. I will go down in history as the Minister for Health who introduced the open heart cardiac service in the Cork Regional Hospital.  I provided, from the resources available in the Department of Health, a sum of £423,000 to the hospital to enable it to commence cardiac surgery.  I am proud to be able to say that I was the first Cork Minister for Health to do that.  To date there have been 19 open heart surgery procedures carried out in the hospital.</P>

      <P>I do not profess to be a consultant radiotherapist but I do know that the Southern Health Board have told us that their first priority in <Col N="2587" /> relation to the service is to replace the existing cobalt source and the treatment couch.  That alone will cost £200,000 in the current year.  Before there is any question of a simulator being put into that unit the cobalt source and the couch must be replaced.  The cost must be funded before any further development can be considered.  The £50,000 referred to by the Deputies for a building required for a simulator has not been listed by the Southern Health Board, or the hospital authorities, as a priority in terms of capital expenditure for the hospital.  The £200,000 will be required in the relatively near future for the essential segment of the cobalt unit and that is our first priority.</P>
      <P>If the Deputies opposite are so concerned about this, and if Dr. Hurley is so concerned, I suggest to them that they should meet, under the aegis of the Southern Health Board, the Aid Cancer Treatment Group, a voluntary organisation, who have collected £300,000.  That money could be used to purchase the essential cobalt source and a replacement treatment couch.  Without them there is not much point in going down the road.</P>

One year earlier, the number on hand was 1,687 and at the end of December 1983, the number was 2,452.  When the present board took <Col N="2383" /> office in March 1984, the number of appeals on hand was 2,354 and the number of appeals received between then and 31 December 1985 was 4,349.

I am advised that in the opinion of the health board the waters do not constitute a threat to public health.  My Department have made extensive funding available to the Dublin authorities to improve the sewerage disposal arrangements in the bay area.  Last May, the greater Dublin drainage scheme which cost in excess of <Col N="2384" /> £50 million was commissioned.  I have approved proposals for the Blackrock main drainage scheme (Stage 1) and Phase II of the Ringsend treatment works which have a combined estimated cost of £10 million.

      <P>The primary responsibility for the planning and execution of improvement works on county roads rests with local authorities.  The expenditure involved falls to be financed by the local authorities from their own resources which may be supplemented by the block grant for roads paid annually by my Department.  The manner in which the block grant is spent, including the extent, if any, to which it is to be applied to improvement works on county roads, is largely a matter for each local authority.</P>
      <P>The road grants notified to local authorities for 1986 include a sum of £20.4 million which has been allocated by way of block grant.  This is 21 per cent higher than the corresponding grant in 1985.  In addition, grant commitments totalling £3 million are being notified to county councils this year to finance improvement works on county roads used mainly for agriculture or forestry, in those parts of the country coming within the scope of the EC western package. This represents an increase of £1 million compared with 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to allocate any additional road grants to any local authority because the funds available in 1986 have been fully allocated.

I am satisfied that the relevant capital provision for 1986 will be adequate to meet the appropriate share of the cost of commitments arising on all schemes under construction or already approved and will also enable a sufficient number of additional schemes to be released so as to ensure the continuance of a high level of activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the condition of roads generally including county roads in County Mayo.  Primary responsibility for the planning and execution of works on county roads rests with the local authorities.  The expenditure involved falls to be financed by the local authorities from their own resources which may be supplemented, in the case of improvement works, by the block grant for roads paid annually by my Department.  The manner in which the block grant is spent, including the extent to which it is to be applied to improvement works on county roads, is largely a matter within the discretion of each local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A block grant of £909,000 has been notified to Mayo County Council for 1986, which is an increase of 33 per cent compared with 1985.  In addition, since 1981, the local authority has benefited from funds provided specifically for the improvement of county roads under the EC western package.  Grant commitments <Col N="2395" /> to the local authority to date under the Package total £1.56 million.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the practice established by successive Governments, road grants are not provided to finance the cost of maintaining county roads.  Expenditure under this heading falls to be financed from the local authority's own resources.  In this connection, may I remind the Deputy that the Government decided this year to abolish the levy on local authorities in respect of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The effect of this, combined with the increase in the rate support grants, notified to the local authority in December last, was to make an additional £1 million available to Mayo County Council to meet their commitments in 1986.  Moreover, the 1986 rate support grant has just been increased further in the context of the budget.  This will give an additional £171,000 to the local authority in the current year.  I am confident that these additional funds will enable the authority to maintain its services at a satisfactory level in 1986.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the general condition of roads in County Donegal on the basis of inspections carried out by my Department's inspector for the area and reports submitted by Donegal County Council.  I do not consider it necessary to have a special survey carried out along the lines proposed by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The State grants for roads allocated to Donegal County Council for 1986 totalled £6.318 million.  This represents an increase of 9 per cent relative to the original allocation notified to the local authority in 1985.</P>
      <P>The position regarding State grants for maintenance works is, as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  Full cost grants are provided by the Department for approved programmes of surface dressing and ordinary maintenance on national roads.  I am satisfied that the grants allocated to the local authority for these purposes in the current year are sufficient to provide a good standard of maintenance on these roads.  The grant allocation notified to the local authority in 1986 for maintenance works on national roads is £978,000, which is 7 per cent higher than the corresponding payments made to the authority in 1985.</P>
      <P>(2) Expenditure on maintenance works on regional roads falls to be financed by the local authority from their own resources, which may be supplemented by the block grant for roads paid annually by the Department.  The manner in which the block grant is spent, including the extent to which it is to be applied to maintenance works on regional roads, is largely within the discretion of each local authority.  The block grant allocated to the local authority in 1986 is £1.04 million, which is 10 per cent higher than the corresponding grant in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) In accordance with the practice <Col N="2398" /> established by successive Governments, it is not proposed to make State grants available for county road maintenance. Expenditure under this heading will continue to be financed by local authorities from their own resources.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to allocate any additional road grants to any local authority because the funds available in 1986 have been fully allocated.  The Department are monitoring progress on grant-aided works during 1986.  If it should appear later this year that the grant allocated to a local authority will not be required in full in 1986, the authority will be consulted and any possible savings will be reallocated to other authorities which require the additional funds and can spend the money involved this year.</P>

Continuation of the subsidy in the latter year was conditional on the pig producers involved undertaking full responsibility for financing the slurry transport arrangements from 1 January 1985.  This undertaking was given and it is now a matter for the pig producers to finance the removal of slurry from the catchment.</P>

During 1985, some seven overseas companies were taken to view a variety of potential industrial sites in the county.  In addition, as part of the IDA's policy of regionalisation, the Donegal Small Industry Board was established in 1985 with full responsibility for processing and approving small industrial projects in the area.  During 1985 the board approved 35 projects with a job potential of 254.</P>

      <P>The taxation changes in the recent budget will have a stimulatory effect on business generally.  As a result of the budget prices in general will rise by no more than one-half per cent and these price increases will not have any significant effect on business or employment nationally.</P>
      <P>The Government have been aware of the difficulties experienced by certain traders in the Border areas because of price competition from Northern Ireland.  In order to alleviate these difficulties the Government have taken steps in recent years as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash;substantial reduction in the duty on spirits in 1984;</P>
      <P>&mdash;halving of the duty on televisions in the 1985 budget;</P>
      <P>&mdash;abolition of the 35 per cent rate of VAT;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2402" /> These changes benefit the traders concerned and help maintain and create jobs. Furthermore the changes taking place in the VAT treatment of areas of the services industry from 1 July 1986 should have considerable benefits for the economy generally.

      <P>Following the transfer of ownership of a goods vehicle, certain licensing authorities require the new owner to present the vehicle for reweighing prior to relicensing the vehicle in the name of the new owner.  My Department proposes to ask licensing authorities generally to limit this practice to cases where the licensing authority have reason to believe that the new owner has modified the vehicle in such a way as to affect the unladen weight of the vehicle involved.  When a vehicle is presented for weighing for licensing purposes a relatively small fee is charged for the use of the appointed weighbridge involved.  Inquiries made by my Department of a sample number of licensing authorities indicated that the fees generally do not exceed £5.</P>

This case concerns a claim by a former employee of An <Col N="2408" /> Foras Forbartha who is now employed by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards for payment of a lump sum in respect of a period while employed with An Foras and which was related to revised working arrangements and future productivity.  When the Labour Court examined the case initially it was not satisfied that liability for payment rested with An Foras.  The matter came before the Labour Court again by way of a claim against the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the court on this occasion took a different view and recommended that An Foras was liable for payment.  An Foras were not present at the hearing of this claim.  I understand from inquiries I have made of An Foras that the board has decided that taking account of all the circumstances of the case it would be inappropriate for An Foras Forbartha to implement the recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to road grants provided by my Department.  Road grant assistance towards the cost of works on county roads normally forms part of the block grant paid annually by my Department.  This grant supplements the provision made from local authorities' own resources for the improvement, maintenance and management of non-national main roads, for improvement works on county roads, and for the implementation of traffic management measures.  The manner in which the block grant is spent, the extent to which it is apportioned to county road improvement, and the rate per mile of county roads which this represents are largely within the discretion of each local authority. In the circumstances, I am not in a position to provide the information sought by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Block grants allocated to local authorities for 1986 total £20.4 million which is 21 per cent higher than the equivalent grants in 1985 which, in turn, were 10 per cent greater than the 1984 grants.  In accordance with the practice of successive Governments, State road grants are not made available for county road maintenance. Expenditure under this heading falls to be met from local authorities' own resources.</P>

      <P>University College, Dublin, is statutorily required to make any request for State funds through the Higher Education Authority.  I understand that the authority has not received a request from UCD for moneys to be made available for resurfacing the athletic track at the college.  Any such request would have to be considered in the context of the overall allocation to UCD for 1986 bearing in mind that in the absence of a formal request from the college authorities a specific provision was not made in the 1986 Capital Programme of expenditure for this purpose.</P>

    <P>This, however, is one of a number of matters being considered by the various Departments concerned in the context of the EC Directive of 10 June 1985 on the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications in architecture, including <Col N="2442" /> measures to facilitate the effective exercise of the right of establishment and freedom to provide services.

      <P>I understand that the decision of the Employment Appeals Tribunal in this case was issued to the parties concerned on 7 February 1986.  I understand further that the tribunal found in favour of the person concerned.  He should now request payment of his redundancy lump sum from his former employer.  If the employer fails to pay him the lump sum within a reasonable time, he should apply to the redundancy payments section of my Department on the prescribed form to have the lump sum paid to him direct from the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund.</P>
