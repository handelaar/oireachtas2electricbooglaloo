    <P>
      <Col N="791" /> I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable a referendum to be held so that the people will have an opportunity of deciding whether they wish to amend the Constitution to enable divorce legislation to be enacted.  I need not stress that this is one of the most important proposals to come before the Oireachtas and the people in recent years.</P>
    <P>The debate on divorce has gone on for some years now.  It has enabled the issues to be identified and the feelings and views of different groups to be made plain. Divorce was the subject of some discussion in the New Ireland Forum, and it was considered in depth by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown which furnished its report a little over a year ago.  That committee, which dealt in great detail in its report with all aspects of family law, marriage and the ways in which the institution of marriage can be protected, considered it necessary as part of its investigation of the problem of marriage breakdown to examine the question of whether divorce should be introduced.  The report sets out clearly the main arguments for and against the introduction of divorce and it was the view of a majority of the committee that a referendum should be held.</P>
    <P>The report of the committee was fully and extensively debated in both Houses of the Oireachtas over a long period. Deputies will be aware also that, before bringing forward the present proposals for the approval of the Government, the Taoiseach, accompanied by myself, had full discussions with all the main Churches on a range of topics arising from the joint committee's report dealing with marriage, including the question of divorce.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate over recent years, a succession of opinion polls have been conducted to ascertain the views of the people.</P>
    <P>While there may be some doubt about opinion polls as a method of accurately ascertaining the views of the general public, I believe that the findings revealed <Col N="792" /> are significant and cannot lightly be ignored. I think it fair to say that they have shown an increasing trend in support for some form of divorce.  I say &ldquo;some form of divorce&rdquo; because I think it is common cause with most people who support the introduction of legislation permitting divorce that what they would like to see is not free-for-all, unrestricted divorce but a regime which would enable the bond of marriage to be broken only in circumstances where it is quite clear that the marriage has failed and that there is no realistic hope of its revival.  All who have contributed to the debate have also recognised that there is an increasing incidence of marital breakdown in our modern society, however much they may differ on what should be the correct response to that unfortunate development.</P>
    <P>It is in that developing situation that the Government feel that the time is now appropriate to give the people an opportunity to decide on this important issue. It is, of course, a matter for the people to decide, not the Government.  The present Bill is before the House because the Government and the Oireachtas have a duty to present the issue to the people.</P>
    <P>Before discussing the details of the Bill and saying something about the further proposals, which are particularly relevant to the subject of the Bill and which the Government are committed to bringing forward if the proposal in the Bill is approved by referendum, I would like to make a few general remarks.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to contend that divorce legislation &ldquo;defines&rdquo; all marriages as dissoluble. It does no such thing, rather it defines the circumstances and conditions in which a marriage has ceased to be a source of happiness and strength to those involved may be brought to an end.  The constitutional amendment proposed in this Bill and the further legislation which the Government will propose will, together, provide that a marriage can be dissolved in law only in very restrictive circumstances.  There is no compulsive power in this amendment nor will the <Col N="793" /> supporting legislation contain any obligation on those who do not wish to do so to use the mechanism it will set up.</P>
    <P>In promoting legislation to permit divorce the Government are not opposed to marriage.  The Government are fully committed to the protection of marriage so far as that can realistically be achieved and I hope to satisfy the House that the legislation that the Government are committed to bringing forward, if the proposal in the Bill is approved, will be carefully designed to recognise the need to protect marriage and to contain and minimise as far as possible the effects on the dependents of granting a divorce.  The Government's proposals are simply a recognition of the fact that many marriages do in fact fail and will continue to fail and that there are cases in which nothing short of divorce will provide an adequate solution.</P>
    <P>As I have said there is, indisputably, an increasing number of marriages which have failed.  Whether or not divorce is introduced it would be foolish to think that that trend will not continue or that men and women will not continue to leave their married partners and form other unions.  The law must eventually, I would suggest, take account of that fact &mdash; otherwise there would be a danger that the law would lose touch with the lives of a growing number of people and that could result only in the law coming into disrepute.</P>
    <P>In deciding on the form of the constitutional amendment that should be presented and in forming its further proposals, the Government have taken fully into account the views expressed by the various persons and groups who have contributed to the debate, including the views expressed by the various Churches in their meetings with the Taoiseach and myself.  The Government have carefully weighed the various arguments on each side, both from the point of view of the individuals directly involved and of society as a whole.  In the Governments considered view, the balance of the social good lies with the introduction of divorce in limited circumstances.</P>
    <P>As a general remark, I would like to <Col N="794" /> bring one point to the attention of the House.  It has been stated, and no doubt will be stated again over the coming weeks, that the history of divorce legislation in other countries shows a development along a particular track and it will be contended that once we pass any legislation permitting divorce there will inevitably be a speeding up process.  That is an argument that will be made and one that deserves to be examined.  But I would ask the House to bear one very important factor in mind.  The Bill that we are discussing is the Bill to amend our Constitution.  We are proposing to put a provision in the Constitution that will define and delimit the circumstances in which a divorce can be granted by law. Once that provision has been entered in the Constitution no fundamental change can be made unless the Constitution itself is again changed.  That is a situation which, to my knowledge, is peculiar to this country and is a circumstance governing the law on divorce which equally would be peculiar to this country.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House proposes that the Constitution should be amended by the deletion of subsection (2) of article 41.3, which states that no law shall be enacted providing for the dissolution of marriage, and its replacement by a new provision.</P>
    <P>It did not seem to the Government that the prohibition on the enactment of divorce legislation could simply be deleted without the insertion of a suitable replacement provision.  That view was expressed by the Joint Oireachtas Committee. Such a replacement provision is necessary for two reasons.</P>
    <P>First of all, simply to delete the present prohibition would run the risk that any subsequent divorce legislation that might be enacted might be seen to be in conflict with other provisions of the Constitution guaranteeing the protection of the family and marriage.  A positive provision specifically enabling divorce legislation to be enacted was therefore necessary.</P>
    <P>Second, the Government felt that it was also necessary that the new provision should indicate clearly the type of divorce legislation that the Oireachtas might <Col N="795" /> enact.  Throughout, the Government were concerned to ensure that the constitutional amendment and any further divorce legislation they would subsequently introduce should reflect the principle that divorce was to be obtainable only in restricted circumstances where it was clear beyond doubt that the marriage had failed and that proper provision had been made for dependent spouses and children.</P>
    <P>In line with that view the new provision proposed for insertion in the Constitution would allow divorce only where a court was satisfied that the marriage had failed, that that failure had continued for a period of, or periods amounting to, at least five years, that there was no reasonable possibility of reconciliation between the spouses, that any other condition that might be prescribed in law had been complied with and that adequate and proper provision having regard to the circumstances is made for any dependent spouse and children.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the House in particular to the construction of the provision that is proposed in which all of those conditions which I have just outlined must be each and every one of them, satisfied before a decree of divorce can be granted by a court.</P>
    <P>The concept of &ldquo;failure of marriage&rdquo; has been used in the proposal rather than a concept such as &ldquo;breakdown of marriage&rdquo; since in the Government's view it indicates more clearly the idea that the marriage has ceased to be a marriage in anything but name.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the conditions set out in the proposed amendment are cumulative and must, of course, all be complied with before the court could be satisfied that a decree of divorce should be granted. They are all conditions to which the Oireachtas would have to have regard in considering the type of divorce legislation that might be enacted and are conditions which, of course, could not be diluted by subsequent legislation.  They indicate clearly that what is intended is that divorce would be available only in limited circumstances where it is clear beyond <Col N="796" /> doubt that the marriage has come to an end and that fact has been proved over a period of five years and where proper provision has been made for dependants. The requirement that such other conditions as may be prescribed by law have been complied with means that the Oireachtas may impose other restrictions if it so desires and the legislation which the Government propose to introduce, in the event that the constitutional amendment is approved, will contain such further conditions.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the proposed amendment strikes a proper balance between the need to include in the Constitution a clear statement of the type of divorce that would be acceptable to the people and the need to allow the Oireachtas freedom to add, should it so desire, other additional conditions which of course could never detract from the effect of the constitutional provision.  I would suggest also that the proposal reflects what a substantial majority of people would see as a moderate and reasonable response to the cases of people whose marriage has failed, with due regard to the general social good.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer here to comments that have been made in regard to the effect of divorce on the rights of the family under the Succession Act.  I must point out first of all that the children of a marriage which has been dissolved will remain entitled to succeed as children of their divorced parents on the intestacy of their parents and will still be entitled, where a will is made, to apply to a court for proper provision to be made for them out of the estate of a divorced parent if such provision has not been made by will or otherwise.  As regards the spouses, it will, of course, be a consequence of divorce that a person who has ceased to be married to another by reason of the dissolution of the marriage, would not be regarded as the widow or widower of the other, for the purposes of succession when that other dies and would lose rights as a result.</P>
    <P>As part of the proposals outlined in the statement which accompanied the publication of this Bill a court granting a divorce <Col N="797" /> will have new powers to make orders as to the ownership of property of the spouses.  This will enable the court to make some compensation for loss of expectations on the death of the other spouse, if that is appropriate.  It is, of course, a normal feature of the standard form of separation agreement usually entered into by estranged spouses that each renounces his or her succession rights on the death of the other.  This is the case in practice even though it is not recognised, or perhaps not realised, by many of those who comment on issues raised by the Bill.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware the Government, in circulating the Bill before the House, also published a statement of their intentions in regard to marriage, separation and divorce.  The purpose of that statement was to inform the people of the type of divorce legislation which it is the Government's intention to submit for the consideration of the Oireachtas should the proposal in the Bill be approved. That statement, of course, refers also to other legislation proposed in the family law area.  The Government regard it as of the highest importance that the people, when voting in the referendum, should know as clearly as possible the type of divorce legislation they may expect if they give an affirmative vote.  I think I should therefore briefly indicate for the record and for the benefit of Deputies who may not have taken the opportunity of reading the Government statement of intention, what these proposals are.</P>
    <P>The central feature of the proposals to be enshrined in the further legislation is that the spouses must prove that they have been separated for a period of, or periods amounting to, at least five years before a divorce can be sought.  Such a period of separation will provide, as I think most people will agree, the clearest possible proof that the marriage has in fact failed.  The proposed amendment to the Constitution, considered in conjunction with these further proposals cannot, in any way, be represented as providing for easy or unrestricted divorce.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="798" /> People who have already been separated for five years at the time the legislation to provide for divorce comes into force will be able to apply for a divorce once they have proved that fact and also that proper provision has been made for dependants.  As regards people who are not separated for five years at the date of enactment of the legislation, it will be an additional condition to the general requirement of five years' separation that they will first have to obtain a decree of judicial separation or enter into a separation agreement which is then approved by the court.  If they so desire, they may then present a petition for divorce when two further years have elapsed.  The purpose of requiring a decree of judicial separation or court order approving a separation agreement is twofold.</P>
    <P>It is designed to protect the interests of the dependent spouse and children and to provide a period of reflection before the final step to terminate the marriage would be taken.  It will protect the interests of dependants because it means that, long before a petition for a divorce is presented, both parties will have had to address themselves, under the supervision of a court, to the various questions that must be settled in regard to maintenance, custody of and access to children and property owned, before a separation, and ultimately a divorce, could be granted, and arrangements will have been put in place to cover these matters. The court subsequently considering an application for divorce will then have ample opportunity of judging how effective the arrangements made have proved to be in practice over a lengthy period and in the light of that judgment and knowledge, of deciding whether to confirm or to vary the arrangements.</P>
    <P>In order that the court will have the ability to order the best possible arrangements to protect the interests of the parties and their dependants, it will be given full power to make orders in regard to maintenance, children and property owned by the spouses.  At present a court can only decide disputes between spouses as to the ownership of property &mdash; it cannot change the ownership of property <Col N="799" /> in favour of a spouse who cannot prove an existing beneficial ownership.  A provision in the proposed legislation for the making of property orders is a very significant new departure and one which the Government believe is an essential component of the provision in relation to divorce.</P>
    <P>Under the proposals, applications for judicial separation, for an order approving a separation agreement and for a decree of divorce will all fall to be made to a family court which will sit separately from other courts.  Each sitting of the family court will be presided over by one of a number of Circuit Court Judges specially assigned for the purpose.  The procedures in the court will be less formal than the usual court procedures and the court will have available to it counselling services which will enable it to decide, first of all, whether there is any realistic possibility of reconciliation between the parties.  If it appears that there is no such possibility, the court will then consider whether counselling or mediation services should be availed of to enable a conciliation process to be undertaken with a view to encouraging the parties as far as possible to come to mutually acceptable arrangements on the various issues that need to be settled and with as little bitterness as possible.</P>
    <P>In the case where the spouses have themselves come to an acceptable arrangement the court will no doubt find itself in the position of being able to endorse that arrangement, if it is satisfied that the interests of dependants are adequately and properly taken care of by the arrangement.  Otherwise, if the couples fail to come to an acceptable agreement, or indeed to any agreement, the court will make the necessary orders to ensure that dependants are protected or it will refuse the application for divorce.  Contrary to the impression that seems to have gained ground in some quarters, the provisions we have made here, with the emphasis on proper provision being made for dependent spouses and children, means that the proposals <Col N="800" /> we are putting forward based on this constitutional amendment are a great deal more child centred than the divorce legislation in other countries with which comparisons will be made over the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>A number of counselling agencies already exist.  The statement of intention mentioned three &mdash; The Catholic Marriage Advisory Council of Ireland, The Marriage Counselling Service and The Marriage and Family Institute.  It would be the Government's hope that the expertise of those agencies would be availed of, if they are willing to participate in the process.  If that is not possible, however, new counselling services will be provided.  As Deputies will be aware, a pilot mediation scheme has also been established by the Minister of State with responsibility for Women's Affairs, Deputy Nuala Fennell, and that scheme will also have a part to play.</P>
    <P>The law relating to judicial separation will play a crucial part in the process which I have outlined.  The present law, on any view, requires some amendment. At present the grounds for obtaining a decree of judicial separation are somewhat limited &mdash; they are cruelty, adultery and unnatural practices.  The further legislation proposed will introduce a number of new grounds &mdash; these will be desertion, including constructive desertion, separation for three years if one spouse does not consent to a decree and separation for one year if both spouses consent to the grant of a decree.  These reflect grounds recommended both by the Law Reform Commission in their report on the matter and by the joint Oireachtas committee although they do not represent all the recommendations contained in these reports.  The Government are satisfied that the reformed law on judicial separation will fully meet the needs of people who wish to seek a decree of judicial separation.</P>
    <P>There are two other areas of family law in which the Government have also decided to make changes.  One is the law of marriage.  As a step towards the protection of marriage and towards ensuring that young people will not enter <Col N="801" /> into hasty marriages &mdash; marriages by very young people appear to be specially vulnerable &mdash; the Government will propose that the minimum age at which a person may validly contract a marriage will be 18 years, with power to the family court to authorise in exceptional cases and after having heard the parents, an earlier marriage between the ages of 16 and 18.  The legislation will also provide a minimum period of notice of three months before a marriage can be contracted unless the family court is satisfied that there are substantial reasons for abridging that period.</P>
    <P>The law of nullity will also be reviewed. The Law Reform Commission have furnished a very comprehensive report on this subject and the joint committee have also made detailed recommendations. These will provide a very useful contribution to the review of this very complicated subject.</P>
    <P>I hope I have said enough to convince the House of the moderate and reasonable nature of the Government's proposals. I would stress again that the Government are not proposing free for all, unrestricted divorce.  Very stringent conditions will have to be met which will ensure that, before a divorce is granted, the marriage has clearly failed beyond redemption and that the dependants have been properly provided for.  In an ideal world we would not, perhaps, need to concern ourselves with divorce but in the real world in which we live we cannot avoid the fact that many marriages fail or the fact that, while much can be done to protect and support marriage, there will remain a number, and in the modern society in which we live an increasing number, of cases where the only answer on any view of the matter is divorce.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I will repeat something I said earlier, that the provisions we make, restrictive as they are, will allow or open up a possibility of a new form of resolution to people who find themselves, unfortunately, in very considerable distress.  To speak very personally, I would not regard it in any way as a threat to my marriage to feel that our Constitution and our legislation provided a <Col N="802" /> reasonable means of resolution for people who find themselves in that situation. On the contrary, I would find myself if anything strengthened as a legislator and comforted as a member of a community if I felt we had enough compassion to allow that to be brought about. Whatever my own religious beliefs or inclinations as to how I conduct myself, I do not feel I have the right to say to anybody else in our society that I deny that person a solution which can be given, without doing violence to anybody else, to the problems he or she experiences.  In that spirit I hope we will debate this issue. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The question we are considering here today is one of the most fundamental and far reaching issues to be put before the people since the foundation of this State.  Essentially, and the Minister referred to this in his opening statement, this is a social issue affecting the fundamental unit group of our society, the family.  Although pressures are increasing on the family and even on the institution of marriage, few Irish men and women would support the destruction of family life as we know it.  Consequently, when faced with problems of marriage breakdown our first recourse is to defend the family and protect it from attack.  Nevertheless, we recognise that there are serious problems of breakdown and separation in which the partners are irreconcilable.  On both compassionate and practical grounds we want to provide remedies for them which are consistent with our basic support for the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have decided that divorce is necessary so as to provide for remarriage and as a remedy for marriage breakdown.  So convinced are they of the value to our society of divorce that they plan to campaign in a vigorous and political way for the removal of the present ban on the dissolution of a marriage and the installation in its place of a positive constitutional provision for divorce.  The Government see the provision of divorce as the greatest social need of our time and consequently, they have committed <Col N="803" /> all their energies and political resources to a national campaign for divorce.</P>
    <P>The position of Fianna Fáil is quite different.  We are not opposed to the holding of a referendum on the issue of divorce and we will not oppose the Second Reading of the Bill, but we regard this as an issue which should be decided by the people in the full light and knowledge of all the social and legal implications involved.  Therefore, our objective will be to ensure that the pros and cons of the Government's proposals are fully aired and clarified in the course of this debate.  Individual members of our party may hold different views on such a controversial matter, but all are agreed that the issue should be put before the people. This debate is the first major opportunity to have a detailed and critical analysis of the Government's proposed wording for the referendum and of its likely effect on Irish society and family life should it be passed and included in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown considered in detail the protection of marriage and of family life and put forward the measures needed to deal with the problems arising from breakdown.  The committee were hampered by the lack of basic factual information on the causes and extent of marital breakdown in Ireland today.  However, the attention of the committee was drawn in submissions to the large number of marriages where abuse of alcohol was seen as a major factor in breakdown. Another outstanding contributor to breakdown is the age of the couple at the time of marriage.  Research has shown that in every major study in the past 30 years and in all official statistics, the age at marriage is associated with success, with a critical cut off point at about 18 or 19 years.  Marriages below that age run a considerably higher risk of breaking down.  The personal characteristics of the partners are important in achieving a stable marriage relationship, but the committee found also that large scale unemployment, poor housing or inadequate financial resources can place marriages under strain and exacerbate <Col N="804" /> problems which may exist already in a marriage and bring it to the point of breakdown.</P>
    <P>Members involved in the preparation of the joint committee's report became acutely aware of the lack of comprehensive statistics on marriage breakdown in Ireland.  The submissions received were critical of the unavailability of such statistics and questioned the accuracy of those which were available.  The committee stressed the need for the 1986 census to include precise questions on the extent of marriage breakdown.  This has now been done and it is expected that accurate information on the extent of breakdown will be available later this year.  It is at least highly questionable that the referendum is being held so shortly before this accurate information on the extent of the problem is made public and fully analysed.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the Labour Force Survey, 1983 is the principal official statistic available for this referendum debate. Based on some 40,000 households, it covered approximately 4 per cent of the population and is, of course, subject to sampling errors.  The survey estimates showed that there were 2.45 million people in the State aged 15 or over.  Of these there were 952,000 single and 1.3 million married persons, and 179,000 widowed.  All forms of breakdown amounted to 21,100 persons who were separated.  These included deserted spouses, annulled marriages, and divorced or separated persons.  On this basis the percentage of the population aged over 15 recorded as separated or deserted was 0.9 per cent, and as a percentage of those married 1.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>The indications are that the figures have increased further since 1983 but this will not be fully known until the date from the recent census are published. What proportion of the 21,000 persons &ldquo;married but separated&rdquo; would seek to remarry if divorce is introduced is a matter of conjecture.  We know that 1,500 of these had already obtained divorces and 500 had received annulments.  On this basis it seems likely that at least several thousand of these &ldquo;separated&rdquo;<Col N="805" /> persons would seek to avail of either an expanded and updated legislation on civil nullity, or a divorce jurisdiction so that they could remarry with the full authority and backing of the law.</P>
    <P>What are the remedies?  The trauma of marriage breakdown and most of the problems associated with it can be resolved without any amendment to include divorce in the Constitution.  The following measures could be taken immediately by the Government or where appropriate by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The first approach to marriage breakdown must be to undertake a more detailed study of the causes and to suggest suitable remedies.  However, it is clear that some measures could be taken without delay.  These include legislation to raise the minimum age for marriage to 18 and the use of the basic educational system to prepare young people and give them an understanding of marriage. Resources should be committed to ensure that there would be an easily accessible and effective guidance and counselling service available to married persons and couples preparing for marriage.  These measures will cost money but the cost of prevention is small by comparison with the present day cost of broken marriages.</P>
    <P>Where marriage breakdown or signs of failure occur there is a need for:</P>
    <P>1.  A reconciliation service aimed at restoring the marriage through specialist counselling and guidance.</P>
    <P>2.  A mediation service aimed at assisting couples whose marriages have irreconcilably broken down, to resolve the problems and disputes which inevitably arise, by consent rather than by conflict, for example in claims for custody and access to children.</P>
    <P>3.  A family court jurisdiction to adjudicate on disputes in a more informal legal environment and to note mediation settlements.</P>
    <P>4.  The updating and clarification of the law on civil nullity and the reform of the procedures involved.</P>
    <P>5.  The updating of the law and <Col N="806" /> arrangements for other legal remedies such as separation agreements and judicial separations.</P>
    <P>Those whose marriages have broken down may avail of any of these legal remedies and do so at present.  The improvement of these remedies is a matter for the Government and the Legislature.  It does not need a constitutional change.  They are effective and comprehensive measures for assisting and regularising, and giving legal force to, arrangements made between the partners to a marriage which has broken down to the extent that the spouses decide to part.  They cover such matters as maintenance, custody of children, the position concerning property and the family home.  All these measures can be taken without a referendum.  Indeed, they should already have been taken which would put the need for divorce and remarriage in perspective.</P>
    <P>There are spouses who simply agree to live apart and who want to have their separation agreement formally recorded, usually by a deed so that in the event of a later dispute it can be enforced by the courts.  A separation agreement has the advantage that it is inexpensive and can readily be revoked if the parties decide to resume their marital relationship.  It does not affect the validity of the marriage. If arranged following suitable counselling, and possibly mediation, it can in a humane way fully provide for the breakdown of a marriage.  What is missing here is an adequate counselling, mediation and family court jurisdiction to support such arrangements between spouses.  The constitutional amendment will not help these cases in any way unless they later wish to remarry.</P>
    <P>The present law on the granting of judicial separations is fault-based.  The &ldquo;faults&rdquo; specified include adultery, physical or mental cruelty, or unnatural practices. The Law Reform Commission recommended in 1983 that the grounds on which judicial separations may be granted should be extended to include <Col N="807" /> desertion, breakdown of marriage or separation for a set period of time.</P>
    <P>They also recommended that husbands as well as wives should be allowed to apply for alimony and that each spouse should be precluded from taking any share in the other spouse's estate on the death of the other spouse.  The Oireachtas joint committee in their report over a year ago gave as their opinion the proposal that a decree of judicial separation should be granted if the court is satisfied that the marriage has irretrievable broken down.  They considered that there should be one overall ground for granting the decree and that should be irretrievable breakdown.  This would be accepted if an applicant proves one of a number of specified grounds.  These recommendations were aimed at updating the law on judicial separation and at ensuring that the arrangements for a couple who separate, and for their children, would be as helpful, supportive and compassionate as they possibly can be.</P>
    <P>Once a couple separate they are immediately faced with a whole series of practical problems especially where there are children involved.  These problems are a consequence of the breakdown and, no matter how compassionate or concerned we may be, there is a limit to the extent to which society can help.  This applies whether one of the parties wishes to remarry or not.  Many of those who are separated, especially wives and children, find themselves thrown onto the State for social assistance and deserted wife's allowances.  Most TDs are very familiar with the situation where the husband, having complied with all the formalities of a legal separation, defaults in the subsequent payment of maintenance.  As a result the taxpayer has to foot the bill.</P>
    <P>Surely it is time that a more serious view was taken of this abdication of responsibility by deserting spouses? There is of course the underlying problem that few men, or in some instances women, can afford to support two homes or two families.  Nevertheless, with the tax bill for deserted wives and their families at a record £33 million it is time a <Col N="808" /> new look was taken at the question of responsibility.  In particular it is time that the Oireachtas considered giving power to the State to recover moneys owed by maintenance defaulters where the taxpayer has had to meet the bill.  The Minister in his suggestions is proposing that extra powers be given in subsequent legislation in relation to property.</P>
    <P>The taxpayer is making the payments already but does not have the power to recover any or all of the outlay.  The deserted wife and family have the right to pursue maintenance or attachment-of-earnings orders through the courts, but they rarely have the time or financial resources to do so.  Deserters and defaulters may also attempt to defeat court orders by moving to another jurisdiction. Such an evasion route could be stopped by the State pursuing the defaulter.</P>
    <P>This would require the implementation as soon as practicable of the EC Convention on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial matters signed by Ireland in 1978.  This convention covers proceedings for maintenance and the pursuit of a debtor.  It would require enabling legislation here to bring it into operation.  This should be proceeded with without delay.</P>
    <P>It is indeed strange that so little has been said concerning the civil law of nullity as it applies in Ireland.  Even the limited official statistics available from the Labour Force Survey, 1983, showed that 500 respondents were described as &ldquo;marriage annulled&rdquo;.  Civil nullity is a remedy which may apply to many cases of marriage breakdown in Ireland today, but as it stands the legislation is over restrictive and out of date with developments in the courts.  It is a remedy which could and should be immediately updated by the introduction of suitable legislation.  It does not require a constitutional referendum to bring a satisfactory solution to those seeking civil nullity.</P>
    <P>Today the Minister gave an undertaking that subsequent to the referendum he plans to bring in this type of legislation. However, that type of legislation is long overdue, as has been well indicated to us <Col N="809" /> by the Law Reform Commission and the joint committee.</P>
    <P>The civil law of nullity derives its jurisdiction from the Matrimonial Causes and Marriage Law (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1870.  This Act transferred the jurisdiction, up to then exercised by the Ecclesiastical Courts of the Church of Ireland, to a civil court for Matrimonial Causes and Matters.  This move followed the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland.  These matters were subsequently transferred to the High Court and are dealt with there at present. Under section 13 of the Act of 1870 the new court had to rely on the principles and rules used by the Ecclesiastical Court of the Church of Ireland up to that date, 1870.  Thus, while a new civil jurisdiction was introduced breaking from the Church &mdash; the Church of Ireland &mdash; it was still held by the courts that the limited grounds for nullity practised by that Church at that time still applied to Irish civil law.</P>
    <P>This somewhat ridiculous situation continued in the Irish courts up to 1975 when the principles of law in these cases were extended.  But, to our shame as a nation, there has been no legislative change in this area since 1870, or 116 years ago.  The Judiciary have been left to apply outdated laws based on the concepts and social mores which applied pre-1870. There is an obvious and urgent need to update the law on civil nullity as a remedy for those cases of marriage breakdown to which it can apply.</P>
    <P>The grounds for obtaining a civil decree of nullity which make a marriage void are:</P>
    <P>1.  Lack of capacity: This can arise from a prior subsisting marriage, a marriage within the prohibited degrees of relationship, marriages involving a lunatic and under age marriages;</P>
    <P>2.  Non-observance of formalities which are set down by Statute;</P>
    <P>3.  Absence of Consent: This can arise from mental incapacity, mistake, duress or fraud.</P>
    <P>The grounds for obtaining a decree of <Col N="810" /> nullity which render a marriage voidable, that is it can be set aside if one partner so requests, are:</P>
    <P>1.  Impotence;</P>
    <P>2.  Psychiatric illness or mental illness present at the time of marriage which renders a person unable to enter into or sustain a normal marital relationship.</P>
    <P>In the case of nullity these grounds would have to have been present at the time when the marriage was originally entered into.  Nevertheless, in cases of breakdown it is not uncommon to hear of instances in which a young wife was deserted after only a few years of marriage.  In such cases there must surely be a question as to whether the husband had the psychological capacity to enter into or sustain the marriage.  There are also instances in which the husband, or indeed the wife, may be found after marriage to have serious and lasting psychiatric problems. These too must surely raise questions concerning that spouse's ability to enter into and sustain a normal marital relationship.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Kenny, in the Supreme Court in 1976, stated that the court should recognise that the great advances made in psychological medicine since 1870 made it necessary to frame new rules which reflect these developments.  A number of subsequent High Court cases helped to develop this case law.  These developments relate mainly to the requirements for full and free consent of both parties at the time of the marriage and to the psychological capacity of the parties to contract a valid marriage.  They have an important bearing on the practical application of the law of civil nullity in the eighties and on the extent to which it can be applied to help in cases of marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>The Government should act now by introducing modern legislation for civil nullity and by simplifying the procedures involved.  This could be done through the new Family Court which has the support of all political parties.</P>
    <P>The great, and often silent, majority <Col N="811" /> of Irishmen and women do not want, nor do they intend to avail of, divorce for themselves, and the Minister reflected that in his comments this morning.  However, because of religion, tradition or personal conviction they do not want divorce or see it as a remedy for which they would be likely to apply.  These convictions are not, as is popularly thought, confined to members of any one religion, but this silent majority would avail of an updated law of civil nullity or judicial separation which would not be in conflict with their personal convictions.  They have a right to be heard.  They have a right to be catered for.  In the Ireland of today they are the vast majority and the Government are ignoring their needs and their personal convictions.  The Government's proposals in this referendum will do nothing for them or for the problems with which they are confronted when faced with marriage breakdown and family disruption.  Indeed, the Government must surely be aware of this reality and yet they have chosen to ignore it to date.</P>
    <P>The silent majority of Irish people also know that there are within our society people who want divorce and whose breakdown would not be catered for by even an updated law on civil nullity or judicial separation.  Some of them in fact might be, but others certainly would not.</P>
    <P>It is important that we recognise that the Government's proposals contained in this Bill to amend the Constitution are not designed to cater in any way for the many problems resulting from marriage breakdown with which we are familiar. Nor are they in any way designed to protect or alleviate the problems of existing families.  They are simply intended, if approved by the people, to provide a means whereby a partner to a valid and sustained marriage can be free to enter a second or subsequent marriage with the full support, recognition and backing, not merely of the law, but of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>This then is the context in which we must examine the Coalition Government's proposals.  The people will <Col N="812" /> want to know how divorce can be provided to meet the desires of those who wish to remarry without undermining the many existing marriages or withdrawing the constitutional protection which we have accorded to the family.  This is why we regard this proposed referendum as essentially a social matter with profound implications for the fabric of Irish society. The decisions which we, as a society, make now in this regard will deeply influence the social environment in which our children and our children's children will be reared.  I agree with the Minister when he says that it is unlikely to affect him personally.  There are others of us, hopefully, who could say the same.  We are talking here about the likely effects on our society and an analysis of these so that the pros and cons can be put properly to the people.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that we must critically and constructively examine the Government's proposals and do our utmost to ensure that the people fully appreciate and understand the issues involved, and see them in their proper context.  I would hope that those who present this debate through the media will recognise this proper context, that we are talking here specifically about remarriage. The question of having compassion for those whose marriages have broken down can be catered for in so far as this House or any Legislature can cater for it without a constitutional amendment. Ultimately, the question concerns those who wish to remarry and whether provision should be made in the Constitution, in law, or in both, to meet their desires.</P>
    <P>Those who argue in favour of divorce say that the prohibition on divorce is an injustice to those who have become involved in new relationships, or those who want to become involved.  Although they may live as common law man and wife, they cannot achieve any legal recognition of their new relationship or any adequate legal definition of their new status.  They point out that there is no legislation to provide protection for the parties in the second family.</P>
    <P>The constitutional and legal rights <Col N="813" /> reside with the first family.  These include the right to maintenance, the right to the family home, the right to property and to succession.  They also point out that the rights to social welfare benefits are attached to the first family and cannot be transferred to the second family.  These rights include the contributory widow's pension and deserted wife's benefit, which at present stay with the first wife. It is, of course, open to the second wife to obtain the means-tested allowances from the Department of Social Welfare. It is argued that the parties want the commitment of a marriage and that they do not have that right at present.</P>
    <P>Family lawyers say that the women and children in these second relationships are left in a very vulnerable position.  They claim that a formal remarriage would help the parties to have a greater commitment to each other and would mean that the law would apply to them and protect them.  They regard the right to remarry as a civil right which the State should provide for in law.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, those who argue against divorce say that they fear that divorce would open up the floodgates and lead to an increase in marriage breakdown. There seems to be little doubt that divorce has become commonplace in countries where it is easily available.  We learn that one in two marriages end in divorce in America, and one in three in Great Britain.  Recently I was told it is now one in 2.3 in Great Britain.  But others would say that this is due to a change in social behaviour rather than the availability of divorce <i>per se.</i></P>
    <P>It is also argued that the introduction of divorce would fundamentally change the nature of marriage from a permanent union between husband and wife to a temporary one and that it would undermine the family.  Those who are against divorce fear that the protection at present afforded to marriage and the family under Article 41 of the Constitution would be reduced as rights are taken away from the first family.  They say that those who are having difficulty in marriage will be more inclined to take the easy way out instead of working hard to <Col N="814" /> preserve and revive their marital relationship.  They also point out that women and children would suffer financial hardship if divorce is introduced. They point to the fact that most women and children from first families end up dependent on means-tested social welfare allowances.  This appears to be borne out in practice.  It is due mainly to the inability of a spouse to maintain two homes and two families.</P>
    <P>These, then, are some of the principal pros and cons of introducing a divorce jurisdiction.  They will no doubt be greatly expanded and analysed in the course of the debate.  Suffice it to say for now that there are deeply held and sincere views on this question which are totally in conflict.  Most commentators favour strong protection for the family as the fundamental unit of our society.  The question then is how might second and further relationships be recognised in law and be given the rights they seek without damaging the family and our society as we know and enjoy them today.</P>
    <P>In this context we must consider the Government's proposal to amend the Constitution to permit the introduction of divorce.  The Government propose to amend Article 41 of the Constitution by deleting from it Article 41.3.2.º &mdash; the prohibition on divorce &mdash; and to replace it by a positive provision permitting divorce in the circumstances which are set out.  The wording of the Government's amendment has some unusual features which, on careful analysis, do not accord with the claims being made by the Government for the purpose of selling their proposal.</P>
    <P>We must examine the amendment to determine what exactly it means and what would be its legal effect.</P>
    <P>The amendment or Part II of the Bill states:</P>
    <P>Where, and only where, such court established under this Constitution as may be prescribed by law is satisfied that &mdash;</P>
    <P>i.  a marriage has failed,</P>
    <P>ii.  the failure has continued for a <Col N="815" /> period of, or periods amounting to, at least five years,</P>
    <P>iii.  there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation between the parties to the marriage, and</P>
    <P>iv.  any other condition prescribed by law has been compiled with,</P>
    <P>the court may in accordance with law grant a dissolution of the marriage provided that the court is satisfied that adequate and proper provision having regard to the circumstances will be made for any dependent spouse and for any child of or any child who is dependent on either spouse.</P>
    <P>The unusual, if not extraordinary, feature of this proposal is the fact that the right to a divorce which it creates becomes available where a marriage has &ldquo;failed&rdquo;.  It is the use of the concept &ldquo;failure&rdquo; that makes this proposal extraordinary. Failure is obviously a very subjective criterion.  One might well ask: when has a marriage &ldquo;failed&rdquo;?  Clearly this sets a very low threshold for divorce since a great variety of circumstances could be said to constitute the &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It could be the first row.  It could be an isolated act of adultery, the inability to have children, inadequate sexual relations or inability to communicate adequately.  The courts would take the ordinary meaning of the word &ldquo;failed.&rdquo; The Oxford dictionary describes &ldquo;failure&rdquo; as being unsuccessful.  Indeed, the Irish version of the amendment uses the word &ldquo;theip&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;theip sé&rdquo;.  Obviously the really significant feature of this reliance on the concept of &ldquo;failure&rdquo; is that it could occur long before a separation takes place.  In the statement issued by the Government when the Bill was published it is claimed that the legislation to be enacted providing for divorce would provide that a period of separation of five years would be required before a marriage could be dissolved.</P>
    <P>It is very important to bear in mind that all we are inserting in the Constitution are those words I have quoted, the section in <Col N="816" /> this Bill now before the House.  However good may be the Government's intentions later, however even-handed they may be, they will be constricted and affected by what is inserted in the Constitution at this time.  They should be considered separately, as indeed they were put by the Government when they mentioned them in the first instance.  They say quite clearly that the purpose of their statement is to describe in broad terms the type of divorce legislation which the Government would submit for the consideration of the Oireachtas if the proposal being put in the referendum is approved by the people.  It is very important that the people understand clearly that what is being inserted in the Constitution is what we are debating here today, that the other paper brought out side by side with that statement has no immediate relevance.  It is just a statement of what the Government would hope to do in particular circumstances if the Oireachtas agreed and so forth in the future and depending on what actually happens afterwards.  What we are now doing is putting a definite provision, not into legislation but into the Constitution.  A careful reading of paragraph 14 of the Government statement does not bear out their claim.  The only definite commitment that can be abstracted from the text of this paragraph is to provide a minimum period of two years from the granting of a judicial separation before a dissolution of the marriage can take place.</P>
    <P>In the text of paragraph 16 of the statement headed: &ldquo;Conditions for granting Divorce Applications&rdquo; the concept of failure comes to the fore again linked to adherance to the &ldquo;separation procedures&rdquo; outlined.  Taking all of the confusing information contained in the statement together, all that one can say is that the bottom line of the Government's subsequent intentions is to provide for a minimum period of separation of two years from the granting of a judicial separation, or rule of court.</P>
    <P>However, leaving aside altogether the vagueness of this statement of the Government's intentions, one thing is quite clear, and that is that the claim <Col N="817" /> made by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, that any change or reduction of the alleged five year separation period, or whatever separation period they really have in mind for the legislation to be enacted would require a further referendum, is untrue.  This is so because, as I have already indicated, the &ldquo;failure&rdquo; of a marriage and actual separation are two very different things.  Therefore, legislation which provided for a period of separation, no matter how short that period was, would not be inconsistent with the Government's proposed change to the Constitution.  Indeed, if no period of separation were provided for at all, the legislation would still be consistent with the Government's amendment.  Any change in the legislation which the Government intend to enact, in so far as periods of separation are contained in it, would not require a further referendum.</P>
    <P>It is quite irresponsible of the Government to pretend to the people that the safeguard of another referendum is there when they know, or should know, that no such safeguard exists.</P>
    <P>Before leaving consideration of this aspect of the proposed amendment, it must be noted that in all other jurisdictions that have divorce the concept of irretrievable breakdown is the basis of entitlement to divorce.  This is clearly an objective concept, capable of clear definition and clearly implies and is understood to include separation.  By adopting the concept of &ldquo;failure&rdquo; the Government seem to want to put into the Constitution the most liberal divorce scheme so far devised in any modern society.</P>
    <P>The Government may say that the proviso, that there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation, makes the constitutional provision very restrictive. This, of course, is nonsense as every lawyer familiar with family law practice knows.  All that it takes for a court to be convinced that there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation is for one of the spouses to say that he or she is unwilling to entertain reconciliation.</P>
    <P>At the end of their proposal the Government have included a paragraph which on the face of it purports to protect <Col N="818" /> the interests of dependent spouses and children.  The first thing one can observe about this provision is that in most jurisdictions with &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; divorce similar provisions have been enacted but have been found to be solely platitudinous in that there is no record of a divorce being refused because of the inadequacy of provision for either the dependent spouse or children.  Therefore, in so far as this part of the Government's proposed amendment may be advertised as adequately protecting dependent spouses and children, it must be clearly stated to this House that no such protection exists in this amendment.</P>
    <P>Having considered the text of the Government's amendment, we must now look at the place which it will occupy in the Constitution, if passed by the people, and its effect on the family as the fundamental unit group of society.  It is proposed that this amendment will form part of Article 41 of the Constitution and that, apart from the deletion of Article 41.3.2º and the substitution for it of the proposed amendment, Article 41 will remain the same.  In understanding the effect of the proposed amendment in the overall context of Article 41, it is important to be aware of the nature and purpose of Article 41 in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Here the Government have very specifically and very deliberately decided not just to remove the ban on divorce, although that is a clearcut definite decision. The proposal here before us is (1) to remove the ban on divorce, (2) to put into the Constitution a positive provision for divorce and (3) to put it in the way in which the Government have decided to put it in.  These are the three elements in this question.  It is important to look at Article 41 and indeed Article 42.  These Articles are unique in the sense that they, or something similar, do not occur in the constitutions of other countries.  They therefore represent a unique commitment by the people of Ireland to the family as the fundamental unit group of society and to its rights and welfare. These Articles are the fundamental basis for the various legal protections now enjoyed by the family.  They have been <Col N="819" /> the inspiration and directive force of most of the legislation affecting the family passed since 1937, and have been the bulwark which from time to time has been relied upon to prevent discrimination against the family as an institution.</P>
    <P>Articles 41 and 42 protect and support the family in two directions.  First, they regulate the relationship between the State and the family so as to ensure that the family enjoys fair play.  This is a very real and very important protection for the family in areas such as taxation, social welfare and education.  In 1980, in the case of <i>Murphy v. the Attorney General and Others</i>, section 192 of the Income Tax Act was struck down by the Supreme Court because it was a breach of the pledge by the State to guard with special care the institution of marriage and to protect it against attack.</P>
    <P>Also in 1980, the Supreme Court, in the case of <i>MacDonald v. Feely and Others,</i> came to the aid of a travelling family who were about to be bulldozed off a site.  The plaintiff, Mrs. MacDonald, relied on the protection of Article 41 for the family, and the court, accepting the applicability of Article 41, took the view that:</P>
    <P>Nothing is solved merely by moving such families from place to place.  By doing so, not only is the problem perpetuated, but the claims and rights of children to any kind of education, settled life and future are ignored.</P>
    <P>In the area of education, the fundamental rights of the family guaranteed under Article 42 have been relied upon in a number of cases.  Section 4 of the School Attendance Bill, 1942, was struck down by the Supreme Court on the grounds that it offended Article 42 in three respects.  In the case of <i>Crowley v. Ireland and Others</i> in 1980, members of the Irish National Teachers Organisation, who refused to permit children from a neighbouring parish to be enrolled, were held by the High Court to have breached the children's rights under Article 42.</P>
    <P>Recently, in the Circuit Court in Mayo, <Col N="820" /> the court acquitted a man summoned under the School Attendance Act for failing to send his child to school.  His defence was that he was entitled under Article 42 to educate the child at home and that he was doing this adequately. Articles 41 and 42 are very important to the family in its relationship with the State as they ensure that the basic rights of the family cannot be set aside or supressed.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in discharging its pledge &ldquo;to guard with special care the institution of marriage on which the family is founded&rdquo; the State has enacted several Acts to regulate the relationship between spouses and other members of the family, when this is necessary to secure the overall welfare of the family.</P>
    <P>In this context we can consider the following Acts:</P>
    <P>1.  Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.</P>
    <P>2.  Succession Act, 1965.</P>
    <P>3.  Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.</P>
    <P>4.  Family Home Protection Act, 1976.</P>
    <P>5.  Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>The first of these Acts permits the parents to call on the courts to adjudicate on disputes between them as to the parenting of their children.</P>
    <P>The Succession Act, 1965, gives a spouse a legal right to the estate of the other, notwithstanding the provision of any will.  Where there are no children, that legal right is to half the estate and where there are children, it is to one-third of the estate.  On a death intestate, the Act gives the surviving spouse two-thirds of the estate and the children one-third between them in equal shares.  The Act also, in section 117, imposes on parents a moral duty to provide out of their estates for their children and the courts can change the distribution of an estate to ensure that that duty is fulfilled.</P>
    <P>The Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, gives a dependent spouse an unrestricted right to maintenance for herself and any <Col N="821" /> dependent children.  This right is unrestricted in the sense that its exercise does not require that there be desertion or even that a separation should have taken place.  All that is required is that there has been a failure to maintain by the supporting spouse.</P>
    <P>The Family Home Protection Act, 1976, gives either spouse the legal right to prevent the sale of the family home, in that the sale of any family home now requires the written consent of the spouse who is not the legal owner of the home. This is an extremely important right, because it gives a dependent spouse security in his or her home.  The loss of this right and security on being divorced would be catastrophic.</P>
    <P>The Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, through the provision of barring orders and their efficient enforcement gives vulnerable spouses and children protection from marital violence.  The question of family violence has been raised by those who are pressing for divorce and it is one in which they would seek to have similar protection under the law.</P>
    <P>Articles 41, and 42, are the foundation of this whole scheme of legislation and the basis of the relationship between the family and the State.  It is important, therefore, to consider the effect which any change or changes in either of these two Articles can have in this whole area of social planning and engineering.</P>
    <P>To begin to get a clear idea of the role of the Government's proposed amendment, as part of Article 41, it is worthwhile to quote the entire Article in its proposed amended form.  The following would be the amended format of Article 41, if the Government's proposal were accepted:</P>
    <P>Article 41.1.1º: The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> Article 41.1.2º: The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its Constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.</P>
    <P>Article 41.2.1º: In particular, the State recognises that by her life within the home, a woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.</P>
    <P>Article 41.2.2º: The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.</P>
    <P>Article 41.3.1º: The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of marriage, on which the family is founded, and to protect it against attack.</P>
    <P>The changed part of the Article is therefore:</P>
    <P>Article 41.3.2º: Where, and only where, such court established under this Constitution as may be prescribed by law is satisfied that:</P>
    <P>(i)  a marriage has failed,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the failure has continued for a period of, or periods amounting to, at least five years,</P>
    <P>(iii)  there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation between the parties to the marriage, and</P>
    <P>(iv)  any other condition prescribed by law has been complied with, the court may in accordance with law grant a dissolution of the marriage provided that the court is satisfied that adequate and proper provision having regard to the circumstances will be made for any dependent spouse and for any child of or any child who is dependent on either spouse.</P>
    <P>That is where it goes in the context of the other Articles.</P>
    <P>Article 41.3.3º: No person whose <Col N="823" /> marriage has been dissolved under the civil law of any other State but is a subsisting valid marriage under the law for the time being in force within the jurisdiction of the Government and Parliament established by this Constitution shall be capable of contracting a valid marriage within that jurisdiction during the lifetime of the other party to the marriage dissolved.</P>
    <P>That would be Article 41, as amended, if the Government's proposal is carried by the people.  A careful appraisal of Article 41, as proposed to be amended, immediately invites inquiry as to the interaction of the amendment and the original portion, and its effect in particular on a family founded on a marriage that is now dissolved.</P>
    <P>As can be seen from the Article and as has been determined by the Supreme Court in the case of the State, <i>Nicolaou v. An Bord Uchtála 1966</i>, the inalienable and imprescriptible rights, recognised by Article 41, attach to the family &ldquo;founded on marriage&rdquo; only and to no other familial type group.  It is important that we recognise that the Constitution states very clearly, and by putting this section in where the Government intend it, that the imprescriptible and inalienable rights will attach to the second family.  That is the intention of the amendment and that then would presumably have the full force of the other parts of Article 41.  The first family will not have it, because it will not be the family founded on marriage at that stage.</P>
    <P>If the marriage is dissolved manifestly that foundation no longer exists.  What then is the constitutional status of the first or divorced family?  Reason and logic compel the awful conclusion that these families are, after a dissolution of the marriage, no longer recognised by Article 41 and, therefore, outside its powerful protection.  They would become constitutional orphans.  The mind boggles at the possible consequences of this situation.</P>
    <P>No longer would the first or divorced family be able to rely on either Article 41 or Article 42 to protect itself against <Col N="824" /> any unjust discrimination or oppression against it by the State, such as in the area of taxation, social welfare, education and, indeed, in all other areas where the State might enact legislation concerning the relationship between the State and divorced families.</P>
    <P>Worse still a divorced family without the protection of Article 41, would find itself hopelessly disadvantaged in the areas of succession, maintenance and security in the family home.  This would be particularly so, where the breadwinner remarries and then has to support two families.</P>
    <P>In this situation, the new or second family would be a family &ldquo;founded on marriage&rdquo; and, therefore, the one protected by Article 41, and enjoying the State's pledge to &ldquo;guard with special care the institution of marriage... and to protect it against attack&rdquo;.  The new family would inevitably claim constitutional priority over the first family.</P>
    <P>In the inevitable competition between the new family and the first family for the scarce financial resources available it is certain that any legislation which supported the divorced family, however even-handed it might be between the two families, would be challenged by the new family on the basis that it failed to satisfy the State's pledge to it, to guard it with special care and protect it from attack. The logic and reason of such a challenge would be hard to resist.  This seems to create a difficulty in relation to the way in which the Government have introduced the proposed amendment. Although they may intend in future to bring in a very caring, compassionate and even-handed legislation to cater for the needs of the first family, they could find that because of the way in which they have decided to place this positive provision for divorce in the Constitution it may have adverse effects which it would not be possible to overcome.</P>
    <P>In the area of succession the wife would lose her present entitlements.  The children of the first family might find their claims to the estate of a deceased divorced parent resisted by the legal wife at <Col N="825" /> the date of death, on the grounds that the children of the second marriage should have priority.  Thus, those legislative provisions which distribute shares on intestacy to children of the dissolved marriage could be challenged and the State compelled to enact legislation excluding the children of the first marriage from succeeding to the estate of a deceased divorced parent.  Likewise, the moral duty imposed by section 117 of the Succession Act could be defeated so far as the children of the first marriage are concerned.</P>
    <P>The effects of the proposed amendment on succession would have very serious implications for the farming community. For example, if a farmer gets divorced the wife who may have contributed substantially to the development of the farm as a farming enterprise will, in the first instance, be deprived of her home on the farm and her way of life.  If the farmer dies intestate, she will have no share in the inheritance.  Her children may also be excluded from inheriting even though one or more of them may have been working the farm with the father before his death.</P>
    <P>In the area of maintenance, legislation providing maintenance for the first family could be challenged where there would not be enough to keep two families.  In this area the new family could legitimately claim the lion's share, if not all, and any legislation which failed to secure sufficient for the new family would fall to a constitutional challenge.</P>
    <P>The right of the first family to remain in the family home would be threatened. Where the remarried spouse could not afford to provide a new house for the second family it is hard to see the existing protection afforded by the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, being left with the first family.  Inevitably, the sale of the original family home would be forced by the second family, and if any legislation prevented this, inevitably it would have to yield to a constitutional challenge by the second family.</P>
    <P>These conclusions are not fanciful possibilities. They arise directly from a reasoned interpretation of the interaction <Col N="826" /> between the original part of Article 41 and the Government's proposed amendment. The extraordinary and terrible result is that Article 41, which should protect the family, becomes the instrument with which the family is oppressed.</P>
    <P>If this proposed amendment is put into the Constitution and divorce becomes common, as it has in other countries, legal reasons will be sought for terminating the financial shackles of previous marriages. This trend has clearly emerged already in Britain and the USA.  In this context the Government's proposed amendment could in future be used as a sledgehammer to crush the rights of the first family, which will have lost its present constitutional protection.  Could it be that the Government have unwittingly created a &ldquo;constitutional Frankenstein&rdquo; which may sleep for a time but then rise and stalk the land?</P>
    <P>The Government had the option of simply removing the ban on divorce which is continued in Article 41.3.2º. Instead they chose to replace it with a very positive and forceful constitutional provision for divorce.  This may well create enormous constitutional difficulties which the Government do not appear to have foreseen.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to this in the course of his speech.  He said that to delete the present prohibition would run the risk that any subsequent divorce legislation that might be enacted might be seen to be in conflict with other provisions of the Constitution guaranteeing the protection of the family and the marriage.  I brought up that point and made a submission on it at the Oireachtas Joint Committee. As has been said publicly and in the media the simple answer was just to remove the ban on divorce and subsequently to allow the Legislature to bring in some form of legal remedy for people who wish to remarry.  At that time I pointed out that there was a likelihood that the provision which would be brought in by legislation could not stand against the positive protections for the family in Article 41.  The Minister is taking much the same line on it now.</P>
    <P>Instead of doing that the Minister has <Col N="827" /> chosen, perhaps somewhat hurriedly, to take out the section referring to the ban and to insert another section.  There could be a great danger in that.  We could run into the kinds of difficulties which I have mentioned here.  This will need to be considered very carefully on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The legal and welfare costs of marriage breakdown are already substantial. Deserted wives and dependants' benefits and allowances are estimated to cost £33 million this year.  Civil legal aid, which is mainly expended on marital problems, amounts to £1.5 million at present.  In addition, community welfare officers through supplementary family welfare payments and voluntary aid societies through income supplements, also support broken families.</P>
    <P>The main effects of the Government's proposed amendment will be (a) to formally recognise and accept responsibility for the spouse and children of a second or subsequent marriage.  Thus if a male spouse is unemployed or ill the State will accept responsibility for, and make payments in respect of, his wife and dependent children of the second marriage. Similarly, death, dental, widows and other benefits will have to be paid by the State to dependants of the second family; (b) almost inevitably the State will incur the cost of maintaining the majority of the first or divorced families.  It may be necessary to introduce a new payment entitled social assistance (divorced) which would replace deserted wives' payments, since the deserted wives will no longer be wives nor technically be deserted.  It would also presumably replace widows' pensions for deserted wives if they were to be considered eligible for social assistance.  In reality there would be two widows but since the law will recognise the widow of the second family, the widow from the first family will lose benefit and fall onto means-tested assistance schemes for herself and her children.  Widows' contributory pensions for 1986 cost £209 million.</P>
    <P>The State is likely to incur the added cost of litigation arising from conflict <Col N="828" /> between the second or subsequent families, and the members of the first family, in regard to such matters as the family home and possessions, maintenance, and the custody and education of children. Who then will pay the bulk of these costs? Under the Government's constitutional amendment the State will be forced to protect the second family's rights.  The Legislature will not be able to decide otherwise.  Therefore, it seems inevitable that in the majority of cases the State, that is, the taxpayer, will be left to foot the bill for both families.  If in practice divorce leads to an increase in breakdown then the extra cost will be even greater.</P>
    <P>The question to be decided is whether the particular constitutional amendment that is before the House is an appropriate amendment to put before the people. The Government are convinced that the approach which they are taking is sufficiently restrictive to permit divorce while at the same time safeguarding, as far as possible, the interests of the family unit. Following a critical analysis of the text one is forced to the conclusion that the amendment as worded does not appear to meet the Government's stated intentions. If adopted it will lead to a very liberal and unrestricted divorce jurisdiction, with damaging consequences for the stability of the family unit.</P>
    <P>The main implications of the text are:</P>
    <P>1&mdash;A very low threshold is to be used to decide if a marriage is no longer viable.  The term &ldquo;failed&rdquo; is so subjective and undefined that the courts will find it impossible to avoid a liberal and unrestricted basis for divorce.</P>
    <P>2&mdash;The use of the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo; will permit unilateral divorce at the request of one party only.  A court will have no other option but to accept the view of one of the parties that the marriage has failed regardless of the view of the other spouse.</P>
    <P>3&mdash;It allows for divorce on demand once the couple have been married for five years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> 4&mdash;It is particularly inadequate in providing financial support and security for a divorced spouse and the children of the first family.  The financial needs of, say, the wife and the children will be determined once and for all at the date of divorce.  The proposed constitutional provision will not permit these needs to be reviewed over the years should circumstances change for example, due to serious long term illness or accident.  Under existing legislation all provisions for maintenance of spouses and children can be reviewed by the courts as the circumstances require.</P>
    <P>5&mdash;It gives no constitutional protection whatever to a spouse who is considered not to be dependent on the spouse seeking the divorce.  For example, is a wife to be considered a non-dependent spouse because she is capable of working and, therefore, to be forced to go out and work to support the children? In any case a non-dependent spouse is excluded from consideration, and from any protection, under this Government's proposed constitutional amendment.  The amendment states that very clearly and relates very directly to a dependent spouse.</P>
    <P>6&mdash;The proposed amendment provides no protection for assets or any source of income, for example, a shop or farm, which may belong to, say, the husband, but which was built up over the years by the mutual efforts of both spouses.</P>
    <P>7&mdash;The succession or inheritance rights of a spouse and children of the first marriage are left unprotected and are transferred to the second family.</P>
    <P>8&mdash;Existing social welfare benefits, for example, widows' pension, deserted wife's benefit and dental benefit, are transferred to the second wife.  The State would presumably assist the divorced wife <Col N="830" /> and children on a means-tested social assistance basis.</P>
    <P>9&mdash;The rights and protections which are enshrined in the Irish Constitution, and are designed to protect the family based on marriage, would be transferred to the second marriage.  The divorced spouse and children of the first marriage would become &ldquo;constitutional orphans&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Marriage is an institution the stability and well-being of which are essential to the stability and welfare of society as a whole.  Virtually every civilisation has recognised the protection of the family as the necessary basis of social order and indispensable to the welfare of its people. Hence the introduction of divorce laws or laws providing easier access to divorce always have involved controversial debate.  Such issues must be considered in the light of the system of values, the traditions and welfare of each particular society.  What is good for one society is not necessarily good for another.  Much depends on the values of the society concerned, its priorities as well as the nature and scale of the problems of marital breakdown experienced.</P>
    <P>No society has seen the provision of divorce as a desirable end in itself.  It has invariably been introduced as the lesser of two evils in a situation where there is a high rate of marital breakdown.  No society, no national Legislature, no major political party, no professional institution concerned with social welfare has, to the best of my knowledge, ever maintained that the introduction or facilitating of divorce would have no ill effects on the status or stability of the institution of marriage.  On the contrary, all societies which have introduced divorce have recognised its negative and destabilising effects on marriage and society generally, and have introduced it in spite of these factors, because it was seen to be &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; in their particular circumstances. In stating that a law providing for divorce will have these attendant negative consequences for society I may perhaps be stating the obvious, but I do so for good reasons.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" /> To be placed in the balance against the negative consequences for the institution of marriage and society as a whole, which the introduction of divorce will inevitably bring, are the negative consequences which its absence may have on a proportion of our people whose marriages are irretrievably broken down and who, in turn, have or wish to start a new family with another partner.</P>
    <P>One of the first questions which the people have to decide, therefore, is whether the nature and extent of the problem of marital breakdown is of a sufficient degree and magnitude to justify the introduction of any kind of divorce with all its attendant ill-effects on the status and stability of the institution of marriage.  It is a question of judgment as to where the interest of the common good lies in this difficult and complex issue and a judgment which each individual voter must make for himself or herself when he or she has taken all the material factors into account.  The Minister referred to this in his statement.  He said that in the Government's considered view the balance of social good lies with the introduction of divorce in limited circumstances. I say this is a question of the interest of the common good and the social good and that is a matter that only the people can decide.</P>
    <P>Bearing these features in mind and having regard to the social nature of the issue with its implications which are fundamental to the very order and fabric of our society, it is, as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, not one for party political poses.  It is necessary, however, that all those who participate in this debate inside or outside the House, present clearly, and I hope objectively, a complete picture of all the implications of the proposal. As the major Opposition party, it is the duty of Fianna Fáil to examine the proposal critically, in the best sense of the word, both as to the fundamental principle behind the proposed amendment, namely, the introduction of divorce and as to the nature and terms of the specific proposal having regard to the text of the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="832" /> In this context, I wish to turn to another reason for having stated the obvious with regard to the negative effects which divorce will inevitably leave on the stability of marriage as an institution.  Fine Gael have circulated a document, in substance a propaganda document, which is intended to put the official Fine Gael case in support of the introduction of divorce in this country.  It is entitled <i>Fine Gael &mdash; Marriage, Separation and Divorce</i> and bears all the hallmarks of the so-called national handlers with the smooth language and presentation one normally associates with the advertising of soap powders.  It does little credit to Fine Gael and an injustice to the complexity of this issue, which is of such importance both to those who already favour divorce and those who oppose it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The document is clearly calculated to convey, and does convey, that the divorce proposal now before the House will not affect the stability of marriage in any way.  That is a false message and is misinformation that should be seen for what it is at the outset.  The issue going before the people is not whether divorce, in whatever form, will have destabilising effects on the institution of marriage but whether these negative effects for society are outweighed by the need to cater for those who wish to remarry.</P>
      <P>The message being propagated by this document goes even further.  By the slick juxtaposition of the second and third of a series of contrived questions, the document manages to convey that divorce will actually stabilise society.  As stated already, no credible social or political commentator can seriously advance this contention.  To do so can only be calculated to mislead the people as to the issues on which they are being asked to pass judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael document sets out to present the availability of divorce as a desirable end in itself.  This distorts the issue.  The real issue stems from a conflict between (a) the needs of the minority <Col N="834" /> proportion of our people who have suffered or will suffer a breakdown in their marriage, and who wish to remarry, and (b) the need for society to protect the institution of marriage from being undermined and destabilised in the interests of the common good of society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>If one examines specific cases of marital breakdown and considers their plight in isolation from society as a whole, one will find cases where compassion alone would lead one to favour the introduction of divorce, having regard to the plight and human needs of the individuals concerned.  The difficulties arise when one moves away from considering cases of marital breakdown, individually or collectively, and one examines the introduction of divorce in the context of society as a whole.  A new divorce law will not simply affect those who have suffered marital breakdown but will apply to every citizen who enters into the marriage bond.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would ask the Deputies behind him to keep quiet.  Up to the present time our human perception and response to the <Col N="835" /> institution of marriage has been conditioned by its permanence and indissolubility in civil law.  Anybody who maintains that our perception and response as a society to the marriage bond will not be altered once divorce, in whatever form, is introduced will be deluding himself or herself, or is seeking to delude others.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt in my mind that the concept and perception of marriage and its traditional role in society will change if divorce is introduced.  This is not to say that this fact alone must defeat the proposal at present before the House. What must be said, however, is that each voter should appreciate these implications when he or she comes to make his or her judgement on the issue.  The implications to which I have referred will not simply affect those already in the marital state today but will continue to make an ever-increasing impact on the younger generations as they approach and undertake the marriage bond. Divorce must inevitably have similar negative effects in store for the children of those marriages.</P>
      <P>It is this potential change in the role of marriage and the status of the family in the Irish society of the future which has to be placed in the balance on one side, with the real human needs of those whose marriages have broken down irretrievably and who wish to remarry on the other.</P>
      <P>In recent public discussions and reports there has been a major emphasis on marriages which have broken down, to the exclusion of the positive and beneficial influence which the success of the vast majority of marriages has had in our society.  The family has been the primary source of joy and happiness in the lives of the vast majority of our people in spite of any difficulties which, on account of our inherent human frailties, may be encountered from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seeking to protect and cherish the family is not the pursuit of some arid or sectarian principle, as some would have us believe.  Nor is it simply a question of <Col N="836" /> clinging to outmoded conservative precepts. Rather, it is the duty of all citizens, and especially of the legislators, to promote the common good by protecting the family and the institution on which it is founded, as the natural and primary source of human satisfaction.</P>
    <P>Further we must remember that the great majority of marriages are successful. It is against this background that we must consider the Government's proposed amendment to provide for divorce. The Government's proposal will certainly provide for divorce and for remarriage. How this specific proposal will affect the common good and family life as we now know it, is a matter for judgment.  Whatever the result of this debate and of the proposed referendum, society will still have to protect the family as the necessary basis for social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the nation and the State.</P>
    <P>The overriding goal must be to protect for the benefit of this and future generations of our society the family based on the institution of marriage.  We must protect it from serious or undue injury. Whether this can be achieved in a manner consistent with divorce is something which only society itself can answer through the ballot box.  We are not opposed to the holding of the referendum and we are not opposing the Second Stage of this Bill.  We have examined the Government's proposals constructively and given our views in a constructive way. It may be that the Minister does not like my saying particular things but the different points in an argument should be dealt with in the open here in this House. Let people take their decision subsequently.</P>

      <P>I have analysed the matter as clearly as I can and I have found that many of the statements used by the Minister have come from inputs we made to the Oireachtas joint committee.  We are fully prepared to participate in constructive debate and discussion in this area.  Our party have taken the particular decision that we are not opposed to the holding of the referendum and that we will not campaign politically.  If the Minister's party, or a section of it, want to campaign politically, let them do so.  our party have taken their own democratic decision not to oppose the holding of the referendum but to discuss and critically analyse the proposals.  I have given the House my views and the Minister has an opportunity to respond when replying to Second Stage or on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>There are concerns about the way in which the Minister and the Government have chosen to go about this amendment. I have outlined them as clearly as I can and we will await the Minister's reply. I appeal for objective, full, frank and constructive discussion.  I also hope the Minister will ensure that the people are fully informed on this issue.  it is one of our major objectives to ensure that people can make a mature decision in the light of all the facts involved.  We will accept their decision.</P>

      <P>I should like to compliment Deputy Woods on the excellence <Col N="838" /> of his contribution to this debate.  He has outlined in minute detail most of the important factors of concern to me.  He has, however, made my job a little more difficult because it would be unnecessarily repetitious if I were to use all the material I had intended.  I will not take up the time of the House by so doing.</P>
      <P>The basic issue in relation to divorce is one which is often disregarded by individualistic liberal opinion, that is, whether the sum total of human happiness in society is more likely to be served by permitting unions to be terminated and new unions to be entered into, with all the possible adverse effects, especially on children.  It is very striking that the issue never seems to have been argued in terms of any empirical evidence.  That is an extract from an address by Dr. Garret FitzGerald to the Law Students Debating Society of Ireland at King's Inns on Tuesday, 8 November 1977.  It would appear that at that time the present Taoiseach had his finger on the pulse of reality and it is hard to understand how his opinions can have changed so much.  One must ask the reason for this great rush to introduce a divorce culture into our society.</P>
      <P>I had occasion on Monday night to be on a public platform with Deputy Barnes. In the course of the discussion she asserted, among many other things, that since we were the only remaining country in Europe which had not yet introduced divorce we more or less had an obligation to do so as soon as possible.  Those were not her exact words but that seemed to be the intent of the comment made.  If that is the reason this country finds itself debating this topic it is reprehensible and unfortunate.  Once before in our history this island was out of step with Europe but at that time Europe was going through what history afterwards recorded as the Dark Ages.  If we had not had the good sense to be different then, Europe might not be the place it is today. I hope it will not be a good enough reason for us to change our attitude to the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make some comment about the media and their performance to date since this issue was introduced.  There has <Col N="839" /> been a notable play-up of the issue of divorce in the mass media.  Almost every day on television or radio there are commentators giving all the hard luck stories. It is necessary for us, because of that tendency to summon emotion-charged arguments, to remove the prejudices in our mind and think clearly about the reality of marriage and the cold facts about divorce.  The proponents trump up the perpetual hard cases and that is the way divorce started in Italy, France and every other country throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>What started off as looking for protection for the hard cases is now a tide which has swept over Europe and it appears to be unstoppable.  If it were a valid argument that the hard cases deserve the kind of consideration we are told they should get and if that were all that would happen and divorce would not escalate, throughout the countries of Europe where it has been introduced only a small percentage of marriages would encounter divorce problems.  That has not happened.  The facts attest to the very opposite.  Once the floodgates to divorce are opened it will lead to demands for more divorce and we might as well be trying to hold back the tide with our hands.  The job will be impossible.</P>
    <P>We are being presented with this demand to introduce divorce because of the findings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, which was presented in March 1985 and contained the following statement:</P>
    <P>Large-scale unemployment, poor housing and inadequate financial resources can, individually or collectively, place a marriage under strain and can exacerbate problems which may exist within that marriage already.</P>
    <P>Financial strain is one of the major factors in marriage breakdown.  It is impossible for me or any rational person to understand how the Government, armed with that information, could proceed to remove, in the last budget, the last vestige of support for the family by taking away the last £100 that was there as a tax concession to the breadwinner.  Those in <Col N="840" /> the 35 per cent bracket gained 2p per week per child; those in the 45 per cent bracket lost 23p per week per child and those in the 58 per cent bracket lost 42p per week per child.  The Government have not recognised the need to support the family.  There is something incongrous in a Government that wilfully removes the support that is there.  It is worthy of note that successive Governments since 1957 have launched on a course of, year after year, whittling away the support for the family.  If the tax free allowance that existed in 1957 existed today, and if it had kept pace with inflation, the father of a family would have £1,200 tax free for every child.  We all know that has not happened.  So how can people be so surprised when they hear that there are many marriages breaking down?  The wonder of it is that any marriages can still exist, because it is almost impossible for people to survive with escalating prices and more and more being taken out of their pockets.  The equal pay decision of 1974 made it a crime for an employer to give a married man extra pay to support his children.  I consider that irresponsible and unconstitutional treatment has been doled out to the family and it is no wonder that they find themselves in trouble.</P>
    <P>The cure-all for all of these ills appears to be the introduction of a divorce culture at a time when in this little impoverished nation the total revenue coming from the PAYE sector amounting to £19 million only goes part way to paying the interest on the massive national debt of £20,000 million.  I suggest that it will be very difficult to get that overburdened taxpayer to put his hand still deeper into his pocket in order to support the divorce culture that will ensue if this referendum were, God forbid, to be passed.  I had a question down during the week for the Taoiseach and for the Minister for Finance. I asked the Minister for Finance had he calculated the likely cost factor involved.  Even at local authority level if one makes a recommendation that costs money, one must say where that money is to come from and how much it is likely <Col N="841" /> to be.  It is a fair question to ask in this instance.  How much money will be required to support the divorce culture and where is it going to come from?  We do not have to worry about where it is going to come from because there is only one source it can come from, that is, the already over-burdened taxpayer.</P>
    <P>When I asked the Taoiseach about the effects of this legislation on women I was told that it was a hypothetical question, that it had not happened yet and therefore it could not be answered.  I made a calculation of the likely cost to the taxpayer.  We already know for certain that £33 million is being paid out to deserted wives and £31 million per annum to unmarried mothers.  We are told that there are 70,000 people out there living in utter misery and abject despair waiting to have the opportunity to remarry.  It is fair to assume that the majority of them will be rushing into the courts if the facility becomes available.  Assuming that 35,000 of them are women, I estimate that it would cost about £200 million, taking into account the degree of social welfare that we are now paying to those already deserted and the kind of services that we are assured will be provided &mdash; for example, court structures and medical and legal facilities.  This is a conservative estimate.</P>
    <P>That is very interesting.  In providing the services necessary for the victims, that is the women and children, of this Bill we would have to provide conciliation services, health board grants and services, social workers, home advisory personnel, extra psychiatric and psychological services, medical cards, free legal aid, half-way homes for those families in the process of breaking up, new family courts with all of their accoutrements and paraphernalia, ever-increasing social welfare for women and children and, of course, the numerous factors can never be costed &mdash; the effect on the shattered lives of the unfortunate children who will be the real victims and who in fact will have no say in what their parents do.  The evidence abounding from where these cultures exist is that the children are <Col N="842" /> treated savagely by the parents, perhaps not intentionally, but that is what happens to them because they love both parents and it is now agreed by many sociologists that a child is better off with parents who have the odd falling-out or disruption at home than without one of them.</P>

      <P>A factor which is emerging more and more in Great Britain and elsewhere is the risk to young girls in particular where the new father figure, a stranger, no blood relation, enters the household.  An increasing number of headlines are appearing in the British newspapers of sexual abuse of young girls in their own homes.  We all agree that this is horrifying but these are consequences of the divorce culture and these facts cannot be denied.  The world is a sociological reservoir where evidence of this sort abounds and anyone who is not prepared to accept this is not prepared to face reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="843" /> The effects on women especially warrants some comment, and Deputy Woods mentioned them.  The Minister said the children will have succession rights but no account is taken of the woman who is discarded.  The woman will be the victim of this legislation, the cast aside spouse. Evidence proves that her status in society is seriously diminished.  A very small percentage of Irish women are in the workforce &mdash; I think around 12 per cent &mdash; and an even smaller percentage are professionals. The rest would be employed in shops or offices and would not have job security.  It follows from this that most of the people affected by this legislation would have to fall back on the resources of the State.</P>
    <P>As I said, these women are denied succession rights but the position as regards family home protection is self evident.  If a husband leaves his wife and children, what family home are we talking about?  Reason would suggest that the family home is that of the second liaison. The Constitution is to protect the family but a women case aside is not a family. She becomes a non-person.  She loses all protection under the Constitution.  The wife and the children are diminished.  But the opposite happens to the male.  He will have formed an alliance with somebody in the workforce who is bringing in plenty of money.  That is all he is interested in. This is what has happened everywhere else and it will happen here.  It occurs to me that any woman voting for divorce is like a turkey voting for Christmas.</P>
    <P>The important point here is that the children of the divorced spouse are at risk.  They are living with their mother and she is not part of a family.  Article 42 says the duty of parents is to &ldquo;provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children&rdquo;.  She probably does not have the resources to do that and she is left in a very vulnerable position.</P>
    <P>We are being asked here to delete Article 41.3.2º which says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="844" /> No law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage.</P>
    <P>When we look at what remains of Article 41 after the deletion of that paragraph, and even including the failure process, it does not have any real meaning.  It becomes a contradiction because this Article &ldquo;recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law&rdquo;.  That suggests that anything which would interfere with the family, as we are doing here, would bring that protection to nought.  It takes on the connotation of an Irish joke.  Here we have an Article which says we cannot pass laws which will interfere with the family and we are now doing exactly that. I firmly believe this is an Irish joke and I am sure when the legal people look at it they will agree with me.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go into the difference between the words &ldquo;failure&rdquo; and &ldquo;separation&rdquo; because there is no connection.  I reiterate that to include what is suggested here &mdash; that a marriage has failed, that the failure has continued for a period or periods amounting to at least five years and that there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation and that any other condition prescribed by law has been complied with &mdash; is a recipe for the most liberal form of divorce ever introduced. It took England 100 years to legislate to the point from which we are starting.  Can you visualise a situation in these costly courts which will be set up where a couple are confronted with a judge who is handing down a judgement on his interpretation of that section?  Who can say what failure is.  Can any of us?  I believe that would be extremely difficult to do.  I honestly believe a confidence trick is being played on our people with this suggestion. I do not give two hoots what is in the statement on Government's intentions with regard to Marriage, Separation and Divorce, 23 April, 1986, because it is of no consequence.  That is another day's work and should not even be referred to here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="845" /> One thing I am certain of is that there is not one word about separation in the proposed amendment to the Constitution but it is referred to in the document and from that it appears that separation can be cumulative or retrospective.  In the document it would appear that no fault divorce is what we are talking about, and that almost on demand.  Great Britain has supposedly a two year embargo before a divorce is granted, and in Belgium it is three years.  Those times were written into the legislation, but of course the people concerned all go to the courts and now there is no longer even any pretence that that has any validity.  They can get divorce almost on demand.  I have heard lately that it may be possible shortly to get divorces by post.  Anybody who believes that we cannot go down that road is just not prepared to face reality.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods has referred to much of the matter that I had intended to speak about and I will not take up the time of the House because other people are trying to get in on this debate.  I would like to comment about the proposed courts. There will be judges specially qualified to deal with marriage breakdown cases, but where are they likely to look for guidance in these cases?  I suggest that they will look where they have been looking in the recent past for cases of this nature.  They will look to America, the only other country governed by a constitution as we are, and it is of assistance in this matter to see what the Americans are doing. What are they doing in America at the moment?  One marriage in three breaks down in divorce.  Thousands of men are incarcerated in jails because they will not or cannot pay alimony.  When the women go into court in pursuit of their alimony they are told in effect by the judges &ldquo;Do not waste out time.  You are an able-bodied woman.  Go and work for yourself. He is not married to you any longer and cannot afford to keep two homes.&rdquo; That is the situation in a nutshell.</P>
    <P>My task has been lightened because of Deputy Wood's contribution.  Let me say that I pray that God will save Ireland, its families and its Constitution, which has <Col N="846" /> stood us in good stead.  To use present day parlance, there is hardly a nation out there now suffering from that culture that would not give an arm and a leg to have the protection we enjoy and which I hope we will not be foolish enough to throw away at the behest of the individualist liberals whom the Taoiseach referred to in his address to the Law Society.  I am not afraid of the referendum or of putting the matter out to the people.  I have grave reservations about the wording and the effect it will have and I am glad that we do not have to vote here on this because I would have great difficulty in deciding how to vote.  I would need two votes, one to reject the wording and one to vote for the referendum.</P>
    <P>The principle of subsidiary function is well known and cherished.  It means that it is gravely wrong and an evil for a greater institution to take on what a lesser institution can do as well or better.  What about the family in that regard?  This State in wanting to interfere in the family is doing evil and a grave wrong.  Anyone who doubts that should remember what happened to the local authorities when subsidiary function was cast to the wind and big brother was supposed to take up the bill.  We know today that the essence of it is that not alone have we not got the money to provide roads, but we have not even got the money to paint road signs.  If such effect were to fall on the families of this land it would be a poor day for all of us.  On this issue I suggest that the new divide here in politics is not on party, religion, education or so on.  Some of us are wise enough to want to preserve what is good and has served us.  The new liberal wing want to throw it overboard and join their colleagues in the EC and every country in Europe.  That is not for the common good.  The Taoiseach referred to the social good.  That is a doubtful aim.  I am concerned about the common good and the people of this nation.  Not only will I vote against the introduction of divorce when I get to the ballot box, but I will work night and day to inform and to encourage everyone I can to do the same, <Col N="847" /> to go out in throngs and say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to this evil recommendation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on the divorce debate as it is a social issue related to marital problems. Let me refer to the excellent report placed before this House last December by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  This report highlighted an in-depth study of marital problems. In the Dáil then I made the point that I hoped that the Government would take note of the areas where this committee were unanimous, especially on the setting up of a new family court and in regard to education, counselling and the legal age for marriage, and that legislation should be introduced as soon as possible on these issues.  I look forward to that legislation.</P>
      <P>That excellent report provided much useful information.  The report indicated that the majority of the committee did not regard divorce legislation as essential or desirable at this time.  Definite figures for marriage breakdown are not available.  Various figures have been thrown around, 36,000 to 70,000 people supposedly being affected.  Such statements are misleading.  Circumstances indicate that if divorce were introduced into this country it would not provide the solution to the breakdown of even one marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that we should have divorce in limited circumstances. The usual expression used here is &ldquo;no fault divorce&rdquo;.  Where no fault divorce has been introduced, even on a limited basis, a snowball effect has ensued and divorce on demand has been the eventual result.  If we decide to legislate for divorce as a result of this referendum we will leave ourselves open in many ways.  We are no different as human beings from any others.  Recent census figures in the UK show that a divorced woman who remarries is twice as likely to divorce as a woman marrying for the first time.  One must take into account the long term impact on the children of divorced <Col N="848" /> parents especially in relation to their perception of future marriage.  Research seems to suggest a link between childhood experience and adult divorce. Family breakup is a factor in juvenile problems, personality disorders and so on.  The very basis of any Christian community is the family.  It is given a special place in the Constitution and should be protected.  Therefore, we should be talking about and tackling the problems which lead to marriage breakdown and which undermine family life.</P>
    <P>In 1984 a survey was carried out in a Dublin constituency into marriage breakdown which showed that in 67 per cent of cases alcohol was the main reason. Should we not be tackling this problem? Over indulgence in alcohol leads to many marital problems.  We also have a problem in regard to teenage drinking and, after all, the teenagers of today will be the married couples of tomorrow. Even if alcohol is a major problem in marriage breakdown, divorce will not solve it.  In many instances those who are divorced once will not successfully re-marry and will be divorced again.  A leading marriage counsellor said that research all over the world has shown that, when people under the age of 20 years marry, there is a high risk of future marriage dissolution and divorce.  That report is very important as it deals with preparation for marriage and suggests that it should be incorporated in our educational system at primary level.</P>
    <P>It is also important that young people should learn about personal relationships, communication, affection and understanding.  Perhaps, more than anything else today, young people need counselling before marriage.  I appeal for support for the counselling service available at present and I should like to see it extended.  I am very conscious of the problems within marriage and the many young people affected by such problems.  However, divorce is not the solution.  In the past few weeks there were statements from prominent legal people pointing out that there is a fundamental flaw in the proposed legislation in allowing the grounds for divorce to hinge <Col N="849" /> on the question of marriage failure.  A period of five years has been mentioned and I should like to refer to the point made by Deputy Woods that a very low threshold is to be used to decide if a marriage is no longer viable.  The term &ldquo;failed&rdquo; is so subjective and undefined that the courts will find it impossible to avoid a restricted basis for divorce.  What evidence can a judge accept to decide that a marriage has failed?  It is not just liberal divorce which is proposed but an open door policy.  There is also the question of costs but I will not go into that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement today by the Catholic Bishops.  We owe a lot to the Church and they have a right and a duty to speak on divorce which is quite different from dictating to the civil powers on how the Constitution should be formulated. All politicians should be devoting their energies to solving the massive problems facing the country at the moment.  Divorce has been a disaster all over the world and we have only to look at England where it has been proved to have failed and is not the answer to marital problems.</P>

      <P>I should like to quote from a letter in today's newspaper:</P>

      <P>Tom Dineen, PC.  Divorce is a social evil and will create more hardship instead of providing solutions. The Government's proposals are very liberal and the Catholic Bishops said they are even more liberal than they appear at first sight.  I am surprised that no effort is being made to identify the problems within a marriage and to come up with solutions which would resolve them.</P>
      <P>I accept that there are problems when a marriage has broken down, but divorce is not the solution.  I have tremendous sympathy for people in broken marriages and they need all the assistance they can get.  The question to be decided is whether the constitutional amendment before the House is an appropriate one to put before the people.  The Government are convinced that their approach is sufficiently restrictive to permit divorce while, at the same time, safeguarding the interests of the family unit.  Following a critical analysis of the text, one is forced to the conclusion that the amendment as worded does not appear to meet the Government's stated intention.  If adopted, it will lead to very liberal and unrestricted divorce with damaging consequences for the stability of the family unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is also rather loose in regard to financial support and security for the divorced spouse and the children of the <Col N="851" /> first family.  The financial needs of a wife and children will be determined at the date of divorce.  The proposed constitutional amendment will not permit these needs to be reviewed later on should circumstances change due to illness or other reasons.  I am pleased that the people will have an opportunity by way of referendum to decide the issue before us in regard to divorce.  I know the family unit is very close to the hearts of the people and that, when given the opportunity, they will reject this amendment as it is not in the best interests of the people. They will maintain the present constitutional support for marriage and family life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking on this Second Stage of the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1986, I have to say how pleased I am that all the consultations, discussions, and the reports of the past two years have brought this matter to a fitting conclusion &mdash; this move to give the Irish people the opportunity to express their views on the need for fundamental change, the right of citizens to divorce, and to re-marry in our own jurisdiction.  This is the honourable and proper manner in which to deal with such an important social need, rather than to stand by, take no action, and condemn this and future generations to flounder on in a social and legal wilderness, when a marriage fails irretrievably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are going into this debate, both in the House and outside, with good source material for information and reference. We have the report of the all-party committee on marriage breakdown, the working party report on women's affairs and family law reform and numerous reports and working papers on family law from the Law Reform Commission.  It is vital, I believe, that commentators should acquaint themselves with the facts and the realities and I believe that, whatever reservations people may feel about the outcome of the proposed referendum, the overwhelming evidence will show that there is a growing constituency <Col N="852" /> of people for whom access to divorce law is a pressing need to allow them lives of dignity, legal protection and a chance for happiness in their second family life.</P>
    <P>Marriage in Ireland is the same as in most other countries.  People get married with hopes and ideals and a commitment to each other for life.  But people here are no different in terms of human frailty from anywhere else.  They often marry the wrong person or marry for the wrong reason.  There is no formula for knowing in advance how well two people will relate, form a sound marital base and live lives of contentment for ever after.</P>
    <P>At one time the Marriage Guidance Council in England analysed what seems to be the main reasons for marriage breakdown among its clients and tabled them neatly under sex problems, one-third; parental influence, one-fifth; living conditions, about 16 per cent and financial worries, 5 per cent, but the council does not do this now.  It says that people are the cause of marriage breakdown. The Family Discussion Bureau of the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations which through the years has evolved its concepts from its casework practice based on psychological principles maintains &mdash;</P>
    <P>There is seldom, if ever, a single factor which can be held responsible for the failure of a marriage, and we have no evidence at all which factor points towards chronological age, in itself a decisive ingredient of marital breakdown.  This is not to imply that young people are not &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; in adolescence and early adulthood, but rather that the way in which these risks are met is largely dependent on the pre-existing relationships between parental couples themselves and between them and their children.  When a marriage reaches a critical point, the crisis is inevitably due to a complex combination of personality interactions plus external pressures which combine in such a way as to exceed the joint emotional and physical resources of the two partners.</P>
    <P>Crisis can come at a number of points in <Col N="853" /> a marriage.  It can be when the couple's own children are reaching adolescence, or later when they leave home.  The English Marriage Guidance Council finds that most of its clients have been married between 15 and 25 years.  There is no such thing, according to the Family Discussion Bureau, as a marriage free from conflict.</P>
    <P>No one ever escapes the hates and resentment or the unreal demands and expectations of the earliest years of childhood. In marriage the polarities of love and hate, male and female, dominance and submission move around between the partners, often in a bewildering way. The marriage that works is the one that manages to keep them in balance, where the couple can find and keep their own separateness and remain together.  When conflict and disharmony enter a marriage and remedial measures are not forthcoming, the relationship can very rapidly deteriorate, and the reality of married life can become a grim ordeal of coping with stress, resentment, anger and even awful bitterness.  For everyone involved in such a family there is pain and unhappiness, but above all for the children.  Whatever the trauma may be for the adults involved, they can at least have scope to escape, to share their feelings with other adults.  Not so with children caught in the crossfire between warring parents.  Their distress can find no ease.  Many children, it is known, secretly blame themselves for their parents' anger and disagreement and are unable to cope with their fears and confusions.  The net result is a pervading sense of insecurity, an inability to work at school, bedwetting, becoming either introverted or aggressive.</P>
    <P>For such children, for whom fighting and unhappiness becomes a way of home life, deep and in many cases irreversible scars are the result.  Such children find it almost impossible to learn the lesson of love, of founding a family, of forgiving or tolerance in such a home environment. How often have I been told by young adults, whose parents would have eventually separated after a long unhappy marriage, that they wished their parents had done so sooner.  They said their mother or father had told them they had stayed <Col N="854" /> together for the sake of the children. Those children said to their parents that they wished they had not done so because they were very unhappy.  No marriage is going to break up because it is going mildly wrong.  Couples only admit breakdown, and separate when there are serious difficulties in which case, while the children may have to cope with a difficult transition of living with one parent thereafter, they can, and do, settle down to a home where family life can be content, and the lessons of love learned.</P>
    <P>I reject the notion that children suffer less in a family where there is unhappiness than they do through a separation or divorce and life with one parent or in another's family structure.  It hardly needs to be said that the vast majority of Irish marriages are good, in which we find parents committed to each other and to the welfare of their children, but that fact does not give us the right to claim that the fabric of Irish family life is perfect and only at risk now in the face of divorce proposals.  There is an awful lot wrong with the fabric of Irish life and too many people in this society wanted to turn a blind eye to the instability and stress in many families in the past.  How many families suffer abject poverty because of a father's alcoholism?  In how many Irish homes has violence become a way of life?</P>
    <P>Our attitude to marriage laws has led to a whole sub-culture which is peculiarly Irish.  We have Irish euphemisms like deserted wives, deserted husbands, battered wives, living in sin and church annulments.  The position particularly of people who remarry following church annulments, who have separated and are living with someone else or who have received foreign divorces which may not be recognised in Irish law, must be sorted out.  No matter which label we slap on any of these people we are indirectly identifying the same thing &mdash; marriage relationships that have broken down and need the option of a natural and legal terminal &mdash; namely divorce.  All of these people have made their own <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements, which put them into a legal limbo land.</P>
    <P>It should be said that divorce is about <Col N="855" /> more, much more, than the opportunity to re-marry.  It is about a status that reflects reality, men and women whose first marriage have ended, never to be resuscitated, and who, therefore, wish to break the ties of that first legal contract finally and irrevocably, and know that they can make a declaration that has a universal definition and understanding.  It is against a background of unsustainable legal disarray that, after great consultation, research and deliberation, the Government have made a statement of intention to reform our laws which takes account of the need for action on a number of fronts but recognises the real fear many people have of too easy access to divorce.  The constitutional provision ensures that this will not happen unless and until the electorate by referendum choose to bring about change.</P>
    <P>The introduction of divorce as proposed will not be a threat to happily married couples and, indeed, will I believe even have the effect of concentrating couple's thinking when difficulties first arise, and encourge them to seek help. Our greater emphasis on marriage reconciliation, family counselling, and the expansion of the excellent schemes already in operation can only have good effect in the future.  But, however good our conciliation methods are, they will not and could not eliminate the need to deal with the irretrievably broken marriage. Introducing divorce will not threaten marriage any more than the development of heart transplant techniques in surgery lead to an increase in heart disease.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the emphasis in the Government statement on the need for protection of marriage and for the development of less adversarial and more human oriented legal institutions supported by professional counselling and conciliation to deal with marriage breakdown. The entire area is very complex and, in retrospect, it was very useful to tap the collective wisdom of the Oireachtas in determining the type of arrangements which should not be introduced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> The divorce referendum Bill, I believe, strikes a balance between the interests of society generally and the need to deal humanely and fairly with people whose marriages have broken down.  I have said before on many occasions that the reality of life is that many marriages break down, and some of them break down irretrievably.  We might wish that this would not be so, but we must face up to it and deal with the consequences.  The non-existence of divorce in our society is itself a destabilising factor at this stage in that many people whose marriages have broken down openly live in relationships outside of marriage.</P>
    <P>Some people will say that the terms of the referendum Bill are too broad and others will say that they are too narrow. In my view they represent a reasonable compromise against the background of the values of the society in which we live. We have, in a sense, an opportunity to come of age and to treat people as adults, capable of coming to responsible decisions about how they will regulate their domestic affairs.</P>
    <P>Some will say that the introduction of divorce will sap the moral fibre of the nation and leave society immeasurably worse off.  I am in difficulty with this argument.  From my experience in other countries, in the United States and Europe, I find it difficult to conclude, nor have I seen any facts to support it, that their societies with divorce are any worse than we are without it.  We have, I believe, a presumption of innocence, based on the concept of the Ireland of the saints and scholars, which is not justified and which does not result in our society being any better off than other developed societies.  We are already changing, and if divorce is introduced it will merely be a reflection of those changing values in our society and not any co-ordinated plot by a minority to subvert the family and the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is accepted that consolidation of the Income Tax Act, 1967, with the related provisions of subsequent Finance Acts is overdue.  There are now provisions in 25 Finance Acts &mdash; including the 1986 Bill when enacted &mdash; to be consolidated with the 1967 Act.  Some of <Col N="858" /> those Acts are of major size and complexity embodying many new concepts and provisions while a significant number of provisions were also repealed.  Ideally the process of consolidation of the Income Tax Acts should also embrace the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, and later enactments.  The Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, and later provisions relating to the taxation of capital gains also require to be consolidated.</P>
      <P>It will be clear that a considerable volume of work would be involved in the consolidation of the provisions mentioned and thus substantial deployment of highly trained staff to undertake the task would be required in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, on whom this work would devolve.  As the Deputy will be aware, the resources of trained staff available to the Revenue Commissioners are already under-strength and are overstretched in coping with current work.  The embargo on staff recruitment does not permit this position to be remedied in the short term.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are acutely aware of the need for consolidation and are taking every opportunity which arises to further the preparatory work necessary.  From the nature of the undertaking it will be appreciated that a large input will be required from senior, experienced staff and the heavy legislative programme of recent years has heretofore rendered it impossible to allocate such staff to this work.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, as a first step a target date for the introduction of the new consolidated Income Tax Act has been established as the end of the year 1987 but reaching this target will depend to a critical extent on the sustained availability of suitable staff.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, the Office of Public Works act on an agency basis only for Departments, in this instance, the Department of Justice.  We await full instructions as to what the Department of Justice require.  I agree with the Deputy that the environment at the Bridewell is one of overcrowding, violent tensions, of difficulties on both sides and fears in relation to infection from AIDS and indeed hepatitis B. Management of the Bridewell, including questions of overcrowding, public health operational policy and others are matters for the Department of Justice, the Garda Commissioner and local Garda management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Representatives of the Department of Justice, the Garda Commissioner's Office and the Office of Public Works met at the Bridewell on 25 September 1985.  The Department of Justice representative instructed the Office of Public Works to undertake works which <Col N="862" /> included door lighting, ventilation, heating, sanitation, and so on, on a particular cell which would be a prototype for a major cell block refurbishment scheme. The Bridewell houses a total of 20 cells. This intimation, on 25 September last, was the first from the Department of Justice to my office that the Department required a major cell block refurbishment.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance when work will commence for the reconstruction and rebuilding of the bridge at Coole, Ferbane, County Offaly; and if he will confirm that work will commence immediately in view of the severe hardship which is being experienced by landowners in the area since October 1984 when the accident happened putting the bridge out of use and also in view of the fact that the landowners in the area agreed to forego the building of a temporary structure by the Office of Public Works, to enable the Office of Public <Col N="864" /> Works use a proper allocation of moneys to build a permanent structure this year.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the contract is being arranged for this summer.

      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, a similar question was put down by Deputy Enright on 23 November 1985.  He was informed at that time by the Minister for Finance that works were expected to commence in the summer of 1986.  I have just reiterated that.  All the necessary on site investigations have been completed and contract documents have been prepared for the erection of the bridge.  Arrangements are being made to invite tenders in the very near future.  Provided, as I said, that no undue difficulties or complications are experienced in the receipt or examination of tenders, a contract will be placed this summer.  The length of time that it will take actually to do the work I am not aware of, but if the Deputy is interested <Col N="865" /> in that time scale I shall correspond with him.</P>

To this end the Office of Public Works acquired land at Carrickcarnan with a view to developing full export and import facilities at the site, including examination sheds and parking space.  However, a consultancy study has now recommended that a proposed Dublin-Belfast motorway should by-pass Carrickcarnan about two miles to the west and consequently, plans for Carrickcarnan have had to be reconsidered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Kerry County Council have indicated to the Commissioners of Public Works that an order prohibiting the removal of beach material is being and will continue to be enforced on the Maharees peninsula.  Accordingly, the Commissioners will proceed with the making of the required statutory determination under the Coast Protection Act, 1963, as to whether or not a protection scheme is feasible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to say to the Minister of State that the Maharees is first on the list for a coast protection job.  It has or had priority at one time.  Does the Minister of State realise that if a coast protection job is not done in the Maharees in the near future, there is a possibility that this could be an island?  There is a great danger of this. The local newspaper stated last week that the residents are taking action about the situation.  Would she give me an assurance that a start will be made as soon as possible on a coast protection job?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Deputy's opening remark with interest.  I can give no guarantees or dates in relation to the starting of any capital scheme under the Coast Protection Act, 1963.  As I understand it, the situation in relation to the Maharees peninsula is at a very early stage and I am sure the Deputy is aware, as I am, of the rather difficult and very out-dated legislation in relation to coast protection at present.  There are 24 stages of preparation and planning and determination which have to be crossed before an actual on-site commencement of works is reached.  As such, the Maharees peninsula is at the first or second stage of that.  There is certainly a minimum of 18 months to two years work to be done as a personal opinion, before <Col N="871" /> the situation is on-site.  That is a minimum pending everything going according to plan and finance being available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that all the planning had been done for a coast protection job for the Maharees.  It has been the subject of many discussions over the past five years and definitely it must be well ahead on the planning stage.  I would also like to ask the Minister of State if her Department have made any applications to Brussels for grants for coast protection work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last point, as of now under the Regional Development Fund no specific grants have been made for coast protection schemes over the years.  We have taken our full allocation under the Regional Development Fund and it has been well spent on other infrastructural services of one type or another, and various other schemes.  I am hoping that in the future coast protection works will be included.  I have already mentioned this to the Minister for Finance. They may be included in our list of requirements from the European Regional Development Fund but no decision has been made and no specific proposal has as yet gone to Europe.  It is for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the specific scheme for the Maharees, the proposal for a coast protection scheme at three locations on the peninsula was submitted by Kerry County Council in 1964.  A preliminary examination in accordance with the Coast Protection Act, 1963, undertaken in 1973.  The Commissioners of Public Works did not, however, make determinations at the time on whether coast protection schemes were feasible at the three different locations because of the serious problem of beach material removal on the Maharees peninsula.  I know the Deputy is aware of this problem.  Instead the commissioners urged the county council to obtain an order from the Minister for Transport prohibiting the removal of the beach material.  This order was <Col N="872" /> made by the Minister in 1980 but subsequent inspections by the commissioners' engineers revealed evidence that, despite the order, beach material removals were continuing.</P>
    <P>Recent inspections carried out by the commissioners' engineers suggest that the problem of beach material removals is now being brought under control and Kerry County Council have advised the commissioners that the order prohibiting the removal of beach material is being and will continue to be enforced. Accordingly, the commissioners are now examining all aspects of the council's proposal for a protection scheme with a view to making the required determination under the Coast Protection Act, 1963. While this determination will be made as soon as possible, we must bear in mind the large number of other proposals for coast protection works which are also under consideration.  I am unable to say when this statutory process will be completed. The Deputy's assumptions that the planning and determination have been done is incorrect.</P>

I am of the opinion that no useful purpose would be served by my meeting with officers of NERDO to discuss the report and its contents and they have been so informed.

      <P>The only EC Directive on Freedom of Services in banking and other financial institutions of which I am aware is a draft directive on the freedom of establishment and the freedom to supply services in the field of mortgage credit.  This has yet to be considered by the Council of Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may have in mind the document, &ldquo;Completing the Internal Market&rdquo;, a White Paper from the <Col N="874" /> Commission to the European Council, issued in June 1985.  In that document the Commission set down detailed proposals for the removal of barriers to the achievement of a single market by 1992, including the free provision of banking and other financial services.  The detailed measures would be implemented by means of Council Directives, one of which is the draft proposal on mortgage credit, to which I have already referred. We will participate fully in the consideration of all such proposals in the Council when and if they arrive.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that the EC proposals will pose major problems for Irish banks. The banking sector have become increasingly inter-nationalised and Irish banks are already competing with their foreign counterparts.</P>
    <P>With regard to building societies, the Minister for the Environment issued in April last a discussion document on the future legislative and regulatory arrangements for that sector.  In that document it was recognised that the Commission's proposals on mortgage credit will effectively alter the competitive environment. When the societies and other interested parties have submitted their comments on the document, the Government will propose the necessary legislative changes to enable the societies to compete in the new environment, which will present them with opportunities as well as challenges.</P>

      <P>It is not a directive yet, but when it becomes a directive it will be mandatory on us to implement it in national legislation.  I am hoping that the Minister might be in a position to seek a derogation or a stalling effect on that for the following reason.  Is the Minister aware that some 6,000 employees currently employed in the insurance industry would be under considerable threat &mdash; in fact, it would have a disadvantage for the Minister's Exchequer funding also &mdash; in that the premiums of policyholders in so far as insurance is concerned have to be invested in the economy.

The Freedom of Services Directive is coming up shortly which will allow any insurance company or any other financial institution to set up business here without even maintaining an office here, let alone maintaining investment income here.  I am seeking the Minister's support in having this matter stalled for sufficient time until our insurance industry, and in particular the building society industry, can come to grips with what will be a very difficult time for them.</P>

The national plan <i>Building on Reality 1985-87</i> committed the Government to policy measures aimed at halting the escalation of the tax burden and undertook that over the period of the plan tax bands and alowances will be adjusted each year so that the overall income tax burden on taxpayers will not increase.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the report gave the example of married people with two children earning three quarters of the average wage who paid nearly three times as high a percentage of their wages in tax in 1985-86 as they did in 1969-70 whereas on the higher bracket the tax percentage of a similar family with twice the average wage had doubled in that time?  Therefore, the burden was even more heavily on the lower paid workers.  This has led to a serious erosion in the real take home pay which has declined significantly.  Does the Minister accept that the <i>Building on Reality</i> programme will not recoup the significant losses since the years 1973-74. What steps is he taking to ensure that they are recouped?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very well known that the burden of income tax has increased in recent years.  Anybody who needs to put down a parliamentary question to discover that is not fully up to date.  The reason for this is also well known.  Our entire income tax revenue, virtually without exception, has to be used to service debt.  This is because of debts run up by successive Governments on both sides of the House.  It is because Government spending is greater than Government revenue and has been since 1972.</P>

      <P>I would regard the income tax burden at present as being too high, certainly in so far as the ordinary <Col N="880" /> medium paid and lower paid workers are concerned.  Until we can succeed in reducing the services for which we use income tax, namely, the service of debt and payment for services that we enjoy as a community, we are going to face considerable problem in reducing the income tax burden.</P>
      <P>The income tax reductions in this year's Finance Bill are better than those indicated in <i>Building on Reality</i>, where we indicated that we would not increase the burden of income tax &mdash; in other words, mere indexation in relation to inflation. In this year's Finance Bill the reliefs granted to income tax payers are twice what they would be under indexation &mdash; we are giving more relief in income tax than would be justified by the increase in the rate of inflation.  We are doing better than was presaged in <i>Building on Reality.</i></P>

      <P>The position is that the amount we have to pay in debt servicing is slightly less than the amount we raise in income tax, but virtually all of our income tax revenue has to be used in servicing debts.  The result is that the country has to be run on VAT and excise duties.  That is regrettable.  It happens because of the necessity to service debt and it points to the danger involved for any Government of any political persuasion to think that borrowing in the short term will provide a long term answer to our problem.

      <P>Interest rates are influenced by several factors, mainly external.  I do not see any need to modify the existing arrangements under which primary responsibility for the level of bank interest rates rests with the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>I would remind Deputies also that the Government decided on 16 January that all exclusions, including banking, from the Restrictive Practices Act and the Prices Acts should be removed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of these complaints but I have lost sympathy with businesses who find that the amount they have to pay for services previously provided in relatively small amounts has <Col N="883" /> increased considerably.  However, I understand that what the banks have done is to try to price the various charges at their actual cost to them so that each individual service provided by the bank pays for itself as an independent cost covering centre.  The result has been that services that were previously cross-subsidised from other banking business have increased quite dramatically.  Though it is regrettable that any business &mdash; banking is a business &mdash; should try to ensure that each service provided would pay for itself, we should not have to accept that statement from the banks and that is why the Government decided to ensure that the banks will be properly scrutinised by bringing them within the ambit of the new fair trading legislation.  For many years fair trading legislation has been introduced here which dealt with every sector of the economy, virtually, except the banks and certain public sector services. I am glad to say that the new fair trading legislation will ensure that banks and public sector companies will be investigated in exactly the same way as any suggested private monopoly might have been.</P>

I do not think there is much evidence to that effect.  I will take the bait, just the same, and answer the Deputy's question.  It would be desirable, not just from the <Col N="884" /> point of view of Ireland but of Europe and of Britain, that Britain would become a member of the EMS.  The whole purpose which prompted the Irish Government and the Opposition of the day to join the EMS was the creation of a zone of monetary stability in Europe which would be conducive to investment. Clearly, it would be desirable for Europe as a whole if Britain decided to join the EMS.  We, as a member of the system, would be very happy to see that occurring. I cannot say what are the intentions of the British Government in this regard.</P>

      <P>My question to this Minister was also addressed by me to his predecessor.  Does he not agree there should be a review of the embargo with a view to ensuring it does not apply in areas of State employment where there is a positive revenue or profit gain to be made?  In this connection I am thinking in particular of the Revenue Commissioners but there are other areas such as the Land Registry.  Will the Minister not agree that it is long overdue for such a review to be made rather than applying the crude embargo instrument across the board in the State services without taking into account potentially profitable revenue earning and profit-making sectors where the employment of more people would yield a more fruitful result to the economy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the fact that the financial services sector does not qualify for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax. That rate is confined to manufacturing, certain approved activities at Shannon and data processing and softwear development activities approved under the IDA international services programme. This is because these activities are regarded as having the best potential for employment creation in Ireland.  The 10 per cent rate is a concessionary one and the fact that it has not been extended to the financial services sector could not be regarded as discriminatory against the sector; the normal regime of corporation tax applies for such services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has dealt with one aspect of the Deputy's question. He is aware of the venture capital provision in the Finance Bill that is confined <Col N="888" /> to the manufacturing side of industry and does not include the services sector.  Will the Minister agree that across the board there is a similar discrimination in other State agencies such as Fóir Teoranta who confine themselves to manufacturing industry?  Will he not agree that all of these facilities, whether in respect of taxes, grants or loans, should apply <i>pari passu</i> to services as well as to manufacturing?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was they who introduced the distinction between the rates. The displacement effect is different with service employment as compared with manufacturing employment.  Increases in service employment in the non-trading sector very often displace other service employment.  If a person opens a hairdressing salon in a town where there is already such an establishment and there is only business for one, the result is the closure of one of the undertakings. However, in the case of manufacturing it is different.  Generally speaking, the opening of a new factory in a town does not affect existing firms because the products of both are likely to be exported and the only people likely to lose their jobs as a result of the additional output are people in other countries.  That is the conceptual basis for the distinction.</P>

There is a substantial export content here, but even in that case there are certain aspects that have a higher export content, such as hotel accommodation in the west of Ireland, as against other aspects such as retailing, where the export effect is relatively moderate.

      <P>The Government have been particularly successful in rearranging the profile of our foreign debt in a fashion which ensures that the maturity profile is improved &mdash; in other words, the date at which debts have to be repaid is stretched out over a longer and more even period.  They have also been successful in shifting from relatively high interest rate loan agreements to those at lower rates of interest.

In view of the fact that this country got £1,112 million last year from the EC, I am totally at a loss to understand what the Deputy's party are at in suggesting a renegotiation.  A renegotiation will have no other effect than to put in jeopardy all these benefits.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment I was saying society is changing and, if divorce is introduced, it will merely be a reflection of those changing values in our society and not any co-ordinated plot by a minority to subvert the family and the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> I now refer to the proposals indicating that the arrangements for judicial separation and divorce will in future be dealt with by a family court presided over by one or more judges of the Circuit Court specially assigned for the purpose and that it will have powers to make orders in relation to maintenance, including maintenance of children and property owned by the spouses, including the family home.</P>
    <P>Much has been written about the question of family courts.  Indeed a majority of the submissions that were made to the Working Party on Women's Affairs and Family Law Reform, of which I was chairperson, raised this question.  That committee, in their report of just over a year ago, considered that the question of <Col N="921" /> family courts was of very great significance. They noted that the family courts proposal is not, of course, confined to this jurisdiction &mdash; that in Britain the Finer report made recommendations in 1974 for the setting up of family courts.</P>
    <P>However, in Australia and in some other countries the family court has been in place for a number of years.  We have, of course, the wide-ranging recommendations on a new family court structure made in the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown which was debated at length in this House.  Of relevance too is the fact that the Law Reform Commission report on divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> made a number of recommendations bearing on the same matter.</P>
    <P>The commission recommended that in proceedings for judicial separation the legislation should provide that the court should proceed without undue formality, that neither the judge nor the legal representatives should robe, that the order of address of these representatives and of the parties should be at the court's discretion and that the court should have power to call any witnesses, expert or other, additional to those suggested or called by the parties.  They recommended that if adversarial procedures are not to apply, there should be a positive obligation on the court to inquire into the case, and not simply to permit the case to proceed only on whatever basis the parties may choose to present it.  The legislation should, they said, require the court to discharge this function.  The commission also recommended that if proper counselling services are available, whether provided by private agencies or the State, it could be made a necessary preliminary to the institution of court proceedings that recourse be had by the spouses to those services.</P>
    <P>These recommendations would clearly require to be borne in mind during the preparation of the legislation to be proposed. But I think most Deputies would agree, for example, that any formal compulsory counselling procedures would not be desirable since there is a weight of <Col N="922" /> opinion to the effect that compulsion in that area is pointless.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome, therefore, the approach that the Government would take on this matter; that approach is that the family court would require, in the first instance, whether counselling services have been or should be availed of by the spouses to assist them in attempting a reconciliation and would have power to adjourn the proceeedings so that recourse may be had to these services where it considers it necessary or appropriate to do so.</P>
    <P>Should reconciliation prove to be impossible a further process, that is a mediation process, will follow.  Mediation &mdash; or as it is sometimes also referred to, conciliation &mdash; is a process whereby a third party, a skilled mediator, brings a husband and wife together to work out their own problems when their marriage has failed.  The objective is not to provide somebody else's answer to the couple's problems.  This is the important point. Decisions may have to be made about the children, the house, the bills outstanding and the future generally.  While the decisions to be made must be the couple's own decisions, mediation can be of very great help.</P>
    <P>In the first place it can assist the parties in identifying the options that are realistically open to them and in weighing up those options before final decisions are taken.  It can assist in dispelling misunderstandings and mutual suspicions by bringing them face to face with the support of an impartial adviser.  It can encourage them, through facing the painful issues, in taking control of their own lives.  It can assist in the maintenance of a parental role where their children are concerned and in an understanding of the need for them to give and to go on giving moral and other support to the children.  The skilled mediator can work through all aspects of their case with the parties while reinforcing their sense of their own personal dignity and helping them to look with confidence to the future, whatever the outcome.</P>
    <P>Both the proposed counselling service and the mediation process that I have <Col N="923" /> mentioned should play an important role in the proposed arrangements for judicial separation and divorce because, apart from special provision to be made for existing cases of long standing separation, it is proposed that before a spouse will be entitled to apply for a decree dissolving the marriage, the spouses will first have availed themselves of the procedure for a judicial separation or for making a separation agreement a rule of court.  It is clear from what I have just said that a service of the kind to be provided by the pilot family mediation scheme will be an integral part of the Government's proposals on marriage, separation and divorce. I take this opportunity to state that the pilot scheme, which is being finalised in the Department of Justice, will be an out of court scheme and will be in operation very soon.  A co-ordinator has already been chosen and mediators are to be appointed.  The pilot scheme will operate as a training body to ensure that trained mediators will be available in the coming year.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I have every confidence that the Irish electorate are alert to the need for these changes and will consider rationally and maturely all aspects of the reality of marriage breakdown.  I will be urging a yes vote because I believe the choice of getting a divorce should be available to people in their own country and because to do anything else would be inconsistent with the commitment I have given to many couples whose marriages have broken down over the years, both before I came into this House and since I was elected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Our Constitution binds the State to recognise the family as a natural institution founded on marriage possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, which are antecedent and superior to all positive law.  The family based on marriage is the natural, primary and fundamental unit group in society, is the necessary basis of social order and is indispensable to the welfare of the nation and the State.  The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of marriage on which the <Col N="924" /> family is founded and to protect it against attack.</P>
      <P>Those who are responsible for these provisions in our Constitution and the people of this country, who, by their vote, enacted the Constitution in 1937 regarded marriage as a life long commitment. This Bill proposes to change that commitment.  Divorce abolishes the legal right to life long indissoluble marriage, and what we are now being asked to do through this proposed legislation is to accept a fundamental change in our way of life as we know it, a change which will undoubtedly weaken the stability of the family and the quality of family life, and will severely damage the future well being of society.</P>
      <P>Let us be very clear that the White Paper entitled Statement of Government's Intentions with regard to Marriage, Separation and Divorce has no constitutional status.  The aspirations it contains have no constitutional standing, nor will they if the referendum is carried. What would matter then is what the referendum Bill contains and perhaps at a later date the Supreme Court's interpretation of this new addition to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>After divorce and remarriage, if the proposed amendment to the Constitution is passed, the second marriage will have all the rights prescribed in the Constitution because divorce will have a constitutional status and all supports which were there for the first family will devolve on the second family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The family courts to be set up by this Government may allocate resources, for example, a proportion of the former husband's income to his first wife and family but, because the Constitution declares that the family rights are antecedent and superior to all positive law, and as this will apply to the second marriage only, the second wife could contest the first wife's right to the allowance on the grounds that problems arising from living on a reduced income, allied to the strain and bitterness and resentment arising from the knowledge that part of the husband's income is being paid to the first wife, endanger the marriage and the <Col N="925" /> State will then be constitutionally obliged to guard it with special care.  After the divorce the first wife is no longer a dependant. In the event of a married man dying who was divorced and married a second time, the second wife will be entitled to the widow's pension and the first wife, very often, will exist on social assistance.</P>
    <P>There is no gainsaying that there are severe marital problems to be found in our society, that, sadly, marriages do break down in Ireland and that all those involved are entitled to and deserving of our deep sympathy and compassion.  We already have laws to help alleviate the problems and difficulties arising from marital breakdown.  In cases where the marriage becomes intolerable and the husband and wife wish to separate and live apart, they have judicial separation, legal separation and civil nullity available to them, but problems arising from marital breakdown, such as maintenance, succession, family home, custody of children and so on are resolved.  These laws can be improved further and, coupled with a positive programme to support and strengthen marriage and with a concerted effort to tackle the factors which cause marriages to fail, will result in the alleviation of much of the suffering and hardship involved and will go a long way towards meeting the needs of the breakdown of marriage.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I emphasise that the fundamental issue in our discussion on this Bill is not separation, which is already available here, but the right of a person to remarry while that person's spouse is still alive and the inevitable consequences of such change on the stability of marriage. What may appear to be a relief for the few may cause disruption for the many, including many of those involved in divorce.  The Government White Paper states that applications for divorce with the right to remarry will be made to the family court and that divorce may not be granted unless the court is satisfied that the marriage has failed, that the failure has continued for a period or periods of at least five years during which the parties have been separted in accordance with <Col N="926" /> the separation procedures set out in the White Paper and that there is no reasonable possibility of a reconciliation between the parties.</P>
    <P>There is no reference to separation in the Bill before the House, only the failure of marriage, nor will the people in this referendum be voting on the separation issue.  Should the proposal in this referendum be accepted, people married and living together for over five years could claim that their marriage had failed and could apply for divorce as of that moment.  The Government state that they will bring in legislation which will provide that a period or periods of not less than five year's separation will be required before an application for divorce will be entertained.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that, as the Government are introducing a separation period condition through legislation, this Government or any future Government can introduce further legislation reducing the separation period to three years or to one year or abolishing the separation condition altogether.  Should the separation period be abolished in future legislation &mdash; and trends in other countries where divorce is available show that this will inevitably happen here &mdash; then, as I mentioned earlier, any couple married for over five years could apply for divorce.  The five year separation period will not be part of the Constitution and will be a matter for the Oireachtas only should the referendum proposal be accepted.</P>
    <P>What is proposed by the Government is by no stretch of the imagination a restricted divorce law.  Statements that it will be necessary to have a further referendum to change the five year separation period are not correct.  Should the referendum proposal be accepted, any Government can have the separation period changed by simply introducing the necessary legislation and having it passed through the Dáil and Seanad.  In the divorce poll taken recently, 26 per cent of those interviewed are reported as saying that the five year period specified in the Government's proposals is too long.  That is a sizeable group, and we can be assured <Col N="927" /> that, should the amendment be carried, that group will immediately commence a campaign to have the five year separation period reduced or abolished.</P>
    <P>Divorce has been introduced to many countries throughout the world and we here have at least the opportunity to assess whether divorce laws elsewhere solved marital problems or whether they simply proved to be a solution to some problems only to replace them with more serious and more intractable problems. Those who advocate divorce state that divorce does not create instability in marriage. Experience in countries where divorce is available does not bear that out.  The rapid escalation of divorce in these countries underlines the fact that divorce breeds divorce and in some countries has led to what is tantamount to a breakdown of marriage as an institution.</P>
    <P>The law permitting divorce was first introduced into England in 1857.  Adultery was the sole ground on which it could be granted and then only to the innocent party.  It was thought at the time that the divorce law would cater for a small number of hard cases only.  Gradually the number increased.  Within 18 months of its becoming law the number increased from three to 300.  The man largely responsible for the 1857 Act, Lord Campbell, said: &ldquo;I have been sitting two days in the divorce court, and, like Frankenstein, I am afraid of the monster I have called into existence.  There seems some reason to dread that the prophecies of those who opposed the change may be fulfilled by a lamentable multiplication of divorces.&rdquo;  His words have proved only too true.  By 1978 the number of divorces in England had jumped to 143,667 which represented 39 divorces per 100 marriages in England and Wales.  In 1983 the figure was 146,669 which represented two divorces in every five marriages.  In 1984 the number of marriages filed for divorce was 178,940, up 6 per cent on the previous year.  In 1870 there were three divorces per 100 marriages in the USA.  In 1978 there were 1.13 million divorces which was more than 50 divorces per 100 marriages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="928" /> How anyone could suggest that this escalation in divorce rates with all its social implications had no bearing on the fact that divorce was available, or that divorce could lead to a reduction in marital problems, or serve as a foundation for social stability is beyond me.  Could anybody facing this issue honestly believe that had divorce not been introduced into England or the USA half of the marriages in these countries would break down, or is it suggested that we in this country have some inherent qualities not given to other peoples which will protect us from the frightening consequences of the divorce scene in other countries?  Once divorce is introduced and a number of divorces take place, there is an increased acceptability of it by society and later it becomes the norm and can no longer be controlled.</P>
    <P>The figures I have given refute the case made by those favouring divorce who argue that, should divorce be made available, only those who want divorce need be involved.  As I have shown, the experience elsewhere is that all marriages are put under strain by divorce and many people who have no desire for divorce are forced into it because the other spouse files for divorce on the grounds of marriage failure.  Those who claim that divorce is a civil right might well remember that under no fault divorce, which this Bill proposes to introduce here, a husband can desert his wife and family, set up home elsewhere and after the five year separation envisaged in legislation obtain his divorce, leaving his divorced wife &mdash; who did not wish to be divorced because perhaps of religious convictions or a wish to preserve her rights under the law &mdash; and his children to live on social assistance.  What civil rights have this wife and family in the eyes of those who call divorce a civil right?  Do they count for nothing?</P>
    <P>Professor Henry Finlay, a leading apologist for the type of divorce now proposed here, gave an honest appraisal of the situation when he said the dilemma of our society was that in relation to this matter you have to be either restrictive or permissive but you cannot be both at the same time.  He said that once you <Col N="929" /> start to be permissive you are committed to being increasingly permissive.  The process is a cumulative one.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland, where those who support divorce here would have us believe that divorce legislation is not affecting family life, the number of divorces has risen from 300 in 1970 to 1,655 in 1983, which is more than 18 divorces per 100 marriages.  Should this divorce amendment be accepted the legal concept of indissoluble marriage will be abolished and from there onwards all marriages must be defined as dissoluble, and marriage becomes a legal principle, a temporary union.  A commitment for life is replaced by a legal commitment to stay with one's spouse until one or other of the partners decides otherwise.  It is not simply broken marriages which are affected; all marriages are implicated. The rapidly increasing statistics of divorce experienced worldwide are the inevitable follow-up.</P>
    <P>In this Bill it is stated that dissolution of a marriage may take place where a marriage has failed and this would give to the persons concerned the right to remarry.  The remaining subsections are merely a palliative to be changed later when the time is ripe.  The fact that they will be incorporated in the Constitution can mean little, because, if the constitutional amendment is passed granting permission to separated couples to remarry, we can be assured, if world trends are followed, that in a few years' time the people will be asked to pass a further constitutional amendment changing the remaining sections in the proposed legislation. For example, this Bill contains a provision whereby the marriage failure must continue for a period of at least five years before a dissolution may be granted.  This stipulation is more or less on a par with the Divorce Reform Act, 1969, in England.  Later, the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1973, provided that no petition of divorce shall be presented within three years of marriage unless the leave of the court has been obtained.  In the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act, 1984, that section was repealed and the new section provided that no petition <Col N="930" /> for divorce shall be presented to the court before the expiration of the period of one year from the date of marriage and nothing in this section shall prohibit the presentation of a petition based on matters which occurred before the expiration of that period.  There is, therefore, in essence, divorce on demand in England.</P>
    <P>There can be little doubt, Constitution or no, that pressure will continue to build up here once divorce is introduced and with the same effects as in England.</P>
    <P>There is reference in this Bill to the functions of the court in respect of divorce proceedings.  We should remember that when the Divorce Reform Act, 1969, was being enacted in England, those in support of the Bill stressed that the divorce process would remain judicial rather than administrative.  In other words, the court should have control over the proceedings rather than making the granting of divorce akin to granting a licence.  Within a few years, 1973, to be precise, a special procedure was introduced whereby divorces by consent may, in effect, be obtained by post.  There is no need for either spouse to attend court and the judge normally announces decrees of divorce in bulk, rather than assessing each case individually.  The reality is that divorce is no longer a judicial process in England.  The same situation will apply here eventually if the amendment is passed.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with irretrievable breakdown or, as it is now termed, marriage failure.  Far from this type of divorce being restrictive, it is the basis for the most advanced and unrestricted form of divorce available today, a form which has swept through the world in the past ten years and which is sometimes known as no fault divorce.  I am referring here to the essence of the type of divorce proposed by the Government in this Bill. The restrictions being imposed will prove to be of a temporary nature as is the case in every country where divorce has been introduced.  Under this style of divorce, where a marriage is said to be irretrievably broken down, either spouse will be entitled to divorce without any consideration being given to the conduct of either <Col N="931" /> party.  I am not advocating the guilty party concept, far from it, but I could do worse than quote from the observations of Kevin Gray of the University of Cambridge in <i>Reallocation of Property in Divorce:</i></P>
    <P>The English Divorce Reform Act, 1969, effected a radical change in the legal basis of divorce, substituting for the matrimonial offence a concept of irretrievable breakdown.  Much of the pressure for reform had dwelt, quite correctly, upon the abuse to which the legal process lent itself and upon the impossibility of applying a criterion of moral guilt as a determining factor in the divorce proceedings.  These defects were swept away in the new law, but along with them disappeared the notion of individual responsibility.  The idea that matrimonial innocence and blame could no longer serve as satisfactory tests of entitlement of divorce was expressed in statutory language which implies that the concept of responsibility is wholly meaningless in the context of marriage breakdown and is an implication which is by no means justified.  The old law had few merits, but it did, at least, recognise substance in the salutary principle of living which treats individuals as ultimately responsible for their actions.  The notion of individual responsibility is an intrinsic, albeit inconvenient, feature of the human condition: we would be somewhat less than human and our existence less than purposive, if our decisions and actions were deprived of the dignity of being either right or wrong.</P>
    <P>So we would have here a no fault divorce, and we should note that a divorce will be granted not only where both spouses wish it, but, also, in cases where one of the spouses does not wish to be divorced.</P>
    <P>If we are to judge by experience in other countries where irretrievable breakdown of marriage is always at the centre of their divorce legislation, the plain facts are that this is not a matter which is investigated by the courts. Where one spouse seeks a divorce, it is <Col N="932" /> in practice presumed to prove the existence of irretrievable breakdown.  How could it be otherwise?  If a person states that his or her marriage has failed, how can it possibly be proved that it has not? The only effective limitation is where one spouse wants a divorce against the wishes of the other and this simply might result in the waiting period being extended.  Of course, the universal trend is for the waiting period to be progressively shorter and that will inevitably apply here whatever the safeguards constitutionally.</P>
    <P>The Bill states:</P>
    <P>The court may, in accordance with law, grant a dissolution of the marriage provided that the court is satisfied that adequate and proper provision having regard to the circumstances will be made for any dependent spouse and for any child of or any child who is dependent on either spouse.</P>
    <P>That sounds very well but, in practice, has been shown to be meaningless elsewhere. Unless the people concerned are reasonably well off, it means little or nothing.  The vast majority of families in this country, whether PAYE workers, small farmers or unemployed people, have a relatively low standard of living. What provision can any court make for the deserted spouse and children of a person in such circumstances, who proposes to remarry and raise another family?  Indeed, irretrievable breakdown can be engineered by one of the spouses, more than likely the man.  He simply moves out of the house and, after the requisite number of years, applies for a divorce.  If the purpose of his original desertion of his wife and family is to marry somebody else, then the likelihood is that he has gone to live with her and perhaps has a second family by the time the five years are up.  Unless he is relatively well off, how does a court decide as to what adequate and proper provision he can make for his wife and children?  Is it not a fact that in the vast majority of cases the State will have to step in and take over the financial responsibilities? He will get his divorce, the taxpayer will foot the bill and in all probability, as is <Col N="933" /> happening in other countries, the former wife and family will be left living on a subsistence allowance.  The cost of divorce to the State in Britain is now £1,000 million per year.</P>
    <P>Even if a man has a decree for maintenance granted against him, will not that decree become meaningless when the second wife and family appear.  The reality is not in the words of the Bill, but in what has happened in other countries where similar divorce laws were implemented. In England, for example, only a tiny percentage of divorced women receive any financial support from their husbands.  Indeed, the trend of modern thought in England, as in many other countries which have got divorce laws, is that after a divorce has been granted, both spouses should be regarded as single people, as they were before marriage, and that they should have no responsibility of any kind towards one another.</P>
    <P>Men have been pushing this theory even further by stating that they should not have a responsibility towards the children, because the children did not live with them.  It is pointless to say there is a subsection in the Bill which states that adequate and proper provision must be made.  Such a provision has been inserted in divorce legislation in many countries and it has proved useless.  Might I further add that, while supporters of divorce claim that divorce cures bitterness, the English Law Commission, with reference to the bitterness and resentment surrounding the enforcement of financial remedies, points to the fact that in England in 1978, 2,439 men went to prison for wilful refusal and culpable negligence to pay maintenance.</P>
    <P>In the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, wives were given substantial protection in respect of the family home. In the event of divorce and remarriage, which wife's rights will be protected in respect of the home?  The fact is that the experience in other countries shows that, after divorce takes place, security in the home can no longer be guaranteed in law. In England, for example, the statutory protection for wives against being evicted <Col N="934" /> from the home generally ceases to operate after divorce.</P>
    <P>In countries where divorce has been introduced, the succession rights of married women have been substantially reduced.  The Succession Act, 1965, seeks to protect the wife's right to occupy the home after the husband's death.  Under existing law, a woman has substantial succession rights.  Where the husband does not make a will and there are no children, the wife is entitled to all his property and if there are children, she is entitled to two-thirds of his property.  A wife is entitled to half the estate where her husband makes a will.  As soon as a marriage is dissolved, the divorced wife loses her rights under the Succession Act.</P>
    <P>Lord Simon, a former President of the Divorce Division of the English High Court, speaking on the Northern Ireland Divorce Order of 1978, said that he had no doubt that the measure, like the 1969 Divorce Act in England, would be utterly unjust to married women.</P>
    <P>Once again, I wish to make the point, as I did in my speech on the report on marital breakdown, that my major concern in this whole matter is for the children. Children are the innocent victims of divorce situations.  They have no responsibility for it and they have no say in its outcome.  They suffer severe psychological stress as well as economic loss. They cannot cope with divorce.</P>
    <P>Before dealing further with this matter, I wish to refer to the paragraph on children in a document circulated I presume, to other Deputies as well as myself, entitled <i>Children &amp; Divorce: Existing Research,</i> by the Divorce Action Group.  In this paragraph they refer to research carried out by Hendel in 1960, by West in 1969 and by McCord &amp; McCord in 1969 to support the case they make that where there is conflict in the home, children are better off if parents divorce.  The fact is that much more recent research finds that the contrary is true and that divorce is always a disaster for children even where the parents' marriage is unhappy or violent.</P>
    <P>There can be little doubt that the Divorce Action Group had got access to <Col N="935" /> all recent research on the subject.  What is particularly disturbing is that they chose to ignore it because it did not suit their case, and nothing can better illustrate the weakness of their argument in respect of the seriously adverse effect of divorce on children.  The matter we are debating here is of very serious moment and the people of this country are entitled to the full facts of the effects of divorce on children before coming to a decision on the amendment.</P>
    <P>The director of the Yale Child Study Centre, Albert Solnit, said that divorce was one of the most serious mental health crises facing children in the eighties.</P>
    <P>I am aware that it is sometimes argued that divorce is desirable because it is said that a child will be happier where his parents are divorced rather than living in family discord.  This argument equates separation and divorce.  While it may happen that because of deep seated disharmony separation may be desirable, it does not follow that divorce is desirable and, indeed, when one notes the economic damage to women and children resulting from divorce, there is good reason to distinguish between separation and divorce.  I might add that many divorces have been granted abroad where there is no evidence of continuing matrimonial turmoil.</P>
    <P>A recent study in America has shown that less than 10 per cent of the children surveyed experienced relief at the time of separation even though 30 per cent of them witnessed scenes of physical violence between the parents.  It was found that though the parents were unhappy, the children were reasonably happy because they did not believe they were any worse off than other families.</P>
    <P>Dr. Futterman, Clinical Professor of Psychiatry and Pediatrics at the Child Study Centre of Yale University, has stated that recent studies have challenged the earlier belief among professionals that divorce is better for children than living with unhappy marriages and a study by Wallerstein &amp; Kelly demonstrates that children actually prefer an <Col N="936" /> unhappy marriage to their parents' divorce.</P>
    <P>Michael Freeman of University College, London, 1981, notes that Wallerstein and Kelly 1980 found, so far as pre-adolescent children are concerned that divorce was a bolt of lightning that struck them when they were not even aware of the existence of a storm and that at the time the parents separate, the child is intensely worried about what is going to happen to him.  Whatever its shortcomings, the family is perceived by the child as having provided the support and protection he needs.  To him the divorce signifies the collapse of that structure and he feels alone and very frightened.</P>
    <P>At a time of divorce children and adolescents experience a heightened sense of their own vulnerability.  They suffer depression, sleeplessness, restlessness and difficulty in concentration.  The loneliness of the child is very deep and very painful and it is frequently wedded to a sense of rejection and a yearning for the intact family.  The child's loyalty is strained and pulled in both directions towards each individual parent.</P>
    <P>Children of divorced parents suffer from a feeling of deep insecurity.  They feel that, having been abandoned by one parent, the other parent will also abandon them.  They feel the need to be near that parent and often no longer want to go to school or to go out to play in case the remaining parent will have gone away when they come home.  Children of all ages can suffer as a result of divorce. Many independent studies show the recurring picture of children suffering guilt, fear, loneliness and anger and point to the very important effects of parental conduct on children.  If one were to ignore this dimension and concentrate solely on the relationship of parents to one another, serious damage can be caused to children.  Clearly from the child's point of view divorce is certainly not the solution for unhappy marriages.</P>
    <P>The deep seated detrimental effect of divorce on children can last a lifetime. Even where divorces were co-operative ones, without acrimony, Dr. Edward Futterman of Yale University Child <Col N="937" /> Study Centre 1980 found that children from such apparently benign marriage dissolutions may come to the child psychiatrist long after the actual divorce with many psychological problems.  There are often, too, problems experienced by the child with step parents.  Families in these circumstances are often beset with jealousies and conflicts of loyalty not found in traditional families.  Children sometimes cannot adapt to the new family.</P>
    <P>This Bill claims that the rights of maintenance of children will be protected in law.  The evidence from countries with a system of divorce similar to that proposed in the Bill is that the interest of children is largely ignored, even though apparently catered for in legislation.  When the Divorce Reform Act, 1969, was being enacted, those favouring the legislation gave assurances that the interests of the children would be protected in divorce proceedings.  It was stated that a divorce decree would not be granted unless the court was satisfied that the arrangements made for the children were satisfactory or the best that could be devised in the circumstances.  Note the similarity in the wording of the Bill before the House. Experience has again shown that in nine cases out of ten the courts do not even adjourn proceedings for further information regarding the child's welfare where the parents are agreed on the custody of the children.  There is, in fact, no concern for the future lives of the children.</P>
    <P>In a report published in April 1981 entitled <i>Maintenance: Putting Children First,</i> the National Council of One Parent Families, referring to the maintenance of children after divorce in England, state that dependent children are involved in over 60 per cent of the divorces and that there are very strong indications that very little maintenance is paid to the vast majority of one parent families that are a consequence of divorce and that 61 per cent of one parent families headed by women are dependent on State benefits as their main source of income.</P>
    <P>In America, Professors Sabilas and Ayers, 1977, state that often the interests of children is the least considered area in <Col N="938" /> the American way of divorce.  So far as children are concerned, clearly divorce is not the answer.  Little attention is paid in divorce cases to the interests of children even though their rights are laid down in legislation.  In no country in the world is divorce granted in the interests of children.</P>
    <P>If I am to judge by literature and statements from those supporting divorce, the motivation appears to be compassion for persons locked in intolerable marriage situations suffering mental, emotional and physical cruelty from their spouses or deserted by their spouses.  Such persons deserve sincere sympathy and compassion and the State must gear itself to help them to a much greater degree than heretofore.  There are, however, persons other than the marriage partners affected by divorce.  These, also, deserve sympathy and compassion.  As I have already said, none is more deeply affected by divorce than children.  Marriages may cease, but parenthood is for ever.</P>
    <P>The report of an ecumenical working party on the effects of divorce on children set up in 1980 by the then Archbishop of Canterbury, which reported in 1983, bears out all I have said on the tragedy of children caught in divorce situations. In an appendix to the report is the following, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Divorce is always a disaster for children. This is true, even if their parents' marriage was stormy, unhappy or violent, or any combination of these.  It is true, also, of civilised divorces. Divorce must be seen as one of the hazards of childhood.</P>
    <P>There are about one million children in Great Britain at present who have divorced parents.  It is estimated that 1.6 million children there will have divorced parents by the end of the century.  Nothing could more vividly display the escalator effect of divorce.</P>
    <P>As I said here on a previous occasion, between 1950 and 1980 the divorce rate in the United States of America doubled. Since 1972 an additional one million children have been affected there by their parents' divorce.  It is estimated that 45 <Col N="939" /> per cent of the children growing up in the United States will see the separation or divorce of their parents.</P>
    <P>Dr. Michael Rutley, Department of Child Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Denmark Hill, London, states:</P>
    <P>Sometimes there is a tendency to view divorce as if it were a positive solution to destructive family functioning. For the child, according to this view, the resolution of the family conflict should be generally beneficial, with the loss of one parent from the household as the only likely stressor in the situation.  Recent research, especially that by Hetherington (1978, 1979), by Wallerstein &amp; Kelly (1980), and by Hess &amp; Camera (1979) has clearly shown that these assumptions are wrong.  The assumption that divorce necessarily brings conflict to an end is mistaken and it is certainly not the case that the absence of one parent is the only potential stressor for the child.  In the immediate aftermath of divorce, both parents tend to be inconsistent, less affectionate and lacking in control over their children.  The mothers become depressed, self-involved, erratic, less supportive and ineffectually authoritarian with their children. Fathers often begin by being unduly indulgent and permissive but then increase in restrictiveness and in the use of negative sanctions.  The post-divorce family relationship between parents and between each parent and the child play a major role in determining the consequences of divorce for the children.</P>
    <P>One thing is certain.  The clean break that many parents hope a divorce will bring is a fantasy, at least as far as children are concerned.  For them, there is always some carry-over from the past.  It can be a case that adults improve their situation at the expense of children.</P>
    <P>Can we as a caring community make a decision which will place the future of Irish children in such jeopardy?</P>
    <P>The argument is being put forward that <Col N="940" /> religious conviction in Ireland would be strong enough to withstand the introduction of divorce and that a small minority only would avail of it.  If one is to go by experience elsewhere, this expectation can hardly be said to be justified.  In countries where divorce is extant, divorce built up a social pressure which became stronger than moral or religious resistance. The sharp increase in the divorce rate in Northern Ireland since 1979, when that area was brought into line with English legislation, supports the point made. In Northern Ireland the rate of divorce was one in every 40 marriages in 1970.  In 1975, a mere five years later, the rate had risen significantly to one divorce in every 25 marriages.  In 1983, it had leaped to one divorce in every six marriages.  These statistics have a frightening message for us, and the only conclusion one can draw from them is that the more readily available divorce becomes, the more frequently it is sought.</P>
    <P>In a report entitled <i>Demographic Trends</i> in Northern Ireland, published by the Economic Council there, it is stated that in 1984 divorced men remarry four times more often than divorced women. These figures further highlight the position women find themselves in when divorced and support my argument that women are badly affected by divorce, being left, as a rule, to look after the family, often on a subsistence income, while the man sets up home elsewhere. We should remember that that is happening in a part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Marriage and the family are under great pressure at present.  Marital breakdown is a growing problem in this country. From what I have said today and on previous occasions on the subject, it is clear that divorce is not the remedy and that, indeed, the cure would be worse that the disease.  If we are to fulfil the constitutional pledge which I have quoted, we must rather concentrate on the many and varied factors which give rise to tensions within marriage and on the necessary supports for marriage, so as to alleviate and, where possible, eliminate these factors.  I believe that the subsection for the Constitution which I have <Col N="941" /> quoted makes it incumbent on the State to play a major role in aiding those with marital problems so as to improve their position in the short term by gearing our social and legal systems to a much greater degree toward support for marriage and the family and through developing counselling facilities for persons proposing to marry and for those already married. With regard to married couples, a system must be developed where problems can be identified quickly and dealt with before they become intractable.</P>
    <P>The need for the development of counselling services at the pre-marriage stage is urgent.  As I mentioned in a speech here on the report on marital breakdown, the Churches have given considerable attention to this matter in recent years with worthwhile results.  However, the Churches have limited resources and, as the stability of marriage and the family is the cornerstone to the stability of the State, it is incumbent on the State to recognise its responsibilities in this area and to make adequate finances available to ensure that the best possible services are available to those in need and that every means will be utilised to publicise these services.  As I mentioned already, the Churches have voluntary advisory bodies which have got a high level of professionalism but which need money to develop their facilities so as to provide easily accessible and effective counselling services.  The State should recognise these voluntary bodies, finance them and co-operate with them so that they can effectively carry out their duties.  I do not feel, however, that the State should be directly involved in this work where a delicate and particularly caring approach is needed.</P>
    <P>My experience of the personnel involved in Church advisory councils is that they are well trained and very professional. This is a vitally important aspect. Poorly trained personnel would wreak havoc on an unstable marriage.  The return to the State for this type of expenditure is exceptional and, of course, the impact on the married couples involved is incalculable.</P>
    <P>A relatively mature approach and <Col N="942" /> proper training go a long way to guarantee that a person will perform well with the job in hand.  It is regrettably only too true that for the most important vocation in the lives of the vast majority of people, that is to say, marriage, maturity does not appear to matter and there is little or no training whatsoever.  Young people meet, fall in love and get married and that appears to be that.  There is no more serious decision in the lives of young people, bearing in mind its responsibilities and consequences, than the decision to marry and yet few contracts are more easily entered into.  It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that young people should be as mature as possible before entering into marriage so that they can fully appreciate its implications and be prepared to undertake its responsibilities and, therefore, while welcoming the decision to raise the minimum age for marriage to 18 years, I, personally, would like to see it raised somewhat higher.</P>
    <P>The age at which two people marry is closely associated with the likelihood of marriage breakdown.  Experience in Britain shows that the figures for marriage breakdown generally decline the older the spouses are when they marry and that those who marry in their teens are twice as likely to experience marriage breakdown as those who marry between 20 and 24 years of age.  If the 1980-81 divorce rates in Britain were to continue, almost three out of every five teenage bachelor grooms and one in two teenage spinster brides would eventually divorce.  These figures show how susceptible to marriage breakdown teenage people are and the need for particular care in deciding on the minimum age for marriage.</P>
    <P>I cannot sufficiently emphasise the importance of education in the preparation for marriage.  I am not now referring simply to pre-marriage or post-marriage counselling, but to the gearing and restructuring of our education system towards the development of the whole person as an individual human being, and in relationships with fellow human beings.</P>
    <P>Our education system, however well it may ensure academic and technical <Col N="943" /> achievements, will have failed if young people are not taught to respect their fellows.  I believe that a properly structured development of our educational system would transform the scene in years to come.</P>
    <P>We are told by Government sources that efforts will be made to deal with problems so as to avert a breakdown in marriage, and that a whole variety of counselling services will be made available.</P>
    <P>Experience in other countries and, indeed, our knowledge of human nature, teach us that divorce, once introduced, will become an end in itself.  The Government will reckon, having given the opportunity to married couples to opt out and to marry again and having made provision mainly through the social welfare services for the other spouse and dependants, that they will have done their duty and will no more concern themselves here than the Government in Britain does about reconciliation and retrieving a failed marriage.</P>
    <P>We have people being interviewed by the media all over the country stating that they fully support divorce, sadly without concerning themselves about the consequences. It might be helpful to remind them that should a divorce situation hit somebody in their own family circle, their attitude might quickly change.  I spoke to people who experienced such a situation in America and they told me that the grief and anguish this causes to most members of a family are indescribable. The worry of a father and a mother when a son's or daughter's marriage fails and goes to the divorce court is pitiable.  The court must know the facts, all of the facts and the cloud hanging over the whole family during the divorce proceedings and after is sad indeed.  In Britain and America the sword hangs over every family and even when people rejoice at a wedding, the clergyman or registrar and particularly the older people present cannot help wondering at the back of their minds whether next year, or five years hence, will see the loving and happy couples parted in divorce.  The chances <Col N="944" /> of survival in both these countries is only about fifty-fifty.</P>
    <P>It is therefore important that in particular young people before casting their votes should ask themselves if what they are doing is opening the door to problems in the divorce courts, maybe for themselves, maybe for their brothers and sisters, maybe indeed, for their own children, and then ask themselves if, when such a day comes, they will be happy that they had, through their votes, precipitated such a family crisis.  Of one thing they can be assured, should divorce be introduced through the referendum, there can be no turning back.</P>
    <P>We all know troubled couples whose marriages are in difficulty.  We have compassion for them and are saddened to see them tied in an impossible situation.  If we legalise divorce, some of these troubled people may be helped.  That is the short term view.  The long term view, however, in view of what I have said in the course of my speech, must be that there should be no legal divorce.</P>
    <P>The Government committee on marital breakdown stated that the great majority of our marriages are stable and viable.  The marriage scene in divorce countries, as I have shown, gets worse by the year.  In such countries, the phrase &ldquo;the breakdown of the home&rdquo; has become a terrible reality with an army of psychiatrists and lawyers trying to make sense of the lives of countless young people, often living with one of the divorced parents who is perhaps married with a new family, and unable to relate to one another.</P>
    <P>The real answer to the troubled couples I referred to is help them in their marriages in every possible way and, if possible, to help them rebuild their relationship or where that is impossible to ensure through judicial or legal separation that having separated, they are properly provided for.  Finance must be made available by the Government so that judicial or legal separation will be made easily accessible to people who need these procedures.  The price of divorce is a rapid increase in the number <Col N="945" /> of broken homes and a miserable marriage scene stretching out before us.</P>
    <P>From the points that I have made during the course of my speech, it is clear that women and children are the ones who will suffer if the constitutional amendment is passed and I would ask all our people to make themselves fully informed on the matter before casting their votes.</P>
    <P>I shall now summarise what I have said, regarding women, children and divorce.</P>
    <P>The law in Ireland at present allows a husband and wife, whose marriage has broken down to separate and, through judicial separations, legal separation or civil nullity, provision can be made for the wife and children, and problems such as maintenance, succession, family home, custody of children, etc. resolved.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that people should be fully informed about judicial and legal separation and it is the duty of the Government to let our people know what their rights are under our separation laws, and to make the necessary finance available to improve on these laws and to make them more accessible to people who need them.</P>
    <P>In the amendment, therefore, we are concerned only with granting the right to remarry.  Laws giving the right to separate are already there.</P>
    <P>If the amendment is passed, one of the spouses can demand and get a divorce, on the grounds of the failure of the marriage whether the other spouse wishes it or not.</P>
    <P>Once the divorce takes place the wife is no longer a dependant.  The Succession Act seeks to protect the wife's right to occupy the home after the husband's death.</P>
    <P>Under the Succession Act 1965, if a husband fails to make a will, the wife is entitled to all of his property if there are no children, and two-thirds of his property if there are children.</P>
    <P>If her husband makes a will, she is entitled in law to half of his property whether he likes it or not.  After divorce these rights are lost to the wife.</P>
    <P>Under the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, wives were given substantial protection in respect of the family home. <Col N="946" /> Experience in other countries shows that, after divorce takes place, security in the home can no longer be guaranteed by law.  In England, the statutory protection for wives against being evicted from the home generally ceases to operate after divorce.</P>
    <P>After the husband's death where divorce has been involved, the second wife will be entitled to the widow's pension, while the first wife in many instances will exist on social assistance.</P>
    <P>The amendment states that the court must be satisfied that adequate and proper provision, having regard to the circumstances, will be made for any dependent spouse and children.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of families in this country, whether PAYE, small farmers, or unemployed people, have grave difficulty in living on their incomes.  In most cases there will be no extra money to provide for the first wife and family when the second marriage takes place.  In such circumstances, the court can grant only social assistance to the first wife and family, who will then be forced to exist on it.</P>
    <P>In England, where the same conditions obtain in their divorce laws, only a tiny percentage of divorced women receive any financial support from their husbands. In England 61 per cent of one parent families headed by women are dependent on State benefits as their main source of income.</P>
    <P>If divorce is added to our Constitution, the second marriage will have all the rights prescribed under the Constitution and all the supports that were there for the first family will then pass to the second family.</P>
    <P>If, for example, the court allocates a part of the husband's income to his first wife, because the Constitution declares that the family rights are antecedent and superior to all positive law and as this now applies to the second family, the second wife can have a constitutional right to contest the right of the first wife to the allowance and with the full force of the Constitution behind her claim.</P>
    <P>In countries where divorce is available, it is now becoming the practice to put a <Col N="947" /> time limit to the period in which provision must be made for the former wife.</P>
    <P>In the appendix to a report of an ecumenical working party on the effects of divorce, set up by the Archbishop of Canterbury in England and reporting in 1983, is the following:</P>
    <P>Divorce is always a disaster for children. This is true even if their parents' marriage was stormy, violent, or any combination of these.  Divorce must be seen as one of the hazards of childhood.</P>
    <P>The director of the Yale Child Study Centre in America, Albert Solnit, said that divorce is one of the most serious health crises facing children in the eighties.</P>
    <P>Dr. Wallerstein and Dr. Kelly, in their study of children and divorce, found so far as pre-adolescent children are concerned that divorce was a bolt of lightning that struck them when they were not even aware of the existence of a storm and that at the time the parents separate the child is intensely worried about what is going to happen to him.</P>
    <P>At the time of divorce, studies tell us, children and adolescents suffer depression, sleeplessness, restlessness and difficulty in concentration.  The loneliness of the child is very deep and very painful.</P>
    <P>The deep-seated effect of divorce on children can last a life time.  Dr. Edward Futterman of Yale University found that children from divorces, which were co-operative ones without acrimony, may come to the child psychiatrist long after the actual divorce with many psychological problems.</P>
    <P>Dr. Futterman, Clinical Professor of Psychiatry and Paediatrics at the Child Study Centre of Yale University, states that recent studies have challenged the earlier belief among professionals that divorce is better than living with unhappy marriages.</P>
    <P>Wallerstein and Kelly demonstrate that children actually prefer an unhappy marriage to their parents' divorce.</P>
    <P>The Bill claims that the rights of maintenance of children will be protected in <Col N="948" /> law.  The evidence from countries which have divorce is that the interests of children are largely ignored, even though catered for in legislation.</P>
    <P>In a report published in April 1981 entitled <i>Maintenance &mdash; Putting Children First,</i> the National Council of One Parent Families, referring to the maintenance of children after divorce in England, state that dependent children are involved in over 60 per cent of the divorces and that there are very strong indications that very little maintenance is paid to the vast majority of one parent families.</P>
    <P>In America, Professors Sabilas and Ayers state that often the interests of children is the least considered area in divorce.</P>
    <P>Experience from other countries points to the fact that provision for the wife and family in divorce cases is catered for largely by social welfare payments.  It is estimated that divorce costs the British public £1,000 million a year.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland the rate of divorce in 1970 was one divorce in every 40 marriages. By 1975, it was one divorce in every 25 marriages and in 1983 it was one divorce in every six marriages.  In Northern Ireland divorced men remarry four times more often than divorced women.  Women, in most instances, are left to look after the family, often on subsistence allowance, while the men set up another home.  Remember that this is happening in a part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Experience in other countries shows a rapid increase in the rate of divorce.  In 1978, the number of divorced in England jumped to 143,667 or 39 divorces in every 100 marriages.  In 1983, the number had risen to 40 divorces in every 100 marriages. The number of marriages filed for divorce in 1984 was up by 6 per cent on 1983.  In 1978, there were 1.13 million divorces in the USA which was more than 50 divorces in every 100 marriages.  If divorce is introduced here, the same pattern will follow.</P>
    <P>The figures I have given refute the case made by those favouring divorce who argue that, should divorce be made available, only those who want divorce need be involved.  As I have shown, the <Col N="949" /> experience elsewhere is that all marriages are put under strain by no fault divorce, and many people who have no desire for divorce are forced into it because the other spouse files for divorce on the grounds of marriage failure.  I might add that second marriages after divorce have themselves been found to show a high rate of breakdown.  The only conclusion one can draw from these figures is that the more readily available divorce is, the more frequently it is sought.</P>
    <P>The referendum Bill states that a marriage must have failed for five years before a divorce can be granted, and this is claimed to be a safeguard.  The Divorce Reform Act, 1969, had much the same provision in England.  The Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act, 1984, reduced the period to one year.  Once the divorce provision is accepted here, the period of waiting will follow the same pattern.</P>
    <P>I might add that conditions introduced into the Constitution by this referendum will make little difference.  If divorce can be introduced by a referendum, pressure will build up to hold a referendum to change these conditions.</P>
    <P>There is no reference to separation in the Bill.  The five year separation period required before the application for divorce will be entertained will be legislated for in the Dáil and Seanad if the referendum is passed.</P>
    <P>This Government or any future Government can through legislation reduce the separation period to three years or one year, or abolish it altogether. It is not correct to say that the people must be consulted again by referendum to have the separation period reduced.</P>
    <P>In all these circumstances, where the wife and children fare so badly in divorce situations and where so much irreparable damage is caused to the whole fabric of society, I strongly appeal to the people of Ireland to reject the amendment to the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the proposal to amend the constitution to allow divorce and remarriage in certain specified and restricted circumstances.  I am <Col N="950" /> happy and proud to be part of the Government who have produced what I believe to be a balanced and just proposal for change in our laws and in our society. I have listened most of the morning to the contributions from those with differing views.  I would like to say that it is because I care for families, women and children that I support the making of changes which will allow people the opportunity of divorce and remarriage.</P>
      <P>I accept the views which we have heard against making any change as being sincere and deeply held.  Wherever people have proposed major social change &mdash; and I accept that this is a major social change &mdash; in the past there have always been these fears of huge social instability. When slavery was being abolished there was a suggestion that it would upset the whole social order of American society, which would not be able to function as it normally would.  It did not function as it did previously, but it functioned in a much better fashion.  Seventy per cent of the applicants for divorce are women. The number of women and children involved in marriage breakdown are being used as an argument against the granting of the opportunity of remarriage. I find this absolutely extraordinary. It leads to the strange situation in that the people who are opposed to change presumably speak for the benefit of women and children.  I, in seeking this change, feel that I am speaking from that position.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods' contribution was a very articulate critic of the proposals.  His position is very difficult to understand. Unlike other speakers, such as Deputy Glenn, whose position I respect substantially and know to be deeply held and to be carried all the way, I find his position stops so short of taking any position as to be undermined in its whole presentation.  I wish to make those remarks before going on to explain why this Bill should be passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods in his contribution suggested that valid and constitutional marriages would be wiped out as a result of this change.  It is proposed under this <Col N="951" /> legislation that only those whose marriages have failed for five years or two years after a legal separation &mdash; the ultimate maximum which the law currently allows and which in many cases means people have voluntarily given up succession rights &mdash; will be able to apply for divorce?</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner suggested that problems would arise because of divorce.  The only reason we are addressing this problem is that there are tens of thousands of men, women and children involved in marital breakdown and in remarriage. We are not trying to create a problem. We are dealing with a real social problem which all of us know in our families and all of us can, if we wish, turn our backs on.  I will not be part of a country and a society that will continue to turn our backs on these real social problems which leave people living in very unhappy situations of human misery and in a legal limbo.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods referred to the constitutional orphans.  There are many legal and constitutional orphans blessed in marriage by the Church who have also made their contribution in relation to the family.  They have something to answer in relation to the legal position of families. They have given blessings to second marriages which effectively leave children legal orphans.  It is a new marriage in the eyes of the State and a first marriage in the eyes of the Church.  They have developed a very complex set of responses to marriage breakdown.  They oppose our genuine attempts to deal with the same problem in a legislative fashion in an area for which we have direct responsibility.  There are questions to be answered.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that the Church is ahead of us in acknowledging the problems of marriage breakdown, in annulling marriages where there are children and in allowing second marriages.  That is one of the reasons we have such a complicated situation which must be dealt with before we have generations of children who are completely without legal rights <Col N="952" /> of any sort and where we have ludicrous situations of intestacy.  For example, when a man dies who has been living with his second wife and children, blessed by the Church, his estate will go to somebody who he has not lived with for ten, 15 or 20 years and who may be living with somebody else and may be well cared for.  This is ludicrous and we cannot as legislators continue to turn our backs on it.  It is a serious social and legal problem which we need to redress.  This Bill goes a long way towards doing that in a moderate and reasonable fashion.  There is no question but that this is a hard issue to deal with, an issue of marriage breakdown which inevitably involves suffering. We are trying to ensure where possible that certain avenues will be open to people to reorganise their lives and to try again.  I support that attempt.</P>
    <P>While Deputy Woods made criticisms of the Bill, he stopped short of suggesting that it should be opposed.  If he is supporting the Bill the points which he mentioned can be taken on board.  There are two things he could make clear.  He could criticise the Bill in its detail.  It is important that having gone so far he should, as a representative of his party, either go the whole way and say he opposes legislation of this kind or suggest that the question in principle is one which should be supported.  Deputy Kelly said it is fence sitting and a double-faced approach to a very serious problem.  I find this very frustrating.  It is a totally inadequate response to something which is very serious.</P>
    <P>The Bill is of a restrictive nature.  I hope that the questions raised by people about the interpretation of the Bill can be dealt with on Committee Stage and that any reasonable amendments will be taken on board.  The stated and declared intention of the Government to produce a restrictive form of divorce should receive public support.  Together with many people with a direct interest in this, I became very impatient at times during the lead up to this legislation.  We questioned whether the Taoiseach and the Government as a whole would have the commitment and the courage to deal with <Col N="953" /> this very controversial social issue.  I admit now that the process has been a vindication of the Taoiseach's understanding of the problem and of the need to approach it in a steady, slow fashion. The long process of discussion of the marital breakdown committee led to a consensus which has entirely disappeared in the debate.</P>
    <P>The consultations with the Churches were valuable and the Bill has benefited from them.  The proposals are restrictive and moderate and, therefore, are in keeping with traditional attitudes to marriage in Ireland.  I support marriage and I support the family.  It is for this reason that I take this position.  I resent the suggestion by some of the people who are against any change that, because people have a different view, they belong to a liberal anti-family wing.  I would like to think that I am liberal but I would totally reject any suggestion that to take this position is anti-family.</P>
    <P>The opinion polls published since the publication of the Government's Bill suggest that the Government have got it right and have managed to produce a Bill which responds to the many cases of human misery and which protects marriage as we know it.  There is a conflict in Irish society.  People wish to do the two things but find it difficult to add them together.  The proposal before us does that in a substantial fashion.  It has achieved the correct balance because it is a restrictive proposal.  The mention of five years plus the two years post-separation procedure mean that, before anybody can start divorce proceedings, they must have exhausted all the other legal remedies. Since 1867 we have allowed people to separate, to divide custody of their children, to divide matrimonial property and to have divorces that are divorce in all but the final letter of the law.  Yet we are suggesting that this is somehow going to create a problem.  All we are stopping short of doing is allowing people to remarry.  I do not think we can support that any longer.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that there are extra protections in family law for women and children as a result of the Government's <Col N="954" /> proposals.  It is proposed that there will be a new recognition of the role of women in the home when assessing separation proceedings.  That is to be welcomed.  It is important to point out that they must have exhausted all legal remedies available to them.  Therefore, there can be no accepting the argument that this is somehow making things easier for people whose marriages are breaking down.  It is a further legal stage they have to go through.  The fact that the proposal is built into the Constitution is a security for people who wish to move very slowly on this, more slowly than I would like. As a politician you must try to find the correct balance, particularly on an issue as important as this.  It is important to achieve some measure of reform.</P>
    <P>Listening to some people here it strikes me that we could all be from different worlds.  We certainly have different visions of the future.  My vision of the future is one which allows us to respond to human problems and to take risks.  We can achieve stability in our society and deal with the problem of traditional attitudes to marriage in legislation such as this.</P>
    <P>When I became involved in politics in the late seventies one of the things that frustrated me was that certain things dominated politics and consequently social injustices were buried and ignored. There is still that atmosphere in the opposition to this Bill.  The tendency is there not to deal with it or to pretend it is not there.  It is more convenient to do that and that is an unhappy approach which I could not share.  We can see a generation of children without legal rights and they will not thank us for clinging on to a hollow image of a family.  Many of the children of Ireland are living in marriages that are not recognised by the State.  We are excluding them entirely.</P>
    <P>In the late seventies the present Taoiseach was riding high in the opinion polls. That was so because of his expressed commitment to change our society and to face up to some of the issues now before us.  This is something he had been identified with and during his period he has carried the people with him.  I am <Col N="955" /> convinced that, in delivering on this issue and in giving the people an opportunity to decide, he has proposed a piece of legislation that is broadly acceptable to the people.  He is striking the right balance as a political leader which was sadly missing since the last referendum, which seemed to paralyse people's courage to deal with social issues.  It certainly paralysed the will of politicians, and I admit to being part of that paralysis.  I am glad to see that at last we are attempting to deal with these matters in a courageous and honest way.</P>
    <P>We are right to face this issue for many reasons.  We must allow rights to men and women, but especially to children because the experience of many children has been of sadness, disappointment, violence and trauma in marriages.  They are being given a chance.  Wives of unhappy marriages are being given a chance to try again if they are lucky to find somebody with whom they wish to try again.  I cannot accept that a society should say to a young woman in her twenties with a child or two who has been battered and bruised mentally and physically that she cannot try to build a real marriage in a loving environment for herself and her children with somebody else. That is the heart of the issue.</P>
    <P>People who oppose this legislation respond by simply saying that to deal with these social problems would destabilise marriage further.  That is an &ldquo;I am all right&rdquo; mentality which is neither Christian nor reasonable.  The problem will not disappear by ignoring it.  This legislation will give people a choice.</P>
    <P>It is unChristian to preach that human beings should be condemned for life in the prison of unhappy marriages.  This morning I heard some extraordinary suggestions, some twisting of research to fit an end.  I understood Deputy Faulkner to have said that certain research showed the effects of divorce on children.  He could have put the effect of separation on children in place of divorce because we have many cases of separation and breakdown.  The traumatic effects which he described in relation to divorce are <Col N="956" /> already being felt by thousands of Irish children and families.  He suggested research indicated that children are better in families even where the wife is being beaten by the father.  Was the Deputy putting that forward as an acceptable ideal for a family?  That is an extraordinary suggestion.  What it suggests in regard to the worth of women is unthinkable and entirely unacceptable.  He is not the first to make such a suggestion.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown assessed the submission of Fr. Jack Dominian who suggested that the concept of marriage is changing and as a consequence, perhaps, more marriages are breaking down.  The concept has not changed negatively.  People have a higher expectation of marriage, not an institution in which there is a role of subservience for the woman but a shared partnership in a new challenging relationship. That is the kind of marriage that I would wish to protect.  If, God help us, a child has known nothing but violence during his or her growing up years, that is not a reason to accept that kind of marriage and those conditions as natural. To twist that kind of argument into opposition to changing the law is unChristian. The sooner such a situation is rectified the better for the children of such marriages. It would also be better for the man and woman.</P>
    <P>I regard it as my duty to support this proposed change, and I ask those who oppose it to examine their consciences when they turn their backs on situations of great suffering all around us.  Such suffering is the more painful because it occurs in families in which there should be love and support.  Marriage has not provided that for many people in Ireland without divorce.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some cases known personally to me.  They make me more convinced every day that we need to deal urgently with the problem.  A young woman has been separated for five years.  He left her at age 26 years with two children, the youngest being one year at the time.  The marriage had been one of beatings and bad debts.  In the intervening years she has ensured the security <Col N="957" /> of the family home.  She often works at two jobs and has purchased out the husband's interest in the home, having first paid his debts and re-negotiated a loan. In the interim he has had two different relationships and has been living in various parts of Ireland and abroad.  She has taken the children for psychological assessment.  Her problems were not caused by divorce and will not be solved by divorce.  However, she has now established a new relationship with someone who is kind and loving to her children, takes them to football matches and plays games with them.  Has she not earned her chance to try again if all involved wish to do so?  As a society do we not owe her and her children the opportunity to try again in a stable and loving environment?</P>
    <P>The second case I refer to again involves violence.  The girl, aged 29 years, is now beginning to accept that she must be separated from her husband.  She has one child aged about six years.  The violence in that marriage was associated with unemployment but also with a family acceptance of the history of violence in the husband's family, in which violence was common.  What brought the wife to the realisation that she must separate was a violent beating in which she lost the child she was carrying at the time.  This prompted her to begin to go through the terrible trauma of breaking up the home she loved and that he loved, but the tragedy of their relationship was such that they could no longer live together.  My greatest sympathy is for the six-year old child who witnessed all of this.  Great violence has been done to that child.  I should like that woman to have a chance in the future to meet somebody else so that her son will have a different model as father &mdash; and a different model as a family.  That is the constitutional right of a child.</P>
    <P>Today we have discussed only the family as outlined in the Irish Constitution, but there is also the question of individual rights.  Deputy Woods indicated the dreadful problems that could occur if we accepted the new family and gave all the constitutional rights to that unit.  I gather from the legal advisers <Col N="958" /> around that that problem may not arise because our courts have interpreted the definition of family to be one based on marriage.  Therefore, the first family would be equally protected.  It is sad that this argument has been used as a threat against women to defeat the proposal.  I agree that questions should be asked and matters should be sorted out, but if there is no substance to the questions they should not be raised constantly in an attempt to scare people from supporting the proposal.</P>
    <P>The third case concerns a more mature woman in her late thirties.  She has three children but has finally left her husband after 12 years of marriage, of unpaid bills and of begging for enough money to feed and clothe the children.  She was not subjected to violence but debt collectors regularly called to the door and she never knew a moment's peace.  She had no home but lived with her in-laws.  Finally, for the sake of her sanity and for the security of her children, separation and independence were preferable to &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; to someone who continued to act entirely as though he was single with no responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The most consistent factor in all the cases has been that none of the people involved reached the decision to separate without years of trying to make their marriage work.  It is significant that in the majority of cases it has been the woman who has taken the initiative.  The argument put forward here by people against the proposal is that it is anti-woman, but I do not agree with that.  This morning Deputy Glenn referred to &ldquo;discarded&rdquo; women; but it is the case, and statistics bear this out, that it is often the man who is thrown aside and who is left without family and home.  The argument is being used as a convenient stick to beat this proposal but in my experience it has not been substantiated.  In fact, where divorce has been available, some 70 per cent of the applicants are women.</P>
    <P>As well as being unChristian.  I do not think it is sensible to suggest that people will lightly seek divorce.  I have outlined the kind of torment most people go through before they decide finally to take <Col N="959" /> action.  I agree entirely with the view expressed here that divorce is not a happy thing.  It is not a solution to marriage breakdown and nobody suggested it was.  It is the opportunity to allow people whose marriages have broken down to try again. We must not forget that we have marriage breakdown and separation here already and a high price is paid, both socially and economically.</P>
    <P>Even in a seemingly divorce crazy society such as America, at last there is some evidence of stabilisation.  Divorce has been available for decades in Northern Ireland, but the rate has been comparatively low and it is also low in Catholic Italy.  It would be low here because we have a society who have certain strong values that would not change overnight. Other changes that were expected to create a huge social upheaval have not led to massive change here.  Since 1867 it has been possible here to get a legal separation.  Our laws allow couples to divide up the matrimonial property, to agree on the custody of children and to cease to be married in all but the letter of the law.  It has been divorce in all aspects other than the right to remarry.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made about the adverse effects on women who are &ldquo;discarded&rdquo;.  Most of the cost is already taken up by the State.  The problem is with us; it is not about to come if our laws allow for divorce.  Marriages are breaking up.  Women are being deserted and are not being supported except by the State. The legal costs have already been met by the State.  As things stand today, all stages of the preliminary process are being gone through for increasing numbers of people each year and to argue that we will have to pay suddenly the social cost is not an honest assessment. Deputy Glenn this morning mentioned the figure of £200 million.  She got that up by using the figure she has always argued against, namely, 70,000 and by assuming that 35,000 of them will be in receipt of the deserted wife's allowance. Many of that 70,000 will already be receiving deserted wife's benefit, will be on supplementary assistance and will be <Col N="960" /> in receipt of separate payments from their husbands.  The point is that already the State is paying a quite considerable amount.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for another legal hurdle that must be crossed but at least it offers the people concerned a chance to start again with the blessing of the State.  For a sizeable number, the Church will already have offered them an annulment. For others who have gone ahead and formed new relationships &mdash; and there are many such people &mdash; with or without the blessing of the Church, it will offer the opportunity to bind their children and themselves into a lawful second marriage.  I hope we can devise a Bill that will allow them to do this, not in an easy fashion but as outlined in the intent of the Government's legislation and statement.  The Irish people are caring and compassionate.  If we can assure them that our proposals are sound, I am confident they will feel secure enough to consider those who have marriage problems while maintaining the traditional approach to marriage and the family.  I hope the debate in this House will help to reassure the people that this is the right proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>On 13 December 1985, I spoke here on the report issued by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  I said what I had to say there.  We have had enough talk about this aspect of Irish life.  That committee discussed it and the Law Reform Commission have issued reports about nullity.  Various politicians have spoken about it during the past ten years.  We have had debates and action groups, as well as anti-divorce and pro-divorce campaigns. The time has come to make a decision.  Speaking in this House on 13 December 1985 I said I was in favour of divorce legislation and that I was convinced a referendum should be held as soon as possible with a view to removing that provision of the Constitution which prohibits divorce.  My view today is identical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bringing of this Bill before the House is a historic event.  Politicians seem to get apoplexy when there are moral or social issues to be taken on.  We wait <Col N="961" /> until the mob have moved safely in front before we decide to lead them, rather than initiating debate.  We have grown up as a political society and as a society generally during the past ten years.  I remember the furore in the mid-seventies about the contraception debate.  I have noticed that politicians who made speeches against the legislation on contraception have changed their views not only on that matter but on other social issues.  It is a sign of our maturing as a society.  Political parties and politicians have grown up somewhat in the past ten years and even in the past year.  I accept that there are opposing views on all sides in this House and within all parties.  There are differences in Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and in the other two parties in this House.  No party has a monopoly on sincerity and wisdom in this regard; neither has any politician.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat historic that the Fianna Fáil Party have decided not to adopt a party position on this matter or to apply the Whip.  Instead we will leave it to the people to decide.  I welcome this as a member of Fianna Fáil and as someone who has had difficulties with them through the years on matters such as this. I expect that more than half of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary party will vote against the proposed change in the Constitution when the matter is put to the people, but a sizeable proportion within the party will vote for it.  I will certainly be voting for the Bill.  Fianna Fáil have adopted a mature and responsible position.  People on this side can speak as they wish and advocate that people vote for or against this proposal.  I listened very carefully to what Deputy Faulkner had to say and he is entitled to his opinion.  I was not here when Deputy Woods was speaking but the view he put forward was his own.  The Fianna Fáil view is that it is up to each individual Deputy to decide.  That is our position going into this referendum campaign. I am glad of that allowance for people such as myself who want to speak in favour of this amendment.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown who produced an excellent report and got the <Col N="962" /> issue off the ground.  In particular I compliment Deputy Michael O'Leary who put the cat among the pigeons during the past six months.  A lot of credit must be given to him in that he finally stirred the politicians into action.  We seem to have a tendency in all walks of life to ignore a problem in the hope that it will go away. It is a bit like the ostrich putting its head into the sand.  Politicians and people in responsible positions do not like to grasp any political nettle which might cost votes.  I accept the sincerity of Deputies who have spoken in opposition to this Bill but the impression would seem to be that everything in the Irish garden is rosy so far as marriage is concerned.  That is not the case.  There is hardly a person in any family in any part of Ireland who does not have a brother, a sister or a close relative involved in the problem of marital breakdown.  There seems to be an attitude that these problems do not exist or, if they do, we do not want to hear about them.  Such problems really do exist and we must face up to them.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the Government's proposal, which I believe to be very reasonable.  I do not intend to campaign in the referendum but I will certainly cast my vote in favour on the day of the referendum and if I have any influence with my constituents I will urge them to do likewise.  It is a conservative and restrictive proposal.  The five-year waiting period is very conservative and a recent opinion poll indicated that a sizeable proportion of people think it is unnecessarily restrictive.  A person has five years to make up his or her mind and various steps will have to be followed according to the Constitution.  Any changes that this House wishes to make in ensuing Bills will have to dovetail into the constitutional provision.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that the enactment of divorce legislation will weaken the marriage commitment.  This proposed change in the Constitution would make it very difficult to obtain a divorce.  People will not be able to get a divorce overnight and will have to think about the matter for five years.  It flies in the face of logic to <Col N="963" /> state anything otherwise.  Deputy Faulkner gave very interesting statistics on divorce gathered from all over the world. With regard to the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, I am sure he is not suggesting that society there is more decadent and less responsible than it is here.  I do not think there is any evidence to suggest that it is.  People who oppose this Bill seem to have the impression that divorce makes marriage breakdown.  I made the point in December that you do not prevent death by banning funerals.  It was also stated that one party to a marriage might want a divorce and the other party would be forced to accept it.  Marriage is a partnership between two people.  It is a contract and if one person wants to be relieved of the contract that should be allowed, within the reasonable framework put forward in this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Catholic Church is entitled to its opinion and entitled to speak to its flock. I am here as a politician and a legislator, not to reflect the views of any particular Church.  I regard divorce as a civil liberty. Marriage is a contract and in any ordinary contract there is a way of getting out.  If a contract does not work a person must have the right to change his or her mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mary Flaherty outlined some of the problems she has come across. There are thousands of people involved in such problems and we have a chaotic legal system.  There is one danger.  If by some chance this Bill is not passed by the people &mdash; and I will come to that later &mdash; what proposals will the Government have to face up to the situation then?  It is assumed that this Bill is going to pass. Even though I support it, I would not be as confident that it is going to win hands down.  If it is defeated we will have to face up to the chaotic situation that exists, and something will have to be done about it.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not going to increase marital breakdown.  Irish society has changed.  It is a fact of Irish life that marriages do break down and people should be given another chance.  More important, it should be the people's decision and we will have to accept the decision of the <Col N="964" /> people one way or the other.  We should never be afraid to face the people on any issue.  That is my decision and I will abide by their decision.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, there may be Bills which will have to come before the House as a result of the referendum being passed. There may be problems, as outlined by Deputy Woods, in regard to some of the wording.  But that is only the small print and when we bring in legislation we will be able to go through it at that time.  We are putting proposals before the people to remove the constitutional ban which already exists.  For as long as I can remember I have thought that ban in the Constitution was a mistake and I am delighted that we are now going to ask the people to change it.  The referendum will be a test of our maturity as a society. The question we must ask ourselves is: are we prepared to give other people a chance?  It will be a close-run referendum and I would not be prepared to mortgage the house on the result.  One thing that interests me about this proposal is that it is the people who are happily married who are most in favour of this change as they are prepared to give other people a chance.  I urge my constituents to vote for it.  I certainly will vote for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that this debate is now taking place in this form within this House.  I was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  That committee laboured for 18 months and at the conclusion of their deliberations made comprehensive proposals for the reform of the whole area of marital law and, in doing so, acknowledged the need to face up to the issue of divorce and recommended that there should be a referendum. I am pleased that this Bill is now before the House to provide a vehicle for the holding of that referendum.  It will give the people of this State, for the first time in almost 50 years, an opportunity to express a view as to whether we should or should not permit divorce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is just over 49 years since the current Constitution, enacted in 1937, came into operation.  Despite all the talk and debate <Col N="965" /> over the years there has never been an opportunity since then for people to express a view on this issue that could result in bringing about a constitutional change.  There have been many opinion polls but, other than providing a great deal of meat for debate and a considerable amount of newsprint they do not, of themselves, effect change.  So, I welcome the fact that we have this Bill today and I welcome the document of intent published by the Government which indicates a commitment on the part of the Government to implement many aspects of the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown and to introduce a number of reforms necessary in the general area of marital law that have been long overdue and long needed.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with some of those towards the end of my speech but I want to now deal specifically with the proposal to reform the Constitution.  Other Deputies have spoken on this and expressed different views.  According to Deputy Woods, this is a far-reaching provision which will allow divorce in a wide variety of circumstances and he was extremely critical of the wording of this provision. His colleague who spoke before me took a different view.  I was interested to listen to Deputy Wood's speech because it was my understanding that his party were effectively taking a neutral position in this debate.  They wish the issues to be discussed and debated, which is right, and he has a function &mdash; as we all have in this House &mdash; in teasing out the proposals before us.  But I was curious as to the language he used throughout the course of his speech which effectively decried the wording proposed and was very critical of the idea of introducing divorce legislation at all.  Yet, his even-handed approach, while clearly being opposed to change, fell short of indicating what alternative proposal he believes would be appropriate to deal with the various issues that arise.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that in principle it has been indicated that this debate will not divide on party political lines.  Indeed, I welcome the freedom that all Members <Col N="966" /> of my party have to express differing and varied views.  I respect colleagues' entitlement to do that.  We may disagree with each other on what is the right view, but at least we can conduct a mature debate on that issue.  I think it is slightly dishonest for the main speaker on the Opposition side, the Spokesman on Justice, to say he is adopting an even-handed view and then effectively give a presentation in this House which appears to be totally opposed to change in this area.  If that presentation related to some squabble about the wording for some particular reason and if it was meant in a way that was constructive, one would have anticipated that there might have been some proposal as to how to get around the difficulties that Deputy Woods perceived in this proposition.  Of course there was not, and the reason there was not is that most of the difficulties he perceived as existing are spurious, and I hope to demonstrate that fact in dealing with this issue.</P>
    <P>It was also noteworthy that he failed in his contribution to deal with the real problems that exist in the area of social reality as opposed to constitutional, academic theory.  He did not refer to any great degree to the reality of marital breakdown as it exists within our society today.  Effectively, much of his speech was based on the ideal concept of happy families all living together whose marriages do not break down and the perception was that if divorce is introduced it is going to immediately undermine all of these happy marriages.  The reality of Irish family life is that, while the overwhelming majority of couples are happily married, there is a significant number, an alarming number of couples, whose marriages are marriages in name only, whose marriages really do not exist except in legal theory.  I fail to understand how preserving a dead marriage in name only as a gesture towards the constitutional concept of the family in any way enhances the dignity of marriage or family life or protects the marriages of those families whose marriages are happy and functioning.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="967" /> This provision is a well-balanced proposal. It provides, first, that divorces cannot be obtained unless there is proof of a marriage having failed for a period of five years.  Deputy Woods in his contribution suggested that any husband or wife could simply walk into a court, say their marriage had failed, give an example of a particular instance and, hey presto, a divorce would be granted, that is, divorce on demand.  That is not a reality.  What Deputy Woods did not refer to in any detail or consider in his contribution was the necessity to prove that the marriage has failed for five years and the necessity to establish that there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation. They are two very strenuous, difficult conditions, and let nobody regard them as providing for easy divorce.  For the deserted wife, whose husband has left her and gone to live with another woman, who is told that she cannot dissolve her marriage for at least five years after the desertion has taken place, what Deputy Woods appears to regard as easy divorce will be seen as a harsh and difficult measure compounding much of the distress of people whose marriages do run into difficulties.  It will be very difficult to convince any husband or wife who has been deserted, who knows there is no possibility of the deserted spouse returning, that we are to have the most liberal and easiest form of divorce in the world when they are told they must live apart for five years and prove five years' failure before a divorce can be granted; and they must also establish that there is no practical possibility of reconciliation.</P>
    <P>This provision as a whole as opposed to simply extracting a few words and using them to make a spurious argument, does two things.  It extends the possibility of divorce and the right to remarry to people whose marriages have completely collapsed, while assuring everyone whose marriage is happy and those who fear that this might be the thin end of the wedge, that there cannot be divorce on demand in Ireland.  The suggestion that this is the most liberal form of divorce in the world is so ludicrous as to be unworthy of <Col N="968" /> serious consideration.  How can anybody suggest that the need to prove five years' failure, five years' separation, plus the absence of any possibility of reconciliation, is an easy means to obtain divorce? I think Deputy McCreevy put it correctly when he said five years is a very long time to wait for the victims of broken marriages, for those whose marriages have collapsed through no fault of their own and who are denied the possibility of remarriage for at least five years after the date of marital failure.</P>
    <P>As I said, I find it very difficult to take seriously the suggestion that in some way we are providing an easy system of divorce.  Anybody looking at this House from outside can see that that is an untruthful argument.  You do not have to be a lawyer to parse and analyse the effects of this provision, which is that five years' marital failure, five years' separation, must be established effectively in front of a court before a divorce can be obtained.  That is different to what exists in most other countries.  Examples have been given of the United States and England but then we are dealing with a totally different legal and social system.  In other jurisdictions after one or two years' separation, and in New York after six months' separation, people can get divorce decrees; but that is not possible under this provision.  No matter who says that this is an easy and liberal system of divorce, be it a religious body or group or anybody else, I think this is the most untenable objection to this constitutional proposal.</P>
    <P>What is the reality of the problem facing us in this area?  In Irish society we have thousands of people who, according to law, are married but who in factual and social reality are not only not residing with each other but are no longer in real terms married.  They may be legally married, they may have the legal facade of marriage attached to their relationship, but many thousands are long separated from their spouses.  Referring to them as being a married couple, with all the rights which Deputy Woods suggested are enjoyed under the Constitution by a married couple, is out of touch with reality.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="969" /> There is a need to pin down the statistics of marital breakdown in Ireland.  We have difficulties in this area and we will not know what the real statistics are until we see the results of the current census. There are statistics which indicate that the extent of the problem is far greater than has been calculated to date by any group.  The Divorce Action Group suggest that approximately 70,000 adults may be affected by marital breakdown and groups opposed to constitutional change talk about 20,000 to 25,000 people.  To some degree the figures are irrelevant in that, if people are separated and parties to a marriage which has irretrievably broken down, I would argue that there is no legal justification for requiring them to remain parties to that relationship.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that all these figures are conservative.  I base that belief on two sets of statistics which often emerge in a piecemeal way but which have not been analysed in detail and which I believe were not adequately dealt with by the Oireachtas Joint Committee.  The statistics, which are a very important indicator of the level of marital breakdown in Ireland, are those which relate to the numbers of couples going through our courts annually seeking court orders.  The majority of these couples seek barring orders and/or maintenance orders.  Not all who seek barring orders seek maintenance orders and <i>vice versa.</i> There has been an astronomical number of such cases going through our courts.  They get no publicity because they are heard in private.  Between 1980 and 1985 in excess of 15,000 wives went to the District Court seeking barring orders.  All wives who brought such proceedings did not always succeed in getting the barring orders sought but we can assume that in all those cases their marriage had ceased to exist in any real sense.  In those six years 30,000 adults were involved in barring cases in the District Court alone, and that is an extraordinarily high figure.</P>
    <P>The number of barring orders sought in the District Court between 1976 and 1980 was about 2,000 a year.  For the period 1980 to 1985, 8,963 wives sought <Col N="970" /> maintenance orders against their husbands in the District Courts.  In some instances the wives seeking maintenance orders were also seeking barring orders, but not always; there is not always an overlap between both.  If we said there were 15,000 couples whose marriages had collapsed and who came before our District Courts in a six year period, we would be underestimating the extent of the numbers.  Probably about one-third of the couples involved in maintenance proceedings could be added.</P>
    <P>Since the Circuit Court assumed a working jurisdiction in the area of family law in 1982 approximately 1,500 couples sought court orders&mdash;one spouse sought a court order against the other.  The couples who find themselves in the Circuit Court are different to those couples who find themselves in the District Court. Prior to 1982 a similar number of cases would appear in the High Court annually when the High Court dealt with many marital cases.  Therefore, we are talking about an extraordinary large number of couples whose marital breakdown problems have found them in our courts system because, following the collapse of their marriage, they have been unable themselves to work out the consequences of that collapse.</P>
    <P>We are talking equally about children affected.  For example, in 1984 there were 1,500 child custody cases alone in the District Court.  Deputies come in here and talk about divorce having an effect on children.  It is marital breakdown that has the effect and has all these people in court.  Whether we have divorce or not, we have this problem on a larger scale than anybody to date has documented properly.  As a practising lawyer who for almost 15 years has worked in the area and, despite being a Member of this House, still works in a part time way with couples whose marriages have broken down, I can say that for every couple who went into the courts when their marriage collapsed a minimum of two couples resolve the consequences of breakdown and separate by agreement without ever going near a court or being a part of these <Col N="971" /> court statistics.  Taking the District Court alone, between 1980 and 1985, 15,000 couples whose marriages had collapsed were involved in barring proceedings. For those 15,000 couples in that time I would estimate perhaps another 30,000 who resolved their problems by concluding separation agreements and who never will have to set foot in court at all.  I believe that the extent of the problem is not appreciated fully.  The statistics of estimates of the total number of couples or the total number of adults are not true indicators of the extent of the problem. These statistics, certified by courts which I am quoting from replies received to questions over the years in this House bring home the extent of the problem.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to deserted wives. Currently, 9,353 wives are in receipt of deserted wife's allowance or benefit and for those 9,353 wives, all of whom are deserted and none residing with their husbands, presumably there are 9,353 husbands living somewhere.  Reference has been made to the cost of divorce.  Have we ever considered the cost to this society of our not having a divorce possibility? What effect has the absence of a possibility of remarrying in the future on the lives of those 9,353 wives in receipt of deserted wife's allowance?  Be they 21 or 31 years or age, with one, two or no children, they know that, as our Constitution stands at the moment, the possibility of their ever experiencing a real, happy marriage within the laws of the State is non-existent.  How can it be suggested that we are enhancing family life in Ireland, giving dignity to the family, behaving compassionately and humanely, when we say to all of those wives, &ldquo;We are sorry, we are sacrificing you in the interests of some concept of public good&rdquo;? How many of those wives wish to remarry-and would have a possibility of remarrying if our Constitution did not prohibit it?  I do not know the answer but I am sure that quite a number of them would.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that this issue can be argued on the basis of where the financial benefit lay or did not lay.  One can argue that currently we lock people into the <Col N="972" /> status of deserted wives and forbid them from experiencing again a family life that is legally recognised by the State.  The extent of the problem is enormous and the impact of the absence of divorce is not truly understood.  A divorce provision does nothing other than recognise that the marriage has come to an end and extend the possibility of remarriage. Divorce is purely about remarriage and nothing else.  We have currently all the necessary mechanisms to recognise that a marriage has in effect terminated.  We grant decrees of separation.  Our courts recognise separation agreements as legally valid.  Courts make barring and maintenance orders, but the law currently denies the possibility of remarriage within the law to those whose marriages have collapsed.  I fail to understand how anybody can suggest that it is in the interest of or beneficial to Irish society to prevent a 27 year old battered wife, who has had to obtain court protection from a violent husband and have him barred, from ever remarrying unless she is lucky and her husband dies young, when that possibility might arise.  The only circumstances in which we allow a battered wife to remarry is if her husband's dies.  What advantage is there to Irish society, to marriage or to family life in saying that it enhances family life to tell that young woman, who is a wife in name only and has no prospect of ever again living with her husband, that we believe that it is in the interests of society that we forbid her to marry ever again?  I do not understand how anybody can suggest that that enhances the dignity of marriage or of family life.</P>
    <P>What about the 30 year old deserted husband who is left to care for three children and whose wife has gone to live permanently with someone else?  What advantage is there in saying to him that we are not again going to allow him to marry?  Is there some mystical benefit in locking him into a form of constitutional imprisonment where marriage, instead of being recognised as a viable, valuable, functional relationship, is turned into a constitutional sentence of life imprisonment to be imposed on the casualties of <Col N="973" /> broken marriages?  How is that advantageous, human, compassionate?</P>
    <P>There is something implicit in the speeches made by Deputy Woods and my colleague, Deputy Glenn, which has not been articulated fully in this debate.  The arguments they made in opposition to this proposal are virtually a carbon copy of many of the arguments that have been made against constitutional change by the bishops on behalf of the majority Church.  Indeed, Deputy Woods's contribution was extraordinarily similar to it. The bishops' pastoral <i>Love is for Life</i>, published in the spring of last year, is a very valuable document.  It is unfortunate that the issue within it that always gets public focus is the issue of divorce.  Much of what it says about family life and the need for family law reform is considered, considerate, humane and desirable. Indeed, in this area on occasion the majority Church, frequently criticised for no good reason, has to a considerable degree been streets ahead of politicians in recognising the need for change. Indeed, a report of the Episcopal Council for Social Welfare, a committee of the Catholic Bishops' Conference, articulated in 1975 the need for family courts and for changes in our separation laws, and people often fail to acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Love is for Life</i> presents itself not simply as a theological argument but as a sociological analysis of family life and, in dealing with the issue of divorce &mdash; an extract from the new pastoral apparently being prepared is published in <i>The Irish Times</i> today &mdash; makes a number of sociological asertions which are not intended to be based on any theological preconceptions. Many of those sociological assertions were contained in the speech by Deputy Woods, although he never once referred to the document or to the fact that he was articulating a particular point of view, as he is entitled to do, and the source of that point of view.  His views clearly accord with the views expressed and published in <i>The Irish Times</i> today as being the contents of the new pastoral or letter to be published on this issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="974" /> I wish to turn to some of the sociological assertions contained in the pastoral which mirror similar assertions made by Deputy Woods in his speech.  I will quote an extract from <i>The Irish Times</i> today:</P>
    <P>It is true that morality cannot be legally enforced.  One cannot impose virtue by law.  Yet one can by law create conditions unfavourable to virtue.  Certain kinds of law can make virtue more difficult and non-virtue more likely.  Law and morality are interlinked.</P>
    <P>Presumably that means it is virtuous not to have divorce but it is certainly not virtuous to have it.  How is it virtuous to deny&mdash;this is a sociological perception of how law works in an ordered society and the influence it has&mdash;to that 27 year old battered wife or the 30 year old deserted husband to whom I referred the right to remarry?  Is it immoral to extend to them the right to remarry, because the suggestion is that it is?  It is a colourful assertion with no basis in fact.  I believe that the majority of people would take the view that it is virtuous, compassionate and right to extend the possibility of remarriage to those couples whose marriages have collapsed and who are the casualties or victims of broken marriages.</P>
    <P>The article went on to say:</P>
    <P>Law is, among many other things, a statement of what society regards as socially and morally acceptable.</P>
    <P>Is it not socially and morally acceptable to permit the casualties or victims of broken marriages to remarry?  Is it socially or morally acceptable to deny to them throughout their lifetime that right?  Most people, if asked that question, would take the view that it is acceptable when someone is the casualty of a broken marriage that he or she should be allowed to remarry and would wish to extend to them the possibility and happiness of a second marriage.</P>
    <P>In the discussion that has taken place about marriage there is often confusion as to what is being talked about.  Marriage can be referred to as a number of things &mdash;a contract, a status, a relationship or <Col N="975" /> a constitutionally recognised institution. Many of those who oppose change use, in referring to marriage, the quoted words &ldquo;a commitment for life&rdquo;.  This phrase encapsulates the argument very well.  The previously quoted document suggests that if you have divorce the commitment for life is replaced by a legal commitment to stay with one's spouse until one decides otherwise.</P>
    <P>The problem with that is that marriage is not simply a contract, it is a relationship and, as the law currently stands, when a marriage breaks down no one can be compelled to continue living with their marital partner.  You cannot by constitutional prescription force two people who are incompatible, and who, unfortunately, often grow into a condition whereby they detest each other, to live together. You cannot by constitutional prescription make marriages viable and you cannot, by legal or constitutional rhetoric about commitments for life, ensure that people implement those commitments.  When the Constitution was being drawn up the view was that by prohibiting divorce you would ensure that marriages would not break down.  We have seen that that is not the reality.  All the constitutional rhetoric in the world will not guarantee that couples will have a happy and viable marital relationship and certainly will not ensure that marriages will continue.  Is there any purpose in continuing to require the existence of a legal contract which contains the theory that a couple are married when their relationship has collapsed?  What is the purpose of preserving a meaningless and empty shell? Why &mdash; it has become something of a euphemism in the circumstances &mdash; is there a belief that by preserving in theory and adopting the approach of maintaining a marriage that has ceased to exist we are protecting the continued existence of other marriages which are viable and functioning?  I do not understand that kind of logic or approach.</P>
    <P>The current law does not even provide for the limited circumstances in which members of the majority Church can obtain dissolutions of marriage.  The <Col N="976" /> people who express views in opposition to change have never commented on that. When the joint committee were hearing evidence all the minority Churches made the case that whereas the ideal was that marriages would be permanent and happy unions, they all acknowledged that marriages collapse and they sought a constitutional change to recognise the need for divorce.  Many of the groups who represented the view of the majority Church said that they were totally opposed to divorce, but none of them seemed to be able to deal with the fact that the current law deprives members of the majority Church of rights which the Church extends to them.  I never heard anybody speaking with the authority of that Church explain to me if we continue to prohibit divorce what I, as a legislator, should do to cope with the fact that the Roman Catholic Church permits divorce in clearly defined circumstances.  I am talking about divorce and not annulment.</P>
    <P>In the new translation of Canon Law published a couple of years ago Canon 1142 and the following canons in that code detail the circumstances in which what the Code of Canon Law describes as dissolutions of marriage can be granted. Under the major heading, &ldquo;Separation of Spouses&rdquo;, and the subheading, &ldquo;Dissolution of the Bond&rdquo;, Canon Law prescribes three circumstances in which the marriages of Roman Catholic couples can be dissolved.  That is frequently confused by lay people not versed in Canon Law with annulments.  It is something quite different and distinct.  Under the provisions of Canons 1141 to 1150 there are three circumstances where a marriage can can be dissolved.  Firstly, a marriage can be dissolved by the Church if it is not consummated and, secondly, by the Pauline privilege, a marriage entered into by two unbaptised persons is dissolved in favour of the faith of the party who receives baptism if that party enters into a new marriage with a member of the Church. The third case is where a Roman Catholic party marries an unbaptised person.  Let us consider the case of a Roman Catholic who marries a Jewish person or somebody of the Moslem faith.  If that Roman <Col N="977" /> Catholic person at a future date decides that he or she wants to marry somebody of the Roman Catholic religion that first marriage can also be dissolved by the Church.  They are the three specific circumstances in which the Church currently grants dissolutions of marriage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a dissolution of the marriage which, effectively, is divorce.  There is a dissolution of the bond.  The current constitutional provision seeks to prevent the State from enacting laws to permit the dissolution of marriage while the proposed provision will permit the State to effectively grant decrees of dissolution where a marriage has failed.  The words used are, &ldquo;the court may in accordance with law grant a dissolution of the marriage...&rdquo;  We have the odd position in which members of the majority religion here can obtain Church dissolutions but are denied the right to obtain civil dissolutions which recognise, effectively, the decree of divorce granted by their Church.</P>
      <P>Of course, we have also the other problem that arises: that the nullity laws of the Church have developed to a degree that are far more liberal than our civil laws despite the recent judicial developments of civil law.  Between 95 and 100 decrees of annulment are granted annually by the marriage tribunals of the Roman Catholic Church.  We have the curious position here whereby, following the granting of such Church decrees of annulment, the Church is prepared to remarry in church, those couples to second spouses, although in civil law the Church decree is not recognised and the couple are still regarded as married to their first spouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that the Church, by granting such decrees of annulment and allowing people to remarry, is adding to the social malaise and problems we have. In citing what is happening elsewhere in other countries it is interesting to note that no Member has yet referred to the fact that in England no Church decree of <Col N="978" /> annulment will be granted until a couple have first obtained a civil decree of divorce.  It is recognised there that major problems can arise if marriages take place in church without the first marriage being brought to an end civilly.  I have difficulty in understanding how the outright objections being voiced to any form of dissolution of marriage by those speaking on behalf of the majority Church can be reconciled with the fact that the Church itself grants dissolutions of marriage and also grants annulments in circumstances in which the civil law cannot do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods criticised the constitutional proposal because it provides, as he described it, &ldquo;in a positive way&rdquo; for divorce.  He described them as a positive form of words and asked why the Government proposed to deal with this matter in this way.  I was very confused at that comment because I sat for 18 months on the marital committee with him and we discussed this issue in great detail.  One of the things we agreed about in dealing with this issue&mdash;we did not always agree about this issue&mdash;was that if there was a constitutional change to permit divorce it could not be brought about by simply deleting the current prohibition from the Constitution.  Paragraph 7.8.25 of the report of that committee states:</P>
    <P>To ensure that no constitutional ambiguity results from any such referendum, [that is a reference to a divorce referendum] the Committee is of the view that any amendment to be voted upon should be in a positive format, replacing the present Article 41.3.2º with a provision, specifically authorising the Oireachtas to legislate for the dissolution of marriage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods was critical in his comments in regard to this.  I do not know if he was doing that for a convenient additional debating point, but he was critical of the fact that this provision was going to positively permit the enactment of divorce legislation.  The Deputy was party to that agreed report and that was an aspect of the report that did not produce any division within the committee. It was acknowledged as necessary as a <Col N="979" /> result of the legal advice given and debated within the committee.</P>
    <P>Much play is being made about the possible consequences of divorce if we permit it.  It has been suggested that the wives of the first marriage might be left destitute, that the children of the first marriage will lose their succession rights. A whole series of worrying possibilities have been deliberately raised and thrown up as deriving from the possible introduction of divorce legislation.  What is forgotten in dealing with these is that currently those things can happen.  I am not saying they are desirable, but they can happen. Currently, when marriages break down and husbands and wives separate they can make arrangements in regard to their property and financial affairs to ensure that if one or other dies the deserted spouse, or the spouse left alone, is left with no money or property.  Currently, the law in this area is defective and the proposed reforms that will allow the courts to make property transfer orders to provide financial protection for wives when marriages breakdown, as promised in the Government's document of intent, will provide far greater protection than currently exists, even without divorce, for many wives who are caught in regard to marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>The horror scenario that Deputy Woods has painted is not a legal reality. The legal reality is that the provision it is proposed to include in the Constitution will ensure, and provide as far as any law can, that dependent spouses are fully and properly protected.  It will not in any circumstances deprive children of a first marriage, where a divorce has been granted, of their succession rights.  That I must describe as&mdash;although I do not like resorting to this language&mdash;one of the more nonsensical suggestions or proposals in Deputy Woods' speech.  The fact that a marriage may be dissolved will not mean that the children of that marriage cease to be children of their parents. Under existing statutory law those children will retain their succession rights. Currently we have this predicament. Where foreign decrees of divorce are <Col N="980" /> granted and recognised here&mdash;they are recognised in Ireland in certain circumstances&mdash;with a parent or parents living in Ireland and one of the divorced parents dies, the children of those parents still retain all their succession rights.  Their position is not affected and the suggestion that it could be affected by a domestic decree of divorce is utter nonsense.  The contribution of Deputy Woods on this area was very curious.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods threw up a number of possible horror scenarios if one permits divorce, none of which, I believe, are correct or can be substantiated.  He then went on to say that, whereas all of these problems derive from the granting of a divorce, he appears to favour reform and extending the law of nullity.  He used the words that civil nullity laws could deal with many of the problems of broken marriages without a constitutional amendment.  He did not come to the logical conclusion there.  Is he suggesting that nullity laws, instead of divorce laws, should be used to bring marriages to a legal termination when the relationships have irretrievably collapsed?  That seemed to be what he was suggesting, that there is no need to go about having a referendum, that we should simply provide for nullity and extend nullity laws. Nullity, as a remedy to deal with marital breakdown instead of divorce, would have a far more devastating effect and consequence for the individuals, parties to the marriage annulled, than ever could a divorce decree.</P>
    <P>A civil decree of annulment used as a mechanism instead of divorce would have the following effects.  It would be a court decision that a marriage never existed.  A couple might have lived together for 15 or 20 years but the effect of that would be to say that marriage was no marriage. The decree of annulment would not permit the courts to provide for maintenance because no longer would a wife be a dependent spouse or divorced spouse; she would cease altogether to be a wife. The wife would lose her maintenance rights.  Any property in which she resided would cease to be a family home because the law would take the view that she was <Col N="981" /> no longer a spouse, in fact that she never had been one.  Any succession rights that she had would be instantly obliterated by the granting of a decree of annulment. Any children of a marriage that is annulled are retrospectively made illegitimate or, as they used to describe it in the last century, retrospectively bastardised.</P>
    <P>That would be the effect of the granting of a decree of annulment.  The idea and suggestion that we should forget about having a referendum, that nullity should be used instead of divorce to deal with the consequences of marital breakdown and to extend recognition to the fact that a marriage is at an end, is an extraordinary proposal from someone who has expresed concern as to the possible property or financial consequences for a dependent spouse of the granting of a decree of divorce.  It needs to be emphasised that nullity obliterates all rights. Nullity is a court decision that there never was a marriage.  Nullity retrospectively bastardises children.  A child of 15 or 16, as a result of such a decree, will suddenly be told that the person he thought to be his father and guardian, in law, is not a relation to him at all.  I find that an extraordinary suggestion.</P>
    <P>The consequences of nullity are so devastating in this context that to object to divorce on the basis that Deputy Woods expressed his objections and then suggest nullity as an appropriate alternative is a totally untenable proposition.  He stated that the silent majority would avail of the civil law as to separation or nullity but not divorce.  I have no doubt that there will be people whose marriages tragically collapse, who may in future years still avail of separation, that small numbers of them may have the possibility of getting a decree of annulment, and who will not go on to obtain divorces because of their personal religious beliefs.  But this provision will not make divorce compulsory. They will not be compelled into a position where they have to seek divorces.  I find the idea that nullity in some way should be used instead of a divorce law or divorce jurisdiction something that does not withstand any real examination.</P>
    <P>A lot has been made of the argument <Col N="982" /> that if we provide for divorce it will result in broken marriages, that divorce of itself will be a catalyst to marital breakdown. At the beginning of my speech I referred to the statistics which show that in the absence of divorce we have a gigantic problem of marital breakdown in any case.</P>
    <P>There are two quotes worth putting on the record of the House from the oral hearings of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  They deal with both the issues of nullity and of divorce and with a lot of the alarmist comments made about divorce causing marital breakdown. They deal also with the oddities of nullity.  The comments come from Doctor Jack Dominian, to whom Deputy Flaherty referred, who is not only a well known expert in the area of marriage but is also a renowned Catholic theologian who has written many works in the area of theology and marriage.  He has a great deal of expertise, probably one of the people between both the Republic of Ireland and the British Isles who has most expertise in the area of marital breakdown. He was one of the people who came to make submissions to the oral hearings of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, one of the people requested by the committee to present their views.  He dealt with the issue of nullity as follows.  He said&mdash;and I quote from page 46 of the Minutes of Evidence taken before the committee:</P>
    <P>The heart of nullity as practised in the Catholic Church is really a statement at the end that this marriage did not meet the minimum criteria of the nature of marriage.  This is really a declaration that there never was a marriage here.  It is a very funny declaration, because people can have nullities after up to 20 years of marriage, but that is essentially what it is all about.</P>
    <P>He was then asked to deal with the issue of divorce.  He was asked: was it his view that marriage break down because of the availability of divorce, was it divorce of itself that was the catalyst to broken marriages? Reference was made to the statistics in England and in America.  Doctor <Col N="983" /> Dominian dealt in great detail with what he saw as the causes of marital breakdown which did not relate in fact to the availability of divorce at all but which related to the nature of the society in which people were living, their personal religious beliefs, the social position of that society, the economics of that society, the position of women in society. He detailed a whole series of matters. In dealing with this issue he said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>I have to say that if this room was filled by the Roman Catholic Bishops of Ireland and they were pushing me very hard about divorce, I would have to say very clearly that their fear that civil divorce would make marital breakdown worse or enhance it or facilitate it&mdash;my answer would have to be: no, it will make very little difference.</P>
    <P>That comes from a man who approaches the issue from a particular theological perspective, from a man who has great experience of working in the area of marital breakdown.  It is regrettable and unfortunate that this fear is being floated. How baseless is that fear in the context of someone having to wait five years to get a divorce after their marriage has failed.  In what way can that be seen as an incentive to separation?  People often lose sight of the fact&mdash;I have witnessed it at first hand with many people&mdash;that no one takes with equanimity the collapse of their marriage no matter what the circumstances. Usually it takes two people to make a broken marriage.  Few marriages collapse due solely to the fault of one spouse.  Usually it is due to the interaction of a couple, each party to the marriage, that a marriage breaks down. But the realisation that a marriage has totally collapsed can be devastating for the parties affected by it, the sense of grief and loss experienced by the couple who, when they did marry, genuinely believed, to use the words of the Bishop's Pastoral, that love was for life.  Few enter marriage with any different belief but love may be for life for many people, but not for all.  The grief that people <Col N="984" /> experience when their marriages collapse can be exacerbated by the inhumanity of the law which denies to them the possibility of a second chance, a second possibility to enter into a marriage that may function, may be viable and may work.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to children and my colleague, Deputy Flaherty, dealt with that issue.  No doubt, children are affected by marriages which break down and children in Ireland are currently being affected by marriages that break down.  Marriages will continue to break down in this country, whether we have divorce or not.  For many children, the possibility of a parent remarrying will extend the possibility to them of seeing happy family life at first hand, having experienced or witnessed very unhappy family life, living within a house in which their parents are continuously at war with each other.  I do not accept the spurious argument that divorce of itself in some way prejudices children, or is harmful to them.  I do not see how in any way it can enhance the position of children or protect their welfare to deny to a parent with whom a child is living the possibility of remarriage when the position is such that their parents will never again live together in a real marriage relationship. Much of the research done in this area has clearly established that, so far as children are affected, they are affected by the fact that the marriage breaks down, not by the fact of divorce.  Some of the research which suggests otherwise often confuses the terminology by using the word &ldquo;divorce&rdquo; as synonymous with marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>The feelings which children have as a result of parents separating are real feelings of grief and concern and sometimes they feel abandoned by the separating parent.  We have that situation at the moment.  For a country so concerned about this issue, where people in the House devote themselves to the rhetoric of concern, it is extraordinary how little research we have done as to the impact of broken marriages in Ireland on Irish children.  We continuously have to rely on the experiences of other countries which could be quite different from ours.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> I have no doubt that this issue will be widely debated during the coming weeks, both outside and inside this House.  I also hope that the debate will be restrained and considered and that people will not, for party political reasons or otherwise, throw up false fears to prevent rational and reasoned consideration of the proposals which have been made.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that I wanted to conclude by very briefly moving away from the divorce issue and referring to the other proposals that the Government have made.  Deputy Woods listed the legislation in existence to protect spouses and suggested that the provision of divorce would deprive dependent spouses of all that protection.  I think that I dealt with that adequately and clearly expressed the view that it is not true. Again, the rhetoric of this House, to someone still relatively new to the House, deserves to be treated cynically by people outside the House.  It is noteworthy that much of this legislation to which Deputy Woods referred, such as the Family Home Protection Act of 1976, and the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act of 1976, which provided both for maintenance and barring orders, came from a Coalition Government.  It did not come from the party opposite.  It was legislation which in its time provided protections that had been needed for over a decade and had long been sought.  I cannot help being somewhat cynical about the views expressed on that issue and am even more cynical for another reason.  It is that the constitutional rhetoric about concern for the family is not something experienced in real terms by those who come into contact with marital breakdown and the victims of marital breakdown who find themselves before our courts.  We have currently a court system operating which can be described as Dickensian in the way in which it treats couples whose marriages have collapsed.  I would invite any Deputy who is going to engage in rhetoric of concern about the family, and who does so in the context of opposing this change, to visit the Dublin Circuit Court on any Monday morning to see how we <Col N="986" /> protect families, cherish the institution of marriage and take seriously the need currently to provide protection for children and dependent spouses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods's party in the Courts Act of 1981 sent most of our marital law out of the High Court and into the Circuit Court.  There should have been a good reason for doing so.  It should have made it less expensive for people who have to litigate and are caught in the tragedy of broken marriages to have their problems dealt with in the Circuit Court.  However, the problem with that court is that there are no facilities to deal with marital problems. None of the judges has any special training in these areas.  As a practising lawyer, no doubt, I shall get into trouble for saying this, but very few of them operating in the Circuit Court have any real sensitivity or insight into the problems, and that applies to a number of those who are currently adjudicating in the area of marital law.</P>
    <P>On a Monday morning in the Dublin Circuit Court there may be 30 or 40 husbands and wives hanging around in corridors, with no privacy and no consultation rooms available, being pushed out of the way by six foot gardaí who have criminal offenders attached to them by handcuffs as they make their way into the Criminal Court which is adjacent to the Circuit Court dealing with family cases.  Each of the partners whispers and talks to his or her lawyer or barrister across the corridor and then heads into a court which, to be diplomatic, could be described as less than adequate to deal sensitively with the problems deriving from marriage breakdown. It was the party opposite who subjected people to that system and who are now articulating the rhetoric of concern for the Irish family, marital breakdown and family life.  I find that nauseating.  I am one of the few Members of this House to see it at first hand on a weekly basis. I see the shock that registers on the faces of young wives when they see the system to which they are being subjected, the vagaries of that system and the lack of uniformity in the application of the law by judges, many of whom would prefer to be dealing with other areas of law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" /> I welcome the proposal made by the Minister to establish family courts, but that proposal will have to be teased out. In welcoming the principle of that proposal and acknowledging that this Government are the first in the history of this State to acknowledge the need for family courts, and recognising that they have done so in response to the report from the Oireachtas marital committee, I would sound notes of caution about that.  If we implement family courts, let us make them real family courts.  I should like confirmation in this House that we are not talking about a mere gesture of describing the current Circuit Court system as a family court.  I should like someone to confirm to me, by the end of this debate, that the family courts we are going to establish will take all marital family law disputes which come before our courts out of the current District, Circuit and High Court system and have them dealt with within a separate court structure which operates within the Circuit Court areas, with judges specially qualified and specially appointed, with a proper back-up welfare service attached to it.  I want some sort of recognition to be given to the fact that judges operating in family courts require some type of inter-disciplinary training.  It is not good enough that the fact that barristers or solicitors have been qualified for ten or 12 years should of itself result in a decision being made that they are the appropriate people to be appointed to adjudicate in family courts.  I want this proposal fleshed out.</P>
    <P>Whether we have or do not have divorce, family courts are desirable of themselves.  It is a disgrace to this House that the constitutional rhetoric of years gone by did not result in recognition long ago of the need for a special system of family courts.  Now that we have a commitment to provide those courts, we must get it right.  It must not be a gesture in the direction of calling an existing court system a family court.  The same applies in the context of the provision of conciliation and mediation services.  Like Deputy Flaherty, I take great exception <Col N="988" /> to the suggestion that those of us in this House who want to see change, who recognise the need for divorce and who recognise a need to extend to couples the right to remarry are in some way opposed to the family or anti-family.</P>
    <P>One of the curiosities is that most of us who are looking for that change are people who either still within this House or prior to our coming to this House worked at firsthand with the victims and casualties of broken marriages.  I am not sure that can be said by Deputy Woods or my colleague, Deputy Glenn, or some of the others who are opposed to change. I want to see a humane and compassionate system which allows people whose marriages have collapsed to be dealt with in a sensitive and considerate way.  I want to get away from the rhetoric of concern and see a substantive reality brought to bear on the way we currently operate in these areas.  We must recognise that the thousands of people whose marriages are marriages in name only are entitled to have the possibility of future marital happiness extended to them.</P>
    <P>I hope that following polling day on the referendum this new provision will be included in the Constitution.  I am going to sound a warning and it is that I do not believe anybody who is in favour of change should be complacent and believe this will automatically succeed as a constitutional proposal.  I do not think those people who work in these areas and who have seen at firsthand the tragedies of marital breakdown&mdash;all those thousands of families throughout the country who have been touched by marital breakdown and the sons and daughters, aunts and uncles, neighbours and friends whom they have seen to be the victims of marriages which have collapsed&mdash;and who recognise that in all humanity and compassion constitutional change is desirable should assume between now and the end of June, or whenever we have polling day, that because the opinion polls now say there is a majority in favour of change there will automatically be a successful result to this referendum.</P>
    <P>All of those who believe there is a need for change should in the coming weeks <Col N="989" /> commit themselves to ensuring that not only do they vote but their friends and everyone else vote also.  Nobody on the day of this referendum should be too busy with their own lives to forget the need to vote for compassion and humanity to be extended to the lives of those whose marriages have collapsed.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate which in many respects is an historic occasion.  There have been many times over the past few years when people like myself and others who have consistently campaigned for the abolition of the ban on divorce in the Constitution felt that there was no party, certainly no major party, willing to grasp this nettle.  The credit has to go to the Government for having done so.  I am sure there are Deputies in the Government parties who would prefer not to have that credit but at least they are prepared at this point to permit the people to give their verdict on this very important issue.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to one of Deputy Shatter's final points in connection with the referendum in that clearly the referendum has still to be won.  There will be no automatic passing of this referendum. I would also make the point that, assuming the legislation comes before the current Dáil, there may be a far different approach by Deputies on all sides of the House towards the specific divorce legislation which has to be passed once the referendum has been won.  As I say there are Deputies on the Government side as there are clearly Deputies on the Fianna Fáil side who oppose divorce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is something of a wonder to me that the Fianna Fáil Party have taken the line which they have which is a line of apparent neutrality on this central issue for the people.  Being the largest single party in the State I would have expected them to take a more responsible attitude to the issue.  It is nonsensical for a political party involved in the politics of this State since 1926 to adopt the attitude that they as a party will not be involved in deciding a constitutional issue and that individual Deputies may make up their own minds <Col N="990" /> and may campaign in their own areas, if they wish, one way or the other.  This is, to my mind, an abdication of their responsibility towards political matters in this State.</P>
    <P>Having said that I would also say that clearly there have been changes within the Fianna Fáil Party since the expulsion of Deputy O'Malley who was suspended for having failed to support the party in their opposition to the family planning amendment last year.  It now seems that Deputies are permitted to have their own views and to express those views.  As I say, the Government deserve credit for bringing forward this legislation.  I would say the reasons it has been brought before us at this point derive more from the need for the survival of the parties concerned in view of the pressures which have been building up both within the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party for development and progress in social legislation.</P>
    <P>I have expressed reservations about the Bill before us today but I recognise, and it has to be recognised by all those who want a divorce jurisdiction, that whatever our reservations are about the specific criteria which are being included in the Constitution, basically the ban on divorce is being abolished by this amendment. It is, therefore, a considerable advance over the situation which we are presently faced with.  For that reason also there is a clear obligation on all parties, and I am not just talking about political parties but also about lay groups and so on, who recognise the need for humane divorce legislation, to get out and co-operate with each other in ensuring that the referendum is won and that there is a massive yes vote on this amendment.  I and my party will be exercising whatever ability we have outside and inside this House to encourage people to support the referendum.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism: Motion (Resumed.)</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Woods on Tuesday, 13 May 1986:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="991" /> That Dáil Éireann requests the Government to provide the Garda Síochána with the resources needed to enable them to deal effectively with the present unacceptable levels of crime, lawlessness and vandalism.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann approves the provision by the Government to the Garda Síochána of the resources which have enabled the Force to combat crime more effectively, resulting in a reduction in the levels of reported crime in 1984 and 1985, and supports the Government's further action in this direction.</P>

      <P>I refer to the Minister's opening paragraph last night where he said he found it a little difficult to understand why the Deputy thought it necessary to put down his original motion.  He also said that the facts of the matter are that crime is on the decrease and that whatever resources the Garda need to tackle it have been and will continue to be provided for them.  That is not true.  If the Minister is out of touch with what is happening throughout the country, particularly in Garda stations in Cork with which I am very familiar, I will bring him up to date very quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the House are by now no doubt well aware of the incompetence of the present Government when it comes to tackling the widespread problems of crime which we are experiencing in our society at present.  People are sick and tired of the total lack of commitment by the present Minister and his predecessor to tackle the serious and violent crimes to which we are being subjected by gangs of violent thugs and bully boys who thumb their noses at the Garda and at <Col N="992" /> society in general.  We have been subjected to an unprecedented wave of armed robberies in the past few months. Yet what have this Government done? The clear and unequivocal answer given to me and to other Deputies by our constituents is absolutely nothing.  The Government seem to be more concerned with their media image.  This is particularly true of the Ministers for Justice present and past.  We have only to look at the recent debacle on Spike Island to see just how true this is.</P>
    <P>The prison on Spike Island was opened in a blaze of publicity.  When it was destroyed by prisoners, the then Minister for Justice was quick to talk about proposals for a major redevelopment of the prison.  Yet what happened?  The answer is nothing.  We had the sorry spectacle of the present Minister appearing at a news conference in Cork prison and being clearly embarrassed at having to admit that no proposals had ever been put to the Government for the redevelopment of Spike Island.  This was considered by his predecessor, Deputy Noonan, as a priority.  How can the public have any confidence in a Government who are unable or unwilling to implement plans which they consider are necessary and urgent?</P>
    <P>We are living in a time of unprecedented crime levels.  The pattern of crime has changed dramatically.  We now see more violent crimes.  Personal assaults, especially on the elderly, are now more commonplace.  Action must be taken in a number of areas to combat and reverse the levels of crime, lawlessness and vandalism in our country today.  A fundamental area which needs urgent attention, if we are serious about solving the present problems, is the provision of sufficient resources to the Garda Síochána to enable them to carry out their work effectively and efficiently.  Those resources include not only equipment but also manpower.  These resources must be made available immediately.  The Garda must be provided with the most up-to-date equipment in transport and communications. The manpower must be increased.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="993" /> To come back to my opening remarks about the position in Cork, we were delighted last year when just before the local elections two new Garda stations were opened after much agitation for many years.  At the time I complimented the Government on opening those stations and recognising the need for them. Unfortunately, I have to be very critical tonight of the fact that those stations are half empty.  I would like to ask the Minister: where are the personnel who were supposed to occupy those premises?</P>
    <P>The geographical division of areas in Cork is absolutely crazy.  I would like to refer to the Watercourse Road Garda station.  This is a new area almost double the area which existed before the new stations were divided up.  There has been no additional personnel provided.  This week there has been a reduction in personnel in the station.  They have taken in a big urban area of local authority and a big urban area of local authority and private housing, schools and banks, all of which need additional resources and additional personnel to ensure proper security and proper manning for the public.  Unfortunately, there is a total absence of this.  There has been a request for a Garda car for the station as a replacement for an old car but that request has not been answered.  The Minister told us last night that any assistance the Garda need they have got and they will get in the future.  That is a fallacy. I appeal to the Minister to give immediate assistance to the stations in Cork because of the nature of the changes that took place.</P>
    <P>At the district headquarters in Gurranebraher, the personnel waited for three months for a car.  In that station there is a superintendent, an inspector, four sergeants and almost 40 gardaí. There was only one car, a detective car, in operation there.  When the gardaí in Ballincollig were not on duty the gardaí in Gurranebraher were expected to cover that area.  While we welcome the new stations, the way in which they are divided up is crazy.  It is not alone frustrating the public but also the gardaí.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the <Col N="994" /> gardaí in that area, for their commitment and dedication in carrying out their duty under very difficult circumstances.  I ask the Minister to be sincere in this matter. I am not trying to be political or to be critical.  I want to speak on behalf of the people of Cork who are totally frustrated at the lack of protection and security from the Government.  It is not good enough to come in here and say that the gardaí will get all the assistance they need when the realities of the situation are very clear.  That assistance is not forthcoming. The facts and figures are there for the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the neighbourhood watch scheme.  There are 170 schemes in operation involving 50,000 people.  I presume the Minister is picking up the register and saying 5,000 people in a certain area are involved in the neighbourhood watch scheme.  There are one or two schemes in Cork and there are others which we are anxious to get off the ground.  If those schemes are set up, the resources of the gardaí are not there to back them up.  It would be unfair to expect the public to be civic minded, to assist the gardaí and to report suspicious activities in their area and then find that the necessary back-up facilities are not available.  Because of the shortage of manpower I cannot see those schemes operating successfully.  If anything, they would be a disadvantage both to the community and to the gardaí.</P>
    <P>It is more vital than ever before that the duties of the Garda are defined.  I said in this House and in Cork that many of the duties of the Garda are unacceptable because of the demands on the force, because of the security situation and because of the very large numbers of gardaí who have been drafted to the Border.  It is vital that every opportunity is taken to release gardaí from office duties and duties such as putting parking tickets on cars.  On the one hand we are trying to improve relations with the gardaí in community meetings and by encouraging them to become more involved in the community but on the other <Col N="995" /> hand they are putting parking tickets on our cars.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to be sincere about this because we are all affected by the crime problem.  The Garda have not the full support of the Government and if that is not forthcoming the honourable thing for the Minister and the Government to do is to resign and let a Fianna Fáil Government give the Garda the full support they need if they are to afford proper protection for the community, particularly the elderly who are intimidated and terrorised by thugs and bullies.</P>
    <P>There has been talk about the west of Ireland, but there are many other parts of the country, including the urban areas of Cork and Dublin, in regard to which there has not been a positive response from the Minister.  There should be more manpower available in Garda stations. For instance, it is a disgrace to any police force to be asked to inhabit the Watercourse Road Garda station in Cork.  The gardaí are working out of a temporary building which has been classed as being a fire hazard.  Would the Minister get on with the job of renovating the building next door to help the gardaí who are trying to do a very difficult job?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to respond to a number of points raised by Deputies on the opposite side of the House.  Some of the statements made cannot be allowed to go on the record of this House unrefuted.  The first item I would like to turn my attention to is the reference by Deputy Woods to a statement that it is untrue that spiked chains have been provided to deal with so-called joyriders.  I would like to set the matter straight here and now, for the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of sets of spiked chains have been issued to the Garda Síochána to deal with the upsurge in car stealing, joyriding and ramming of patrol cars which arose early last year.  Because the use of the spiked chains is inherently dangerous to other road users, and could be dangerous also to members of the Garda manning a road block, the advice of the <Col N="996" /> Attorney General was sought by the Garda authorities before they were issued to the force.  The Attorney General issued guidelines as to when these chains could be used, having due regard to the law of the land and the necessity to provide for the safety of other road users.  While one appreciates the feelings of those who would wish to see the problem of joyriders tackled &ldquo;head on&rdquo;, as it were, the fact of the matter is that the law officers have advised on the legality of using spiked chains.  It would be foolish for anybody to suggest that the chains be used other than in accordance with the law officers' directions.</P>
    <P>I must also raise at this stage Deputy Woods' allegations about racketeering, which he made in the House last night.  I am afraid that Deputy Woods cannot be allowed to remain coy about this one. Either he comes clean and reports the matter to the Garda or else he withdraws the allegation.  He should name to the gardaí the public house which he claims cannot be sold because of the involvement of racketeers, or else he should not have made the allegation in the first place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods is quite adept at making these sort of allegations.  He did so before in 1983, after a court case had received some publicity.  He claimed in a radio interview that there was a widespread racket in operation in Dublin.  Subsequently, he was interviewed by a superintendent and a detective sergeant of the Garda but was unable to supply any further useful information.  He was not able to supply the name of even one person who was alleged to be paying protection money.  Because of his past history of making these sorts of allegations I must ask Deputy Woods, plainly speaking, to come off it.  Either he puts up, or shuts up.  If he knows of a racket in existence he should go the the Garda with whatever information is available to him.  If this whole racketeering business is an invention, then the allegation should be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods went on last night to claim that civilian posts were being left unfilled because of the embargo in the <Col N="997" /> public service.  The facts of the matter are that 112 clerical trainees have been assigned to the Garda Síochána in recent months and they have been engaged in a range of clerical duties which has had the effect of making some additional gardaí available for outdoor partol duty.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to a point raised by Deputy Lyons, that is, the development of the neighbourhood watch scheme.  Deputy Lyons claims that the scheme seems to be floundering, because, he says, it is starved of resources, manpower and direction.  The facts of the matter are that specific senior officers in Garda Headquarters have been specially assigned to the development and extension of the neighbourhood watch scheme.  Moreover, the scheme itself, once in operation, does not deplete Garda recources.  Rather, it adds to them.  The scheme makes available to the gardaí thousands of extra pairs of eyes and ears to assist them in their task of crime prevention.  Accordingly, the alleged failure of the scheme because of alleged lack of resources does not arise.</P>
    <P>Next I would like to compliment Deputy Ahern for the constructive way in which he approached the debate.  His acknowledgment of the improvement in the crime situation, particularly as regards car thefts in the Dublin area, is a refreshing change from those on the Opposition benches who will do nothing but criticise because they feel that is the only function they serve.</P>
    <P>It is commendable also that Deputy Ahern recognises the beneficial effect of the major technological developments which have taken place within the force over the past three and a half years.  Criticism, for the sake of criticism itself, does little in the way of stimulating constructive debate.  I welcome Deputy Ahern's statement that gardaí are back on the beat on foot in a number of areas from which he says they had pulled out four or five years ago.  I want to make it clear, as far as this Government are concerned, that there will be no &ldquo;no go&rdquo; areas as far as the Garda are concerned.  Whatever resources, manpower or equipment are necessary will be provided to ensure that <Col N="998" /> even the most difficult areas will be patrolled to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech last night referred to the fact that immediately on taking office the Government had addressed themselves to the problem of drug abuse and had established a special task force to examine the extent of the problem and to make recommendations. As a member of that task force I have had a hand in the formulation of the many important recommendations which they made and which are now being implemented. The recommendations concentrated on three fronts: education, law enforcement and rehabilitation.  We also recommended the establishment of a coordinating committee comprised of representatives from each of the Departments involved in tackling drug abuse to see through the implementation of their proposals.  This committee will, I believe, take care of the major defects which existed previously in the approach to the drug problem i.e., fragmentation of effort.</P>
    <P>The Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984, amended the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, to provide for, among other measures, an increase in the maximum sentence for a convicted drug pusher from 14 years to life imprisonment, an increase in the maximum monetary penalties which can be imposed on summary conviction and removal of the monetary penalty limit for serious offences, such as drug pushing, when a person has been found guilty by a jury, and a simplified procedure for investigating allegations of irresponsible prescribing by doctors.  In addition, the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, provides for the amendment of the criminal law and procedure to deal more effectively with serious crime including serious offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act.</P>
    <P>There are very hopeful indications that the drugs problem is beginning to improve.  The Garda are of the opinion that the incidence of drug trafficking has levelled off.  To illustrate the point: in 1980 there was a 66 per cent increase over the previous year in the number of persons charged with drug offences and a corresponding increase of 137 per cent <Col N="999" /> in the number of drug seizures.  In 1982 the relevant increases were 26 per cent and 55 per cent respectively.</P>
    <P>In sharp contrast the figures for 1985 indicate that there has been a decrease of 7 per cent in the number of persons charged with drug offences, and a 4 per cent decrease in the number of drug seizures.  So far this year the figures for the number of drug seizures and the number of persons charged with drug trafficking are in line with those for the same period last year.</P>
    <P>Clearly there has been an improvement. I want to make it absolutely clear, however, that there is no room for complacency in our approach to this dreadful menace in our society.  I can assure the House that the Government will continue to ensure that whatever resources are necessary to get on top of the drugs problem will be allocated.</P>
    <P>I think the gardaí deserve the highest praise for the determination and work which they are devoting to curb this menace in our society.  Not only is the specialised Garda Drug Squad involved in this task but members of the force are generally motivated to take a particular interest in the problem of drug abuse and become actively involved in controlling it.  To this end a special in-service training programme has been in operation in the force to ensure that each Garda division has a substantial number of members informed on various aspects of drug abuse, preventative measures and the special skills needed in drugs investigations. Over 2,400 members of the force from all Garda divisions have completed this course and they work in co-operation with the permanent units of the Drug Squad based at Dublin, Cork and Limerick. This policy has borne fruit in that many arrests and seizures are made by members other than those attached to the Drug Squad.  In 1985, two-thirds of all seizures were made by uniform and detective personnel other than the Drug Squad.</P>
    <P>An additional benefit resulting from coming to grips with the drug problems is the effect that this will have on the <Col N="1000" /> crime problem generally.  It is acknowledged generally that drug addiction is one of the factors having a significant impact on the crime problem.  Many addicts turn to crime in order to finance their expensive habit.</P>
    <P>It was stated in the course of the debate that Garda strength is 600 short.  This is not true.  There is a statutory order permitting a maximum Garda strength of 12,000 but financial provision for a force of that size was never made by any administration.  Since this Government took office, Garda strength has been increased by over 700, which is a considerable achievement in difficult economic times, and the strength of the force now stands at 11,400, the highest ever.  This is the target figure provided for in the national plan.  We have had a substantial increase in Garda strength over a relatively short period and the emphasis is now on the deployment of resources so as to ensure that they are being used as effectively and efficiently as possible.  Before I leave the question of Garda strength, I would like to refute the statement made in the course of the debate to the effect that no gardaí have been recruited this year.  This is not the case.  Sixty-eight gardaí have been recruited in 1986 to date and further intakes of recruits are planned so as to maintain Garda strength at 11,400.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned in the course of the debate that the financial provision for Garda overtime has been reduced over the past few years.  While there has been a reduction in expenditure on Garda overtime, as compared with the abnormally high levels of expenditure in 1981 and 1982, regard must be had to the fact that Garda strength has been increased substantially since then.  The important thing is not the actual amount of overtime but the effective level of the police service to the community.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have mentioned the question of insurance cover.  It is noteworthy that the press reported last Saturday that the effects of the decrease in crime have been felt in the insurance industry.  The incoming President of the Insurance Institute of Ireland is quoted <Col N="1001" /> as saying that the drop in crime is reflected in the lower number of claims reported arising out of specific criminal operations such as burglary.</P>
    <P>Over the past ten years the criminal statistics show some interesting trends. When the Opposition were last in Government for a period of time for which we can make realistic comparisons, 1977 to 1981, the indictable crime rate increased on aggregate by 42 per cent, not a record one could be particularly proud of.  Contrast that with the past four years.  In 1982 and 1983 crime increased by about 9 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. In 1984, for the first time in six years, it decreased by 2.6 per cent.  That trend was continued last year when a decrease of 8.5 per cent was recorded. Put another way, since 1982, when the present Government came to office, the annual crime rate has decreased overall by 6.5 per cent.  Furthermore, the indications are that the decrease is continuing this year as well.</P>
    <P>Allow me to emphasise further the Government's commitment to providing the necessary resources for the gardaí. The following figures reflect the part the Government are prepared to pay in allocating resources to the fight against crime:</P>
    <P Just="Center">Percentage change over previous year in the expenditure on the Garda Síochána Vote and in the number of indictable offences recorded.</P>

    <P>The Opposition had their day.  They failed in the fight against crime.  The crime rate rose by 42 per cent in the period 1977-1981, while it fell in the past three years by 6.5 per cent.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating and, when it comes to tackling crime, we on this side of the House know we have the better recipe.</P>
    <P>Garda overtime has been bandied about in the media a lot in the last week. III-informed comment was being thrown <Col N="1002" /> about like snuff at a wake.  There were reports of cut-backs in Border security and the withdrawal of resources from criminal investigations.  There were suggestions of a cut-back in the allocation of £12 million for Garda overtime this year. These reports apparently arose out of a talk the Minister gave to a conference of chief superintendents of the Garda Síochána last week.  To set the record straight, what the Minister did was to draw attention to the very high level of expenditure on Garda overtime so far this year which, were it to continue at the present rate, would be substantially out of line with the Estimates provision of £12 million.  There was never any question of a reduction in the provision of £12 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister was concerned that spending on overtime was running at a high level and he exhorted these senior officers, as part of their normal management responsibilities, to make certain that resources were deployed in such a manner as to ensure that the policing needs of their divisions were met in the most cost-effective way.  That exhortation was nothing more than should be expected in the circumstances prevailing from someone who carries responsibility for public expenditure, in other words, expenditure of the taxpayers' money. Unfortunately, it provoked an appreciable amount of public and media attention, much of it, as I said already, ill-informed, and was interpreted in some quarters as meaning that a major cutback was being made in Garda overtime, with serious repercussions for security and policing generally.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate what has already been said on this score.  There has been no cutback in Garda overtime, a cutback was never proposed nor is a cutback proposed now.  The Government have, since coming into office, provided the Garda Síochána with all the resources required to carry out all the duties we expect from the force.  There is no change in that position, nor will there be.  That is not to say that the way in which Garda manpower and woman power and other resources are deployed and utilised <Col N="1003" /> cannot continually be reviewed in the normal way to ensure that the most efficient possible use is made of them. This is something that all those with management responsibility are expected to do from time to time.  Whatever changes, if any, are made in Garda deployment or other procedures, the House can be assured that they will not involve any diminution in the quality or level of Garda service.</P>
    <P>On the question of Border security, I should like to refer the House to the statement issued by the Department of Justice on Thursday last which stated that reports about a reduction in Border security were without foundation.  It is not true that armed detectives are to be withdrawn from Border areas, or that special security surveillance or intelligence gathering will be affected.  The necessary resources of manpower for these purposes will be provided and, in fact, steps are now being taken to make current security provisions even more effective than heretofore.</P>
    <P>The policing needs of areas away from the Border are not being ignored either. The Garda authorities are keeping the policing needs of all areas under review and appropriate measures are being taken to ensure an adequate Garda presence in the streets of all our cities and towns.</P>

      <P>The Government are in for a severe shock when the next election is called if they persist in clapping themselves on the back because the crime statistics are falling and there is a lessening in the crime rate.  People are very worried about the level of crime.  Last Saturday morning I was interviewed on radio by Mr. Seán Duignan during the programme &ldquo;This Week in the Dáil&rdquo;.  I <Col N="1004" /> referred to the fact that there were 265 armed robberies in the first four months of this year &mdash; over two armed robberies per day.  I have a very big public reaction, receiving letters and phone calls from all over the country.  Today I received a letter from a person in the Minister's constituency which states:</P>
      <P>I have just been listening to you speaking on radio re crime in this country and I would like to congratulate you.  Indeed, I am sure that the vast majority of law-abiding Irish people would feel the same way as I do.  When you say criminals should be heavily sentenced you are quite right, but they will have to be dealt with right away before it is too late.  Like so many more things in this country, the Powers that Be wait until things are out of hand and then find themselves having to spend even more in frantic bids to curtail it. Please let us hear from you on this subject again and again.  Maybe then we might see some action but it will have to be soon.  People already are living in fear.</P>
      <P>There is a scandalous level of crime in a country of this size.  It is an absolute disgrace.  I have a suggestion which the Minister's officials might consider.  We should introduce a county jail system where people who are sentenced for any period up to a maximum of one year would be imprisoned.  In parts of the United States the courtroom and the county jail are in the same building.  The object is that people convicted of petty types of crime would not take up places in larger jails such as Mountjoy or Portlaoise. In many counties there are buildings suitable for conversion into county jails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must introduce the necessary legislation to increase maximum sentences up to 25 or 30 years for vicious crimes where people use shotguns to threaten the lives of others, sometimes three times daily throughout this country.  These people must be put away for a long time.  It would have a very salautary effect on people who might be thinking of going out to rob a post office.  They might risk four or five <Col N="1005" /> years in jail for an armed robbery if the amount of money robbed was big enough, but they might be deterred by the prospect of being incarcerated for virtually the rest of their lives.  That may be very tough talk but we must recognise the reality of this problem and face up to it squarely.</P>
    <P>The Minister might examine the idea of having country jails.  People might break out more easily from these units because they would not be as secure as a prison like Mountjoy.  Some sort of legislation should be introduced whereby their sentence would be increased every time they escaped.  An increase in their sentence of three or four months should be imposed, as well as loss of remission.  If they escaped and were recaptured often enough their total sentence would be in excess of one year and they would be transferred into a larger prison.  We need a prison system which can accommodate long term prisoners, while the petty offenders convicted of crimes without violence should be accommodated elsewhere.</P>
    <P>My concern is about the increase in crimes of violence.  The figures I asked for related to armed robberies.  I did not ask for the figures for burglaries and break-ins where no arms were used.  We must take our courage in our hands and do something soon to protect people.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the decrease in the number of car thefts and quoted Deputy Bertie Ahern as complimenting the Government on that fact.  I, too, would like to compliment the Government on having taken many of these joyriders off the streets and put them where they belong.  The problem, however, will not vanish.  The Government will have to maintain the policy of putting these people away.  Where they are seen to be doing something they will get credit. Crime has become a way of life, a means of livelihood, for many people.  There are not that many of these people but they are becoming more numerous.</P>
    <P>People are very unhappy about the sentencing policies of the District Court. Recently a man who killed a woman in a hit and run accident was fined £50 for <Col N="1006" /> driving without due care and attention and £20 for leaving the scene of the accident. A vigilant taxi driver overhead this man talking to his friend in the back of his taxi and reported the matter to the gardaí.  The man was subsequently brought to court, found guilty and fined £70.  Something will have to be done about the kind of people being appointed to the District Courts.  I am very unhappy about it, as are many people.  When confidence in the law wanes it can be very bad for democracy.  People must respect the law and the courts.  When judges behave stupidly, people lose faith in democratic institutions.</P>

      <P>This motion calls on the Government to provide the Garda Síochána with the resources needed to enable them to deal effectively with the present unacceptable levels of crime, lawlessness and vandalism.  The methodology used in assessing the statistics of crime leaves much room for improvement.  That is generally acknowledged by people within the Garda Síochána and there have been some improvements in the past few years in their annual reports on crime.  It has also been recognised in reports issued by Professor Rothman of the ESRI who has shown up the deficiencies in the methodology used in trying to assess properly the levels of crime, lawlessness and vandalism. It is important to ensure that we put that part of the problem right.  A prerequisite for drawing up the list of priorities to tackle this major social problem is criminological research and correct crime statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated by Government speakers that we are over-emphasising the ban on overtime that was mooted in the press last week and the subsequent denial by the Government.  We have pointed out that only £12 million was allocated in this year's Estimates for Garda overtime.  In recent parliamentary questions put down by this side of the House we have found out that in the first four months of this year £2 million per month has been used up, so there is really only £4 million left of that allocation for the next eight months of the <Col N="1007" /> year.  If the Government are claiming that there will be no such reduction in Garda overtime as there was heretofore, it is quite clear that they will need a Supplementary Estimate under that heading of the Estimate.</P>
    <P>The Government should come clean and tell us if they are in fact going to ensure that that level of overtime is available for the rest of the year, or if they can in some way manage to provide that level of support in the Garda services by providing only £0.5 million per month for the rest of the year whereas it has taken them £2 million per month for the first four months of the year.  That is something which the Government have not come clean on but have simply issued a blanket denial.  We do realise that as a result of the Anglo-Irish Agreement there has been a major redeployment of Garda forces to the Border and that has meant fewer gardaí on the streets in our own area, certainly in major urban areas, as urban Deputies can testify.  It is estimated that something like 1,000 fewer gardaí are on the beat as a result of this redeployment.  We should also recognise that in 1982, in our last year in Government, we recruited 983 gardaí.  But, in 1985, 253 were recruited and this year none has been recruited.  It is important that we give priority to the crime problem, but the performance of this Government does not seem to bear that out in terms of ensuring that we have enough recruits coming into the force and that we try to redress this imbalance that has resulted from the redeployment of forces to the Border areas.</P>
    <P>It should also be pointed out that there are reports in existence which clearly set a path for us to follow in trying to come to grips with what is probably the result of the major social changes that have taken place here since the fifties and sixties. The crime statistics that are available from the Garda Síochána could perhaps be best supplemented by more crime victimisation surveys in various areas of activity in the social area under the heading types of crime that are becoming <Col N="1008" /> more prevalent.  The 1985 report by Profesor Rothman and Richard Breen of the Economic and Social Research Institute quite clearly shows that in relation to household burglaries we have a problem greater than our counterparts in England, Scotland and Wales; and similarly with the larceny of vehicles, with something like twice the average of those countries. We should be getting down to the business of how we can curtail just those two levels of activity, which are not in many instances crimes of violence unless perhaps the perpetrators are interrupted.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that we take cognisance of the fact that there is a major problem even in those two areas.  The report states that the results of analysis suggests that property crime in Ireland is clearly patterned and offers the prospect that an improved allocation of personnel and a more imaginative choice among modes of policing in localities should be rewarded with success.  It should be pointed out that, more so than in any other country in Europe, we have crime which is very much urban orientated.  It is a fact that 73 per cent of the type of crime I have referred to happens in County Dublin.  It is crazy when one considers that only 42 per cent of our Garda force are actually where that level of crime is.  So we have to try to devise some strategy whereby priorities will be relevant to the facts, as are becoming obvious through these various reports and studies that are being made.</P>
    <P>The lack of criminological research has tended to allow various prejudices and simplistic thinking to prevail in relation to how we deal with crime and who is responsible for crime.  I am sure we have much crime in the white collar area in terms of fraud and embezzlement.  We do not seem to give the same sort of priority to those crimes in which there is, perhaps, an even greater amount of money being lost to the State and to individuals than there is in the streets.  The Government have not shown in the past three years that they are prepared to provide any of the extra personnel in the force or to redeploy existing resources, which is perhaps an even greater need within the <Col N="1009" /> Garda at the moment.  We should try to ensure that the sort of policing we have makes for a greater presence of Garda on the streets and that the level of co-operation which might be there will be used to the optimum to ensure that we reduce the level of crime.  It is simplistic to try to take some sort of laurels in relation to the reduction in the crime rates as published by the Garda Annual Report on Crime, because basically if the methodology used was more professional and efficient there would obviously be greater crime and the public would be able to have greater confidence in reporting to the Garda the various crimes that happen and which are not reported because the detection rates are so low. Therefore, I would ask the Government to be mindful of those points in relation to this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil motion requests the Government to provide the Garda with the resources needed to enable them to deal effectively with the present unacceptable levels of crime, lawlessnes and vandalism.  The amendment tabled by the Minister, referring to a reduction in the levels of reported crime in 1984 and 1985 and seeking support for the Government's actions, is most unreal in the light of what is happening outside.</P>
      <P>The serious rise in indictable crimes committed in this country over recent years and particularly crimes of violence has not decreased as the daily quota of armed robberies aptly demonstrates. Any thug wishing to hold up a bank, a post office, a credit union or even a chip shop now seems to be able to get his hands on firearms to carry out an armed raid and drive away with considerable amounts of money</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very recently the Minister replied to a question put by me regarding armed raids with violence and to my astonishment informed me that, during the first three months of the year, 165 armed robberies with violence had taken place in the Dublin area alone and something in the region of £1 million was stolen.  Of these 165 raids there had been, up to a couple of weeks ago, only 12 detections which is <Col N="1010" /> something in the region of 8 per cent and it is simply asking too much of the Dáil to stretch its imagination to such an extent that the Minister has expected in coming to the House claiming success in the battle against crime.  Indeed, since I obtained that information the number of raids has increased even further and after four months we are now talking in terms of £1.4 million having being snatched by armed robbers up to the end of April. This situation is totally intolerable and must be stopped.  It is the job of the Garda to stop it but they lack the authority, the resources and the necessary law to do this successfully.</P>
    <P>The position of the Garda is further confounded by unrealistic rules and regulations designed scrupulously to protect the rights of known guilty persons under investigation and putting the Garda at a severe disadvantage in dealing with the unscrupulous, but highly organised, crime doers.  It is vital that his House provides the Garda with the resources that are necessary to deal with the terrible situation they have to face.</P>
    <P>On a daily basis our newspapers report countless robberies and criminal cases. Dublin in particular continues to suffer from an increased and appalling level of crime and vandalism.  To our regret and sadness it is a city of shutters, barbed wire, expensive security systems, a city of fear.  There are numerous &ldquo;no-go&rdquo; areas despite what the Minister might say.  Our tourists and visitors are advised not to go out alone at night and that, under no circumstances should they visit certain areas at any time of the day.</P>
    <P>Business houses are paying huge amounts for insurance, if they are fortunte enough to be able to obtain insurance, and to the neutral observer it is very obvious that the position has reached a very serious and dangerous stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech last night talked about a decrease in the level of crime and threw out figures and statistics to back up his claim.  Despite what the Minister might say in this regard, nobody will accept that the crime situation in Dublin is on the decrease.  It has, to the contrary, become much more organised <Col N="1011" /> and the petty thief of two years ago is now a part of the very highly organised and sophisticated gang who take part in armed raids and at times are getting away with huge and substantial sums of money, jewellery and other goods.</P>
    <P>I have the highest of respect for our Garda Force and I sympathise with them in so far as they must operate at present within very stringent limits and very obviously are not getting the support they deserve from the Minister, or his Department.</P>
    <P>There has definitely been a change in the type of crime being committed.  The criminal gangs have now perfected their techniques and when they strike nothing stands in their way between the snatch and their getaway.  Armed crime has become far too common in recent times and the determination of criminals to fire has become very evident in recent months.  Vicious gangs are working within the city and it is now a very regular occurrence to hear reported bank raids in the Dublin area on most days, but in particular a number are carried out on Fridays and Saturdays, when the big amounts of cash are available and on hand.</P>
    <P>Apart from the armed raids, there are other levels of very serious crime that continue unabated, and I refer to rape, assault and, of course, housebreaking, which unfortunately appears to be the norm in most suburban areas.  House insurance premiums have increased by over 100 per cent this year alone due to the vast increase in the number of breakins. Many centre city businesses cannot get any insurance cover against burglary and are trading under impossible conditions. Even where business houses provide all sorts of security systems &mdash; bars and locks &mdash; many of these businesses are still unable to get any insurance cover. There is another aspect to all of this which is very frightening, and that is the general acceptance of crime and lawlessness as a new and frightening reality.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a new and comprehensive programme to reduce crime. <Col N="1012" /> The Government have failed to take positive action in the allocation of personnel and resources to do this.  When one looks at the overall impact of crime and at the allocation of resources, one finds that the Government have not allocated sufficient resources to this area.  It is accepted that the most valuable method of providing peace and security in homes, streets and businesses is through an effective Garda Síochána Force.</P>
    <P>The Garda are highly respected and have been very effective in ensuring that law and order prevailed down through the years.  The reality is that this Government reduced the new strength of 12,000 gardaí, introduced by Fianna Fáil in 1982, to 11,500.  From the very beginning they contended they did not need as many gardaí as their predecessors felt were necessary.  That was the first step towards the disastrous situation we now find ourselves in.  Since the Anglo-Irish Agreement came into operation there are even fewer gardaí on our streets, as vast numbers have been drafted to Border duty. Part of the agreement obviously was increased security along the Border but I believe that, before any Irish Government entered into such an agreement, they should have ensured that the additional security would not be at the expense of our own citizens in their homes, streets and places of business.</P>
    <P>During the past week or so there was widespread alarm about the additional cut-backs in Garda overtime and it is old hat now, of course, that this decision was denied by the Government, by the Minister of State tonight and by the Minister in his contribution last night.  It is interesting indeed to really look at the wording used by the Minister last night. He said:</P>
    <P>To put the matter in perspective what happened was that I drew attention to the very high level of expenditure on Garda overtime so far this year which, were it to continue at the present rate, would be substantially out of line with the estimates provision of £12 million.</P>
    <P>That statement confirms, even further, <Col N="1013" /> that either there is a cut-back at this stage, or that there will be no overtime when the £12 million runs out.  If you look at the figures up to the end of April, £8 million has already been spent in overtime and if you spread that over a full year the amount required will be £24 million.  Therefore, the £12 million allocated by the Minister will run out at the end of the next month and this has already been reflected in a number of city stations where staffing of gardaí is totally inadequate during the crisis hours of 10 p.m. and 3 a.m. the following morning.</P>
    <P>For example, in the Bridewell Station, which caters for the whole city centre and covers also a massive residential area, only one car and one motorcyle are available to the gardaí during those hours.  The same applies in other city stations and during the day it is also a case of &ldquo;robbing Peter to pay Paul&rdquo; because gardaí have been transferred from stations all over the city to the Border and also to additional security duties to Arás an Úachtaran, Government offices, embassies and the homes of ambassadors. Many of these additional security duties were implemented following the Libyan crisis and the ordinary citizen and householder has been sacrificed by the Minister for those purposes.</P>
    <P>How can the gardaí be expected to cope effectively with criminal activity when manpower levels are not sufficient to meet the challenges of the criminals? Civilian posts in the force are also being left unfilled because of the public service embargo.  Again this is most short-sighted as it means that gardaí are being diverted from their primary function of police work to clerical and other duties.  Late last year the Minister indicated that overtime would be provided where crime was a serious problem and that activities on the Border would not take from the provision of flexibility in overtime in the areas where this was needed.  Not only is the bill for overtime on the Border taken from the general overtime fund, but it also results in the depletion of funds for the more effective policing of other areas. It is estimated that in all there has been <Col N="1014" /> a net cutback of almost 1,000 gardaí as a result of deployment to the Border.</P>
    <P>The training of gardaí in Templemore is also out-dated and out-moded to meet the new challenges that face gardaí today, particularly in our cities.  It is also imperative that every person entering the Garda Síochána should be required to undergo a new and appropriate selection process.</P>
    <P>Another area the Minister must look at very urgently is the huge number of hours wasted by gardaí hanging around courts all over the country to give evidence in cases of, sometimes, a very petty nature.  In the Dublin area, for example, one has only to go down to the Four Courts to see hundreds of gardaí sitting around waiting for their particular cases to be called and very often as many as 50 per cent of those cases are adjourned after a couple of minutes to another sitting day when the same process takes place all over again.</P>
    <P>Reorganisation is very badly needed if we are to succeed in our battle against crime.  It is clear that the Government are falling short in their allocation of resources and support to the Garda.  No amount of juggling of figures, or covering up with arguments for overtime and so on, will get away from the fact that fewer gardaí are patrolling our streets.</P>
    <P>While the Government continue to delude themselves into thinking that things are improving, the situation on the ground is disastrous.  People are crying out for gardaí on the beat.  It is not good enough to have highly trained men snowed under with time-consuming tasks, preparing files and statements, usually in handwriting, but the reality of the situation is that too many of our gardaí are being bogged down under reams of paper work without any secretarial or administrative assistance.</P>
    <P>A fundamental change is needed in this organisation and the responsibility is on the Minister to set about this task and to spend less time in the bureaucratic exercise of counter-arguments in terms of percentages, figures and other statistics. The plain fact of the matter is that the people in our cities continue to be under <Col N="1015" /> siege more than ever from the criminal and are beginning to feel that their cries for support and assistance are being totally ignored by this Government.</P>
    <P>They are frustrated and it is most surprising that more people have not decided to take the law into their hands to protect and safeguard themselves, their families and their property.</P>
    <P>It is not long ago since the party on this side of the House introduced a similar motion, but we make no apologies for doing so again on this occasion as we are seriously concerned and disturbed by the continuing seriousness of crime, lawlessness and vandalism throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I have spoken tonight mainly about the problems in the Dublin area, but I am quite sure that the situation is very similar in other cities such as Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.  We are asking for the resources and the support to enable the gardaí to do their jobs effectively. The Minister, and the House, should accept the Fianna Fáil motion and thus begin the long road back to the situation where our citizens can walk freely and comfortably again along our streets and relax in their homes without fear of intrusion, robbery or assault.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will persuade the Minister to change his mind in regard to this and accept the Fianna Fáil motion tonight.</P>

      <P>The House is aware that I am vice-chairman of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism.  Whereas I could make a <Col N="1016" /> Second Stage speech pondering over a number of areas, I rise to make one point which I ask the Minister of State to take cognisance of and to pursue through her Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs, and when I have made that point I will resume my seat and allow my colleague, Deputy Enright, to make his point.</P>
      <P>Very much of the crime, as research has shown, is related to drug abuse and drug pushing.  Many people steal to feed a very serious drug abuse problem which costs many in this city hundreds of pounds a week.  The drugs problem is controlled, although not eradicated.  It is not growing at the rate that it was and it has been eliminated in some areas, but still there is a problem which needs to be pursued at source.  Most of the heroin which finds its way into this city is manufactured in Pakistan and comes to this country via Amsterdam.  We must take on a diplomatic offensive to challenge the Pakistani authorities who seem not to be too concerned about the amount of heroin which is leaving their country and finding its way into countries like Ireland. We should find out from the Pakistani authorities what their attitude is.  Perhaps we can find out from them through the EC as a bloc why so much heroin originates in Pakistan.  The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has an important role to play in tackling this matter at European and international levels on a one to one basis between this country and Pakistan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without a doubt, Amsterdam is the main distribution centre for drugs coming into this country and I as chairman of the crime committee and one or two members hope to visit Amsterdam in the near future to put our case to the authorities there and find out exactly how bad the problem is.  There is no doubt that Amsterdam is the warehouse of drugs in Europe and, whatever we say, the Dutch Government traditionally take a very liberal &mdash; if that is the word &mdash; attitude towards drug abuse.  The rigid rules which we are accustomed to seeing applied here and in Britain in regard to drug use and <Col N="1017" /> abuse are not applied there to the same extent.  Within the Community and between our Government and the Dutch Government we should press for the Amsterdam authorities in particular to make moves to ensure that internationally accepted standards are applied to the control of exports of drugs such as heroin.</P>
    <P>The London Metropolitan Police have a detective resident in Amsterdam who is their liaison officer.  He looks after their interests there and liaises with the Dutch authorities and is constantly on the spot. I would like the Minister to raise with the Garda Commissioner the question of giving every consideration to assigning a Garda officer to the Irish Embassy in The Hague, but working from Amsterdam, whose job would be to liaise on behalf of the Garda drugs unit here, the Garda Síochána generally, the Department of Justice, this House and the crime committee, so that we can have information at first hand to deal with the serious problem which gives rise to other crime problems.  I hope the Minister will take all those suggestions on board.  I do not want to bore the House with a long speech but I hope the points I have made will be considered.  If they were dealt with many of our crime problems would be eradicated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell and Fianna Fáil for their courtesy, and your good self for allowing me the opportunity to speak.  I wish to draw your attention and that of the House to tonight's <i>Evening Herald</i> in connection with an article headed &ldquo;Overtime: Garda Chaos&rdquo;.  I am concerned about it.  Either it is true or it is not true.  The first paragraph deals with Garda overtime cut-backs. I quote:</P>
      <P>Garda overtime cutbacks are now hitting so hard that criminals are walking free from uninvestigated crimes.</P>
      <P>I believe that is untrue.  Tonight the Minister will not have an opportunity to give a detailed reply on it but I would like him to reply on it tomorrow.  I continue to quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1018" /> Last weekend, it was learned the bulk of the Garda Technical Bureau, including the Murder Squad, was shut down.</P>
    <P>Was it shut down or not?  I would like to know because I feel that the Garda Murder Squad are important.  I want the chief superintendent who is responsible in this regard to state clearly and emphatically whether it was closed down.  If it was closed down the chief superintendent who is in charge should be brought before the Commissioner and the Minister and asked to account for that event.  The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>One violent death was not attended to by the Murder Squad.</P>
    <P>This is interesting because of the way it is stated.  Was it attended to by the Garda? That statement is very ambiguous.  A statement of that nature should not be put in that way.  Was that death investigated by gardaí in the normal course of their duty?  That report states that it was not attended to by the Murder Squad. Perhaps it was attended to by other gardaí.  If so, has it been attended to since then?  I would like more background on that serious allegation.</P>
    <P>The present Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Noonan, have made major improvements in co-operation with the Garda Síochána in tackling crime in this city and country.  They have applied themselves to their important duties in the Department, and I wish the new Minister well.  The Garda force, now at 11,400 is exceptionally high, and it is important that the Government maintain that level of numbers.  We have made progress in tackling the drugs problem, &ldquo;joy-riding&rdquo; and serious crime, and Dublin is the better for that.  The Garda force have always been held in the highest respect by the people and it is important this should continue.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister denied that any cutbacks in overtime were ordered by him and he said that no cuts were proposed either.  I hope this is correct because I believe the Minister intends to ensure that the citizens here continue to be well protected by the Garda Síochána <Col N="1019" /> and by the Government, and I am certain he will ensure that this is done.</P>
    <P>In conclusion let me say that a huge number of the Garda Síochána are engaged in traffic duties in regard to parking and so on.  Can the Minister try to arrange that gardaí who are involved in such simple administrative duties are channelled into areas where crime can be tackled and that other people can be assigned to those tasks?</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will reply to the article to which I referred because, although no sources are mentioned, I should like more information on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The central feature of Government policy in their efforts to contain crime and to control lawlessness is to strengthen and make the Garda Síochána more effective so that there will be a greater likelihood that the criminals will be caught.  We must ensure that the courts can deal effectively and expeditiously with criminals when they are caught and provide the necessary prison accommodation to contain people sentenced to imprisonment to serve their sentence in full.  I am firmly convinced that the most effective deterrent is not the birch or the shotgun of the vigilante but to create a position where the detection of crime is a virtual certainty.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána are to the forefront in bringing about greater deterrents and we look to them to secure detection and the apprehension of the criminal.  For that reason, it is vital to have the most efficient force possible and the Government have paid special attention to that area.  Additional gardaí have been assigned to areas where the Garda authorities felt the need for their service was greatest.  It is the policy of the Commissioner to have as many gardaí as possible on foot patrol duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has also been a substantial increase in the number of uniformed gardaí performing foot patrol duties and the operation of a new roster system has <Col N="1020" /> given an improved Garda presence in areas which did not have this service previously. I deny Deputy Vincent Brady's allegations in that regard.  The action taken by the Garda to deal with the so-called joyriding epedimic in Dublin last year had a fair measure of success.  The evidence indicates that the Garda are now winning the battle against this scourge of urban life.  They established a special unit in the Dublin Metropolitian area in January 1985 to deal specifically with that type of crime and it will remain in operation for as long as it is required. Figures indicate that the problem has abated in recent months.  There was a decrease of 20 per cent in the number of unauthorised takings of vehicles in 1985 compared to 1984.  During the first three months of this year, there was a 20 per cent reduction in the number of unauthorised takings compared to the same period last year.</P>
    <P>The number of incidents of ramming Garda cars is down by 66 per cent compared to the first three months of last year.  The penalties for this type of offence have been increased and the unauthorised taking of motor vehicles can now attract a sentence of up to five years' imprisonment on indictment.  Additional custodial accommodation has been provided to ensure that there is adequate prison accommodation so that those convicted of joyriding offences will serve their sentence in full.  There is also provision in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, for the imposition of consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking so far about an effective Garda response to a particularly worrying category of crime.  Of course, in relation to general crime, one of the most important assets which the Garda have at their disposal is the general public.  The community have a vital contribution to make in the area of crime prevention.  The neighbourhood watch scheme involves the community in crime prevention.  It is essentially a network of public spirited people who observe what is going on in their neighbourhood and report suspicious or unusual happenings to the Garda.  Civilians become the eyes and ears of the Garda with a view <Col N="1021" /> to counteracting the activities of criminals and vandals.  So far, 174 schemes are in operation involving a total of 50,000 households. Of these, 147 schemes operate in the Dublin Metropolitian area involving 44,000 households and they contribute greatly to the prevention of crime.</P>
    <P>The motion calls on the Government to provide resources for the Garda Síochána but it is important that other areas of the criminal justice system receive attention from the Government in the fight against crime.  The Government are ensuring that there will be enough places in prison to accommodate those who have been convicted of serious crimes to serve the sentence imposed on them by the courts. The fight against crime is one of the greatest challenges facing the Government and they are determined to continue taking whatever action is open to them to meet this challenge.  The Garda, sometimes at great practical cost to themselves, never flinch in their duty to serve the community.  They played their part well in the past and I have no doubt that they will continue to do so in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>In replying to this debate on behalf of my party, I should like to thank Deputies from both sides of the House who contributed in such a constructive way.  I said on a number of previous occasions in the House that I do not regard the general area of justice administration as one for political point scoring.  The very nature and jurisdiction of the Department call for, it not a united approach, certainly one of commitment and responsibility from all sides of the House.  It is, therefore, with some regret that I listened to the Minister's reply last night which, for him, was unusually politically arrogant and did not address itself to the issues and problems facing the people and in a more pressing way, the gardaí who have to administer the law on our behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ten years ago, a relatively short period in political terms, a motion of this kind would not have been necessary.  Contrast that with the increasing amount of time given by the House in the past four years <Col N="1022" /> in debating the various activities of the Department of Justice and one gets some idea of the increasing demands being placed on the various agencies within that Department.  It reflects the serious deterioration in law and order and the inadequate resources of the State in dealing with that very serious problem.</P>
    <P>The level of crime and lawbreaking generally reflect the level of success or failure of the Government in the area of economic and social legislation.  Even the statistics quoted by the Minister last night fully vindicate my conviction in that regard.  I have spoken on a number of occasions about the various activities of the Department of Justice and I have always based my arguments on the fact that the general breakdown in law and order reflects the level of success of the Government's policies.  When one compares the deteriorating graph, the increasing unemployment and the frightening increase in the level of crime, it is clear that what I say can be fully borne out. Does it not follow that the more we fail in our efforts to create jobs and improve living standards the more we will have to spend on protecting society from the backlash of those who are the victims of the Government's failure in this important area of administration.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree that we are now caught in a vicious circle and have to provide scarce resources to protect society when an earlier and positive commitment to channelling that same amount of money into realistic development programmes would have eliminated the need for this additional expenditure on security.  I have no doubt that the Government have got their priorities wrong in terms of public expenditure. They would be better employed channelling as much of our national resources as possible into productive areas of the economy in order to create jobs.  If they did that there would be a corresponding reduction in the demands on the Department of Justice in regard to citizen protection.  In carrying out a cost-benefit analysis of the various areas of Government expenditure the Government should also cost social failures.  A lot of <Col N="1023" /> lip service is being paid to the importance of getting the maximum possible return from public expenditure but we do not always take into consideration the result of the social problems that arise because of failure to invest adequately in certain areas of the economy.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Minister in his contribution last night desperately clung to and seemed to be totally dependent on past development in his Department and in the Garda Síochána rather than outlining his plans for future improvements.</P>

      <P>I read the speech again today in the hope that I would find an indication of the Minister's plans for the future.  The Minister spent most of his time outlining the technological advancements in the area of communications but improvements in that area were not initiated by him or his predecessor.  It is nothing short of political expediency for the Minister to claim any credit for that. I am not claiming credit for Members on this side of the House but the Minister, who is a reasonably honest man, is aware that long before he or his predecessor took charge of the Department of Justice provision had been made to develop the communications network.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the dedication and level of commitment by members of the Garda Síochána.  They have been doing an excellent job despite the serious financial restrictions under which they must operate.  The Government, and the Minister for Justice, deserve credit for the decrease in joyriding in Dublin city.  Deputy Woods expressed concern about that on many occasions in the House and the Government reacted to that concern.  We have a reactionary Government and I am pleased to note that they reacted on almost all occasions when Members on this side of the House highlighted the deterioration in law and order.  I hope that as a result of our motion tonight the Government will react and bring about an improvement in regard to crime.</P>
      <P>Apart from the human evidence, in terms of fear and insecurity, of the level of crime in our society, the problem is confirmed in a positive and monetarist way by the failure of insurance companies to accept applications or to charge prohibitive premiums for certain areas.  I should like to compliment our citizens on their concern in establishing and participating in the community watch scheme. That scheme was initiated by this side of the House and I congratulate the Minister on giving it his full backing.  It has proved to be a worthwhile development and it is being backed by the community.</P>

      <P>I listened attentively to all the Minister said last night and I did not interrupt him.  I hope the House will afford me the same courtesy that I afforded him.  No amount of heckling from the Government side will deter me in my efforts to make my contribution. Despite what the Minister has said there is a growing concern in the Garda force about the absence of support from the House.  Members of the force feel exposed and insecure about where the force is going in the future.  The immediate challenge facing the Minister and the House is not only the need for technological aids for the Garda but the establishment of an acceptable organisational structure in the force which will be conducive to good morale.  Good policing should be acknowledged and encouraged.</P>
      <P>In the course of contributions in earlier debates I called for the establishment of an independent police authority.  Such a body is long overdue and if the Minister is giving serious thought to the establishment of a modern police force he should have made some reference to that in his speech last night.  It appears that the Government have lost their will and their appetite for real reform.  Lack of resources is the hackneyed excuse for the Government's inactivity.</P>

The Minister is well aware that it would not cost money to put through the legislation that is needed to improve the climate under which the Garda must operate.

      <P>The Minister's speech last night was more notable for its evasiveness and its failure to deal with reality than for any evidence of a positive nature in regard to reform.  The Minister is trying to convey the impression that there has not been a cutback in regard to financial resources for the unrestricted operation of the Garda Síochána when the opposite is the case?  The Minister of State tonight tried to indicate that there have not been cutbacks.  How can the Minister explain that at a time when there is an increasing demand on Garda manpower arising out of the need for additional Border security and the rise in crime, the strength of the force is 600 below the number approved by the House in 1982?</P>

      <P>The House does not need to be reminded of the importance of providing the highest possible level of security at Portlaoise Prison.  In recent months we had evidence of serious breaches of security which, in one instance, resulted in books of evidence containing names and details of prison officers being circulated <i>ad lib</i> to a number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister to take particular note of what I have to say because the Minister of State this evening said that we were making statements we could not substantiate.  I want to warn the Minister that the security in operation in the prison at Portlaoise has now been dangerously weakened as a result of overtime cuts. Security posts around the prison are <Col N="1028" /> being left unmanned if there are no gardaí to man them within the normal tour of duty.  In other words, if any of these important security posts in Portlaoise Prison cannot be filled in the normal course of garda duty, then they are left vacant.  One might well contrast that with the situation of just a few months ago when two gardaí were seriously disciplined because they had left their posts for a very short period.  Now the Government are condoning a situation in which the security in that prison is being totally undermined as a result of their unwillingness to make adequate funding available for the financing of security.</P>

      <P>The manner in which this debate is conducted within the Oireachtas and outside it will give some indication as to what extent, if any, we have matured as a society in recent years. If we can conduct the debate on this difficult social issue in a calm, rational and reasoned manner, then I think it will show that Irish society has at last grown up.  If, however, the debate degenerates into the sort of hysteria and emotional rhetoric which was a feature of the 1983 referendum campaign, irrespective of the outcome it will reflect very badly on Irish society and will damage the self-respect and confidence of our people as a whole.</P>
      <P>The debate will also say a lot about the nature of the relationship between Church and State in our Republic.  As far back as May 1975, the then Bishop of Kerry, Dr. Eamonn Casey, who is now in Galway speaking on behalf of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy said that the question of legislation was a matter for the legislature and that politicians must be guided by the people who elect them. Unfortunately, since then, especially in their submission to the Forum, the Roman Catholic bishops seem to have retreated from this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disclosure this morning that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy intend to mount a major campaign, printing and distributing one million copies of their pastoral letter and presumably engaging in a series of discussions from pulpits and so on, appears to confirm a major retreat from the position as expressed in 1975 by Bishop Casey.  It indicates that they are <Col N="1034" /> not prepared to accept that legislation is a matter for the legislators.  This has brought into focus once again the whole nature of the Church-State relationship in this country.</P>
    <P>I would argue tonight, as I argued in the debate on the amendment to the Family Planning Bill, that it is for us in this House as democrats to defend our democratic role as legislators regardless of whether or not we agree with divorce. The decision must be made in this House in relation to the referendum and we must campaign for and against the issue on the basis of whether it is right or wrong for the citizens of this State, irrespective of their religious persuasion.</P>
    <P>Apart from the compelling arguments that exist for the removal of the constitutional ban on divorce on humanitarian grounds, there is also a strong argument for the removal of Article 41.3.2. of the Constitution if we believe in the principle of separation of Church and State.  Article 41.3.2. represents one of the worst aspects of the denominational nature of our Constitution.  The article is exclusively Roman Catholic in its conception. On that basis, it is sectarian and ought not to be part of the basic law document of a democratic State.  Our Constitution should not place those citizens whose moral views do not exclude divorce at a disadvantage before the law.</P>
    <P>In this context it is important to emphasise that all Churches, other than the Roman Catholic Church, in their submissions to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown and in their recent discussions with the Taoiseach, and many secular groups have indicated their support for the removal of the constitutional ban.  These Churches have accepted the desirability of the State legislating to allow divorce.  This does not mean that as members of Churches they are failing to uphold strongly the Christian ideal of marriage as a life-long and exclusive relationship.  They have argued that this ban should not be included in the Constitution and laws of the State.  A vote in favour of divorce is not inconsistent with a personal moral belief in the principle that marriage is indissoluble for <Col N="1035" /> oneself.  It is a vote to allow others who do not share that view to exercise their moral judgements and rights in relation to marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>The Roman Catholic Bishops in campaigning against this amendment must accept the logic of that position.  They are adopting a partisan position on a political issue, the right of the State to regulate marriage and make provision for marital breakdown.  Having entered the political arena, they must accept that their statements must be judged as political views and not as religious pronouncements. While much of their case concerns the social effects of divorce, which is open to a variety of interpretations, as is clear from the small number of contributions made today, their fundamental position is that Roman Catholic beliefs should be enshrined in our Constitution and laws because their position has been revealed by God and that, anyway, the majority of citizens are Roman Catholic and therefore the Roman Catholic view should prevail.  This was their position on the family planning amendment last year, on the constitutional amendment in 1983, and now on divorce.  It is a fundamentally sectarian and anti-democratic position.</P>
    <P>As I have argued before in relation to the family planning legislation, if there are two or three dozen bishops in Maynooth who have between them all of the wisdom, the justice and the rights and know exactly what is for the common good of this country and if we accept that all Roman Catholics must abide by that, whether they be ordinary lay people or legislators, then why bother with a democratically elected assembly?  What is the point, if 45 bishops in Maynooth can decide for us what is right and what should be in our laws?  It ignores the rights of other religious congregations, for a start, and of all citizens, including many Roman Catholics, who want separation of Church and State and who are not satisfied that what is defined as sinful by a particular Church automatically should be illegal.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that the way in which this debate is conducted will indicate the <Col N="1036" /> maturity or otherwise of our society.  It should be said as well that the debate will be looked at by a large number of people in Northern Ireland of various opinions and traditions.  However, it would be wrong of us either to support or oppose this issue of divorce simply as a means of encouraging, or otherwise, the Unionists of Northern Ireland to look more favourably on unity with the South.  I have always opposed the idea that divorce, or family planning, or any of these issues that cause such controversy here, should be used as political lollipops to try to encourage people in Northern Ireland to take a more kindly view of us.  These issues must stand or fall on their merits for the citizens of this State, and it is on that basis that the matter should be approached.</P>
    <P>The case for divorce does not depend on proof that marital breakdown has increased substantially, but such proof strengthens the case.  It is a matter of a civil right for citizens to be allowed to choose.  The number of people who may need to avail of divorce is largely irrelevant. The question of large numbers being in need of it strengthens the case, and I do not think anyone would dispute that marriage breakdown has increased in recent years.  The Divorce Action Group have estimated that 70,000 adults in this State are involved directly in broken marriages.  The report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown gave figures some time ago showing that 8,000 women with more than 14,000 dependent children were receiving deserted wife's payments.  In the short time since that report was prepared those figures have increased to 9,300 wives with more than 15,000 dependent children. That shows that in the years since these allowances were introduced there has been a steady increase each year.</P>
    <P>Many varied and complex factors associated with marital breakdown can be given.  Attempts were made here today to argue that availability of divorce and the existence of divorce law would create marriage breakdown.  I have a number of case histories proferred by the Divorce Action Group and I will read <Col N="1037" /> through a few of them to indicate the problems that exist for many couples.</P>
    <P>Anne was married at 19 years of age 15 years ago and was deserted by her husband five years after they were married. She and the three children have not seen him since.  Anne has been seeing a man for the past two years and would like to marry him.  Does that case warrant divorce?  I would argue that it does.  John was 22 years when he got married five years ago.  His wife moved out a year later and said she did not want to meet him again.  He made a few unsuccessful attempts to get her to go back and has now heard that she is living with another man and has two children with him.  Is this not another case for divorce availability?</P>
    <P>Patricia went out with her husband for three years before marrying him two years ago.  He started to throw things at her during the honeymoon and got more and more violent towards her as time progressed.  She left him after a year and moved back with her parents.  She is now 25 years and would like to start over again.  Is that not a case for availability of divorce?  Martin was married for six years and had three children when his wife met another man and moved in with him.  She now has two children by the other man.  She and Martin are on reasonably good terms.  The three children are living with him and she sees them regualrly. Martin would like to get married again.  Are they not grounds for divorce?</P>
    <P>Bob and Carmel were both 23 years when they married.  They drifted apart and separated six years ago.  They are now both living with other people and both of them have begun families with their new partners.  Mick and Linda recently got a Church annulment after waiting seven years.  If they become involved in new relationships they could get married in a Catholic Church but that marriage would not be recognised by the State.</P>
    <P>Joan was married in the early fifties. Her husband was a heavy drinker and his drinking gradually got out of hand.  He sold their house 15 years ago.  They have been separated since then.  She does not consider herself to be married.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1038" /> They are all real people who through no fault of their own find themselves in that position.  They are not the hard cases spoken about here today and the cases that will be spoken about in the next two or three days.  They are genuine cases of people who entered into marriage contracts. They did not work out, and now the law of the State provides that they must not get married again at any time before they die.  Any of them who enter new relationships will not have those relationships recognised and any children that come from those relationships, to use our archaic terminology, will be illegitimate and they have no protection whatsoever under the law.</P>
    <P>These cases are only a sample.  It is clear that the factors involved in marriage breakdown did not mean that particular individuals became infatuated with other men or other women and went off on that basis.  As I have shown, it is not a matter of people getting married today and looking for divorces tomorrow.  These situations developed over time.  People found themselves to be unsuited to live with each other.  Apart from showing that there is need for a divorce law, the cases I have given indicate clearly that marriage breakdown occurs without the existence of divorce law or the opportunity for divorce.  There is no evidence to show that divorce laws, whether liberal or strict, have any significant impact by themselves.  The causes of marital breakdown have much deeper roots in social and economic changes.  The introduction of divorce laws have followed rather than initiated social changes.</P>
    <P>I should like to read some extracts from a book published by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties in 1979.  The author is Mr. William Duncan, a law lecturer who specialises in family law.  He deals in that document with the question of objections to divorce.  Incidentally, it is the only document I have come across that deals in a fairly scientific way with the case for and against divorce and I recommend it to any Deputy or member of the public. In the book he deals with the question that divorce causes marriage breakdown <Col N="1039" /> or makes marriages unstable and he makes the following comment:</P>
    <P>The fact is, however, that they are based on an assumption about the relationship between divorce and marital stability which time and again has been proved false.  Professor Rheinstein, who has written probably the most authoritative work on the subject in recent years, involving an examination of divorce experience in many countries throughout the world, summarises the counter-argument as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Even endless repetition cannot make true the proposition that lives or homes are destroyed by divorce.  What may destroy homes or lives is something quite different: the breakdown of a marriage, an event in the realm of fact which is different from and regularly precedes that event in the realm of law which is called divorce, and which does no more than, ascertaining the fact that marriage has broken down, restore the parties to the freedom of entering new relationships that will be recognised as legally effective marriages and thus as socially respectable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He quotes G.R. Leslie, who is dealing mainly with the situation in the USA and who writes as follows:</P>
    <P>There is no necessary relationship between divorce rates and either family or societal stability; high divorce rates may reflect family breakdown, or they may reflect societally prescribed ways of eliminating disruptive influences.</P>
    <P>He quotes the Law Commission in England who commented in 1966 on the rising divorce figures:</P>
    <P>These figures may merely reflect the fact that a growing segment of society is coming to regard divorce as more respectable than other outcomes of a broken home.  They are therefore important figures for sociologists and people responsible for social policy, <Col N="1040" /> but they do not give cause for believing that morality is being corrupted in England, still less that it is the divorce law that is the corrupting agent.</P>
    <P>He also quotes a series of other authorities in the area of divorce.  The references are in the book entitled <i>The Case for Divorce in the Irish Republic</i> published by the ICCL in 1978.</P>
    <P>Various devices exist in the State to cope with marital breakdown but only divorce is said to be objectionable in principle. The fundamental difference between divorce and separation is the right to remarry.  The differences between divorce and nullity relates to the time at which the grounds for a decree must have existed.  Remarriage is considered acceptable in the case of annulment that is, for those who can establish an initial defect at the time of marriage but it is not considered acceptable in the context of divorce, that is, for those whose marriages may have been successful initially but subsequently became defective.  There is no social reason why that distinction should be made.  There is a religious reason and everyone accepts the right of people who hold that religious conviction to abide by it but there is no social reason for making a distinction between when a defect occurs in a marriage, thereby denying on the basis the right to remarry.  The State should not uphold that distinction.</P>
    <P>I have said repeatedly, as have others, that divorce is not offered as a cure for marriage breakdown, nor can a sustainable argument be made that divorce legislation causes marriage breakdown, as I have indicated in reading the extracts from the book to which I referred.  As Deputy McCreevy quite rightly said, you cannot prevent death by banning funerals. A good divorce law is simply that.  It is an attempt to lay to rest a marriage that has broken down and where there is no possibility of reconciliation.  A good divorce law can only regulate the aftermath of a broken marriage in such a way as to minimise the distress and the trauma to the parties involved.  I stress the fact that fundamentally there is no difference <Col N="1041" /> between a family that has divorced and a family that has separated, whether it be a judicial separation or a separation by agreement.  The fundamental objection in this debate would appear to be the right to remarry.</P>
    <P>One of the main arguments put forward by opponents of any change in our legislation is that divorce damages children. There is considerable evidence to suggest that children are adversely affected by marital disruption and breakdown but this in no way proves the assertion that divorce damages children.  That assertion is based on two assumptions: that divorce promotes marital breakdown and that a broken marriage that ends in divorce is more damaging than a marriage in which marital disharmony continues.  Today people have quoted various sources backing the case for and against divorce; but as far as I can see the evidence is that it is tension and discord, rather than separation and divorce, that harms children most in the long term.</P>
    <P>I read a book published recently in which the author interviewed a number of children in Britain about the effects of separation and divorce on them.  I stress that the author claimed nothing more for the book other than the fact that this was the case for the children she interviewed: she was not attempting to say this was the general position.  In her conclusion she arrived at the view that in the case of separation or divorce &mdash; there was little distinction in Britain in relation to this &mdash; while the children were unhappy and disorientated in the short term, in the long term it was more beneficial for them to be taken out of a situation where there was marital disharmony.</P>
    <P>I presume all sides will produce all sorts of authorities to argue one side or the other but it should be admitted that there is a case that children are harmed by marital breakdown.  There is no dispute about that as far as I am concerned but it is a question of whether in the longterm they are better off as a result of their parents separating.  It is my view that they are.  Nevertheless, children are vulnerable in such situations and legal procedures should protect them as much as <Col N="1042" /> possible.  It must be stressed that this is as important in a non-divorce jurisdiction as it is in a divorce jurisdiction.  Our present procedures for dealing with child-related legal problems such as custody disputes are very far from satisfactory.  It is totally intolerable to continue with a situation where Church annulments can be granted on an increasing basis which leave children totally unprotected as a result.</P>
    <P>The other major argument put forward by opponents of divorce is that divorce damages wives or women in general.  This is put forward on the grounds that it is the wife who is generally economically dependent and she will therefore suffer if a marriage ends; also, that if the husband founds a second family he is less likely to be able to support the first family; that an innocent wife or husband may have divorce or desertion forced on her or him.  These arguments do not stand up to scrutiny.  The law and the Constitution, even as it stands, do not and could not force a spouse to remain or resume living with a husband or wife.  The damage does not come from the fact of divorce but from the breakdown or separation itself. Any public representative will be aware from dealing with constituents' problems that economic difficulties arise whenever a marriage breaks down, whether there is desertion, agreed separation or judicial separation.  No doubt that will be the case in situations of divorce as well.  The absence of divorce does not prevent it happening.  As I said previously in another place: how could a deserted wife with two children living on £66 per week be any worse off simply because she has the right to re-marry as a result of the removal of the constitutional ban?  It does not make sense.</P>
    <P>Cases have been made today about the Succession Act.  While I am not by any means an expert in this area, I understand the Minister for Justice stated here today that the rights of children and wives would not be affected in that area as a result of divorce legislation and that courts, under the proposed divorce legislation, would have the right to deal with property matters at the time the divorce <Col N="1043" /> was taking place.  This would be a far better situation than at present.</P>
    <P>The absence of divorce makes it impossible for separated couples to establish a legally protected relationship with a second spouse.  Taking the reverse view of the argument that divorce damages people economically, divorce in a situation which would regularise second relationships would be protecting dependent spouses by ensuring that they had legal entitlements to an income.  Divorce in those circumstances could help to provide security for dependent partners.  If a marriage has completely broken down and one partner has left five years previously, it is difficult to see the real advantage to the other spouse of opposing divorce. Certainly, it would not make sense on economic grounds.  The arguments on the economic vulnerability of women, which is a fact under the present jurisdiction, do not relieve the State of its responsibility to protect the innocent or the dependent spouse, particularly against financial hardship.  This protection is required now, not just when divorce is introduced.  The present position can hardly be classed as satisfactory generally in relation to the status of women in our society.</P>
    <P>Regarding the specific constitutional amendment being proposed.  The Workers' Party have some reservations about the form of words used.  There was an argument for simply deleting Article 41.3.2 in its entirety and possibly Article 41.3.1 as well.  I say this because Article 41.1.1 and Article 41.1.2 of the Constitution already include very specific and strong guarantees of protection for the family which most people would want to see retained in the Constitution.  Article 41.1.1 states:</P>
    <P>The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <P>Article 41.1.2 states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1044" /> The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.</P>
    <P>Clearly if the State had fulfilled its obligations under that Article there might be far fewer cases of marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>If a specific wording had to be included to replace the Article which I believe should have been deleted, then the wording produced by the Labour Party in their recent Private Members' Bill would have been preferable to the amendment before us.  That amendment seemed to provide solid guarantees of protection for the family and marriage without placing the absolute restrictions on the Legislature which are involved in the Government's amendment.</P>
    <P>The Constitution sets out the broad legal and social framework within which the laws of the State must be drawn up. I am not convinced that it is a good principle to include such restrictive detail in an Article of the Constitution as there is in the wording before us.  I do not believe there is any other section of the Constitution that includes such specific restrictions on the details of any possible legislation.  While I acknowledge the arguments in favour of the Government's wording, I have particular reservations about the inclusion of a very specific period of time for which a marriage must have failed before a divorce can be considered. It surely would have been better to consider this in the detailed legislation that will come before the House after the amendment has been passed.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Government's intention regarding legislation, there are a number of points requiring clarification. I, and the Workers' Party, welcome the decision to establish the special family courts.  Indeed this was something which we specifically sought in our own party submission to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown and I look forward to the Government actually spelling out in detail how the courts will work.  In any event, we must ensure that <Col N="1045" /> the procedures are informal and non-adversarial. In particular, we must ensure that they do not simply become a gold-mine for the legal profession.  In this context I would welcome assurances from the Government that free legal aid will be available and that the necessary staff will be employed to ensure that legal aid will be available to people without delay. There are very long delays in obtaining civil legal aid at the moment and the law centres certainly could not cope with the demand which is likely to arise in the immediate aftermath of the introduction of divorce legislation.  That demand will obviously arise because of the build-up of cases which have been accumulating in the absence of divorce over the years.</P>
    <P>The other area where there is a genuine concern which needs to be clarified by the Government is the question of social welfare entitlements for persons in the aftermath of a divorce.  There are all sorts of anomalies that might arise when divorce is introduced and a full-scale review of our social welfare code will be needed to deal with the new situation.  I would suggest that the Commission on Social Welfare which I understand is concluding its deliberations at the moment would look at the effects which the proposed legislation would have on our social welfare code and how various social welfare recipients can be protected along with their dependants, whether they are divorced or judicially separated.</P>
    <P>There are two areas to which I would ask the Minister particularly to address himself.  In regard to a woman who at present is receiving a deserted wife's allowance and who applies for and gets a divorce, what social welfare entitlement would she have in that situation?  In regard also to the case of a woman who is divorced and who has been receiving maintenance from her former husband and whose husband dies, what pension if any would she be entitled to?</P>
    <P>These are questions which need to be dealt with.  They are not issues which should be used to defeat the idea of divorce.  They are simply questions which need to be dealt with to ensure that everyone, regardless of status, gets an <Col N="1046" /> adequate income and that their children, if they have custody of them, should have enough to live on.  That obviously would apply to men the same as it would apply to women.  One of the major anomalies in the deserted wife's code at the moment is that a deserted husband who is not in a position to work or is unemployed is not entitled to a deserted spouse's allowance. This is an anomaly that exists at present and should be eliminated and there should be an opportunity to do that during the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that the introduction of divorce will change the concept of the Irish family.  There is a certain amount of misunderstanding in relation to what exactly constitutes the Irish family.  It is said that divorce will change it.  The reality is that the Irish family has changed virtually out of recognition from what it was 50 years ago.  It is no longer, in the vast majority of cases at any rate, the extended family that existed, certainly in the Dublin area where there were brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers and uncles and aunts and grandmothers and grandfathers all living within a stone's throw of one another and, in many cases, in the same house and where they supported one another. That, by and large, is no longer the case in Irish society.  Is that the concept of the family which we are trying to preserve? There is also the emergence of the single parent family which is a growing phenomenon, whether we like it or not.  It is a reality of Irish society.  More and more young women are choosing to rear children on their own.  Would that fit into the concept of the family which we are told we should preserve or try to protect?  I do not believe it does.  Judging by the comments of some speakers in this debate, the single parent family is not included in their definition of the family.</P>
    <P>It must also be accepted that the basis of marriage in Ireland, as indeed in other countries, has changed.  A century ago, or even more recently than that, marriages were based on economic necessity where there was a need for a husband and wife and the children to work in the home, either on the farm, in some cottage <Col N="1047" /> industry or in some other way because it was impossible to exist unless one was involved in a family of that kind.  That is, largely, no longer the case.  Marriages are made now more on the basis of personal relationships rather than on matchmaking or the transfer of dowries or any of these things.  The basis of marriage has changed; the basis of a relationship has changed.  When people are talking about divorce altering the concept of the family and substituting one kind of family for another, they are not facing up to the reality that Irish families have, in fact, changed, perhaps unknown to them.</P>
    <P>The other element of that is the fact that women, despite our Constitution which places them firmly in the home and firmly in charge of domestic duties and no other duties, are no longer satisfied with that subservient role.  As far as I am concerned that is a good thing.  Women are entitled to the same equality and the same rights and the same life as any other person in society.  That also is an element in the changing face of Irish families and Irish marriage.</P>
    <P>There are a whole range of other things as well, for example, the longer life span of people and earlier marriage age all make for longer marriages which nowadays, if they are to last for life, have to last a lot longer.  If one is talking about getting married in the early twenties and perhaps living together into the early seventies, one is talking about 50 years. One hundred years ago marriage for life probably meant about 20 years.  So we are talking about a huge change in relation to how long couples have to put up with each other, and that too has a bearing on this idea of marriage and the family.  This debate shows that this House is slowly, and perhaps painfully, coming to terms with these realities.</P>
    <P>It was suggested when we were discussing the Family Planning Bill that there were more important things the House should be dealing with &mdash; there are major economic problems, major unemployment and so on.  These are points I agree with and I would argue on behalf of very strongly, but I do not take the view that <Col N="1048" /> any of these issues should be in competition with each other.  I do not accept that the happiness or well-being of men, women and children should be put on the long finger until such time as this Government, the next Government or some other Government get around to solving the unemployment problem.  I would argue that the solution of the unemployment problem might help to solve the problems of marriage breakdown, but I strongly oppose any idea that this proposal to change the Constitution and to introduce divorce legislation is in any way less important than any of the other major economic and social issues which this State faces.</P>
    <P>That, basically, is the case I wanted to make in support of the divorce referendum and the broad outline of legislation which the Government indicated they will introduce.  I will be working for a massive yes vote.  I will be speaking as often as I can on the issue and hope to convince people that they should vote yes on the basis of compassion for those who are trapped in marriages that have broken down, where there is no possibility of reconciliation, and also on the basis that we must establish in this State a body of law which is applicable to all citizens and with which all citizens, whether they hold any particular religious belief or no religious belief would feel comfortable, would feel they are part of our society and that they are not restricted in the exercise of their validly held moral view of how they should live their lives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we are at least giving people the opportunity to express their opinion on whether we should allow divorce to be introduced.  This is the seventh time an attempt has been made in this House to bring forward legislation dealing with divorce, and each attempt has been resisted each time for various reasons.</P>
      <P>Volume 323, column 1117, of the Official Report of 29 October 1980 reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We recognise that marriages can end, but no law can keep people <Col N="1049" /> together if the marriage has broken down....  There is no law which can stop people forming new relationships; there is no law, where a marriage has broken down and people are living in isolation, that will prevent them from forming new relationships and cohabiting outside marriage.  This has gone on in every country and it is going on here. We are no better and no worse, we are just the same as the rest of them, to use the biblical phrase and it is about time we accepted the need to recognise that marriages break down and that the only way in which we can help people is to accept the recommendation of our all-party committee.</P>
    <P>These words were spoken by the then Deputy Noel Browne.  Whenever these issues came up before we took refuge in finding another reason for not making a decision.  Since this is the seventh Bill to be introduced in this House, I thought it appropriate that, as a person who tried on another occasion to introduce his own Private Members' Bill, it was a good starting point.</P>
    <P>I spoke at length on this subject when the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown was introduced on 29 November.  I also supported the Private Members' Bill introduced by Deputy O'Leary which had few takers outside The Workers' Party, the Independents and myself.  I also spoke on the Private Members' Bill introduced by the Labour Party on 25 February.  I do not want to go over old ground; but, although few people contributed to those debates, the indications are that many Deputies want to contribute to this debate for some inexplicable reason. When the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee was introduced there were very few Opposition speakers.  This begs the question as to why there is such a flood of Opposition speakers lined up on this occasion and why the Leader of the main Opposition party should accuse the Government of wanting to guillotine this most important Bill when he had so many Members anxious to speak on it.  The first day the report of the Oireachtas Joint <Col N="1050" /> Committee was introduced in this House, the debate nearly closed within two hours because of a lack of speakers.  There was a great flurry and the debate was saved and the public were led to believe that Dáil Éireann was interested in this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Who is trying to guillotine the Bill?  The Opposition are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had started my contribution by saying I had spoken at length on this subject three times already, that it looked as if the anti-divorce campaign had collapsed, and if I had sat down quickly and asked the Minister to conclude, this debate would be over because of a dearth of speakers.  That nearly happened the last time I spoke but the debate was saved by a Member of the Opposition running panting down the steps to take his place in this House.</P>
      <P>We will see the sincerity with which this measure is to be approached by the Opposition tomorrow, the following day and for the remainder of this evening by their contributions.  I have no doubt that this is purely a political ploy and they are jumping on the bandwagon because of the fear of interfering with favourable polls which indicate that the majority, or at least half the population now favour some form of legislation to deal with marriage breakdown.  They believe it would be very dangerous to interfere with that poll by going against this legislation; but in private, and by their actions over the past couple of years when these Bills were introduced, it is obvious to everybody that Fianna Fáil do not want this measure, and most of them will campaign privately against it.  If any reassurance is needed on that all one has to do is to refer to the debate on the contraceptives Bill of the last year or so when we were threatened daily with moral catastrophe. One would have thought that there would be queues outside chemists' shops all over Ireland as soon as that Bill became law. We do not hear much about it now, as was predicted so ably by Deputy O'Malley when he contributed to that debate shortly before I did at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1051" /> That form of leadership is leading from behind.  As somebody said earlier and I have said often enough, the attitude is &ldquo;There goes the mob and I am their leader, therefore I must follow&rdquo;.  I am not disappointed. The Minister reaffirmed in his speech this morning that he, like the Taoiseach, had been waiting for the polls to indicate a need for this before introducing it.  That is not political leadership. No account at all is taken of the minorities' viewpoint on this or any other issue. If the majority are to rule, polls do not come into play when a minority are affected.  Democracies are judged on how they treat minorities.  Conscience comes into play and it is necessary and desirable that this proposed legislation be brought before the people.  As outlined, it is very restrictive.  To quote the Minister, it has been carefully designed to recognise the need to protect marriage.  From that point of view people can feel reassured. Deputy Woods this morning suggested that the Government were trying to force divorce on the people but that is not so.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Michael O'Leary tried to introduce similar legislation his Bill followed the same sort of line, that it would go out to the people who would be able to debate it.  That form of reassurance, which was rejected then by this House, is now being accepted and it is correct that we follow along these lines. One reason why I took the stance I took then was a lack of faith in the proposed legislation.  I do not like the way the numbers game is played frequently in this House by Ministers introducing legislation. Democracy is undermined and democratic principles are ignored when a majority that a party have is used to bring in legislation and when careful attention is not applied by Members of the House to any particular form. Because divorce is such a contentious issue we are probably adopting the right way to deal with the Bill.  The Minister and many Members have stressed that marriages will break down.  The Churches are taking a stance on this, and the amendment, if carried, will give them an <Col N="1052" /> opportunity to come up with any positive and constructive suggestions that they have.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to the Forum where Deputy Kelly made his famous remark that the Hierarchy were being asked for the first time since Saint Patrick came to Ireland to think on their feet and apply themselves to this massive problem.  In this peculiar set up Members of the Dáil who have to pay so much attention to their constituencies, through their advice clinics meet deserted and battered wives, people who are on the breadline because of marriage problems which are sometimes related to ignorance, jobs and so on, must be aware of the extent of the problem.  They cannot shirk their responsibility to apply their experience and their minds to the Bill and they will have opportunities to make suggestions about it.  I have had no doubt that eventually we would have to face up to this problem.  It is sad to relate that we do not consider social legislation until it is forced upon us.  The Church will have to consider this matter in the same way as we do and come up with the best solution.  It may not be an Irish solution to an Irish problem in the same sense as former social legislation was introduced in this House.  Nevertheless, because it is such a sensitive issue for so many people who are so genuinely worried about it, because it is getting a public airing, everybody can have his or her say.  Bodies like the Catholic Hierarchy who are demanding their say will have to have their say. That will be welcome because if this amendment is passed, we will have to face one of the most serious social problems and nobody will be able to shirk it.</P>
    <P>It would be easy to give innumerable examples of hardship.  Some Members have been selective in giving two or three examples but I would take all that as read.  People who know what is going on around them will be aware of the extent of the problem and the hardship caused by failed marriages.  The views of the Churches have been taken into account up to now and the real opportunity will come after the referendum has been decided by the people and when the Bill <Col N="1053" /> is introduced.  That is when those people who are shouting most about it will be able to contribute most and then they can face up to it and I am sure they will do so.  Nobody is opposed to marriage and many people have considerable difficulty in deciding, especially people who are happily married and feel that if divorce was available their marriage could or would have broken down.  Perhaps they do not realise that many marriages experience the same thing, that they think theirs is the exception and that they succeeded because of the lack of divorce. On the other hand, as has been pointed out by many people, Catholics in particular &mdash; I do not want to refer to Catholics only but they are the majority of the population and it is from them that the main thrust of the anti-divorce campaign is coming &mdash; should feel more secure because of their religious beliefs, a point which has been made already.  As a result of the Bill on contraception, condoms are now available but there is no great rush to get them and the same will apply in regard to divorce if it becomes available. In any event, the Bill is very restrictive and makes it very difficult for a person who is the victim in a failed marriage because of the restriction of five years and the various points mentioned in the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>People opposed to this proposed legislation say that women will suffer most if divorce is introduced.  However, women suffer and are abused most at present and are subjected to the greatest pressure. They will be relieved of those pressures if an acceptable form of divorce is introduced. I hold about 13 clinics a week and the cumulative weight of abuse which women suffer in failed marriages depresses me.  That also applies to deserted wives left with large numbers of children to rear on a pittance.  They are under tremendous pressure in trying to bring up a family without enough money to support them.  They pay weekly visits to social welfare officers and are not able to afford bus fares for their children.  The lack of jobs causes unbearable strain on marriages and many of them break up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> Separated women are subject to attention, from unscrupulous men in the main who take advantage of their weakness, financial plight, loneliness and the terrible pressure they are under to indulge in temporary affairs which cause even more problems and hardship to the families involved.  Very often, more children from the new relationship are brought into the family which, in turn, puts even more presure on these women.  In many cases &mdash; I am sure Dublin Deputies will confirm this &mdash; these parasites live off the women and take a portion of the small amount of money they get to buy themselves drink and so on.  Decent people do not take advantage of situations like this and the problem must be addressed.  One can multiply those experiences by 11 constituencies which means that about 40 Deputies are involved with about a million people.</P>
    <P>Nobody is trying to pull the wool over anybody's eyes in regard to this Bill.  It is not anti-family and we are not attacking religion.  The Bill is an attempt to remove the hypocritical veil that lies over society in many areas.  Perhaps this is the most difficult aspect.  People would prefer if these mavericks or rebels had not kept bringing this matter to our attention on the basis that by constant repetition we will be able to find a trace of Christianity in ourselves, to look at ourselves as a people and a nation and to have a starting point from which to solve some of our tremendous problems.  Not just in our social life, but also in our economic life, we have not come of age because we have never faced up to our problems.  That is the bane of our society.  This is another attempt to make us do so.</P>
    <P>Although it is late in the day, the Government have attempted to face up to some of the problems and legislation is promised in the future.  However, the strength of resistence gives us an idea of the way we must go and our problems in those areas.  The political rumblings which have appeared in the last few months show cracks at the seams and probably mean that we are at the stage where the whole system will be taken on. I hope there will be an explosion over the <Col N="1055" /> next couple of years and that we will be able to face the situation realistically, not as we would like to see it or as it is painted.  Every section in society will have to face up to this, including, of course, the Hierarchy who oppose this measure.  It is my view that they will have a greater duty after the referendum, if it is carried, to help their people to a solution of this massive social problem that is getting bigger and will not disappear.</P>
    <P>It is a tribute to the Minister, and those who drafted this measure, that there was little furore kicked up when it was introduced. That may be because the worst fears of many people were taken into consideration.  The conditions laid down before a divorce can be granted are reassuring and they can be added to.  Those conditions when written into the Constitution cannot be diluted.  Further refinements are possible.</P>
    <P>If the referendum is carried, and the resulting legislation is passed, what will happen is that people will work harder at making a success of their marriages.  I do not think that is the case at the moment. Marriage is almost taken for granted, particularly by males.  Females may now have the edge.  As females usually have the responsibility of looking after the children it will balance things up if the threat of divorce is hanging over a male who misbehaves constantly.  He will get adequate warning and it will be fairer than the Probation Act that operates in our courts.  It is only right that justice should be done and that those in bondage, if all conditions are not fulfiled, should be believed.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to give examples or to go into any depth about this except to say that a contributory factor to the huge number of marriage breakdowns, frustration, abandonment and beatings in marriage is the lack of jobs.  Problems are also caused because people are kept in ignorance in regard to marriage and sexual matters.  Another contributory factor is the expediency and alacrity with which housing accommodation is granted to people who have had a very short <Col N="1056" /> relationship.  In one sense we are being penalised for our success.</P>
    <P>Too often here we ignore the social problems in the hope that they might go away or that those suffering might continue to suffer in silence.  Many people have suffered because of the failure of the House to tackle the more important social problems.  The disadvantaged in our society have suffered because of the failure to introduce legislation to provide for equal opportunity.  Children born outside marriage have suffered because we have struck them with the tag of illegitimacy. I am pleased to say that that matter is being tackled in a Bill introduced this week.</P>
    <P>In the House we are ignoring important social needs and are afraid to act until there is a clear and definite majority outside clamouring for a change.  That is not the way to lead.  One must lead from the front.  I would not mind if we were defeated on this issue.  It would not be a waste of time because this is an educative process and one we must go through with. If we reacted only when the time was right, when the polls were in our favour, we would have very funny legislation on the Statute Book.  For example, if hanging was introduced in the aftermath of bombings it might be accepted but in a quiet period it would be rejected.  There was a lot of opposition when it was decided to abandon slavery.  It does not make sense to wait much longer in regard to this issue.  I do not think there is any necessity for us to salve our conscience on this.  We did not lose too much time in bringing this before the House but an attempt to act upon clearly identified needs in society is very often slowed down by this process.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note how attitudes have changed in the last few months, particularly since the Labour Party introduced their Bill to provide for a referendum. A serious attempt is being made to recognise an urgent social need in society and that pleases me.  I am tempted to go into detail in regard to some marriage problems but other Members have documented them sufficiently.  Modern women are seeking equality in marriage <Col N="1057" /> and are refusing to suffer the inhuman treatment their predecessors suffered. Men and women are being more realistic about their marriages and, rather than living in the same house and making each other's lives, and the lives of their children, miserable, are willing to recognise the fact that their marriages have failed. An important point made by speakers is that legislation for divorce is necessary to recognise the fact that marriages have failed.  I cannot understand those who try to sweep that fact under the carpet or even go so far, like one Member today, as to say that the cost would be prohibitive. That Member tried to frighten us off this by pulling a figure of £200 million out of the air.  If it is right to introduce this legislation we must do so.</P>
    <P>Marriages have broken down despite the fact that there is a constitutional ban on divorce.  The truth is that no law can hold two people together when the relationship has irretrievably broken down.  The State can and does deny such people the right to enter into another stable and legal relationship but it does not prevent people from doing so.  This has led to all sorts of appalling problems with some children in a family being termed legitimate and others termed illegitimate.  I have seen examples in my constituency where marriages have broken down or wives have been deserted, where the women have entered into a second relationship and as a result had children and were ultimately deserted by the men.  There is no legal protection for those women or their children.</P>
    <P>There was the example of another woman in my constituency, a woman with five children, who had been deserted for nine years.  Her former husband ended up in jail.  She formed another relationship with a second man by whom she had two further children, which meant she had then seven children altogether.  That second relationship is continuing and there are seven children involved.  We must recognise such examples, that a man is not obliged to pay for his dependants in such situations.  That is the sort of thing that is undermining marriage in this <Col N="1058" /> country.  That point should be emphasised.</P>
    <P>In my view, in the main it is women who are the sufferers.  I have also seen cases where marriages have irretrievably broken down and where people became involved in second, stable relationships which lasted for many years.  Yet we still consider such people married to their first spouse.  There are examples also of men who left their families to work in England &mdash; presumably such men found work there &mdash; but some of their families have never seen them again.  Yet we in this State consider such couples as still married. There are also examples of many women who have had to flee the family home with their children because they were receiving brutal beatings at the hands of their husbands.  Yet those women remain legally tied to those men. They cannot enter into another relationship or even get legal recognition of the fact that their marriages are dead.  That is the sort of hypocrisy being perpetrated in this country.  We all know that these things happen but we refuse to recognise the fact.  We squirm, turn and twist in all directions, first, in an attempt to ignore the fact that problems exist and, second, in order to avoid doing anything about them.</P>
    <P>Regardless of whether the people vote in the referendum to abolish the constitutional ban on divorce we must accept that people will continue to experience irretrievable breakdowns of their marriages and will separate, with consequential serious repercussions for their children.  There are some 8,000 women in receipt of deserted wife's allowance, with approximately 14,000 children dependent on them.  Perhaps people with consciences might think for a moment of the sort of life ahead of such children.  I will not even both to appeal to those people who complain constantly about deserted wives or single mothers and the so-called huge fortunes they receive every week to feed them, people who seem to begrudge those children &mdash; because it is they who are affected most &mdash; this stipend in order merely to live from week to week.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1059" /> During the debate on the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown I said I would be very concerned, if the people voted for divorce, to ensure that every possible provision would be made for the welfare of the children.  I reiterate that concern.  I must express my approval of the Minister's assurance that one of the proposals to be enshrined in further legislation is that the courts will make the necessary orders to ensure that dependants are protected when they refuse applications for divorce.</P>
    <P>We have heard much comment about the effects of marital breakdown and divorce on children.  Here I should like to draw the attention of the House to some research carried out on the effect of marital breakdown on children.  For example, research carried out by a Mr. Rutter in Britain indicates that it is not so much the actual separation or divorce which adversely affects children but rather the tension and discord which precede separation or divorce or which continue in the absence of separation or divorce.  I think Deputy De Rossa made a similar point.  These comments are contained in an article entitled &ldquo;Parent-Child Separation: Psychological Effects on Children&rdquo; in the <i>Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 1971</i>, at Vol. 12, page 233.  Other research carried out by G.R. Leslie, reported under the heading &ldquo;The Family in Social Context,&rdquo;<i>Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry</i>, at Vol. 12, page 715, reached the same conclusion and I quote:</P>
    <P>Several studies have shown that broken homes and juvenile delinquency are associated.  However, the correlation appears to be with all forms of broken homes including those that are emotionally broken but structurally intact, and not just with divorce-broken homes....  Predictions of dire effects of divorce upon children appear not to be warranted.</P>
    <P>The Canadian Law Reform Commission suggested some basic principles designed to protect children involved in divorce, three of which are, first, there <Col N="1060" /> should be a statutory duty imposed on the court to refuse a divorce unless it is satisfied that suitable arrangements are made for the maintenance, custody, care and upbringing of the children.  Second, appropriate counselling services should be available to assist parents and children to adjust to changes in circumstances and to work towards achieving satisfactory solutions and diagnostic and investigative services should be available to assist the court in reaching the appropriate disposition. Third, arrangements for the custody, care and upbringing of children should be based solely on their welfare and best interests.</P>
    <P>I think it is intended to give a lot of attention to that area, one that has been identified by many people, including the Hierarchy.  However, they contend that, if we did that, divorce would not be necessary. Such arguments have been answered conclusively by anybody viewing the position objectively in that we cannot ignore the failure of marriage in our society.</P>
    <P>Like other people, I hope that the debate outside this House does not become hysterical.  I am quite confident that hysteria will not work in this case. The problem in our society is so endemic that it is likely to backfire on those people who wish to make a political issue out of it or who threaten damnation or fire and brimstone on people with a different point of view from theirs.  I do not believe anybody, Church or State, has a monopoly <i>vis-à-vis</i> the minds or the morals of people, that there are certain checks and balances which would demand that this debate be taken seriously.  In order to achieve a fair result, that should happen.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed at some of the things Deputy Woods said this morning. For example, he alleged that the Government had decided that divorce was necessary so as to provide for remarriage and as a remedy for marriage breakdown.  He tried to blame the Government, to imply that the Government were doing this against the wishes of the people.  He said:</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that divorce is necessary so as to provide <Col N="1061" /> for remarriage and as a remedy for marriage breakdown.  So convinced are they of the value of divorce to our society that they plan to campaign in a vigorous and political way for the removal of the present ban on the dissolution of a marriage and the installation in its place of a positive constitutional provision for divorce.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Deputy Woods has stooped that low in politicising the issue himself.</P>

      <P>Let me put it in plain English. He said: &ldquo;So convinced are they of the value of divorce to our society that they plan to campaign in a vigorous and political way....&rdquo;  That is what he is saying.  He is trying to politicise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>He is accusing the Government of politicising it there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>He is using this kind of innuendo as if to impute to the Government that they are trying to impose on the Irish people this awful evil called divorce. The Minister, however, has been at pains to explain over the past number of weeks that that is not the case and it has been explained in a reasonable way in this House how this whole matter came about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We understand why the Opposition take that point of view.  It is very simple. None of them were here when we discussed this matter on the last few occasions, because when the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown was discussed, 23 Deputies contributed and 18 of those came from this side of the House.  I understand how they are now trying to catch up.  I am sorry Deputy Woods took that view.  I want to tell the Deputy that the Government have not decided that divorce is necessary.  Rather have they recognised that it is necessary. This is because they, like all of us, have seen the misery to which people are subjected because divorce is not available. They have recognised it because there <Col N="1062" /> are people in this State who have received annulments from the Catholic Church, have remarried in that Church but in the eyes of the State have committed bigamy. No matter what statistics are quoted about marriage breakdown here, we cannot deny that it is occurring on a considerable scale.  We cannot continue to ignore this if we are really serious about guarding the institution of marriage.</P>
    <P>The truth is that many who are considered married in the eyes of the law and the State have long since ceased to live that Marriage.  It is this mockery and charade, with people who cannot stand the sight of each other and who have lived apart for years and entered into relationships with other partners still being classified as married by the State, which is seriously undermining marriage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to hear what Deputy Skelly had to say and I respect many of the things which he has said over many months.  We all recognise that he is accepted as the deadly dragon of the Fine Gael Party.  He is the man who sends shivers up the Taoiseach's back every time he opens his mouth. However, at least on this occasion they are in accord.  I must commend him for his honesty and consistency, even though there are many areas in which I would not be in agreement with him totally, or sometimes even partially.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment to the Constitution has implications for the futures of all our people, every man, woman and child.  That it was introduced underlines the incidence of marital breakdown, and the amount of pain and suffering caused to the individuals concerned is quite obvious.  The adversarial nature of the legal system and the inadequacies of counselling and mediation services have contributed to our failure to halt the increase in marriage breakdown.  We have been and are still unprepared for the enormous problems which this poses for our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed legislation contains a number of excellent changes in relation to the present marriage law, such as proposals on family courts, reconciliation <Col N="1063" /> procedures and a higher minimum age for marriage.  It echoes the spirit of the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown which pointed out quite clearly and unequivocally that the provision of improved education for relationships in marriage and an increase in the minimum age for marriage, community based support for marriage and the provision of increased marriage counselling services can be expected to slow down and reduce the rate of marriage breakdown. This is something which should concern all of us and of which we should take very serious cognisance.</P>
    <P>The nature of marriage is permanent and lifelong.  Marriages do break down, resulting in much personal suffering and trauma to the parties involved and their children.  Does this mean that we should provide for the dissolution of marriage in legislation which, however carefully defined and circumscribed, will have the effect of diminishing the integrity of marriage as a lifelong commitment?  While I respect the integrity and honesty of people like Deputy Skelly who believe sincerely in what they have said, one must ask that question very seriously.  I do not think I would show less compassion for people experiencing marital breakdown by posing this question.  This is fundamental for the long term wellbeing of our society.  As a consequence of the introduction of divorce, will the incidence of marital breakdown increase?  That is also a question which we must ask ourselves seriously and analyse the answer.  If the incidence does increase, it will exacerbate the problem rather than ameliorating it.</P>
    <P>How does one define objectively a marriage which has irretrievably broken down or failed?  The terminology is extremely vague in the latter case.  How does a marriage cease to exist as an active social relationship and can such a marriage be resuscitated?  I must quote one society in this country, dealing with problematic situations, particularly appertaining to the over-indulgence in alcohol, that is, Alcoholics Anonymous.  A statement was made recently by my colleague, <Col N="1064" /> Senator Hanafin &mdash; and I do not think he would be ashamed if I repeated what he said &mdash; that he attended meetings of that association on a weekly basis.  He said that every man or woman who stands up at those meetings and who confesses to fellow members about problems with regard to alcohol says that the home and family had been broken, that he or she had no money and had lost his or her job and that his or her marriage was finished. That colleague suggested that were it not for the fact that we did not have divorce legislation available freely and easily in this country, those people would have got divorces in that crisis.  We would have been legislating for a minority situation in that these people who had suffered the particular distinctive problem, which we recognise, subsequently had got cured. Their marriages had become resustained, redeveloped and more permanent.  That is a point I would like to make and it is something we should think seriously about.</P>
    <P>I must ask how a marriage finally ceases to exist as an act of social relationships? Can such a marriage if there has been this so-called irretrievable breakdown be resuscitated?  We must consider whether a marriage can be resuscitated rather than being dissolved.  Will recourse to divorce make it easier for people experiencing difficulties in their marital relationships to give up in despair and to stop making the extra effort which might save their marriage and which would commit them to trying to understand each other better and their family lives better?  Would it give them the easy option of trying to be permanent for a while so long as a while is a short time? That is something that must be considered.</P>
    <P>I asked a man and his wife whom I know very well, what they think of divorce.  Johnnie and Mary are normal and ordinary people.  They are like Deputy Reynold's taxi driver.  Johnnie and Mary are ordinary and the archetype of the normal citizen which we recognise in this country to be the salt of the earth, as you would say, Sir, if you were above in north Tipperary, with all due respects <Col N="1065" /> and as the Minister would say down in Kildare.</P>

      <P>We have to look at other countries in the western world where divorce has been introduced on the grounds of irretrievable breakdown. We must acknowledge the experience of those countries, which is, that the rate of divorce has increased significantly and in many cases has multiplied several times. In other western countries divorce started off in a restricted fashion.  Gradually, divorce, available originally on the grounds of adultery, was extended to include cruelty, desertion, insanity and all sorts of other causes which might be used as reasonable reasons for the application of divorce.  Eventually, due to practical considerations, the idea of irretrievable breakdown, no fault divorce, was introduced to replace divorce on a fault basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The experience of other countries clearly indicates that where no fault divorce has been introduced it leads eventually to divorce on demand.  It does not seem realistic to imagine that we will remain impervious to trends which predominate in other similar western societies.  The <Col N="1067" /> impact of divorce on those societies is indicated very clearly by the chilling statistics. I did not create them, no one on this side of the House created them, and I have no doubt that no one on the other side of the House created them.  They are an absolute fact of life and we cannot run away from them.  Some 33 per cent of all marriages in the UK are subject to divorce proceedings.  In 1972, the number of divorces had increased steadily from some 2,000 in the twenties to 110,700. By 1981, the number of divorces had increased to 200,000.  In 1981, some 100,000 English children were living in care situations as a consequence of the introduction of divorce.  At the start of this decade one in every three marriages in the UK ended in divorce.  Now the figure is one in every two marriages.  That is a chilling and absolute statistic which, as I have said, I did not invent, the Deputy did not invent and no one on either side of the House invented.  The divorce rate doubled between 1967 and 1977.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Private Notice Question which I put down today was to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he would make a statement about the imminent closure of the mushroom factories in Carbury, County Kildare, and the measures he proposes to take to save the 350 jobs in this vital industry.  I wish to thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I apologise to the Ceann Comhairle for any nasty remarks which I may have made in my endeavours to have this problem aired and I ask you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to convey my withdrawal of those remarks to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past 28 years a good mushroom industry has grown and expanded in the Carbury area, Drummin Growers, Midland Growers and other sister firms <Col N="1068" /> started originally in an empty Bord na Móna camp.  The industry gives employment to about 350 persons.  Many of these jobs are female labour and are particularly important in a disadvantaged area of Kildare.  Not alone does it include the Carbury area but also a very sizeable hinterland for miles around.  In an area where job opportunities are few, where there is no hope of expansion in Bord na Móna and the ESB and where eventually turf supplies will run out, these two major employers will fold up.  The serious impact of the impending closure of the mushroom factories cannot be over-estimated.</P>
    <P>This area has seen the closure of Ceca, a French factory which makes carbon from turf, because of increasing costs.  It has seen the closure of Robertstown Hotel and the dimming of the vision of the late Reverend Fr. P. J. Murphy to restore the waning glories of the Grand Canal.  If the Government had their way, they would have seen the closure two years ago of the Allenwood peat fired electricity generating station, a decision which involved the use of Polish coal or Australian steam coal to make electricity rather than Irish turf which is still available in the area.</P>
    <P>Some years ago Bord na Móna treated us to the premier of a local film which showed the evolution of Bord na Móna from the time of the great forests in the central plain through the first turf development board and down to the huge machines which are working on the bog today.  That film was called Inné agus Inniú.  It was a proud history.  I want to ensure that there will be an amárach for this area too when Bord na Móna and the ESB have gone their ways.</P>
    <P>Since 23 January this year the Carbury mushroom industry has been in receivership. In keeping with their previous record of good employment the factory was kept at full production.  There was continuity of work and more particularly and importantly continuity of supply on the UK market.  The receiver did not close it down.  His aim was to keep it going and to try to sell it as a going <Col N="1069" /> concern.  That has not been easy for the past four months.  They have been losing money and they consider, rightly so, that the position is now unsustainable.  They have come to the end of the road.  It looks as if, by the end of May, we will also see the end of Carbury mushrooms.  Measures have been taken already to wind down the operation and the production cycle will be broken.  The biggest difficulty is the glut of mushrooms on the British market.  That has led to a sharp drop in prices.  The price of 60p per lb. is probably only a breakeven price for fresh mushrooms.  The average price is 40p per lb.  Prices as low as 27p per lb. have been mentioned for some grades.  Even modern, up to date, recently built, family run, tightly knit units are going to the wall.</P>
    <P>Some modern whiz kids will say that Drummin Growers are old-fashioned, that the system of trays which they use is archaic, that the modern system of satellites and small units growing in bags and supplying to one particular centre is the best.  We must give credit where credit is due.  This firm were a pioneer in the field of mushroom growing and they made a success of it for 28 years.  If it is now necessary for them to modernise and to revamp, I would like to know what semi-State body or State grants are available to them to make themselves viable.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister for Finance today at Question Time giving a dissertation on subsidisation and State aid.  He explained that it would be wrong to give help in an area where it is likely to reduce employment in a similar industry down the road.  I wonder did this type of thinking surface to any great extent when the new mushroom factories were mushrooming all over the country to put Carbury out of business and cause a glut on the market.  It raised the price which suits no one only the British consumer.  Even in the popular television programme of &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; we saw Biddy and Miley in the mushroom act.</P>
    <P>In my schooldays the Irish word for mushroom was fás an aon óiche, the <Col N="1070" /> growth of one night.  It might be uncomfortably appropriate for some of these Johnnie-come-lately outfits which we now have.  I wonder if there was a degree of State subsidisation available to them which has been denied to the Carbury factory.  This company have a cash flow problem.  What attempts have been made to assist them?  The area is obviously as disadvantaged as any other area in the country and deserves assistance.  It may well be that a mushroom processing industry incorporated in the system would lessen the dependence on the fresh mushroom market.  This might be the very scheme to tilt the balance in their favour.  I hope this aspect has been and will continue to be examined.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress to the Minister the need to be positive.  We have 8 per cent of the British fresh mushroom market at present.  The situation is not at saturation point despite what some pundits migh say.  We could capture 10 per cent of the market and solve our difficulties.  What is vital now is to give every assistance to the industry to hold their share of the market, to maintain continuity of supply and to be in a proper position to move ahead when times improve.  I ask the Minister not to let this industry be another sad statistic in the litany of factory failures.  There is a good employer there.  There are no employer-labour-shop steward problems.  There is an anxiety to provide continuity of employment.  There is a willingness among the workforce to work.  Surely there is an onus on the State agencies to match that willingness.</P>
    <P>Traditionally summer time is a bad time for selling mushrooms.  Demand falls off and there are losses.  Usually the demand in winter time makes up for this and the books are balanced.  I want the Minister to do something to bridge that gap.  There is a trend of opinion that Dutch mushrooms are being dumped on the British market at much less than the cost of production.  There are those who will say that with their in-built, cheap energy subsidisation the Dutch can afford to do this until they cut out the opposition and have a monopoly of the trade in <Col N="1071" /> mushrooms just as they have cornered the tomato industry.</P>
    <P>We can ask ourselves why is it that the gas line which Fianna Fáil brought so swiftly from Cork to Dublin did not become extended in spurs to provide a cheap energy source for our own horticultural and glasshouse industries and particularly the mushroom industry.  That is the problem which Deputy Connolly and I wished to raise today by Private Notice Question.  It includes the real world where people live and work, rear their families and try to pay their way.  They want to see a life for themselves other than life on the dole.  They might see the debate on divorce today as an indication of how difficult it is to have their problem aired.  As I mentioned before, they can see this House as divorced from reality and that their public representatives are not really in a position to represent them. These simple country people faced with a destitute future with the closure of the industry believe that their lives are irretrievably broken down.  We, as public representatives, are concerned on their behalf and I hope the Government and their agencies and all the facilities they have at their command will help this industry and the jobs depending on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Power regarding the mushroom complex in Carbury.  Three individuals in a limited company are involved.  The firm has been in receivership since early this year.  They had been very good employers, providing jobs for 350 people in an area otherwise without industrial employment.  The workforce were very young in a rural area stretching from Clane to Edenderry in Offaly.  There are no industries in that area capable of absorbing those workers and of giving them hope for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This industry's problems were exacerbated by a glut of mushrooms on the British market.  We Irish are excellent Europeans, abiding by all the Community's rules and directives and we behave ourselves as good Europeans.  However, it seems to be possible for other member states to dump their goods wherever they <Col N="1072" /> like and that is why this industry has been forced to close.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, though this is not strictly a Government problem, to get the Government agencies to do everything in their power to bring some relief to this area of County Kildare.  Mushroom production is part of our food industry, and when we joined the EEC in the early seventies I thought that from the point of view of economics joining a free trade area would bring immeasurable advantages to us as a food producing nation.  I thought that we would be encouraged to produce the goods that we were best at, based on the theory of comparative advantage.  We thought we had an inbuilt advantage in food production and that within a free trade area we would be able to expand all branches of our food industry.</P>
    <P>It amazes me that in County Kildare there are three meat factories two of which are closed at present and the other on a short working week.  They are part of our food industry which has not been thriving.  We must have gone seriously wrong in our industrial policy over many years if we cannot sustain such industries in free trade conditions.  It seems to me that the original idea of the Community has not worked at all.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, knows the problems in his own constituency, particularly in Midleton.  The spectacle of so many food factories being closed suggests that something must be done urgently.</P>
    <P>The area in which we are interested has not had a great industrial history. The power station at Allenwood will be closing down shortly and many jobs will be going to the wall.  In a few years turf production in Timahoe, Ballydermot and their neighbourhoods will run out.  Therefore, the Government should be preparing a long term strategy plan for that area of the midlands from the middle of Kildare into Laois and Offaly.  If we do not take action now, in five years that area will be destitute from the point of view of jobs.</P>
    <P>The mushroom industry has given excellent employment and I ask the Minister again to encourage the IDA and <Col N="1073" /> Fóir Teoranta to assist in a rescue bid. This industry has a long term future.  If such industries have not got a future in Ireland we cannot foresee a future for what I call the matchbox factories producing Black and Decker tools, cameras etc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my Fianna Fáil colleagues for giving me an opportunity to speak for a few moments.  I, too, had a parliamentary question disallowed on 5 May on this subject.  Should this industry close it will spell social and economic disaster for north-west Kildare, an area that for 30 years has enjoyed continuous employment in an indigenous industry which has been self-supporting, which has bought all its raw materials locally and employed local people from north-west Kildare and Offaly.  The company has had a very successful trading history.</P>
      <P>People will say that as time passes and whiz kids take over and markets change, perhaps greater changes should be made, such as rationalisation.  This private firm indicated their willingness at all times to co-operate with all State agencies in an effort to bring about rationalisation in the hope of saving the firm and the jobs.  That being so, one expected that the State agencies would row in behind them and give them the support necessary.  I give all credit to the IDA who have indicated their willingness to assist in revamping the plant so that as many as possible of the 360 jobs would be saved.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, I am not so impressed with Fóir Teoranta, who seem to look at the matter in a far more callous, economic light.  They have not been forthcoming with assistance.  They have indicated they want to see massive changes before they would put money in. As Deputies Power and McCreevy have said, this industry has been there for a long time.  It has worked well and given good employment.  Ninety-five per cent of their produce was exported, something to be proud of.  Our export industries have shown great progress in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For all these reasons we should not allow this industry to disappear before <Col N="1074" /> our eyes.  It has potential to develop exports and at the same time maintain its labour force.  The area concerned can be regarded as disadvantaged in many ways. We would be neglecting our duty as public representatives if we did not bring sufficient pressure to bear on the one agency that can now assist in a worthwhile way, Fóir Teoranta.  I repeat my appeal to Fóir Teoranta to look again at the proposals before them.  A great deal of effort has been put into the proposed rescue package by the firm and the receiver. I am afraid that what is called rationalisation often turns out to be a much reduced version of what this industry has been.  If that is to happen in this instance I can see the loss of the market share previously enjoyed by Drummin and Midland Growers in Carbury.  I ask Fóir Teoranta to consider the 360 jobs at stake in an area that badly needs them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the financial difficulties which have built up in the mushroom production units at Carbury, County Kildare.  The complex was set up in the sixties and represented an important unit of the national mushroom production and export over the years.  Their problems emanated from the radical technological advances in mushroom production which have emerged in recent years.  The traditional form of production in which compost manufacture and the growing of the mushrooms in large trays is carried out on a single mushroom farm has now changed to a system involving a central composting unit which distributes compost in growing bags to a number of satellite growers in the surrounding districts.  The mushrooms are produced by these growers in polythene houses and are usually delivered back to a central packing centre for preparation and sale.  This new system has major advantages in that the investment costs are spread over a big number of investors, labour costs are reduced and a high degree of yield and quality can be obtained.  The satellite system has expanded considerably in this country in recent years and is now making a valuable <Col N="1075" /> contribution to increased competitiveness and expanding exports.  Without the new technology we would not have maintained our position on the UK market.</P>
      <P>Some of the traditional mushroom farms have adopted the new technology but this was not the case at Carbury.  I understand that the receiver is trying to negotiate the sale of the company and it is hoped that he will be able to dispose of the assets.  The IDA are keeping in close touch with the situation and will give every possible help to any new enterprise that may emanate from the sale.</P>
      <P>We are encouraged by the fact that there has been quite an interest in the take-over.  The enterprise is not a writeoff and I hope that jobs can be saved. There is a strong possibility that new technology will be adopted.  I shall do everything in my power to ensure that mushroom growing will be continued in the Kildare area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to Dutch production of mushrooms but I do not think we need worry unduly.  We were established in the English market long before the Dutch and we can and will maintain our position.  However, we must be competitive and it is essential, therefore, that we <Col N="1076" /> adapt to new technology.  Apart from the question of disease control, the use of polythene houses for the production of mushrooms is much more efficient.  This fine industry has served the area well and I hope it will continue to do so, even though it may be in a different manner. Perhaps some of the people involved may become mushroom growers for the central unit.  I give the House this commitment, that I will continue to be personally involved, as I have been in the case of IMP in Midleton where we have now a vigorous company involved in that undertaking.</P>

      <P>Since 1 January 1984, when my Department took over the function of making such purchases on behalf of all Government Departments, all the boot and shoe polish purchased, with the exception of one minor item, has been of <Col N="904" /> Irish manufacture.

      <P>I should add that contracts are placed by my Department on the basis of competitive tendering, in accordance with Government contracts procedures. Because of this country's membership of the European Community, a Government Department may not insist that all, or any, of the work involved in meeting its supply orders be carried out in the State.</P>

These beds are also under-utilised.  All of <Col N="907" /> the medical advice states that obstetric services should be concentrated in centres catering for, at the minimum 1,500 to 2,000 births/deliveries per annum and that they should have full consultant cover.  Maternity units are now being located in general hospitals where they can avail of full consultant staffing in both obstetrics and paediatrics and all the other back up services found in general hospitals.  Accordingly the Eastern Health Board propose to close these maternity beds at Athy with effect from 31 May 1986.  However, the delivery suit and one bed will be retained for emergency cases.  Ante-natal clinics will continue to be provided in the Athy area by consultant staff from Portlaoise General Hospital.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a claimant must be available and genuinely seeking work.  The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 6 February 1984 but her claim was disallowed on the grounds that she was not available for employment by virtue of the fact that she had made no efforts to obtain work. She was last employed in 1980.  She did not appeal against the disallowance although she was advised of her right to do so.</P>
      <P>She continued to sign the unemployed register and her case was reviewed in October 1984.  However, the deciding officer did not consider that there was sufficient evidence to warrant a revision of the earlier decision and she was, accordingly, still not considered to be available for employment.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of a contributory old age pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires a person to have a yearly average of at least 20 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from his year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete <Col N="909" /> contribution year before reaching pension age.</P>
      <P>The Department's records show that the person concerned had 48 reckonable contributions from January to November 1953 and that contributions in respect of his employment from December 1953 were paid at the reduced rate applicable to permanent and pensionable public servants. This reduced rate does not include any element of cover in respect of contributory old age pension and, consequently, such contributions are not reckonable for the purposes of this pension. The 48 reckonable contributions paid in respect of him in 1953 is equal to a yearly average of only one over the relevant period which, in this case, is from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1986. Therefore, he does not qualify for a contributory old age pension.</P>

The application of the schools referred to by the Deputy has not, to date, been placed sufficiently high in order of priority of educational need to warrant the allocation of a post.  It will, however, be further considered in the light of the availability of such posts in the future.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that candidates who took their practical examination in engineering this year in the absence of a metalwork teacher will not be discriminated against or deprived.  The teacher who would normally be present at such tests is there to see that the requisite tools and materials are available for the candidates, but is not permitted to give any direction or assistance to candidates in regard to the marking out or execution of their work.  Candidates who took the practical examination in engineering without the metalwork teacher being present will have this fact taken into account in the marking of their test pieces.</P>
