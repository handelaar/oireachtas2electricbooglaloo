      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 28 to 30, to delete subsection (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill's provision for developing the service industry is a welcome one.  International trade services now represent one-third of total world trade.  The White Paper on Industrial Policy identified a number of target sectors which are judged to have considerable benefit for Ireland by way of new jobs and export earnings.  These included financial services, including off-shore banking.  I am disappointed, therefore, that the Minister chose to ignore the financial services sector in the Bill, especially in view of its potential for growth.  The Irish banking sector has seen exciting changes over the past two decades.  Technological change, and the achievement of internal markets <Col N="291" /> within the European Community, will ensure that the next two decades will see even more exciting and dynamic developments. Experts have pointed out that just as the market in the financial services industry is in transition the world over, the industry in Ireland is moving from a relatively stable environment categorised by the distinct business and product segments through a period of rapid change where broadening and overlapping product lines and expanding distribution options will become more the norm.</P>
    <P>The financial services sector covers a broad area, the associated banks and other banks, building societies and national savings.  The market in which they operate has been seen to be having increasing demand for longer term saving mechanisms, tax efficiency and inflation heading.  The operating environment will continue to change as consumer demands will dictate that the banks innovate to create new products.  Experts have pointed out that there is no doubt that the domestic financial services industry will undergo a radical restructuring as they adapt to change with new competitive developments.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that the Minister has a duty to ensure that all possible measures are taken to improve the effectiveness of Irish banking services as an instrument of industrial policy.  I am proposing that we delete subsection (2) because it excludes the banking service from the list of eligible services.  Deletion of subsection (2) will ensure that industrial policy takes due account of the productive and job-creating potential of the financial services industries by including all sectors of the financial services which engage in international trade.  As it stands the exclusion of a banking service under subsection (2), except for consultation with the Minister for Finance, discriminates against a major sector of the financial services industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that the numbers at work in banking and finance in 1984 exceeded 22,000 which is almost 50 per cent of the total number at work in the financial services sector.  Employment <Col N="292" /> in the sector doubled between 1971 and 1984.  It is clear that the Bill should take cognisance of the changes which occurred in the financial services industry over the last few years and that will take place over the next few decades as the barriers between the financial institutions and markets are gradually eliminated and competition in the services increases.  The sector embraces some 2,000 institutions and companies covering banking, insurance, building societies, venture capital, accountancy and management consultancy, stocktaking, leasing and finance companies <i>inter alia.</i></P>
    <P>It has been estimated that the financial services industries contribute some 6 per cent of growth gross value added to the economy and employ nearly 46,000 skilled personnel.  Internationally that is a high growth sector which is likely to contribute strongly to economic growth here.  Over the period 1972 to 1981 it is estimated that the numbers employed in financial services, for instance in the US, grew by 46,000.  One must compare this with an increase of 95 per cent in Ireland. The industry should be encouraged by appropriate Government action to develop strong internationally traded financial services enterprises.  It is appropriate, therefore, that financial services trading internationally should be eligible for assistance given to other sectors under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Within the EC the liberalisation of financial services linked to that of capital movements will represent a major step towards Community financial integration and the widening of the internal market. The accent will be increasingly on the free circulation of financial products made ever easier by developments of technology.  I contend that this will offer considerable scope for expansion to the financial services industries as the sector seeks to meet the needs of 320 million people within the EC market.  Within a purely Irish context the Governor of the Central Bank noted last September that the development of an efficient financial sector is essential to economic development here especially from the point of view of financing foreign trade and channelling <Col N="293" /> domestic savings into productive investment, Government policy, therefore, must be influenced by the fact that a modern industrial economy demands a very wide range of financial services.  It is for that reason that I am proposing that we delete subsection (2).</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The broad thrust of the Deputy's arguments is understandable and, indeed, has my support but the important words are that the Minister for Finance must be consulted.  He does not have the last say.  This subsection merely repeats, with only minor drafting changes, section 3 (2) of the Industrial Development (No. 2) Bill, 1981, which provides that the Minister for Finance must be consulted about the making of an order in regard to the banking service. We all accept that the Minister for Finance is responsible for the banking sector, for monitoring the international monetary situation and the protection of the Irish currency.  It is appropriate that any order in regard to banking services should be made only following consultation with him.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will know that it is not the intention to preclude the Minister from making an order specifying a banking service as a service industry for the purposes of this section.  It merely places an obligation on the Minister to consult with the Minister for Finance before doing so. I believe that is a reasonable requirement and, for that reason, I cannot agree with the amendment proposed by Deputy Lyons.  The services sector specified by the Minister includes international financial services.  The Deputy may have missed that.  We are really not at odds here.  It is merely a consultation procedure that is logical within the context of governmental responsibility.  I suppose, taken at its most devious, I would want to talk to the Minister for Finance, and he may want to talk to other people regarding integrity, potential and so on. It is merely a consultation process that does not in any way detract from the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section is an enabling one simply <Col N="294" /> to encourage the undertaking of the provision of service industries in this country. It is not a devious subsection.  It is merely to ensure that everything is being done in the right order and with appropriate consultation at Government level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>In section 3 (1) we have dealt with the provision of services.  I do not wish to use the Minister's own word but, when speaking, he reminded me that perhaps there is something devious about the insertion of a section giving special treatment to such an important sector of our industrial financial services industry and, on the lines I have mentioned, its effects and benefits for the banking structure. In the Bill there has not been specified any other sector of the financial services than banking.  I quoted a whole plethora in my earlier contribution &mdash; insurance companies, building societies, venture capital funds, accountancy and management, consultancy, stocktaking. None of those sectors has been singled out for special reference.  That is what prompted me to re-examine why one sector of the financial services should receive this specific treatment under the provisions of subsection (2).  There must be some reason for doing so, but I have not yet heard it.  For example, why was none of the others picked out?  Again, I hope it is not a devious subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not intended to be so.  I will give the Deputy the range of service industries specified by the Minister which are: data processing services, software development services, technical and consulting services, commercial laboratory services, administrative headquarter services, research and development services, media recording services, training services, publishing services, international financial services, health care services.  As I said at the outset, it is merely a repetition of a provision already contained in the Industrial Development (No. 2) Act, 1981.  So there is nothing sinsister in it.  In fact, it was the Deputy's party who introduced the 1981 Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to banking services, I should <Col N="295" /> say that, first, banks take deposits and, second, they are licensed by the Central Bank.  Third, they come under the aegis of the Minister for Finance, unlike the insurance industry which is under the aegis of my Department, the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Therefore, I can supervise them, have consultations and take decisions with regard to insurance. But the primary responsibility for banking is that of the Minister for Finance. There is nothing devious in the subsection.  We are anxious to have a flexible Bill, one that will encourage development of the services industry.  I can assure the Deputy that this is merely a procedural mechanism to ensure that the Minister with primary responsibility for the banking sector would be consulted before I would make an order allowing them to partake in the services industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reaching the stage of being almost satisfied with the Minister's assurances on this subsection.  It is well to note that we have now had read into the Official Report a number of the sectors, as outlined by the Minister.  None of those sectors carries any requirement to refer to the Minister for Finance.  This one does have this extra requirement &mdash; perhaps superfluous would be a better word &mdash; to seek the approval of the Minister for Finance.  I am not suggesting that those outlined by the Minister should be put in the same category to qualify for reference to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said, and I agree, that for the purpose of industrial development we need some flexibility in the provisions of the Bill.  He has said that he wishes to see the provisions as flexible as possible. I go along with that provided that we draft the legislation technically to so ensure.  I am sure the Minister would agree that there is no desire to have any section or subsection that would militate against the flexibility we require for industrial development.  So far the debate on this section seems to indicate that section 3 (2) will not impede, discourage or erect a barbed wire fence around the <Col N="296" /> financial services of the banking sector. If I can have that assurance from the Minister I will be satisfied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Deputy the assurance that we are not endeavouring to erect a barbed wire fence around our activities in relation to the development of the services industry.  On the contrary, we are anxious to ensure the flexibility to which the Deputy referred. I might refer the Deputy to the words used in subsection (2).  The only responsibility on me is to consult with the Minister for Finance.  In legislative, in parliamentary terms, the word &ldquo;consult&rdquo; is less onerous than, say, a phrase such as &ldquo;the approval of&rdquo;, which would necessitate seeking the approval of the Minister for Finance.  Here we only have to consult with him.  That is a normal, logical procedure in Government administration.  The Minister for Finance has primary responsibility for the banking sector and has serious obligations in relation thereto.  We are merely following former procedure.  The provision is not intended to be a stricture on the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; there is no intention to put barbed wire anywhere. Given the primacy of the Minister for Finance this provision is necessary from the point of view of Government responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that we cannot find another means to get around this than by withdrawing the amendment. The point I have made is reasonable and it has been understood by the Minister, who knows what I am trying to ensure there will be no inhibitions in the performance of this subsection.  In view of the fact that the contributions from both sides of the House are on record, I agree to withdraw the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>In page 5, lines 41 to 43, to delete subsection (3).</P>
      <P>Further on there is another mistake in regard to another section, and subsections (2) and (3) have to do with designating areas.  I have much to say about such designation.  In the section, the Minister is taking power to designate areas and in subsection (3) the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by order terminate the designation of any area, or part thereof, as a designated area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy deal with the amendment first and then we can deal with the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difference.  This subsection follows as another adjunct &mdash; it all has to do with the designation of areas.  In other words, I could have put the amendment down to any subsection of section 4.  The Minister is taking power to redesignate counties.  This was not part of the original industrial development legislation &mdash; it is something new, and this is clear in the NESC report on the designation of industrial policy.  The essential part of that report is that a larger share of designation would be focused on the many small towns and villages, the objective being to get the highest return from Exchequer resources, subject to location constraints in regard to approvals. The report stated that this is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is a move already to depart from the original industrial development structure.  The NESC report argued that there are compelling reasons for adopting a concentrated approach to industrial locations and it recommends that designation be retained <Col N="298" /> for specific disadvantaged areas defined on the basis of objective criteria.  I have no objection to a review, but the report argues that the objective of industrial policy is to develop functions other than production, for example, marketing, distribution, headquarters activity and so on.  The report argues that business functions often lead to higher infrastructural demands because they demand a higher level of infrastructure in a few areas from the point of view of having a more feasible industrial policy.  It seems to me that much of this section has arisen out of the NESC report, and that is why I am not at all satisfied with aspects of the section.  Perhaps the Minister would like to comment on what we have said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should give some background details for the Deputy's information.  The White paper on Industrial Policy stated that the Government believe that a more flexible and effective use could be made of the designation instrument to promote an even rate of industrial development throughout the country.  It said that a detailed analysis would be carried out on the relative strengths and weaknesses of all the counties on the basis of objective criteria and at regular intervals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NESC, who have undertaken a number of studies on regional policy, were asked in September 1983 to advise on these criteria.  The objective is to ensure that areas were designated for higher grant purposes for clearly defined industrial sectors and limited periods, so that limited resources can be continuously reallocated to the areas of greatest need and potential.  The NESC completed their report in late 1985 and outlined a mechanism for determining designation along impartial lines, using objective criteria based on labour market imbalances.  The ESRI in recent weeks advised my Department of the practical implications of implementing the NESC recommendations.  Their report is being considered in my Department at present. However, all decisions on changes in relation to the existing designated areas will be made only after the matter has been <Col N="299" /> carefully considered, not only by my Department but by the Government.</P>
    <P>What is proposed in section 4 (3) is that the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, will have the power to terminate a designation of any area.  I take it that this is what Deputy Lyons is concerned about.  It is merely an enabling provision which will allow the Minister of the day to use the designation instrument in a more effective manner in the future. For designation to be effective, there must be a limit on the total area covered for designation purposes.  Members on all sides of the House will see the inequity of the situation where certain areas continue to benefit from a higher limit of grant assistance for industrial prospects, irrespective of changes in their relative positions <i>vis-à-vis</i> other areas.  The provision as it stands makes good sense in that it allows the Government of the day to use the designated instrument flexibly and effectively.  Therefore I cannot agree to the amendment put down by Deputy Lyons.</P>
    <P>I should add that as Minister of State I have been involved in industrial matters for a few years now.  Practically all deputations that come to me are seeking designation for their county.  They see it as a panacea for all their ills.  They are jealous of other perhaps adjacent counties being designated and want the designation to be extended.  One would have to accept that the national funds are limited.  Any Government, on expert advise coming from say, the ESRI or on other independent expert reports which showed clearly that an area had gained in prosperity while some other area had fallen drastically in prosperity, would be able to use this mechanism of flexibility in the context of scarce funds for the promotion of industrial policy more intensively in one area as opposed to another.</P>
    <P>I realise that this is a delicate instrument which would be used only after great care and consideration had been given by any Government.  This Bill, when enacted, will carry through for quite a number of years and, by the nature of politics, will be the responsibility <Col N="300" /> of a number of Ministers.  Great care will have to be taken that it will not be used for by-election purposes or for frivolous reasons.  Before even considering the inclusion of this section, the Minister thought it proper that the NESC should be commissioned to make an independent report.  That report having come to hand, the Minister further thought it proper that the ESRI should examine the Bill and make recommendations.  That report is now being considered by my Department.  I do not imagine that this will be a quick process, as quite an amount of consideration will have to be given to it.</P>
    <P>It is an enabling mechanism which I am sure any Minister would use only after great consideration of the effects on any area and the cost benefit analysis for the national economy and industrial policy overall.  I consider it an important aspect of the Bill.  This Bill is in many ways a consolidating and modernising Bill.  It tries to bring into the legislative framework of modern, flexible approach which can be used by Ministers for quite a number of years to come.  It should be seen as an enabling Bill that reflects the flexibility being brought into the overall legislation.  It is a section which would want to be used with great care and there is no intention on the part of this Government to do anything but take great care in its use.  In including it, we realise that many Ministers will have the same responsibilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with many aspects of the Minister's contribution just now, especially concerning requests for redesignation. I have been asked in a number of places to give almost a commitment, on return to Government, to designate some areas, the most recent being the entire county of Wexford.  This county's unemployment level has now surpassed that of my own county by about 2 per cent.  That is only an example.  People in the west are very concerned that some aspects of this Bill might lean that little bit too heavily on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that this Bill seeks to consolidate all the Acts relating to industrial <Col N="301" /> development over a 30 year period.  That is to be recommended and I agree with it.  However, we must be careful in the light of experience of much legislation. Up to now we have been designating particular areas for various levels of grant.  We have disadvantaged areas, the western package, proposals for a number of smaller segments for higher rates of grant.  If we include the agricultural industry, we are almost at the point of designating the whole county, not just small sections of it.  Instead of designating sections for special allocations, we should be able to pick out a few areas which do not require designation and designate the remainder.  That is the way it looks at the moment.  I hope it will not continue much longer.</P>
    <P>It is a bit frustrating that this Bill has been under consideration for at least four or five years and that this morning we are talking about a further report from the ESRI.  Will the recommendations of this report be available in time for inclusion in this Bill before it becomes an Act?</P>
    <P>I question the designation section of the Bill which says:</P>
    <P>(1)  Subject to subsection (3) each of the areas set out in the Third Schedule and any areas which the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by order declares to be a designated area shall be a designated area for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    <P>(2)  An order under subsection (1) may declare an area to be a designated area for such a period as is specified in the Order.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by order terminate the designation of any area, or part thereof, as a designated area.</P>
    <P>That section is a cause for concern.  The proposal to give the Minister power to terminate designation offers the possibility for the first time of cutting out by order areas which traditionally have been designated areas.  That sort of action should be taken in this House where it can be debated and fully considered by the House.  Apart from the requirement <Col N="302" /> to obtain the consent of the Minister for Finance, other restrictions are not placed on the Minister.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not outline any criteria to indicate why an area might be designated. We must look for the criteria elsewhere. I looked to the White Paper on Industrial Policy and to the NESC report which I already mentioned.  The White Paper on Industrial Policy says that the aim of Policy is mobility and flexibility in the economy so industry can be placed where it can make the greatest progress rather than stick rigidly to job targets or particular town groups.  That is significant. As a result of the introduction of the White Paper, NESC were asked to advise on criteria whereby the relative strengths and weaknesses of all the counties could be ascertained.  Pending completion of the NESC report, the Government asked the IDA to give priority in industrial location policy to allocating projects in areas where growth and job creation prospects were considered greatest, in areas which are most seriously affected by unemployment and job losses and in areas which have the highest prospective labour force growth. I do not have an indication whether these requests from the Government were replied to by NESC and the IDA.  The Bill does not indicate whether the questions posed are criteria for the Minister who will make the decision.</P>
    <P>The NESC report on the designation of areas for industrial policy suggests that the question of objective criteria for designation status can be addressed in two ways: that designation could be based on need, in which case the highest grant levels would apply to areas defined as economically disadvantaged or underdeveloped and that the higher grant level would be intended to promote a more rapid development in these disadvantaged areas than would occur in the absence of the more preferential grant treatment.  The alternative would be to designate areas on the basis of economic potential.  This would result in a grant system which would contribute to a maximisation of industrial growth in the economy and which might require that <Col N="303" /> industry be actively encouraged to locate in centres where growth prospects would be higher and infrastructural costs lower through the realisation of economies of scale.</P>
    <P>The report in chapter five, deals with designation criteria based on potential.  It is their view that the increased emphasis should be accorded the potential approach to regional industrial policy. Why was it necessary to have that remark in the report?  Is it because there is a shift from the regional development policy within the IDA?  I hope the Minister can assure me that there is not a shift from IDA regional policy.  However, that statement in that report causes me some concern.  The bulk of the arguments put forward to support the NESC approach are based on work undertaken as part of studies done in 1967 in the Buchanan report, where towns are ranked in terms of the development potential.  The present report, while it accepts that it is still desirable to update the assessment, says that if it is proposed to pursue a growth centre strategy it is likely that substantial changes in ranking would not have occurred since 1967.  That is the first option.</P>
    <P>The second option is concerned with designation criteria based on need.  The report identifies a total of 39 separate potential indicators which might be taken into account if designation criteria were to be based on need.  These would include demographic aspects, labour market aspects and economic aspects.  The NESC recommend that the concept of need on which designation should be based should be labour market imbalance.  In the past designation has primarily been based on income/employment/unemployment/ migration.  The concept of labour market imbalance is a narrower criterion.  The specific indicators which are recommended for measuring labour market imbalance are unemployment as a percentage of the 1981 labour force; the percentage increase in numbers unemployed between 1981 and 1985; migration of labour force &mdash; age of persons &mdash; as a percentage of the 1971-1981 labour force; <Col N="304" /> growth in labour force on assumption of no migration between 1981 and 1991.  It is suggested that each of these indicators be given a weighting and that counties should be ranked in order of need, on a league table 1-26 or something like that.</P>
    <P>The argument for the de-designation in the west, for instance, has not been adequately made in economic or social terms.  Even the NESC report concedes that sufficient information is not available to make the argument.  If the new designation approach de-designates the west it will remove the one aspect of regional policy which in the past has helped to lessen the economic and social disparities existing between the more favoured and the less favoured regions of this country. The criteria have not been conveyed to us.  I am afraid that the proposals outlined in the NESC report on the question of designation will be used from the enactment of this legislation.  I contend that the proposals for designation are based on a narrow view focused purely in terms of industrial policy.  The matter should be seen in the wider context as an instrument of regional policy.</P>
    <P>The follow-on effect of designation on other activities has not been examined. For example, the effects in relation to FEOGA assistance for the development of an effective and efficient agricultural processing industry has not been examined. Similarly there has not been consideration of the effect of designation on agricultural development generally, within or outside areas qualifying for FEOGA grants.</P>
    <P>If, for example, a policy of designation based on opportunity were to be adopted, it could conceivably result in the designation of a great part of the east coast and no other area of the country.  Would it then be the case that all agricultural processing would have to be located in that area to obtain FEOGA assistance?</P>
    <P>The Minister will bear with me for spending some time on this aspect because it is very important in relation to the whole question of industrial development now and in the future.  Perhaps the Minister will give an indication of the criteria to be used in designation and <Col N="305" /> redesignation with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Are the criteria used to be based on the NESC report?</P>
    <P>I have mentioned a few areas but the question is of particular relevance to the west where the designation of disadvantaged areas had its foundation.  I want to know what is proposed, what the thinking is, and what criteria are to be used.  If a proposal is brought forward to de-designate the west, it will have the effect of alienating the population there.  While the people of the west have seen the economic disparities lessen in the past they are well aware that a substantial degree of disparity still exists.  People there are naturally concerned about these proposals.  Many feel that the population structure in that part of the country is still rather fragile.  People there would no doubt be able to testify that emigration, one of the greatest social and economic scourges of that community, has already re-emerged as a developing problem.  I realise that the problem of emigration is not just confined to one area but it is manifesting itself much more strongly in the western counties where the population structure is still fragile.  A decision to de-designate before that section of the country has had an opportunity of really establishing itself in a self-sustaining growth position would be catastrophic.</P>
    <P>There are other areas of the country where emigration is taking a serious toll. I have mentioned several counties and I will not neglect my own county which had the dubious distinction of being the forerunner of the current decline in economic and industrial development and suffered alarmingly.  I know attempts have been made to redesignate minute areas within Cork city and county for higher rates of grant.  How will designation or redesignation be applied to that part of the country known as the Border region?  What criteria will be applied there?  In effect, section 4 of this Bill covers designation and redesignation in the north, south, east and west of the country.  I trust the Minister will indicate what criteria will be in operation, <Col N="306" /> with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in regard to designated areas for the purpose of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this section of the Bill can make a very important contribution for the future based on experience of the designated and the disadvantaged areas in the past.  The shift from traditional industrial development to modern industry, the shift away from some of the traditional industries, are experiences that can be used in relation to industrial development in the future.  We in the south know very well what are the effects of the closure of traditional industries.  I agree that this Bill which represents a consolidation of many pieces of legislation is likely to be in operation for a substantial period.  Consequently, all aspects of the Bill are of the utmost importance.</P>
    <P>In regard particularly to the designation of areas, there must be laid down clearly established procedures.  There are many areas of the country that are in need of industrial revitalisation.  That is why I am concerned that this section does not outline a number of important factors which should be outlined.  Much importance must be attached to the designated areas, to redesignation and to the qualifying criteria for designation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the constructive manner in which the Deputy has approached this section, a section that involves one of the more important aspects of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, this is not only a consolidating measure.  It is also a modernising measure.  It is inevitable that when dealing with such a measure there is a fresh look at the whole area concerned and that one may wish to adopt a whole new approach to well established policy. In this context the question of the designation of geographical areas for the purposes of grants manifested itself as a problem.  In the past number of years Ministers have had deputations from a number of different areas in relation to unemployment and a breakdown in the manufacturing and construction industries. The general consensus was that <Col N="307" /> the designation of the various counties or townlands being represented by the delegations would be of vital importance to the re-establishment of economic progress. Almost every deputation I have met in recent years claimed that their individual areas were experiencing the highest level of unemployment in the country.  At Question Time here almost every Deputy refers to the closure of some industry in his or her constituency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This exercises the minds of Ministers and officials but a change in the matter of designation is an important matter.  It is not a task that any Minister would take lightly.  It would be very foolish to make any change in regard to designation without first having the benefit of expert advice.  It was because the then Minister, Deputy Bruton, wished to take a fresh look at designation that he commissioned a report on the matter.  Designation is only a weapon in the hands of the Government and in the hands of the IDA to promote industrial progress.  I have said here many times that designation <i>per se</i> is not a panacea for ills of any region.  There are many other equally important factors in the matter of industrial progress.</P>
      <P>Immediately one can specify such factors as the availability of third level education which would produce technologically qualified graduates, the environment that might appeal to an enterpreneur, the availability of qualified labour and good industrial relations.  The latter are as important to the promotion of industrial prosperity and to the success of any undertaking as is designation.  This is because the amount of money that could be lost because of bad industrial relations could exceed by far the marginal increase in the grant to an industry.  I would regard industrial relations as being far more important than the gaining of a high level of grant and we are talking here about a maximum differential of 15 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the White Paper on <Col N="308" /> Industrial Policy the question of designation arose.  The Minister took the only course that could ensure a new view of designation and consequently he asked the NESC to prepare a report.  That report is entitled <i>Designation of Areas for Industrial Policy</i> and I quote from Chapter 7.5 which is entitled &ldquo;Objective Criteria for Designated Status&rdquo; and which indicates the philosophy of the council to designation:</P>
    <P>While recommending that designation status should be retained for certain specific disadvantaged areas, the Council believes that the criteria for delimiting these areas, and the periods for which the preferential grants might be available, should be drawn much more tightly in the future.  Specifically, the Council recommends that designation status should be given for a maximum period of five years after which it should be reviewed.  Designation status should encompass, at most, 25% of the country's labour force. Ideally, designation would be focused on as small an area as possible. Data limitations, however, suggest that in most cases the county would of necessity form the basis of the review.  Designation status itself should be awarded only on the basis of objective criteria and specific position relative to national average. The criterion on which designation status should be assessed should be labour market imbalance which is intended to encompass a comprehensive measurement of unemployment. The indicators which should be used are unemployment rate, growth in unemployment, migration and labour force projected growth.  These indicators should be aggregated with a higher weighting for the unemployment variables.</P>
    <P>The NESC came up with a different attitude to designation.  They saw it as more flexible and not something permanent. One instance is the Ferenka factory in Limerick.  Designation was to be for a <Col N="309" /> short period and to give an impact to attack industry where there was a suddent major loss of industry.  One can see the philosophy of the NESC when they say that designation should be (a) in the smallest area possible and (b) only for a period of time.  They see it as a tool to be used where and when a major problem should arise.</P>
    <P>That is a different attitude than prevailed under the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, which established designated areas for the purpose of the IDA.  This is an independent report with more modern attitudes.  It does not see designated areas over a long period of time as being the most suitable IDA weapon.  The Minister considered the report and called for a further report from the Economic and Social Research Institute.  We should not be afraid in any legislation to provide a section that could take account of a more modern attitude to industrial development. It would be unwise for any Minister to change something that has been there traditionally without knowing that it is very sound footing and without taking the advice of independent consultants. That is nothing devious in this.  We have tried in the Bill to take a modern look at industry and at the weapons available to the IDA.  There have been a number of changes.</P>
    <P>In the last few years the IDA have gone into the regionalisation of small industrial boards.  They have taken on the industrial services sector.  These were innovative moves which were thought out by the IDA.  There is nothing wrong with taking an innovative look at designation.  The advice of consultants is that designation could be used more effectively in small areas and for short periods of time.  In other words, it is an intensive treatment mechanism.  I see that as a good thing. We should not be afraid to take different attitudes.</P>
    <P>The criteria suggested by the NESC are not bad ones.  They compare different areas of employment to the national average rate.  There are many other aspects to it: the growth in the labour force, the migration of people from one area to another, the sudden collapse of a major <Col N="310" /> industry and the availability or lack of availability of infrastructure.  These are all components which show whether or not an area is progressing well industrially. It would not be possible to inscribe all of the possibilities in a Bill.  The Minister should take the final decision but would be very unwise to do so without full consultation, as has been done in this case, with the independent research institutes.</P>
    <P>The Telesis report recommended a reduction in the rates of grant assistance. There is a feeling in Europe that the level of grant assistance is on the high side. We are recognised as being a developing country.  We have the highest rates of grants allowed under the age code for industry in the EC.  It would be a good idea to look at traditional mechanisms. We should not be afraid to change them where it is felt that there might be a better balance achieved and more progress made by using old weapons in a new way. That is what this is doing.</P>
    <P>The ESRI report has been received only in the last three weeks.  It will take quite a while for the Government to consider the matter.  There will not be any immediate moves made for some time.  It will give Ministers in the next Government, or in the next two or three Governments, the facilities to use the weapon of designation in a more specialised sense and to pick out growth centres or smaller areas that need intensive treatment over a short period of time.  I do not think there is anything negative, dangerous, devious or unwise in the provisions of section 4.  We have spoken about section 4 rather than about the amendment because they are intertwined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister accepts that what I wanted to elaborate on was the question of the designation of areas which is contained in section 4.  I agree with the Minister that the designation of areas is not the be-all and end-all of industrial development.  I am sure that the Department could indicate that where grant aid was increased from 40 per cent to 60 per cent in many designated areas it was not successful in encouraging <Col N="311" /> development in these areas.  It is useful as an encouraging factor to have industrialists visit an area which has the designated area status for the higher rate of grant and other criteria such as infrastructure, communications and industrial relations. As the Minister rightly indicated, with so many people unemployed, each Deputy in each constituency claims, with justification, that his area is the hardest hit.  This helps to highlight the situation in the industrial arena.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked of innovation and, of course, the whole purpose of the exercise is to create an innovative spirit.  I would be concerned about the urgency which exists in our country at this time for legislation such as this.  The Industrial Development Bill, 1985, is its title and we dealt with that in the first section. Because of the industrial situation and the number of jobs which have been lost in manufacturing and supporting industries each and every one of us with responsibility at whatever level would hope to see this Bill go through the Oireachtas to give encouragement to reversing the trend over a recent number of years of more and more job losses.  The workers involved in industry would be hoping, dare I say against hope, lest I dampen any enthusiasm there may be in the country for an Industrial Development Bill, for a situation where the downwards trend would be corrected.  That is why I put tremendous emphasis on the urgency which should be seen in our discussions and our passing of this piece of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether areas are designated or redesignated, in this debate and in the enactment of this piece of legislation we must give hope and encouragement to everybody involved in industry, manufacturing, services, and small businesses.  We want to include &mdash; and I certainly want to include &mdash; all strata of industry and not have any hang-ups or emphasis on any one particular sector because the entire industrial sector needs a boost at this time and an indication from us, the legislators, that by the production of this Bill and <Col N="312" /> its passing through the Oireachtas, we realise the industrial position we are in and see the need to give this encouragement and boost.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated in my previous contribution, designation and redesignation take in the entire country, north, south, east and west, urban and rural, village and city, town and country. The Minister referred to the White Paper.  In 1984 people waited with bated breath for a document which would lift morale and raise the spirit of industrial Ireland.</P>
    <P>To be quite honest, when the White Paper did appear in July 1984 it fell very far short of what all of us had hoped for. The principal let down in the White Paper is that it offered no hope of making any real impact on mass unemployment which stood at around 211,000.  With the publication of the White Paper hopes were definately raised.  Unemployment, which I quoted as having been 211,000 at that time, is now registered at well over 240,000.  We have mentioned emigration. With the White Paper, the introduction of this Bill and the ESRI reports, can we now put the whole thing together?  With that much information available to them and the availability of all the studies which have been done, can the Government now embark on a new, improved industrial policy which is so badly needed at this time?</P>
    <P>I want to be as hopeful as industry in general.  People seeking employment in industry are looking to this legislation for a real new beginning in addressing the problems which we have in creating an atmosphere conducive to the expansion of industry.  If we can achieve that through this Bill, then we will be doing something positive for industry, for the people who are prepared to invest in it, for the many thousands of people who have lost jobs and for the many thousands of young people who are at this time in a state of hopelessness about the future. Can we give them some hope, some standard, some criteria, something to hold on to and make it worth their while to achieve academic qualifications at <Col N="313" /> school?  This matter of industrial development and the creation of employment has to be seen in perspective.  Collectively we have a tremendous responsibility to all sectors of industry and to our young people seeking employment in their own country.  We are charged with that responsibility and we had better face up to that fact and ensure that this Bill will create an atmosphere for industrial expansion.  When published in 1984 the White Paper did not create that measure of confidence, nor did it inspire confidence in the industrial sector.</P>
    <P>There have been many studies carried out and a great deal of work done on this legislation over the past five years.  Much depends on this long awaited legislation and we must emphasise that there will not be any section, subsection, paragraph or line in this Bill which will inhibit industrial expansion.  Section 4 (3) reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by order terminate the designation of any area, or part thereof, as a designated area.</P>
    <P>That terminology at this particular time is dangerous because there may be a time in the future when areas would profit by designation for a higher rate of grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon, Sir, I may have been but I have come back to the section.  At another time the wording of that subsection might be acceptable but not at present.  Every area of the country, areas which show even the slightest trace of industrial potential, areas which suffered the loss of potential industries, areas that have the necessary labour force, infrastructure and so on need industrial expansion.  In my view it is negative to talk about terminating the designation of an area or even part thereof.  It would be better if we did not use such terminology at a time when we should be trying to encourage industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="314" /> I hope Members will make an effort to ensure that every section, subsection, paragraph and line of this Bill will encourage industrial development.  Not one word in this legislation should hinder or cast any doubt on industrial development because a great deal depends on passing legislation that will encourage positive thinking not just among legislators but outside this House where it matters.  That is why I am concerned to see a negative aspect in this subsection terminating designated areas without a criterion being outlined.  I would like the Minister to put on record the criteria by which the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may terminate by order the designation of any area, or part thereof, as a designated area.</P>
    <P>I agree that there are many other aspects of industrial development besides designated areas.  I can quote as an example an area in my constituency, Mayfield, which has a voting population of 17,000 &mdash; and the total population is even greater.  There are many towns in the country which do not have such a high population.  There is no industrial development in Mayfield, Cork city.  There are 33 people in industrial employment in that huge area.  There may be other areas where circumstances are similar but in Mayfield there is no industrial manufacturing industry and no industrial sites. This Bill should give areas like Mayfield some hope that industrial development will take place there in the future.  This Bill should be seen as a new and determined beginning based on experience and used efficiently to change the present position and to encourage the setting up of industries.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that designation is not the be-all and end-all of everything, and I agree, but the provision of the necessary labour force, good industrial relations, a proper communications network &mdash; roads and telecommunications &mdash; is very necessary.  If there are areas where industrial development is being hindered because of the lack of essential services, we should address ourselves to those problems.  We are doing nobody <Col N="315" /> any service by just mentioning the need for environment, industrial relations, labour force or communications.  If they are required in areas and they are not there, then we had better address ourselves to providing them.  That would be more positive than saying that we will terminate the designation of an area of part thereof.  I do not want to have an awful hang-up about the designation of areas, but I feel that an important aspect of encouraging industrial development is designation of an area for higher rate of grant.  I am concerned at the criteria by which the Minister may in consultation change the designation, terminate it or reduce it.</P>
    <P>Of course we may, as I hope, arrive at a situation where the designation of an area will help that area to take off and in time it may be so successful in industrial development that it will be able to stand on its own merits and development at the normal rate of grant without the extra amount of grant that follows designation. Such development being productive, well managed and so forth, many other areas of the country would require that assistance to help an operation at the start after it has taken off.</P>
    <P>I have said that in the future that section may be relevant.  At this time it is rather negative to have it there.  The Minister has said &mdash; I agree with him &mdash; that this industrial development legislation might just be around for a long time because in this Bill and even in this section we are referring to 1952, 1969 and so on.  That is why it is so important that every aspect of it should encourage a progressive attitude to industrial development. That is why I put down that amendment.  I thought it a little negative to be talking about de-designating areas or part of areas at this time.</P>

      <P>I can accept Deputy Lyon's reservations and it is proper that we have a full discussion about the matter here.  There have been two major publications on industrial policy in recent years.  The first was the Telesis report and the second was &ldquo;Industrial Policy&rdquo; which <Col N="316" /> was published in July 1984 by the then Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Bruton.  It was the Government's expression of industrial policy's direction and what it could achieve. It was an innovative policy.  It pointed to new directions and new attitudes and generally took a more modern view of industrial progress and the need for Government to take new views towards industrial progress.  I cannot agree with Deputy Lyons's comments on it but I understand why he made them. The industrial policy White Paper was a substantial input into the evolution of industrial policy.  A large part of that White Paper has been transplanted into legislative form in this Bill.  Other State agencies and Departments also have a responsibility here.  Córas Tráchtála, the IIRS, the Department of Communications, etc., all have a part to play in the comprehensive attitude to the development of our industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to confine myself to the amendment under consideration.  It is only an enabling amendment, nothing more.  I do not see it being used for quite some time because of the consideration that would have to be given by any Minister to the implications of a decision and need for consultation.  Undoubtedly the comments of the NESC fortify section 4 as it stands.  That independent recommendation that designation should be focused on a small area and for a specified period is an innovative approach to the designation weapon which we must take note of, and section 4 takes note of that approach.  I feel that the Deputy's concerns, though proper and well expressed and which I can understand fully, should not rule out the existence of this enabling section.  If an area now designated and having an employment rate below the national average suddenly for some reason or other attracted a major, huge industry and, of course, the supply industry and, therefore, the area and the people there prospered, taking into account that any Government have limited resources at their disposal, would <Col N="317" /> it be proper that that area, now very prosperous, should continue to be designated? Would it not be wiser for a Minister to say, &ldquo;You have done extremely well.  We cannot give the higher rates across to your area.  Other areas of the country need to be designated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and we wish to tell you to carry on, you are doing well, you are not going to be designated, we are going to move to some other county or area that needs to be designated&rdquo;?  That is all that is encompassed in this amendment. I think it reasonable.  It would not be possible to specify the terms, conditions and criteria to be used when one decides to designate or de-designate but it must remain for the Minister.  No Minister will put his neck on the block by saying that he is going to de-designate an area without the fullest consultation and with full argument for such de-designation. It is only an enabling Bill.  Even before the section was finally included the whole concept received very serious consideration.  The NESC report was important in that area.  The subsection will not be used in the very near future. It can be used only very wisely and after fullest consideration.</P>
      <P>I take the Deputy's concern.  I, and I think the Deputy, believe that this Bill will remain on the Statute Book for some time.  It is only enabling and reflects flexibility in the weapons and armoury of the Minister and of the IDA in relation to industrial progress.  It is only an enabling Bill.  Even before the section was included the whole concept got very serious consideration.  It will not be used in the very near future.  It will be used only after the fullest consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the point the Deputy is making. This Bill will remain on the Statute Book for some time.  It is only an enabling Bill and reflects the flexibility in the armoury of the Minister and of the IDA in relation to industrial progress.  No Minister would come into this House and lightly make an order to dedesignate an area.  It would <Col N="318" /> have immense implications for his party if he did the wrong thing.  One would need to have good justification for dedesignating any area.  I accept the Deputy's concern, but it would be a very unwise Minister who would move an order to dedesignate an area.  I assure the Deputy that this section is necessary but it will have to be used very wisely by any Minister and I do not think any Minister will be acting on it in the short term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I thoroughly agree with the Minister's last comment.  It would be the nearest thing to political suicide for any Minister to make an order to terminate the designation of an area.  He would need to have proof that by virtue of progress in the area, the designation was no longer necessary.  The political considerations would have to be taken into account.  That section deals with the termination of designation of any area or part thereof.  But in the broader context the Minister must accept that areas have gained because of political considerations. I do not hesitate to say that if we in the Cork region had a stronger political input in government, practically the whole of the city and county of Cork would be designated because of the way they have been decimated industrially. Political considerations will always be part of any Minister's decision on the designation or dedesignation of areas.</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 29, to delete all words after &ldquo;1986&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;and in any year thereafter, prepare a review of national industrial performance in respect of the previous year and shall cause the review, and the conclusions arising from such review, <Col N="320" /> to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a printing error in this amendment. The phrase &ldquo;in any year&rdquo; is incorrect and should read &ldquo;in every year&rdquo;.  The section provides that, every third year after the year 1986, a review of national industrial performance in respect of the previous three years should be prepared and the review and the conclusions arising from such a review should be laid before the House.  Preparation for this legislation and the reports and examinations have been going on for years.  Given the situation we are in at the moment, that timescale is unacceptably long.  I am suggesting that we have a report on industrial performance every year at least until such time as this country is restored to the level of industrial activity it had some years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe it is practical or useful to have a formal review of industrial performance on an annual basis at ministerial level.  It would not be possible to get the drift of domestic and international changes every year.  We have the annual industrial report of the IDA on an annual basis and that gives a very detailed and intimate assessment of the success or otherwise of industrial policy as seen by the IDA.  Córas Tráchtála Teoranta give an annual photograph of the industrial situation.  When one is looking for the pulse of industrial change one needs a period longer than a year to see such changes evolve and to see their effects.  A year is too short a time to do that, given that there already exists quite an amount of annual published accounts and commentaries on industrial policy. A ministerial report which will reach conclusions and is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas needs to have substance which would not be the case if it was done on an annual basis.  It would be possible to have a substantial review on a three year basis when the effects of policy could be seen and it would also be easier to see if changes were needed.  A three year period is short enough but it is necessary to achieve a clear vision of what is happening and what needs to be done to <Col N="321" /> rectify adverse movements.  It would also allow a Minister to review and reach conclusions on industrial policy and the fact that it would be debated in the House is constructive and good.</P>
      <P>We also have an annual debate on the Estimate for the Department which affords Deputies an opportunity to discuss annual problems arising in industrial policy.  However, we are talking about an important review of industrial policy and to do so on a three year basis would be more comprehensive, farreaching, meaningful and more relevant to the needs of the Minister, his Department and this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The section does not mention a review of policy annually; it says &ldquo;national industrial performance&rdquo;, which is quite different from policy, with hindsight, if we had had a performance report over the last number of years &mdash; go back as far as you like &mdash; we would have seen the lack of performance and would have been able to address any problems in that regard.  Instead, a White Paper was published in July 1984 and we had to wait until April 1986 for the Bill to give effect to the White Paper.  During that period the loss of employment and economic activity in the industrial area continued to take a downward turn and that is why there should be an annual industrial performance review.  The Minister said that we could discuss this in Estimates time but I am sure he will agree that the debate on the Estimates is not the best arena to address something as important as national industrial performance.  We know the structure: the Minister delivers a 40 page speech, the spokesperson for the Opposition replies in another long speech; other speakers in the restricted time available &mdash; probably on a Thursday when we finish at 5 p.m. &mdash; contribute to the debate and the Minister gets 15 minutes to reply.  This would not do full justice to industrial performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We appreciate that the State agencies provide us with annual reports and from studying those reports individually it is obvious that there should be a forum for <Col N="322" /> discussing them collectively at a time to be allocated in this House.  We should discuss the relevancy and effectiveness of the reports of the State agencies in so far as industrial development is concerned. Despite what the Minister said, I still think that a three year period is too long in which to review industrial performance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>A three year review of national industrial performance is an improvement on the present position where no review is specifically devoted to national performance.  Policy would be affected by the conclusions reached as a result of this report and obviously the Minister will reach conclusions.  Action will be taken on various aspects of industrial policy.  I disagree with the Deputy when he says there is a need for an annual report, because that would not give sufficient time to come to major policy conclusions. We need to see the drift of the economy and what is happening outside the economy.  However, there is a need for a mechanism which would enable us to see what is happening annually in the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the budget debate is the right time to discuss industrial policy, as the budget is the most important financial instrument which comes before the House annually.  There could be other mechanisms also, including the Estimate of the Department, which is an annual review of industrial policy and performance. There are also other parliamentary occasions on which this matter could be discussed &mdash; Question Time, a question on the Adjournment and in debates on sectoral interests involving industrial policy.  There are many reports published outside the House every year on industrial performance which would enable a Minister to keep up with events.  The CII produce occasional publications which would keep everybody on their toes.  The FUE also bring out publications regarding sectoral interests.  There are also international comments on the economy from the OECD and the EC.  There are many mechanisms whereby people can <Col N="323" /> be kept fully informed of what is going on.</P>
    <P>I do not see any difficulty in this area. What is intended is a more important global review of performance upon which one could reach policy conclusions that may require legislative or other action. One can only reach a conclusion based on performance over a period because annually one sees shifts and movements. Over a three year period one has a better opportunity to get an overall view of drifts in economic and industrial policy and performance.  That is the type of review that is intended.  It will be a major review that will lead to policy decisions and I do not think we could do that on an annual basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's thinking on this because there may be many reports emanating from different bodies in the course of a year.  However, the timescale allowed to put them together so that a conclusion can be formed is rather restrictive bearing in mind that time has to be allowed for the Houses of the Oireachtas to debate them. Will the Minister consider getting his Department to publish on an annual basis a conclusion or an analysis of the annual reports of the various State and semi-State agencies involved in industry and commerce as well as reports issued by the OECD, the IIRS and so on?  The Department should issue a report based on the conclusions and the performances of the bodies I have mentioned.  We should get an annual report from the Department on the performance of industry countrywide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because of past experiences, and the changing pattern in industry and technology, that I wonder if there is a danger of us losing out further in our efforts to keep abreast of changes because it will take three years to review our performance. I accept, as the Minister said, that it is open to us to raise questions in the House but the matter is of such national importance that we should have an annual analysis of the reports of the various agencies.  We should be given the <Col N="324" /> observations of various commentators such as the Governor of the Central Bank and so on.  They are relevant to industrial promotion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bear in mind what the Deputy has said.  Any publication of importance, whether it is issued by the OECD, the CII or NESC, is considered in my Department.  Quite often we have responded in public to suggestions in such reports.  They are all part of the work reviewed in the Department and brought to the attention of the Minister.  We respond to such reports because we recognise their importance.  Where necessary we take action.  What is proposed in the section will mean that the views expressed in the annual reports will be taken on board and effective action will be taken at the policy end.  There is adequate response by Ministers, in the House and outside, to reports on economic policy and industrial performance. I am not aware of any Minister who has not been kept well informed and reacted in a positive sense to suggestions about changes on the industrial scene. We have always been kept on our toes by the Opposition and outside interests and that is the way it should be.  I should like to assure the Deputy that we react very quickly to any changes on the industrial scene in the best interest of industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 8, lines 11 to 13, to delete subsection (3) and insert the following: &ldquo;(3) The terms and conditions of <Col N="325" /> every delegation made by the Authority under subsection (2) or under section 4 of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Act, 1970, as amended by section 6 of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Act, 1983, and by section 9 of and the Fourth Schedule to this Act shall be subject to the approval of the Minister.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment designed to make delegation by the Authority of their grant-making powers to Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited, subject to the approval of the Minister. Section 4 of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Act, 1970, as amended by section 6 of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Act, 1983, does not make explicit provision for ministerial approval of the powers delegated to the company by the Authority.  The amendments will make such delegations subject to the same approval procedure as would apply to the delegations made by the Authority to boards and committees constituted by them.  Amendment No. 7 is a drafting amendment consequential on amendment No. 6 which provided for the approval of the Minister of delegations of grant-making powers to Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any objection to the amendments because they do not change the section greatly from what is in the Bill.  I should like to make an observation about the success that has been achieved in the area under discussion. Would the Minister not consider giving statutory authority to other regions, any or all of them &mdash; the south-west, north-west, north-east, south-east, the midlands and so on?  It is time that the success of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company in the mid-west region was used as a criterion for similar much needed development in other <Col N="326" /> regions.  In saying that I am acknowledging the success that has been achieved in that region.  We should examine all of the other regions with the same objective in view.  For example, I am sure the Minister would like to do something for the south-east region.  I should like to see consideration given to the south-west where one step has been taken in the right direction by way of the legislation enacted for the establishment of the free port area at Ringaskiddy.  In the light of the success achieved in the mid-west region, perhaps the Minister, his Department and the Government would give consideration to the establishment of similar statutory authorities in other regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have done this to a large extent by devolving full responsibility for the decision-making process in relation to small industry to the regional development offices.  We have established regional development boards in all the regional areas of the IDA.  I think that is what the Deputy has been advocating. In relation to industrial policy, the grant-making process, we do not need new legislative measures.  The IDA have been empowered to do so and the Minister's approval has been forthcoming for the delegated responsibility in relation to small industries to these regional small industry boards.  Therefore it has already been done; the regional small industry boards have been established.  For example, there is one in Cork and one in Waterford, which are fully operational and where the initial response has been most encouraging.  Indeed a number of approvals for small industries have been granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously that has been an effective weapon employed by the IDA.  It renders it easier for industrialists to go to the IDA locally with problems.  In addition there is the one-stop shop which has also been created, where there is a mixture of State agencies all housed in the one building, for example, CTT, the IIRS, IDA and so on, where an industrialist can feel close to the people with whom he is negotiating and have all of his problems analysed and <Col N="327" /> resolved within the one building.  That is a very innovative move and is a reflection of Government thinking in relation to the whole of industrial policy.  Therefore we do not need a new legislative body.  We have been able to establish the small industries boards under existing legislation. We are here allowing the Minister to sanction the delegation of IDA responsibility to the various committees. For the information of the House, there are the executive board, the enterprise development committee, the small industries committee, the international services committee, the domestic industry committee, the overseas industries committee and the regional small industries boards.  This is in order to render the work of the IDA more professional and make their task easier.  What has been done has been innovative and progressive and I do not anticipate any other moves to be necessary at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the establishment of the regional boards by the IDA constituted a step in the right direction.  However, the effectiveness of the regional development boards &mdash; take as an example the south-west regional board &mdash; to date has been marginal only with regard to the standard and volume of development required.  In this respect they have a huge task on hand.  For example, the regional development board undertook an immense task in the south-west area.  I compliment them on the measure of success they have achieved to date but it is marginal only in the context of the huge need obtaining in that area.  Indeed the experience gained by the mid-west region should at least be considered, with a possible extension to other areas needing a boost by way of industrial development.  I am not saying that the regional boards, as established, are incapable of achieving what is required but we will have to give them more legislative authority to strengthen their hand.  The Minister may say how successful boards have been in other areas.  My experience of the south-west region &mdash; the one in respect of which I <Col N="328" /> am best qualified to speak &mdash; has been that their success to date has been marginal only in the context of the task facing them.</P>
      <P>What I am advocating, leading on from the success of the mid-west region, is that we should extend those facilities to those other areas that have suffered so badly, industrially in recent times.  An area such as the south-west should be given the required power, functions, statutory authority of a regional board, if necessary calling it the south-west regional development board.  There is such a board there already.  Perhaps they should be given statutory power so that they can address themselves in a more meaningful way to the industrial situation obtaining there. If there are other regions requiring the same encouragement to reverse the trend of failing industries, they should be given an opportunity to do so through this Bill. Then we would be able to get off with our industrial development plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to be suggesting that some IDA statutory powers in relation to large industries, such as international servicing, would be delegated to regions, <i>per se</i>, with full autonomy.  That is not necessary and it would not be wise.  The IDA are charged with the administration of Government policy on Industrial development.  They have a substantial corps of experts not only in Dublin but in their regional offices.  I do not believe it would benefit regional development should any particular region be delegated with responsibilities now in the IDA.  It would lead to regional imbalance.  If all the regions were to have such functions there would be a serious duplication of manpower and resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA are charged with the regional development of the country as a whole and they must ensure that there is a balance in regional development and industrial policy.  The present structures are necessary and sound.  In relation to small industries, decision making has been delegated to regional boards.  The IDA are responsible overall because they must ensure regional balance.  The regional <Col N="329" /> small industry boards have a mechanism which tries to ensure that the boards will have their problems dealt with under one roof, so to speak, so that final decisions will be made locally.</P>
    <P>That is as far as I would like to see devolution of responsibility going.  To suggest that one area, the south-west, should have major responsibility delegated to it does not meet with my agreement because it could be damaging to the national interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not indicate or insinuate or attempt to suggest that total responsibility of the IDA would be spread throughout the regions.  I accept that the IDA are charged with overall responsibility for national industrial development.  I was emphasising that the regional development boards are being given certain responsibilities in regard to small industries, and I did not suggest it should be otherwise, but present legislation inhibits their efforts to be as effective throughout the regions as they would wish.  That effectiveness should not be constrained in any way.</P>
      <P>That is not to suggest that these boards, locally, should take over responsibilities with which the IDA are charged overall. My concern is that the regional boards would not be restricted in any way by any overseeing activity of the IDA.  I doubt very much if the IDA would inhibit any of the regions.  Neither am I saying that the regional boards should be given, or that they would look for, responsibilities proper to the IDA.  However, every consideration should be given to the regional boards to expand, subject to their terms of reference.  If the experience of success in the mid-west could be applied to other regions which need development, we should try to achieve that.</P>

      <P>I have not heard any complaints about the work of the small industrial boards.  I am aware of their composition: they are well balanced as between the IDA, local interests, industrialists and other State agencies such as CTT.  They are not inhibited by the IDA <Col N="330" /> and they have specific responsibility delegated to them by the IDA.  In time we hope they will be very successful.  I can assure the Deputy that any complaints received in the Department will be investigated immediately.  The IDA are throwing their weight behind their efforts in order to ensure success.  They have been welcomed and have been a success.  Local people like the idea of going to a local officer to have all their problems resolved. Given a proper chance, they will be very effective.  They need time.  I do not agree that they have only a marginal influence. My information is that the numbers of inquiries and of projects are on the increase.  This has been an electric shock which has been administered rather successfully. This would be an ideal subject for comment during the three yearly review mentioned earlier.  I assure the Deputy that if any complaints come to him or any other Member of the House they will be examined fully.  My understanding is that they are working well and have the full support of the IDA and the people involved locally.</P>

      <P>In page 8, lines 31 to 35, to delete subsection (2), and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) A directive under subsection (1) shall not apply to any individual industrial undertaking or to giving preference to one area over others in regard to the location of an industrial undertaking.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> The experience in relation to the Hyster plant in Limerick was sufficient to prompt me to put forward this amendment.  The IDA specialists had completed an agreement with that company and, as far as my information goes, the Minister was also in agreement with those proposals, but the Government scuttled them.  In this section the Minister is reserving the right, to put it very simply, to move the goalposts and he is setting down a restrictive criterion for the Industrial Development Authority.  The sad experience of Hyster is typical of what happened and may happen again unless we ensure that there are provisions to guard against the loss of an industrial plant.  I said at the time that the decision in that case was disgraceful.  I hope that situation will not arise again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Hyster plant I disagree vehemently with the Deputy.  The Industrial Development Authority have a serious responsibility to ensure that the terms associated with any application for an industrial grant are reasonable, are a good deal for the country and have the prospect of being permanent. The Government and the IDA were completely aware of the Hyster package and were insisting on more suitable arrangements, which reflects the degree of responsibility shown with regard to industrial promotion.  I do not wish to say more about that at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Deputy's amendment, in effect it proposes to delete the last two lines of subsection (2).  This provides that the Minister may not give a directive in regard to IDA industrial location policy, otherwise than as part of a general review of the industrial policy for the country as a whole.  This section specifically excludes the Minister from giving directives in relation to any one project.  It would be disgraceful if legislation did otherwise.  It would be unwise if any Minister were put in that position. Great care has been taken in the drafting <Col N="332" /> of this section to put adequate safeguards in place with regard to the use of directives. For this reason directives are limited to policy issues which must have regard to the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>Such directives must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and be the subject of full and open scrutiny.  The directives shall not apply to any individual industrial undertaking.  That covers the point the Deputy was trying to make, although in a completely different manner.  Directives in relation to industrial location policy can be made only in the context of a general review of industrial policy, which review must be referred to in the directive.  There are very important and desirable safeguards in this section which the Deputy's amendment could weaken.  Accordingly I cannot accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not arise.  It is a matter for the board of Aer Lingus and the board of Aer Rianta to make prudent commercial decisions.  That is what we appoint them for and it is the consistent policy which I have followed with all the State companies under my aegis since I became Minister, with very beneficial effects, as I have said repeatedly in this House.  There is no question of any State company being forced to participate in a scheme which they do not think is commercially prudent.  In this case the board of Aer Rianta believe that this is not only commercially prudent but that commercially it is potentially a very advantageous scheme.  It will be a preliminary pilot scheme this year if it goes ahead.  Decisions as to the continuation of this scheme in the future will be based on the success of the scheme this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be wrong to go into that in any great detail.  The views of Aer Lingus have been very clearly <Col N="335" /> expressed in respect of some aspects of pre-clearance.  It is a matter for Aer Lingus to decide whether they should participate.  I should say in fairness that the difficulties Aer Lingus would see with pre-clearance would be mainly in the area of customs pre-clearance which would delay flights, whereas immigration pre-clearance should not have that effect.  It would be a matter for Aer Lingus to decide whether to participate in the immigration pre-clearance arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is asking whether any other country has approached Ireland, the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. We will be the first country in Europe to have pre-clearance arrangements with the US, provided the arrangements are finalised, as I hope they will be.  That should give added advantage to Shannon which has been doing extremely well since 1982.  This will give an added boost with great potential for the future, if it works in the way I think it could.</P>

They are the only other countries which have pre-clearance arrangements.  It will be a very significant achievement for Ireland to get in ahead of anybody else for pre-clearance. The hope is that it will increase the <Col N="336" /> number of technical and refuelling stops, with obvious advantages for Shannon.</P>

I am at present awaiting a revised proposal from CIE in the matter following a civil engineering study which the board have in hand, the results of which will be important from the point of view of establishing costs.  The results of hydrographic surveys to be carried out by the Office of Public Works may also have an important bearing on the conclusions to be reached.

They got grants towards providing ferries, terminals, air strips and so on.

I put it to the Minister that the Highlands and Islands Board in Scotland got several million pounds from the EC in the last number of years for schemes such as this.  Has the Minister made any proposals to the EC for funding this scheme?  If not, the Minister has wasted valuable time and has ensured that funds will not be available from the EC in the foreseeable future for this urgent purpose. The islanders are very dissatisfied with the proposals of CIE and with the delays which have been caused apparently by CIE.

      <P>Is ceist é sa chéad dul síos do Radio Telefís Éireann seirbhísí teilifíse a sholáthar faoi na hAchtanna um Údarás Craolacháin.  Níl sé i gceist faoi láthair seirbhís teilifíse Gaeltachta a bhunú áfach.</P>
      <P>Ag an am gcéanna, i ngeall ar thábhacht na Gaeilge, is mian leis an Rialtas go mbeadh freastal cóir á dhéanamh ag an tseirbhís náisiúnta theilifíse ar dhaoine ar mian leo an Ghaeilge a úsáid mar theanga thábhachtach in a saol laethúil, sa tír go léir.  Tá socraithe ag Aire na Gaeltachta, in éineacht liom féin, grúpa oibre a thabhairt le chéile chun féachaint conas is féidir lántairbhe a bhaint as an meán teilifíse i gcothú na teanga agus chun freastal orthu-san a roghnaíonn an Ghaeilge mar phríomh theanga nó mar theanga bhunúsach ina saol laethúil.  Tá ionadaithe ó Roinn na Gaeltachta, An Roinn Cumarsáide, Bord na Gaeilge agus RTE ar an ghrúpa oibre seo agus tá súil agam go mbeidh moltaí ar fáil faoi dheireadh na bliana.</P>

Níl aon chláir Ghaeilge mórán ar RTE i láthair na huaire agus, agus dá bhrí sin, tá géar-ghá le stáisiún faoi leith a chur ar fáil leis an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn chomh tréan agus is féidir, mar tá go leor brú ar Ghaelgeoirí agus níl go leor Gaeilge le cloisteáil ar RTÉ agus, dá bhrí sin, tá gá le stáisiún den chineál seo.</P>

      <P>Táimse féin anmhí-shásta agus is dóigh liom go bhfuil na Teachtaí eile an-mhíshásta faoin bhfreagra a thug an tAire á rá anois i 1986 go bhfuil sé ag cur coiste eile ar bun chun a fháil amach cén slí is fearr do RTÉ Gaeilge a chur ar na cláir.  Sin é an rud atá á rá ag an Aire, grúpa nua.  Anois, ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Aire: cad faoi na moltá a rinne Bord na Gaeilge roinnt bhliain ó shin agus na moltaí a bhí ag Comhairle RTÉ féin faoi chúrsaí Gaeilge ar a gcuid clár?  Dúbhradar an uair sin &mdash; sin 6 nó 7 mbliain ó shin &mdash; go raibh sé i gceist acu aonad teilifíse a shuíomh in aice le ceantar Gaeltachta amháin.  Tá an tAire ag rá anois go bhfuil sé sin le deánamh acu go fóill nuair a bhéas an t-airgead acu.  Bhí dhá mholtaí ag Bord na Gaeilge, an uair sin, gur cóir faoi 1983 go mbeadh clár substaintiúil amháin i nGaeilge gach oíche &mdash; do dhaoine fásta, ceann amháin, agus an dara ceann, réim chuimsitheach clár do pháistí agus do dhéagóirí a bheith ar fáil go coitianta. Leagadh sin síos mar aidhm i gcóir 1983.  Anois 1986 agus tá an tAire ag rá go bhfuil sé ag cur coiste éigin eile ar bun. Cad a rinneadh i rith na mblianta sin?</P>

Ba mhaith liomsa agus leis an Rialtas go mbeadh freastal ceart á dhéanamh dóibh siúd go léir sa tír gur mian leo an Ghaeilge a úsáid mar phríomh-theanga nó teanga thábhachtach ina saol.

Caithfimid a bheith <Col N="344" /> réalaíoch freisin.  Tá seirbhísí teilifíse an-chostasach.  Mar shampla, chosnaigh an córas atá curtha in áirithe do RTÉ a Dó suas le £20 milliún.

Ag an am sin, an n-aontódh an tAire, go raibh sé i gceist go mbainfí úsáid as an Tarna Bealach chun níos mó clár i nGaeilge a chur amach ach nach ndearnadh e sin agus gur Béarla ar fad beagnach atá ag teacht ó Theilifís a Dó?  An n-aontódh an tAire chomh maith nach é moltaí a theastaíonn ag an bpointe seo tar éis na blianta caite ag labhairt faoi seo, ach cláir i nGaeilge?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications the profits on CIE sundries, traffic and freight services to January 1986 in the context of paragraph 3.43 of <i>Building on Realtiy, 1985-87.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE's road freight services in 1984 showed a profit of £41,000. While the audited accounts for 1985 are not yet available I expect a considerable improvement in the financial performance of this service in 1985 compared to 1984.</P>
      <P>Separate working accounts for rail sundries traffic are not contained in the CIE Annual Report and Accounts.  My Department are assessing the financial performance of this service in 1984 and 1985 in consultation with CIE in the context of <i>Building on Reality.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that <Col N="347" /> separate accounts are not available.  How then can the management of CIE decide if the service is profitable or not?  According to paragraph 3.43 of <i>Building on Reality</i>, CIE rail sundries traffic and road freight services will be discontinued from January 1986 unless they are shown to be profitable in 1984-85.  If the accounts are not shown separately, how will anybody, management or Minister, know if the service is profitable or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Work in this area is being done in my Department and in CIE and preliminary indications are clear that there has been a very substantial improvement in the road freight performance and the future is secure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister like to comment on representations I received from private licensed hauliers indicating that CIE freight service are using their subsidised position to compete unfairly for ordinary business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>These types of assertions are frequently made but it must be remembered that the people making them are not always objective, impartial commentators.  There is a difficulty in trying to judge what is fair competition. There are a large number of people on the road passenger and freight sides who want the profitable business, but very few want to take on the unprofitable business. There is a statutory responsibility on CIE to provide certain basic services.  If they are expected to provide these unprofitable services, they have to be allowed a substantial part of the profitable service to offset those costs.  We hear a lot of talk about private operators in this or that area and the unfair advantage CIE have, but nobody talks about the disadvantages CIE face.  I am in favour of encouraging increased competition, but it must be fair competition and none of the relevant factors must be ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the people who wrote to me are fully licensed, legitimate traders, taxpayers, VAT payers and so on?  Could he say <Col N="348" /> how much, if any, of the subsidy CIE receive from this House is applied to that area of CIE's activities?  This is the nub of the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Under EC rules we are not permitted to subsidise road freight services.  As a former Minister for Transport, Deputy Wilson will understand that there are grey areas where rail freight interlinks with road freight and there are shared overheads.  As I said, in relation to road freight there is no subsidy and the question of whether there are undue overheads on the rail side is being examined. I want to make it clear that what I said earlier was not meant to reflect on members of the Irish professional and legal road haulage industry because in my experience they are very fine and reputable people.  The point I was making is that because a case is made by them it should not be taken as being absolutely objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that a decision has been taken to continue with that service?  In other words, in accordance with paragraph 3.43 of <i>Building on Reality</i> has a decision been taken to continue with that service on the basis that it is profit making?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>No decision has been taken but I am optimistic that the requirements of <i>Building on Reality</i> will be met in relation to freight services provided by CIE.  I want to take this opportunity to record my appreciation for what has been achieved by CIE in the past three years. CIE's deficit declined in 1983 and 1984 and when the accounts for 1985 are published we will see a further substantial decline in the deficit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that in certain circumstances we could, but my approach to RTE and to all State companies for which I am responsible is to put them on a proper commercial footing.  As a result, we have made certain decisions. For instance, this year we have allowed RTE to extend radio advertising to Sundays, and we have increased the licence fee by £5, £2 above the rate of inflation, in order to help them put their finances in order and to put them on a sound financial footing for the future.  This has been necessary because of neglect over the past number of years.  I hope whichever Government are in power in future will approach not only the finances of RTE but the finances of all State companies in a commercial way.</P>

      <P>In south Tipperary a licence has been issued for the provision of cable television in Clonmel.  Letters of intent in respect of Cahir, Cashel and Tipperary have been issued and on the fulfilment of certain conditions the licences will be issued.  The companies indicate that they intend to cable these areas during the course of 1986.  The existence of illegal rebroadcasting systems in these areas is impeding progress with the legal systems.</P>
      <P>An expression of interest in obtaining cable television service has been received from Carrick-on-Suir Urban District Council.  The question of holding an open competition for a franchise for this town and any other town where interest is expressed will be considered in the light of progress with the existing cabling programme.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister given consideration to the use of much more modern methods than, say, cable television in bringing multichannel television to all our people in town and country, such as satellite and the like?  Will he not agree that the cable television system which we are now relying on is fast becoming obsolete and is likely to be overtaken by the more modern methods to which I have referred?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Treacy's question is not as simple as it first appears. Some other countries, notably France and the FDR, are diverting quite substantial resources through extending their <Col N="352" /> cable systems because they see that this has great potential for the future in delivering all sorts of services to different parts of the country.  Therefore, it is not right to say that cable systems are being overtaken.  There are very many questions here and I am studying many aspects of the problem at the moment and I hope to come to some conclusions on them in, I hope, the next couple of months.  We must make up our minds.</P>
      <P>The question of the direct broadcasting satellite is coming up for final decision later this year.  We have the question of low powered satellite services which are already available in the sky.  We have the question of whether and in what context we allow receiving dishes.  We must decide, therefore, what services we allow cable systems to carry.  Over and above all those questions is the question of illegal rebroadcasting and the usurpation of the frequency spectrum which is potentially very serious for the future, apart from the threat it is to legally franchised cable systems.  There are many very difficult questions here, and technology is developing all the time.  However, I assure the House that it can expect decisions in the next couple of months on the sort of extra satellite services cable systems may carry and on some related matters.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree further that it would help to accelerate the provision of multicable television in my constituency if we were to have regard to the desire of local traders who feel competent in this area to carry out the work rather than allowing it to companies who would seem to be overburdened with work in my county and other counties?  It would do much to extend it into the areas I am concerned with if the local traders with whom I am sure he is conversant were given an opportunity to do this work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I know at least one case in which Deputy Treacy was interested where that was not possible even though I was prepared to favour it.  He has a considerable point in saying that certain contractors seem to have quite a number of franchises, but very often the choice left to be decided on by me and my predecessor was whether to allow services in the first place if only one qualified contractor was left after all technical and other considerations were taken into account.  That is the major reason why one contractor seems to have quite a number of franchises across that part of the country and the surrounding areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have certain powers under existing broadcasting legislation, and I have responsibilities under that legislation as I have responsibilities under international treaties and law.  Certain aspects of this do not come under my control.  However, it seems inevitable that low powered satellite services already in existence should be allowed in some form on cable systems in the near future.  We have a number of questions to decide.  Most of our cable systems are very nearly fully used because they are carrying six services.  Some of them have one or two extra channels left and not much beyond that, so we must decide how those extra channels on those old cable systems are used to the maximum advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other questions are involved including questions of public order and morality which cannot be ignored.  They are not terribly big problems but they are there and in deciding a regime for satellite services we have to bear those in mind.  We must bear in mind also the effects these <Col N="354" /> may have on existing television services and on the advertising pool which is available generally for newspapers as well as everything else.  Therefore, there are a number of factors all of which are being taken into account in coming to our decision.</P>
    <P>Another point which arises here is the question of to what extent, if any, we should encourage and allow a certain input of local television in these areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

      <P>Yes.

      <P>There are four principal towns in the Deputy's constituency, Tipperary, Cashel, Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir and it also includes Golden, Fethard, Killenaule, Ardfinnan and Clogheen.  The precise position is that a cable television licence for Clonmel issued to Suir-Nore relays in August 1985 and a 17 kilometre trunk cable route has been laid from the head end to the town and work can now commence on putting the distribution cable to serve households. The company have indicated that they expect the Department to take effective action against illegal broadcasting in the area before they can continue with their plans to cable locally.  This problem has arisen in a number of areas and it is very difficult to cope with.  The company are hampered in their efforts to provide a cable service to Cahir and Cashel for which letters of intent issued in July 1984. In addition, a letter of intent for Tipperary town has been issued and they stated that the provision of service to this area has been held up for the same reason. Nevertheless, it is planned to cable Tipperary town, Cahir and Cashel during 1986 after Clonmel has been completed. No recent interest has been expressed by any local party to provide a cable television service for Carrick-on-Suir, although an inquiry was received in November 1984 from a firm of accountants on behalf of an unnamed client. They were told that we were unlikely to be in a position to hold a competition until the then current programme of competitions had been completed and no interest has been expressed since then. However, recently the urban district council wrote to me asking how one goes about receiving a licence for a widely desired cable system and we are in correspondence with them on that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Cork deepwater berth received grants already and indeed they will total almost £26 million by the end of this year.  These grants have been paid out mostly in the last three years.  We have made a huge investment in Cork Harbour but it is not policy to provide grants for things like cranes.  It is not just a matter of looking at Cork Harbour in isolation, every other port would then have a reasonable expectation of grants for such equipment.  We did not do this in the past and will not do so now, and it is now up to Cork Harbour to make the berth work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me remind the Minister that the work was shelved on a number of occasions and indeed ceased at times. Indeed, on one of these occasions a Cork Minister was in office.  A sum of £26 million of taxpayers' money has been expended, but the Minister is now saying that there is no money for equipment. The position is very unsatisfactory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very unsatisfactory that projects of this sort should be promoted and developed and that the developers should then be unable to find the resources to buy cranes.  If that is their argument they are arguing against the project in the first place.  We have been more than generous in this case.  I hope the berth will be an addition to the infrastructure in Cork, but it is now up to the Cork Harbour Commissioners to make it work.  I will ensure that the system is not milked.</P>

      <P>People would be well advised not to purchase receiving dishes for a number of reasons.  It is almost certain that local powered satellite services which are available and will become available in due course will not be receivable by these dishes unless decoding plant is rented with such dishes.  People would be ill advised until this position is clarified to purchase such dishes.  Secondly, it is not clear that such dishes will be usable when the direct broadcasting satellite comes about.  It will depend on the form direct broadcasting systems take.  It is my intention to make decisions on these matters in the near future.

Does the Minister regard this as an important acquisition for Irish interests, whether public or private, in <Col N="362" /> the light of the fact that for most of the time it has been in profit, that that area is becoming increasingly important from the traffic and transport aspects and that a channel tunnel is being established that will pull traffic in the general direction of the south of England?

      <P>A recent intermittent fault on the main VHF radio communications system at Dublin Airport has been corrected.  The stand-by and reserve radio systems were available at all times. A defective part in one of the radars will be replaced this week.  The second radar has been continuously available for operational duty.</P>
      <P>While one of the two non-directional beacons has been unavailable on a number of occasions, the second has been virtually continuously in service.  The VHF omnidirectional Radio Range (VOR) and the Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) have been operationally available at almost 97 per cent of the time since 1 January last.

I want to tell the House that there is a very substantial ongoing investment &mdash; over the past couple of years, continuing this year into next year &mdash; providing new instruments, landing systems, new radar facilities and new voice communications and back-up systems.

They are being further improved, so much so that by the time the full investment programme has been completed next year, we will have communications systems etc. of which we can be very proud, indeed, and which certainly will be as good, if not better than, those obtaining in all other airports in Europe of a similar size.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, absolutely not. The position is, and it is worth repeating to the House, that for 15 years CIE's deficit escalated by a multiple of a very high inflation rate.  For example, it went up from £3 million in 1969 to £109 million in 1982.  That was more than seven times the rate of inflation in that period, a period of very high inflation.  Since 1982, because of the policies we have pursued the deficit has fallen in real terms each year, in 1983, 1984 and 1985, and when the accounts for last year are published in the very near future, we will see a further very substantial improvement, indeed the best year that CIE have had for many years past.  This has been brought about by new financial policies and the strengthening of the board of management.</P>
      <P>The reorganisation of CIE is the final step in this reorganisation, to break down CIE into more manageable units, with more vibrant management closer to the scene of operation.  That is the idea, to create a new environment and a better service to the public at a cheaper price and is the direction in which we are moving.  I want to say again how much I appreciate the efforts made by all in CIE, particularly those in the Dublin bus services in respect of which 1985 was the first year ever that not one manday was lost due to a strike, with the consequences that passenger numbers are beginning to increase.</P>

      <P>I was astonished to learn that this Private Notice Question was disallowed on the grounds of lack of urgency especially having regard to the fact that the factory has been closed since July 1985, that an owner has been appointed by the receiver, and also the fact that the factory is now occupied by workers who have no intention of leaving until this tannery is reopened.</P>
      <P>In the light of all these factors and the serious turn of events to which I have now adverted&mdash; and referred to in our daily papers &mdash; would the Chair reconsider the matter?

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> In page 9, subsection (1) (b), line 2, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or any repealed enactment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The amendment is necessary to put beyond doubt that the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance may make grants to the authority to enable them to fulfil their obligations and liabilities in respect of grant approvals and commitments given under the repealed enactments.  Section 2 of the Bill defines &ldquo;repealed enactment&rdquo; as an enactment repealed by this Act as set out in Schedule 4.  It is to make doubly sure that obligations and liabilities of the IDA under previous Acts will stand under this Act. It is a consolidating Bill and we are taking the opportunity of repealing some previous legislation.  This amendment is simply to ensure that there is no ambiguity about the fact that liabilities and obligations entered into by the authority under previous legislation would be met by this Act.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to set a maximum limit on the exposure of the authority in respect of loan guarantees in any foreign currency under section 24 &mdash; fixed assets; section 26&mdash; enterprise development; and section 27 &mdash; restructuring of the Bill.  The affect of the amendment will be to limit the maximum extent of the authority's liability in respect of a loan guarantee in a foreign currency to the equivalent in Irish pounds at the time of the giving of the guarantee. In essence the new provision protects the IDA from any unfavourable exchange rate losses.  At the same time it allows the authority to benefit from the strengthening of the Irish pound <i>vis-á-vis</i> a currency in which the loan is being nominated.  It is a prudent international currency mechanism which protects the <Col N="387" /> authority from adverse movements in currency rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to substitute the words &ldquo;taken as&rdquo; by the words &ldquo;no greater than&rdquo;.  In the light of present activities on the foreign exchange and the uncertainty of the value of currency is that what prompted this change of wording? If so, how would it apply in years to come when international currency might be more stable than it is at the moment? If the answer to the first question is in the negative then the latter one does not apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not arise because of the recent realignment of the currencies within the EMS and the fact that the Bill was published before this arose. There are general currency movements every day.  We have a mechanism in the Bill to ensure that we give out so many IR£.  In doing so the expenditure commitment will not be diluted from the point of view of the Irish taxpayers.  It is simply to ensure that we will not suffer currency exchange loss on the money we give out.</P>

      <P>It seems extraordinary that the parlimentary draftsmen who prepared this Bill a short time ago found it necessary to make so many amendments and this one in particular.  Was the restructuring of subsection (4) relevant to the timing?  Otherwise, why was it necessary to make this change when it was not seen to be necessary when the Bill was being drafted a short time ago? To substitute the words &ldquo;no greater than&rdquo; for &ldquo;taken as&rdquo; might seem a very small change but why was that not done when the Bill was being drafted?</P>

      <P>The Industrial Development Bill, 1985, repeals and re-enacts with amendments the industrial development legislation specified in Schedule 4 to this Bill.  In understanding these repeals the authority will have outstanding obligations and commitments in respect of grant approvals or contracts entered into on foot of the repeal legislation.  The authority have the legal power to fulfil such obligations and commitments but no provision is made in the Bill as drafted to include payments made by the authority in respect of the commitments made under a repealed enactment within the financial limits set in the IDA aggregate capital expenditure.  The amendment set out above remedies this deficiency and provides for the inclusion of payments made on foot of repeal enactments within the aggregate limit on the IDA's capital expenditure.  This is to make quite clear that whatever obligations have been entered into by the IDA under repeal statutes will be met under this statute.</P>

      <P>I take it it would be proper to say that it is important to relate any expenditure the Authority undertake to their overall philosophy.  In other words, they could hardly build a factory and hand it over to a non-economic undertaking that does not fall within their remit.  It is merely referring expenditure to sections 20, 21 and 25 which set out the criteria for grant aid.  It must be within the ambit of the Authority in order to spend the money.</P>

My understanding is that there are certain provisions which had been previously consolidated, that there was nothing new in the provisions.

      <P>That is the part which worries me.  This may well bring in some rigid restrictions in an area where they did not apply before and may well be detrimental, especially to the provision of industrial projects.  I am speaking of projects in very isolated areas where you have the problem of attracting industry.  What I fear in this legislation, overall, is that some of its provisions will be detrimental to the development of industrial projects in isolated areas where it is already difficult to establish industry.  While the Bill is welcome, there are provisions which would be detrimental to industrial development especially in isolated rural areas such as those I represent.</P>

      <P>Under this section the Authority have power to engage consultants and advisers.  It is very necessary to <Col N="392" /> take cognisance of this whole question of employing consultants.  I would like to be assured that there will be some element of control in regard to the engagement of consultants to ensure that wastefulness of scarce resources is eliminated.  Those of us on sub-committees of this House come across these matters very often.  We are finding that consultancy charges are very heavy.  I ask the Minister to ensure that expenditure on consultants is kept to a reasonable level in regard to any aspect of the IDA's activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point.  It is not the wish of Government that any money would be wasted on consultancies. It is primarily a matter for the Authority and the Authority come before the Committee on Public Expenditure and can be examined.  Obviously if the Minister felt that expenditures on consultancy services were out of order he would require an explanation.  But the Authority are dealing with what can be, on occasions, very specialised projects and they have to be allowed leeway in regard to the engagement of consultants.  I agree with the thrust of what the Deputy is saying.  We would like to see expenditure on the consultancies being reasonable but we must accept that the Authority are dealing with a multiplicity of different industries all requiring very specialised knowledge and when the Authority need to engage consultants I think they have to be allowed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not finished with this aspect of it yet.  It is not good enough for the Minister to indicate that when the public accounts committee and the appropriation accounts committee meet questions can be asked.  It is because of my experience on those committees that I am raising this matter at this time.  That is like locking the stable door after the horse has bolted.  To be fore-warned is to be fore-armed.  If the proper development and the proper accumulation of information and statistics by the IDA require the employment of consultants, then they should be employed.  I am not saying that we ought not to employ them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> I am indicating that it has been the experience of committees of this House that fees charged by consultants and consultancies have been grossly out of proportion to the volume of work and their involvement.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister accepts the thrust of my argument.  We need to invest as much as we can in industrial development. Many State and semi-State bodies are closely associated with and working in conjunction with the IDA and if we have to go outside of all those to employ consultants, I wonder about the total costs of consultancies and reports.  At the end of the day, are we getting value for money?  I ask the Minister and the Authority to be prudent in the expenditure of taxpayers' money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully concur with the Deputy.  I am anxious that any expenditure incurred under all headings by the IDA would be prudent.  This section is virtually identical to section 21 of the Industrial Development Act, 1969.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point, but we must realise that the IDA are an autonomous body.  I understand that quite an amount of consultancy fees go to the IIRS in relation to environmental aspects of various projects and I am not aware of any wasteful expenditure incurred by the Authority.  If the Deputy has any specific problem in this regard I will be happy to discuss the matter with him privately and, of course, when we come to Estimates each year we examine the block grant in relation to the administrative expenses of the IDA.  The employment of consultants was reduced by 25 per cent last year.  It will go up and down because of the nature of the projects coming in.  I understand the need for pruning and we have due regard to it, but the Authority must be allowed a certain independence in this regard.</P>

It amazes me, in particular, that they have to go outside the country for consultants.  Can the Minister tell us the cost in 1985 of the consultants employed, the nature of the work of the consultancies, what assessments did they carry out and how many of those consultants were from overseas?

      <P>They are not a consultancy body but a grant aiding agency. Quite a number of matters could arise in regard to any project or range of products which might involve environmental impact.  Studies might be necessary because of the nature of the projects.  For instance, consultants might be required in regard to the special components of projects and in regard to sectoral strategy, and in this respect outside consultants might be needed so that we could not be accused of going in any particular direction.  The IDA might have to engage consultants overseas so that certain opinions might be got to bolster the <Col N="395" /> IDA's knowledge.  The Deputy seems to be emphasising the monstrosity of consultants, but it is wise for the Authority to engage consultants on many occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

        <i>Dublin North-West)</i>: Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 are consequential and may be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (2), line 39, to delete &ldquo;this section&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;subsection (1)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The first amendment is merely of a drafting nature, necessitated by the proposal to allow the Authority to make grants in respect of new employment created in small industrial undertakings as defined from time to time by the Minister. Its effect is to exclude the employment grants in respect of small industry from the percentage limits specified in subsection (2).</P>
      <P>The second amendment is an important one which I am sure will be welcomed. It will allow the Authority to make an employment grant in respect of additional persons employed in small industrial undertakings as defined from time to time by the Minister.  This is a major amendment to the Bill.  Quite often small undertakings do not qualify for substantial grants in relation to fixed assets.  This is a mechanism which we are using to help to top up the grants to which small industries will be entitled.</P>
      <P>Small industry undertakings, as the House is aware, are defined at present as those which employ up to 50 people and with fixed assets of up to £500,000.  The making of a grant by the Authority under this subsection shall be subject to such financial limits and other terms and conditions as may be specified from time to time in a scheme governing the making of such grants sanctioned by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  The financial limit on such grants will be set by reference to the 13,000 ECUs ceiling on employment grants and the principles of co-ordination of regional aid systems of the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention is that the rate of grant <Col N="397" /> under this subsection would be differentiated to take account of the level of sophistication of the undertaking and the skill content in the employment being created.  The level of grant for a simple assembly type operation would be lower than that which would be made available for an advanced high technology operation. The appropriate levels of grants will be set in consultation with the IDA and the Department of Finance.  It is the intention that such grants would be made to an industrial undertaking only in lieu of making a capital grant under section 21 (1) to that undertaking in respect of fixed assets whether alone or with one or more of the other capital incentives available under sections 22, 23, 24 and 32.</P>
    <P>Grants given under this subsection will not be reckonable for the purposes of percentage limits on capital grants under sections 21, 22 and 33 of this Bill.  They will, however, be reckonable for the purposes of the financial limits set in section 34 which provide that the Authority must first receive the permission of the Government where they propose to make a grant exceeding in the aggregate £2½ million.</P>
    <P>As this scheme presents a significant alternative to the range of State aids to small industry, it will be necessary to seek prior approval of the Commission of the European Community prior to its implementation. Formal notification to the Commission under Article 93/3 of the Treaty of Rome is at present being prepared in my Department.  We are confident that the Commission will raise no objection to the proposal.  This again is an innovative aspect of the Bill in that we are taking into account the particular importance of small industries.  We are taking as flexible a stand as possible in relation to grant aid.  Quite often the employment type of grant is much more beneficial to small industrial undertakings than a capital grant.  I am sure it will be widely welcomed and widely availed of throughout industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The changes proposed by the Minister are certainly welcome, as <Col N="398" /> they extend the scope as he outlined.  I am not too sure about the reference in the amendment to page 10, subsection (2), line 39, to delete that section and substitute subsection (1) of section 21.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) at the bottom of page 10 of the Bill deals with the percentages of grants in designated areas and subsection (1) of the same section talks about making a grant under such terms and conditions as is thought proper.  Am I to take it from that that we are now removing from the legislation the percentages of 60 per cent and 45 per cent which heretofore applied?  If we are, what is the reasoning behind this and will the rates of grants in future be decided without the criteria of those two percentages?</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, as everybody will be aware, every word, line and figure is so important and so relevant.  That is why I am asking for an explanation of the proposal in amendment No. 13 relating to section 21.  Then there is a reference to page 11, between lines 28 and 29 to insert what is in amendment No. 14.</P>
      <P>I should like to get a view on the parts of section 21(3) (a), (b), (c) and (d) on page 11, in particular, with reference to the service industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall not disagree on something as fundamental and reasonable as taking the amendments first.  I have asked a question about amendment No. 14.  The Minister indicated that <Col N="399" /> amendment No. 15 would give greater assistance to small industrial undertakings. If that is the case, then I wholeheartedly agree with it.  However, consultation is to be carried out with such bodies as maybe specified by the Minister from time to time.  Does this mean that the IDA will be deciding or will it be consultants and staff who will be making these decisions and not the political head of the Department?</P>
      <P>I gather that these amendments are to broaden the scope of the Bill to the benefit of the small industries sector and as an encouragement for the employment of additional people.  That is very welcome because it is a section which could contribute handsomely in relative terms to small businesses.  I have no difficulty in agreeing to the inclusion of the amendment as an addendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to use the technical phrase &ldquo;amendment&rdquo; because it is a new subsection.  The Minister shall have the power to define from time to time what is a small industry.  The present level is up to 50 employees and fixed assets worth £500,000.  That definition needs to be amended from time to time, not necessarily radically amended but to take into account practices and inflation.  We want to be as helpful as possible to small industries by giving a genuine and generous definition so that they can benefit to the greatest possible extent from legislation. The Minister would consult and discuss the matter with the IDA but he would not necessarily be advised by consultancies on this matter.  The Minister himself will determine it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is quite right in saying that this is an innovative mechanism to help small industries gain the maximum grants possible, not through the usual route of bricks, mortar and machinery but through employment grants.  This will be especially suitable to new industries which have a high technological involvement and a highly qualified staff.  This mechanism will be very attractive to such industries and I am quite confident that <Col N="400" /> small industries will be very aware of it and will avail of it.</P>

      <P>(c) A grant under this subsection shall not be reckoned in the calculation of the maximum grants payable to the undertaking concerned for the purposes of subsection (2) and section 33.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) is being eliminated in accordance with amendment No. 13. Nevertheless we are referring to it in amendment No. 14.  Is it intended that this element of amendment No. 14 in section 21 is to be in part or in total a replacement for what we deleted in section 21(2)?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (c) removes the 45 per cent and 60 per cent levels because it is not possible to calculate employment grants in the same way as grants for buildings or machinery.  We are removing those criteria.  Similarly it would not be possible to define how much employment grant one would give as between one industry and another.  We have kept the most flexible method possible. A question may arise as to the differential which exists in designated and non-designated areas.  This is a matter which we will have to consider.  Obviously we would wish to maintain a balance.  If a small industry were applying for a grant under this section we would have to balance what we could give them, depending on their location.  Quite often in high technology industries the question of location is not paramount.  Other criteria are often more important, such as proximity of high-tech universities or institutes, communications and proximity to airports. We had to remove the maximum grant percentage because it is not feasible to apply it to employment grants.  There is a different way of calculating them and it would not fall easily within the percentages we employ for fixed assets and buildings.</P>

It will not be retained in respect of the new subsection which we are introducing.  We are retaining the percentage criteria for all eligible fixed assets, buildings and machinery, but we cannot use those criteria for the employment grant because of its nature.  That is the import of the amendment.</P>

The amended subsection (2) refers back to the bricks and mortar, so to speak.  Those grants are 45 per cent and 60 per cent.

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Some subsections of this section require some attention.  I will deal with subsection (3) (a), (b), (c) and (d) which reads:</P>
      <P>This section applies to an industrial undertaking in respect of which the Authority is satisfied that it&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  Will produce products for sale primarily on world markets, in particular those products which will result in the development or utilisation of local materials, agricultural products or other natural resources; or <Col N="404" /> We are all familiar with production for export only.  Some elements of manufacturing industry find that the stipulation &ldquo;for export only&rdquo; does not always meet with their consensus of approval in the best interests of the market place for some of the products.  The subsection continues:</P>
    <P>(b)  will produce products of an advanced technological nature for supply to internationally trading or skilled sub-supply firms within the State; or</P>
    <P>(c)  will produce for sectors of the Irish market which are subject to international competition; or</P>
    <P>(d)  is a service industry as specified by the Minister by order under section 3.</P>
    <P>We are all well aware of various elements of service industries that could do with grant aiding from the IDA to survive and to maintain and increase employment. The Minister may by order provide that any undertaking engaged in the provision of a service specified in the order shall be a service industry for the purposes of this Act.  I would encourage the broadening of whatever standards or criteria are being operated by the IDA in their decision that particular service industries are grant aided while others are not.</P>
    <P>I am sure I am not alone in saying that many more elements of the service industry should be in the position of qualifying for grant aid from the IDA but too often the Authority are unable to approve of certain service industries in respect of grant aid.  This constraint may stem from the provisions of the Acts relating to the IDA.  However, I should like to hear the Minister's view on the possibility of broadening the scope of the criteria in respect of including more elements of the service industry.  This might not relate necessarily to the service industries on the home market but very often nowadays they are competing with foreign products.  In any area in which that is happening the IDA should give every assistance to the native manufacturer, be <Col N="405" /> he large or small.  Many products from low cost countries, for instance, are to be found on our markets.  This creates problems for our manufacturers in terms of competition.  Very often the foreign company are in a more advantageous position in terms of cost effectiveness and so on.  In that way there is an unfair advantage so far as the Irish producer is concerned.</P>
    <P>I trust the Bill will succeed in its many aspects but that in particular it will succeed in terms of this section.  The criterion at (d) is the one that must be looked at.  It provides that the Minister by order may provide that the provision of any service specified in the order shall be a service industry for the purposes of this legislation.  We have been restrictive to a large extent in aiding aspects of our service industry and that is the kernel of the point I am making.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The international services industry order of 1981 specifies the areas that are to be included for the purpose of grant aid by the IDA.  I have referred to those already but perhaps I should mention them again.  They include data processing services, software development services, technical and consultant services, commercial laboratory services, administrative headquarters services, research and development services, media recording services, training services, publishing services, national financial services and health care services. These are all services that are traded internationally.</P>
      <P>The scheme has been in operation for the past five years only but I should be happy to have it reviewed so as to determine whether it has been successful and to enable us to decide whether it should be expanded.  It would not be my intention to include non-trading services in this Bill.  There are services for which there is a finite market.  There is no competition from abroad in relation to them so there is no reason for devoting scarce resources to that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section represents the kernel of the IDA's grant-giving powers in respect <Col N="406" /> of capital grants, grants towards the cost of fixed assets and for industries undertaken on such terms and conditions as the Authority consider proper.  In broad measure there was agreement in the White Paper on Industrial Policy with the thrust of the Telesis report which recommended greater selectivity in the use of State incentives for industry and also for the concentration of key cost disadvantages in logistics, process development, market exporting, linkages and skills.  The selectivity criteria are designed to assist the achievement of these objectives.  That new criteria overlaps with the old of necessity in respect of financial assistance, the commercial viability of firms, the provision of employment, the use of natural resources and technological concepts.  The question of research and development is dealt with in section 29.  It is a separate issue that we can discuss later.</P>
    <P>Our resources are limited so we must decide how best to concentrate the resources we have so as to ensure not only the best possible broad industrial development but that our efforts are concentrated on the broad area that will need industrial incentives in order to expand and prosper.  We must use our resources to attack those industries that are involved in international trading.  This is why we have set out new broad criteria in the matter of empowering the Authority to make grants.  That is not an unrealistic approach.  It is the proper line for a Government to take.  Periodically a Government should review areas in which grants are expended, define such areas and narrow them down so as to ensure the best possible expansion of industry and to ensure also that the grant-aided industries are moving in the right direction.  We must ensure, too, that we attract those industries involved in specialised areas.  Allied to that is the development of our natural resources. What we have here is a <i>mélange</i> of criteria which meet the requirements of our natural resources industries and also the product and services areas that have the best potential for development.</P>
    <P>I do not need to spell that out.  We <Col N="407" /> have defined and highlighted the areas that we want to concentrate our scarce natural resources on.  The direction set down in the White Paper, which took into account the contents of the Telesis report, established the broad area of consensus in relation to the direction of our grant aid policy.  That is included in section 21.  There is a good balance between natural resources, services and internationally traded goods.  There is no need to expand it further at this stage.  I take on board what the Deputy says. Perhaps a review of the criteria could be undertaken and included in the three yearly review on industrial policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that quite an amount of studies and reports have indicated the success of the service industry in other countries as a means of redressing the economic situation pertaining to those countries?  Are we to become so entrenched that we do not propose to move with the times? Would it not be reasonable to extend the support that the IDA should be giving to the service industry?  We know that all sorts of reasons are given when one applies to the IDA for assistance in the service industry.  The resources which the Minister speaks about could easily be channelled to extending support for the service industry.  We have a severe restriction of not giving grant aid to any concern or person who wishes to start up a project if they do not buy a brand new machine.  That aspect of support for the service industry as well as the manufacturing industry should be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entire section deals with the authority's general grant-making powers. From experience in my constituency and elsewhere I find that the restriction on projects of only grant aiding new machinery should be looked at with a view to encouraging the small manufacturing industry who, by their contribution, will surely make a return to this economy tenfold and maybe more.  I asked the Minister to give more assistance to and to encourage the service industry.  I have <Col N="408" /> no doubt that the IDA feel constrained. They say that they are obliged by regulations and by legislation to grant aid only new machinery.  By doing this we could be killing off enthusiasm and the desire and the will of people to do something for themselves and to help our economy. I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to those aspects of section 21. Subsection (4) deals with development of the undertaking, investment, equity base and a suitable company development plan.  All these things are necessary.  We should also look at the decision to back a technically risky project which depends as much on the evaluation of the individual as on the project.  Recently I went to see a project where the evaluation of the individual was not taken into account because they had acquired a machine which was not new.  Because the firm did not prepare a projected return over a five year period it seemed to the people concerned that the IDA were more of a hindrance than a help.  If that attitude is widespread to any degree, the Minister should avail of the Industrial Development Bill to eradicate it.  We should give the IDA freedom in at least two of the elements of section 21, the service industries and the grant aiding of previously used machinery.  By doing this, we would go a long way in encouraging more people to get up and go and do something for themselves and the economy of the country. I would like if the Minister would comment on those two aspects of section 21.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a number of issues.  It is not my experience that the IDA have not been sympathetic to the entrepreneur, the man who would appear to be the driving force in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>They are restricting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept that.  I am not surprised to hear on occasion that the IDA felt that the project as a whole, despite the calibre of the entrepreneur, did not satisfy some of the other criteria in subsection (4) of the Bill.  The IDA are there to encourage people to become <Col N="409" /> involved in industry and on many occasions I have seen them back with money the entrepreneur.</P>
      <P>On the other side of the coin, I must say that I have responsibility for the sectoral industry division in the Department of Industry and Commerce where we have the industries in trouble.  Time and again, I have found that although the entrepreneur may be first class, other factors come into play which if they had been addressed at an earlier stage would have meant that the company would have a bright future.  In particular, I would be concerned that new projects would be soundly financed.  That is one of the major problems I have found in relation to companies in trouble.</P>
      <P>Quite often the company in trouble has not the right market penetration technique, advice or management.  This is, perhaps, because the entrepreneur is too strong and is not prepared to delegate. There is a general problem in relation to the market itself.  Again, a company gets into trouble because it has not got sufficient finance.  I am merely giving some examples of the opposite side of the coin that the Deputy is endeavouring simply to show that there is a need to balance up the support for an entrepreneur by examing the other essential elements in any package that make up an economic enterprise.  The criteria set out in subsection (4) are sensible, they are not overbearing and do not wrap strings or red tape around the project.  I do not believe that subsection (4) does that.  I think that subsection (4) tries not to put up red tape but lays down only five basic elementary criteria which are needed if one looks at a project as a whole.</P>
      <P>In relation to international services, these have been rather successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The moneys involved have been quite substantial.  The IDA's grant commitment approved in 1984 was in the order of £8.7 million.  I must reiterate that I would be happy to have a review <Col N="410" /> of the scope of the international services programme.  I do not feel inclined towards expanding it to the non traded services.  That would be unnecessary and would not meet with the criteria of using our scarce resources to the best advantage.</P>
      <P>In relation to secondhand machinery, this is not as ticklish a problem as the Deputy suggested.  Of course, there is a problem in relation to the devaluation of any machinery and certainly there is great difficulty in the devaluation of secondhand machinery.  The Deputy confined himself correctly to small industries where the bright entrepreneurs want to start up and get into the market with secondhand machinery.  They test and penetrate the market with a view to modernising and upgrading their machinery. They take on new lines which require new machinery.  We have had a good discussion on amendment No. 14 to section 21.  We are going the route the Deputy is looking for.  Although we have not specified it in the amendment we are going to allow an employment grant mechanism for small industries which will allow them avail of the use of second hand machinery.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>What we did say was that small industries may have employment grants but if they receive employment grants they do not have a percentage of grants for eligible fixed assets.  If they go on the employment grants route, they may then purchase secondhand machinery and achieve exactly what the Deputy is asking for, which is to allow them to buy secondhand machinery while at the same time receiving substantial employment grants.  In other words, grant aid is being directed where it should be, which is into specialised employment and the employment of people to work those grants.  We are achieving exactly what the Deputy is looking for.  Indeed, we are aware that there have been on many occasions representations on the purchase of secondhand <Col N="411" /> machinery.  We have allowed for that by giving grants for employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more than pleased to hear the Minister write into the record of this House the subject matter to which I directed some attention.  Not alone have I experience of people looking for grant aid for previously occupied plant and machinery, but the IDA, the Department and the Minister are also aware of this problem, and this has been the position for many years.  I know a man who ten or 15 years ago, imported a secondhand machine from Italy for £40,000, but the IDA were precluded from assisting him because of regulations passed by this House.  Because of his drive and initiative this man now has a business in a village with a turnover of £10 million.  Yet ten or 15 years ago the IDA could not advance him £1 because he had imported a secondhand machine from Italy costing £40,000.  It appears that it has taken all that time to make the people in charge realise the position, but now plant, machinery and equipment previously used can be grant aided.  This is a step in the right direction.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>If, in this Bill, we continue to apply the same strictures which precluded the IDA from grant aiding individuals or groups who wished to purchase previously occupied plant and machinery to set up a business, then we are neglecting one of the most serious aspects of encouraging the development of small industries, because the people who generally buy secondhand machinery are small entrepreneurs.  From his intervention it appears that the Minister does not wish me to be as direct as I have been, but he indicated that by using different <Col N="412" /> words we may be able to include in the Bill a provision which would cover the point I have made.  A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.  If there is likely to be a process by which the objective I have been stressing can be achieved, I would welcome it.</P>
      <P>I would not like one of my constituents to come to me in a few months time and ask why we passed industrial development legislation which did not include a provision allowing the IDA to give a grant for secondhand machinery or previously occupied plant to help the small entrepreneur to set up a business.  I do not want to hear anyone say that the IDA cannot help a small businessman to purchase previously occupied plant or secondhand machinery.  I have heard that too often, and I am sure the Minister and other Members of this House have too. The Minister has shown an understanding of the point I am making and I have no doubt that he is aware of this anomaly in the IDA structure.  I want an assurance from him that those in the IDA who will be putting this legislation into effect, whether the wording is as I suggested or otherwise, will remove the impediment which prevents the IDA from assisting financially any individual or group who may wish to set up a manufacturing or servicing industry with the purchase of machinery which is other than new.  That is what we are talking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can put the Deputy's mind at rest.  Under section 21, if the grant scheme being availed of is the employment grant scheme for small industry, then it is irrelevant whether it is new or secondhand machinery.  It was with that in mind that the new employment grant was included in this Bill. Where an entrepreneur is using the employment grant scheme to get grants, he may use secondhand machinery.  That will be welcomed by all.  Is that clear?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>How many people must be employed before the businessman qualifies for the employment grant scheme? I remember some years ago that it was necessary to employ five people if one <Col N="413" /> wanted a business telephone.  But one cannot employ five people until the business has started and one cannot start a business without a telephone.  In the light of that experience, must there be a certain number of employees before the businessman can qualify under the employment grant scheme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The new subsection (5) (a) says: &ldquo;The Authority may, in the case of small industrial undertakings...&rdquo; That is defined as industries which have a maximum of 50 employees and net assets of £500,000.  That is subject to ministerial amendment.  It is based on the numbers employed and that is why it is called an employment grant.  If only a few are employed them obviously the grant will not be great, but the more are employed up to 50 the greater will be the grant.  That is how it is designed.  Within the scheme once you are operating under the employment grant scheme you may use secondhand equipment.</P>

      <P>If the Minister wants to go into it along those lines I am quite prepared to stay here all night talking about it.  I agree that any concern that employs 50 nowadays is more than a small industry.  Practically all firms who employ 50 or over 50 and up to 500 have closed down, have gone into liquidation, in recent years.  I see announcements about the same jobs being made four and five <Col N="415" /> times.  I hear them announced on radio and television nationally.  A few days afterwards they are announced locally and our quote of 98 for the south-west was announced some months ago.  Three times the announcement was made about 98 jobs.</P>

It is regrettable that we are getting into this sort of thing on a long day here, but I suspect that the Minister referred cynically to the 50 employees I mentioned as being in the category of medium to large industry nowadays.  Of course, they are. I was talking in terms of one or two employees and up to five or ten, and then the Minister comes in and talks about 50.</P>

      <P>I agree that we want to help all strata of industry, but if I thought that the Minister was being in any way cynical &mdash; I doubt if he was; but I got that feeling and, if I am wrong, I accept I am wrong &mdash; and if somebody wants to take me on along those lines, I am quite prepared for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not being cynical. I was anxious to clarify exactly what is in the Bill because it will be read outside the House.  I was saying that at present a small industry is determined by the Minister as one which has up to 50 employees and/or £0.5 million assets.  I consider that those enterpreneurs who are starting new businesses and who avail of the employment grant mechanism are looking on it very favourably because it will allow them to get an employment grant for the numbers they employ and <Col N="416" /> to buy secondhand machinery.  I was trying to be concise as to the parameters of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says, but when I mentioned the same words as he has used now at the end of his contribution he seemed to pull me up and tell me that I was using the wrong words.  I know the IDA are very sympathetic and give people every consideration when they go to them for assistance and so on.  Everybody knows that.  But the feeling abroad among many people is that the IDA would assist people if they could.  We must eliminate that attitude wherever it exists because only 1 per cent of the total number of inquiries is 1 per cent too many.  This Bill will have to be an instrument that the IDA can use to eradicate any feeling abroad among people that the IDA will listen to you, they will do what they can, but that they are restricted or confined by regulations or whatever and it is not their fault.  We have heard that very often.  There is no point in buying our heads in the sand about it.  We have heard that from constituents, from people who have ideas and proposals and initiative.  I am well aware when the Minister says that we must have a financial structure that a financial structure is essential.  It is a big element of any proposal many of which are listed there and I threw in another about the evaluation of the individual in a project.  I hope that we are not overreacting to the closures of many grant-aided firms where jobs are lost and the close down is total. In any updating of the legislation or regulations we must take cognisance of the fact that Fóir Teoranta had to be called in and that the IDA grand-aided many elements of industry which were failures, but it is better to have tried and failed than not to have tried at all.  In the light of some bad experience in the industrial world of grant-aided firms closing and job losses, naturaly we will have to be cautions in spending taxpayers' money by making sure that all the criteria are met: This can be done if the IDA stay within the regulations they are working with and, in the light of past experiences, <Col N="417" /> avoid situations where projects cease to operate and jobs are lost.  Past experience must be taken into account, but I do not think we should over-react.  Let this Bill give the IDA much more freedom to pursue what we want them to do in every way they can, to broaden the industrial base of the country and strengthen that which exists.  If we do not legislate correctly, it is our fault.  We have this opportunity after at least five years of examining the situation.  We should not miss this opportunity.  The whole purpose of this Bill is to give the IDA a structure and a format to revitalise industry and industrial development.  That is what it is all about and that is what we have to aim at.  If there are things which need attention this is our last opportunity to look at them.</P>

      <P>I fully accept what the Deputy says.  The amendment in relation to employment goes quite a long way towards solving one of the major problems which all Deputies have come across when meeting industrialists.  I feel that the criteria set down in section 4 are not onerous.  There will always be a few disappointed people whose amibition may have been thwarted.  On the other hand, it is lucky that one John de Lorean was not accepted as one of our new entrepreneurs. We were lucky to escape that. It is difficult to know when to say no and when to say yes.  We were lucky.  But, of course, we have been unlucky on occasion.  By and large the Authority is receptive rather than trying to put barriers up for entrepreneurs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there anything new in this section?  There is no indication in the column that there is anything new or partially new.  Is it just the 1969 Act, and how does it operate in relation to the deduction of interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It replaces section 36 of the Industrial Development Act, 1969. The amendment made previously to that Act basically reflects the selectivity criteria that we have adopted in section 21. That is really the only difference.  We are relating it to the fact that the grant itself must be in conformity with section 21. There is no other basic amendment to what is in section 23.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister elaborate? The section provides that the Authority can make a grant on such terms and conditions as it thinks proper towards a reduction of the interest payable on a loan raised to provide fixed assets and so on.  Is there any requirement as to from whom the loan is raised?  Does that really matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is primarily a matter for the promoter.  The IDA, in making a grant in relation to the interest paid, is using Irish money and therefore the grant made would be expressed in Irish money and may not exceed 60 per cent or 45 per cent of whatever grant falls due to be paid.  Primarily what is of interest to the Authority is that proof of the loan exists and the loan is actually drawn down.  Otherwise they could not pay the interest subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>When I ask from whom the loan is raised I am wondering is it from the commercial banks or the ICC or the <Col N="419" /> ACC or does that come into it at all?  I have a doubt about elements of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The main proof that the Authority would require would be that the loan exists and there is proof that the loan exists and proof that the loan is drawn down.  Otherwise they could not actually pay an interest grant.  The proof that the loan exists and has been drawn down is the most relevant aspect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that the IDA would have no function until after the negotiations had been concluded between an industrialist and a commercial lending agency?  Will the IDA have no function in the securing of the loan but just come in to grant aid for payment of the interest without having a prior involvement?  Could we have any indication about whether there is a criterion or standardised format for the involvement of the IDA in the paying of interest on loans and have they any input into the raising of that loan?  Would it be restrictive in any way if the IDA had to be involved in the negotiations for securing a loan?  Is there any information on it apart from what is there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>First, this mechanism of granting aid for interest payments usually forms part of an overall package put by a promoter in respect of a project and it may suit the promoter to have part of a package of grant aid paid by way of the grants towards interest payments.  It is not the Authority's remit, nor does it have power, nor should it have power, to negotiate or be party to negotiations in relation to the financing of a project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the promoter comes with his package and is paid the grants on proof of the existence of machinery or buildings or, in this case, proof of the existence of a grant which has been drawn down.  It would complicate the promoter's position and that of the Authority if they were involved in the often complicated aspects of the promoter's financial position.  Quite often, because the promoter may have other interests, he may <Col N="420" /> be put off if there is interference by the Authority in relation to his financial package as he may not want the Authority to know about it.</P>

      <P>This section replaces section 37 of the Industrial Development Act, 1969, as amended by section 3 of the Industrial Development (No. 2) Act, 1975.  There have been some changes, for example, in relation to loan guarantees to the new selectivity grant criteria, which apply to the interest grants also.  A limit of 80 per cent of a loan is being introduced as the amount which may be guaranteed by the Authority in respect of fixed assets and not 100 per cent as heretofore.  The capital value of a loan guarantee under the section will be reckoned in the calculation of the maximum amount of grants under section 33 as a percentage grant, which is normal.  The other change is that it is expressed in IR£ which protects the IDA from adverse currency fluctuations. These changes are rational and sound.</P>

Is the Minister satisfied with that figure? The figure in relation to Hyster was £1 million but, according to this section, approval must be sought for amounts over £750,000.  Are we giving the IDA freedom to operate and yet putting a limit on the figure?  I accept that there must be a ceiling on grant aiding a particular item but is the figure of £750,000 the right <Col N="421" /> ceiling?  We expect this Bill to be in operation for many years and, because of that, this figure is a little on the low side.</P>

Subsection (4) says that the Authority shall not, without the prior permission of the Government, give in respect of a particular undertaking an employment grant or grants exceeding in the aggregate £1,250,000.

It is of interest to note that in November 1985 there were 2,944 international services <Col N="422" /> jobs which arose from 181 projects grant aided by the IDA and this reflects the success of the international services programme which has been innovative and successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The other sections applied to fixed capital machinery.  This section deals with the guaranteeing of loans and interest subsidies for restructuring industry.  We have a mechanism which is intended to help a restructured company in their working capital requirements. It reproduces section 2 of the Industrial Development Act, 1977, and also incorporates the financial limit of £750,000 over which it is necessary to seek Government approval.  The limit meets with the approval of the Authority. It is not a weapon in the hands of the Authority.  It is to help where a company is taken over.  The provision is not subject to the selectivity criteria because we are dealing with the question of a follow-on to existing industries and undertakings where there is an acquisition or an amalgamation in relation to two or more undertakings.  It is a very handy but not over-used provision in the IDA armoury. It is a sensible provision.</P>

      <P>Not particularly.  The provision is to assist those involved in the enterprise development programme which was launched in 1978.  It reproduces section 3 of the Industrial Development, 1977.  The loan guarantee and interest subsidy are being made subject to the new selectivity criteria.  Secondly, the IDA powers to guarantee loans in respect of enterprise development projects is being limited to 80 per cent of capital.  They are the only changes from the 1977 provision.  The Authority assist people involved in the enterprise development programme and, quite often, what they need most is an interest subsidy and a loan guarantee.  Very often executives who have been employed in industry do not have the capital necessary to get their enterprise underway.  This provision meets their needs in that respect.

      <P>In page 14, subsection (1), line 40, to delete &ldquo;The&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Following consultation with such bodies as may be specified by the Minister from time to time, the&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Bruton, when moving Second Stage stated that it was his belief that there was a wealth of invaluable technical expertise available in the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards which would prove a major asset in identifying suitable projects for assistance under the R and D and technology acquisition grant schemes.  He indicated that the IIRS would be consulted on all such projects.  These amendments give formal recognition to the proposed consultation procedure in so far as R and D grants are concerned.  They have been drafted in such a manner as to allow the Minister to specify, where appropriate, other bodies in addition to the IIRS. Obviously, it was because of the expertise at the NBST that he required that an expert from there be consulted in relation to such a grant.  In my view it is a wise provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important departure although the Minister does not seem to think so.  The original section stated that the Authority &ldquo;may make a grant&rdquo; but the Minister is proposing to delete the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;following consultation with such bodies as may be specified by the Minister from time to time&rdquo;.  The Minister is seeking to extend the scope of the authority of the Minister. For far too long we have been underestimating the importance of research and development and undersubscribing to it.  Is the intention of the amendments to broaden the scope of groups or authorities? Is it an extension of the original provision?  If that is the case it is a further example of not enough emphasis being put on research and development as occurred in the recent past when it became more important to keep up with changing technology.  Research and development have been given a back seat position.  Is the Minister satisfied that the amount of a research grant shall not exceed 50 per cent of the approved costs of the project concerned or £250,000, whichever is the smaller sum?  I have no doubt that £250,000 is a reasonable sum for research and development.  But there is much research and development to be done by way of smaller amounts than that.  I wonder would the Minister consider a scaling of grant aid for research and development, perhaps rising from a figure of 60 per cent?  Would the Minister consider a two or three-tiered scale of grants for research and development?</P>
      <P>I am afraid what is stipulated is some what restrictive.  It is all right in the upper bracket no exceeding £250,000.  What about a much smaller enterprise where the expenditure of moneys on research and development would be so essential to its success and when the amount of assistance it would receive, 50 per cent, would not be related to the overall project? I put it to the Minister that with regard to smaller enterprises 50 per cent would hardly be sufficient.  Would the Minister give some consideration to having a tiered system of grant aid for research and development because its importance cannot be over-emphasised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="426" /> Perhaps the Minister would comment on that suggestion I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Recognition has been given in my amendments to the expertise available to the IIRS.  We want to harness that expertise and that available also in other institutions such as the NBST.  If we were to increase the maximum grant allowable beyond 50 per cent we might be offending EC competition rules.  I think that is the reason for having the 50 per cent stipulated.  Fifty per cent constitutes a good incentive in relation to research and development projects and is highly competitive internationally.</P>
      <P>In relation to a tiered type grant I should say that the words used in subsection (4) (a):</P>
      <P>Subject to paragraph (b), the amount of a research grant shall not exceed 50 per cent...</P>
      <P>mean that there can be a scaling up to the maximum, again probably dependent on the quality of the grant.</P>
      <P>I might draw Deputy Lyons' attention to subsection (5) which says:</P>
      <P>The Authority may, in the case of small industrial undertakings as defined from time to time by the Minister, make payment of up to one-third of a research grant prior to the approved costs being incurred on condition that the amount so paid shall be repaid to the Authority if the research or development project concerned has not been carried out to the satisfaction of the Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we are trying to help small industry to become involved in research and development by giving them a prepayment of up to one-third of the grant in order to encourage them.  We recognise the importance of research and development.  We are very anxious, when industries are established, especially those from abroad which have tremendous capabilities in relation to research and development, that they should locate part of their research and development activity here.  We are now meeting with some success in this area.  I should like <Col N="427" /> to see a higher level of involvement in research and development by foreign companies who have located here.  This grant scheme for research and development is welcome and is meeting with some success.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's explanation.  However, I am becoming sceptical about EC rules and regulations being advanced as reasons for our being precluded from doing this, that or the other thing.  I have the feeling that we must be the best behaved member nation in the Community with regard to adhering to the rules, while we see many others not doing so.  I became concerned when I hear so frequently about how good we are in this respect.  As the Minister says, this may be another example of our being constrained by EC rules from deviating from the 50 per cent of approved costs of a project for research and development. For the betterment of the national welfare a time will have to come when we become more selfish, like other nations, when something like this would mean so much to us here battling to broaden and restore our industrial base.  Without breaching the rules too much, surely we should be able to circumvent some of these regulations that deter us.</P>
      <P>The Minister quoted the one-third grant referred to in subsection (5) &mdash;&ldquo;one-third of a research grant prior to the approved costs being incurred on condition that the amount so paid shall be repaid to the Authority if the research or development project concerned has not been carried out to the satisfaction of the Authority.&rdquo;  Where does a small industrial undertaking expect to find the remaining two-thirds?  Could we not reverse those proportions?  If it is a small undertaking surely we could substitute two-thirds for one-third?  Over the years applicants for reconstruction grants and so on provided one-third of the cost and the Department or local authority the remaining two-thirds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be no harm for the Minister to give some consideration to having small industrial undertakings provide one-third <Col N="428" /> of a research grant prior to the approved costs being incurred, with the IDA being given the freedom &mdash; and I use that word advisedly &mdash; to grant aid the remaining two-thirds, of course recouperable, as is said, if the project is not carried out satisfactorily. It should be remembered that resources invested now in research and development will have beneficial effects in the long term for our industrial structure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum amount of grant we consider appropriate is 50 per cent.  We must realise that we are getting the maximum ceiling on the aid code and that other industrialised countries cannot give anything like that figure.  Our business is to ensure that we benefit to the maximum, ensuring that other countries adhere to the regulations of the scheme which is done by way of surveillance in Brussels.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5) is innovative in that we are pre-paying research grants, something not done before.  One-third is a fair enough contribution in a start-up position with regard to research and development and will be so recognised by promoters.</P>
      <P>I want to thank Deputy Lyons for his constructive opposition.  We have had a fairly good debate on the sections we have managed to reach and I am grateful for his contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>All Deputies who contributed to the debate on 13 March 1986 stressed the importance of better enforcement of the law in relation to the road haulage industry.  In my closing remarks on that day I expressed the hope that the enforcement provisions which I will be proposing for inclusion in the Bill on Committee Stage will result in a significant improvement in the level of enforcement of the laws impinging on road haulage and bus transport.  We will be discussing these provisions in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>At this point I want to say that I intend to have the proposed arrangements which, of course, will supplement normal Garda enforcement activities, vigorously applied with a view to securing maximum compliance.  The new enforcement measures will be operated in co-operation with the Garda Síochána and it will be possible to have unified enforcement in the functional area of the Department of the Environment who are responsible for legislation relating to roadworthiness and weights of vehicles, road tax and insurance, speed limits, etc., and the Department of Labour, who have responsibility in relation to the carriage of dangerous substances, as well as with the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>A question was raised about the adequacy of enforcement of the tachograph regulations.  Enforcement of these regulations is undertaken by the Garda, inspectors of my Department and customs and excise officers.  My Department have continuously endeavoured to improve the procedures to secure compliance with these regulations and will maintain their efforts in this respect. The European Commission closely monitors enforcement in this area and I have been able to report to it that there is about 90 per cent compliance with the requirement to have a tachograph fitted and within that bracket, a high proportion of compliance with the requirements as to use.  In 1984 a total of 20,274 inspections in relation to the tachograph was undertaken, 2,506 prosecutions were initiated and there were 2,147 convictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="430" /> Deputies Wilson and Bertie Ahern spoke on standards for admission to the occupation of road haulage operator. Most Deputies will be aware that under an EC directive persons operating a road haulage business must be of good repute, of sound financial standing and professionally competent.  The directive allows member states to determine how the good repute and financial requirements are to be satisfied; in regard to professional competence it provides that any person who has not had experience as operator or manager of a lawfully established road haulage business before 1975 must attend a course and pass an examination in specified subjects before being deemed competent.  The examination must be designed to accommodate persons whose education corresponds to the level normally reached at school leaving age.  The directive has been implemented in Ireland by regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972. These provide that for the purpose of establishing the good repute of a person, I may take into account convictions for certain specified offences under road traffic and road transport legislation.  The requirement of financial standing is satisfied if the person owns a suitable vehicle or has made arrangements to lease such a vehicle for a minimum of one year or proves that he has sufficient resources to establish and administer the business.</P>
    <P>In line with the recommendations of the TCC report, I will be widening the range of convictions to be taken into account in assessing good repute.  I will also be introducing more stringent requirements in relation to financial standing, but on the basis that those new requirements will not act as a measure to restrict unnecessary entry to the market. New amending regulations will be required to give effect to these proposals.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies raised the question of a bonding scheme.  Bonding could prove restrictive and so defeat the purpose of the Bill, which is the liberalising of the haulage industry.  The contract for the carriage of goods is between the haulier and his customer, and the continuation of the contract will depend on the services <Col N="431" /> the haulier continues to provide.  It must be remembered that hauliers have freedom of choice and are not now statutorily required to accept goods for carriage.</P>
    <P>The Chartered Institute of Transport have been appointed to conduct courses and examinations for certificates of competence. The courses are provided, subject to demand, at all the regional technical colleges and at some other establishments. For the information of Deputies, I am circulating a list of the schools and colleges providing the courses.  The duration of the course is normally 60 hours for a national certificate of competence, with an additional 30 hours for the international certificate.  There is a steering committee in my Department who monitor and oversee the running of courses and conduct of examinations.  It was suggested during the debate that applicants for admission to the industry should, as well as passing the examination, have two years practical experience. It would be discriminatory against Irish nationals <i>vis-à-vis</i> operators in other member states to oblige them to have this additional requirement to qualify for a certificate of competence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson was interested in recent developments in international road haulage. With regard to the EC, the major recent developments have been that in December 1984, under the Irish Presidency, a regulation was adopted providing for considerable increases under the Community Quota Multilateral Authorisation Scheme, namely 30 per cent in 1985 and 15 per cent in each of the following four years.  In Ireland's case this has meant an increase from 88 in 1984 to 147 in 1985 and to 204 in 1986.  This is of considerable benefit to our hauliers because of the flexibility of operations given by these multilateral licences which permit Irish hauliers to engage in international haulage operations throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>A directive on weights and dimensions of certain categories of goods vehicles in international traffic, also adopted in 1984, provides for a gross weight limit of <Col N="432" /> 40 tonnes for five and six axle combined vehicles.  Ireland was granted a temporary derogation during which period the existing gross weight limit of 38 tonnes may be retained; this derogation is to provide time for the improvement of bridges and roads.  The maximum of 38 tonnes has applied only since September 1983 when it was increased from 32 tonnes.  A policy decision taken by the Council of Transport Ministers in November 1985 envisages the removal of quantitative restrictions by 1992 at the latest. Ireland strongly supports the liberalisation of international road haulage within the EC, subject to qualitative controls related to technical standards and professional competence.</P>
    <P>International road transport operations are also undertaken on the basis of bilateral road transport agreements or the European Conference of Ministers of Transport &mdash; ECMT &mdash; multilateral licensing scheme.  To date, 12 bilateral agreements are in operation and a number of others are being negotiated. Ireland has 31 ECMT multilateral licences which enable holders to operate between 18 of the 19 member states &mdash; one member, Finland, does not participate.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies commented on the costs borne by Irish operators <i>vis-à-vis</i> Northern Ireland hauliers.  Deputies are aware that prior to this year's budget various reliefs had been given in the form of a reduction in VAT on repairs and a reduction in duty on spare parts and tyres.  The 1986 budget provides for the phasing out of the remaining 10 per cent duty on spare parts and for the abolition of duty on tyres and tubes.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the Green Paper on Transport Policy, the question of the cost competitiveness of the Irish road freight industry is being kept under review.  The recent study into cost of road hauliers in Ireland and the UK, though not conclusive, does not appear to support the view that there is a wide margin in favour of UK hauliers.</P>
    <P>The question of competition from semi-State bodies enjoying State subsidy was also raised.  CIE hold a merchandise <Col N="433" /> licence but I must stress again that CIE do not receive any subsidy for their road haulage operations.  They compete at present with other hauliers for business and will continue to do so.  The effects of the liberalisation measures on CIE will be no different from those to be faced by other hauliers.  The B &amp; I do not hold a merchandise licence but operate a haulage service in the Dublin exempted area. The company maintain a panel of between 120 and 160 licensed hauliers for the transport of their containers throughout the country.  The transport of those containers provides business of the order of £4½ million for the hauliers concerned. The road transport department operate at a profit and do not benefit from any moneys received from the State.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by B &amp; I that there are standard rates for vehicles and containers carried on their ships and these are applied irrespective of whether they are owned by the company or other persons.</P>
    <P>On the question of own account operators being permitted to engage in carriage for reward, I must stress that if own account operators want to carry for reward &mdash; either back or forward loading &mdash; they will have to get the new licence. To get this like all other applicants they will have to meet the requirements of good repute, sound financial standing and professional competence.  Own account operators have always had the possibility to acquire merchandise licences by transfer but very few have availed of this. The trend since liberalisation was initiated has been for a greater share of haulage to be done by the professional hauliers.  This has also been the case in the UK.  If hauliers improve their services, particularly as regards regularity and reliability, they should be able to continue to improve their share of the market.</P>
    <P>I think it is important to say that road freight transport on own account is not of itself to be criticised.  A great deal of it, such as specialised transport of petroleum, fuels or foodstuffs, is essential <Col N="434" /> on grounds of safety or hygiene.  Nevertheless, in general, it is likely to be inefficient as well as costly in environmental terms.</P>
    <P>In the normal way, own account road freight transport is devoted either to delivery only or collection only and so condemned to unladen running for up to half the mileage performed.  That in itself must be excessively costly, as is the fact that the inadequacies of own account transport call for higher numbers of vehicles than would a fully utilised national fleet.  Moreover, if there are too many vehicles on the roads, road costs go up and there are high indirect costs in terms of congestion and environmental damage, not to mention fuel consumption.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Prima facie,</i> therefore, it would be better to have an efficiently used and adequate professional transport fleet than a continuous increase of investment to meet the needs of own account carriage. Nevertheless, I have to stress that there are no hard or fast rules.  If the requirement of an own account operator is to keep his vehicle moving fast but under strict control, empty running in one direction may be an essential to meeting his needs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson asked for some details of own account operations in other member states.  The most recent EC road freight statistics on this are for 1983 from the magazine <i>Eurostat.</i> According to those, carriage on own account for internal journeys only in the other seven member states for which statistics have been published &mdash; figures are not available for Italy and Luxembourg &mdash; averages 39 per cent of total, ranging from about 28 per cent in Greece to about 54 per cent in Belgium.  The own account share for Ireland is shown as 66 per cent, so one can see that we are away above the highest other member states in the EC.</P>
    <P>In the matter of leasing of vehicles I know that the licensed hauliers are opposed to the proposal to allow short term leasing of vehicles for own account operations. In my opinion it would not be practicable to provide against short term <Col N="435" /> leasing once long term leasing is allowed. The removal of control on smaller vehicles in 1978, coupled with the fact that in the exempted areas there never was any restriction on long term or short term leasing by own account operators, renders the leasing question marginal.  Reference was made to a suggestion by the CII that is should be possible to lease a vehicle with a driver.  I would see this as creating another means of law evasion under which unlicensed persons could carry for reward by having themselves leased along with their vehicles.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies thought there should be provision for impounding of vehicles where serious offences are detected.  The more serious offences are likely to arise under the Road Traffic Acts which are administered by the Minister for the Environment for example speeding, excessive weight, mechanical defects. These Acts already give powers of detention to the gardaí in relation to serious defective vehicles.  I have been in touch with the Minister for the Environment and he has informed me that he is considering, in the context of a review of road traffic legislation, whether similar powers might be provided for other offences under road traffic law.  We do not consider that offences under Road Transport Acts &mdash; illegal haulage &mdash; warrant detention.</P>
    <P>There was also a suggestion for the establishment of a licensing authority to grant licences in accordance with the demand of the market.  In my opinion there is no case in the context of qualitative control for a licensing authority. Indeed, it would be contrary to the concept of liberalisation.  Also under a qualitative system there is no correct distinction by which I could make fish of one and flesh of another.  We have had a supply and demand provision in the law since 1944 and it has been completely unworkable.  No one in the future will be entitled to hold a licence without holding the appropriate qualifications and continuing to hold them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ned O'Keeffe was concerned that the position in regard to the carriage <Col N="436" /> of livestock should not be adversely affected by the enactment of the Bill.  I can assure the Deputy that the position in that respect will not be altered.  Transport of cattle, sheep and pigs within the State has been exempt from licence control since 1971.  Hauliers engaging in international haulage of such animals will, as now, have to satisfy the requirements of good repute, financial standing and professional competence and will also need permits except in the case of operations to and from Northern Ireland restricted to 25km on either side of the Border.  Under an EC directive carriage of live animals in special vehicles, while subject to permit, is exempted from quota restrictions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly, in reference to section 12 which empowers me to grant temporary permission for a maximum of 18 months for the carrying on of a business where the licensee or designated person dies or becomes physically incapacitated, consider that the time should be extended.  The position is that as the EC directive on admission to the profession specifically limits the temporary permission period to a maximum of 18 months, I cannot modify this provision.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I would again remind all Deputies that the regulations governing access to the occupation are EC regulations and I cannot, in general, vary what the EC stipulates.  There is some discretion as to the level of certain criteria and I intend, as already indicated, to maintain standards at a high level.  I must not, however, apply standards which would discriminate against Irish hauliers <i>vis-à-vis</i> their opposite numbers in other Community countries.</P>
    <P>There was some criticism of the condition of our roads.  I think the 1985 road plan clearly demonstrates the Government's determination to develop the road network.  Progress to date on the implementation of this major improvement programme has been very satisfactory.  Of the 54 projects listed to start or to be completed up to the end of 1987, 28 are in progress, compulsory purchase orders have been confirmed for eight projects, one bridge order has been <Col N="437" /> confirmed and public inquiries have been held for 12 projects.  Of the nine projects scheduled to commence in 1985, eight have started and the remaining one, the Blackrock by-pass, will start in the first half of this year.</P>
    <P>In the two years 1985 and 1986, the State will have provided 97.5 per cent of the funding promised in the road plan, compared with 73 per cent in the first two years of the Road Development Plan for the eighties.  The 1986 allocation will maintain the programme at its 1985 level in real terms and it is not expected that the shortfall on improvement works will have a significant adverse impact on the programme of major projects outlined in the road plan.  Planning for 1987 is proceeding on the basis of the plan.</P>
    <P>Matters of detail in relation to particular provision of the Bill will be covered on Committee Stage.  I would like to thank Deputies once more for their very interesting contributions to the debate and for their generally supportive attitude to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Bill is of great importance.  It will have a very advantageous effect on the road haulage industry. I know there has been considerable apprehension in that industry about this Bill although it has been very muted of late.  Their apprehension is misplaced.  I have said to them at all times that this Bill represents a great opportunity for them, as has every previous liberalisation, this being the ultimate step.  They had a legitimate concern in the area of enforcement and I hope to rectify that ommission by a Committee Stage amendment.</P>
    <P>This Bill forms a part of a very major wrap of Transport Bills which have been before the House since Christmas or will be coming before one or other of the Houses in the next few weeks.  A total of ten or 12 Transport Bills will be enacted this year, including this one.  I would hope that the overall effect of all the legislation would be to transform Irish transport and to set the scene for a vibrant transport system for the years and decades ahead.</P>

    <P>I understand from section 4(1) that there are alternative layouts.  I know from dealing with certain semi-State bodies that <Col N="440" /> there have been discussions recently about historic cost accounting and a real, updated type of accounting.  Sometimes when semi-State bodies are making a case for extra equity they advance as an argument that, despite considerable progress during the period since their establishment, only a limited amount of money has been invested in them.  I recall getting figures for Aer Lingus, for example, which started out in the mid-thirties.  It gives a false impression if one considers the £500,000 investment of 1935 in terms of 1986.  The original investment would have to be updated in terms of what that kind of investment would mean 50 years later. I do not know what is the thinking behind the balance sheet formats.  Format 1 starts on page 22 and format 2 is on page 24.  From the general thrust of the Companies (Amendment) Bill I gather that the idea in outlining two possible formats there was to give people who examine the accounts an opportunity of fuller information about the accounts of the company.</P>

      <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy V. Brady on Tuesday, 8 April 1986:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to make immediate arrangements for Bord Gáis Éireann to take over the Dublin Gas Company in order to resolve the present crisis; to protect the substantial State investment and interests in the company and to ensure the future supply of natural gas to the Dublin area at reasonable prices.</P>
      <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>1.  To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notes that the Government intends to bring to a conclusion as soon as possible its consideration of the problems facing the Dublin Gas Company with a view to finding a solution for these problems, including the alternative of a State take over of the Company if this is deemed to be the most appropriate means; and that the Government's objective is to protect the substantial State investment and interests in the Company and to ensure the future supply of natural gas to the Dublin area at reasonable prices.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Government have slipped badly in relation to Dublin Gas. The losers because of the lack of action by the Government will be the consumers. Since the taxes were not paid, since An Bord Gáis were not paid and since the banks have stopped payment since last August, why has the Minister not acted before now?  Is the Minister aware that a <Col N="442" /> creditor could step in tommorrow and get a High Court injunction to take over the running of the Dublin Gas Company? Does the Minister realise that every consumer then would be cut off?  Does the Minister intend to step in and follow the advice of Deputy Albert Reynolds that Bord Gáis Éireann take over in the interim pending the setting up of an official board of management?  It is important that the Minister ease the worries of many people in relation to the Gas Company.</P>
      <P>I will not dwell on the inefficiency of the Gas Company, which is very evident. Every Deputy knows about the complaints in relation to conversions where people have to wait for sometimes three or four months to get a cooker part replaced.  Last week a colleague told me of a case where a person who had been converted to gas had had a problem.  A red van pulled up to the door with personnel to fix the cooker, but that personnel could not connect the central heating, which would be done when a white van arrived.  The white van did not arrive and the man had to spend the whole weekend without any gas supply.  The Minister may smile, but this is a fact.  There have been many complaints and people have been told that they will have to wait as long as eight weeks for full connection.  The system is totally inefficient.</P>

      <P>That is not my information. Is the Minister waiting for some creditor to step in and cut off the supply of gas to consumers?  Why will the Minister not allow An Bord Gáis to take Dublin Gas over in the interim pending the setting up of an efficient management <Col N="443" /> team to take over the running?  Gas consumers are entitled to any reductions in the cost of their fuel.  It is incumbent on this House to make certain that any fall in the price of fuel is passed on to all consumers.</P>

      <P>The Government will have to acknowledge that, while they are making considerable gains because of the lower prices of oil coming into the country, they may have to pay a little bit more in the long run to subsidise the people who have converted to natural gas.  That is very important.</P>

      <P>My only surprise that the financial position of the Dublin Gas Company is being debated in the Dáil relates to the time span from when the Government made available in various forms £126 million of taxpayers' money until the signs of financial difficulty, which appears to have been last August. Fianna Fáil have put down a motion calling for Bord Gáis Éireann to take over the Dublin Gas Company.  It was ironic to hear that well-known far left Socialist, Deputy Albert Reynolds, trying to speak with conviction here last night.  It was amusing, because I was in a position not too long ago to know precisely the deal that Fianna Fáil had made with Dublin Gas.  This present deplorable deal, hard though it is to imagine, is in some respects better.</P>
      <P>The story being put across by the Dublin Gas Company is that their difficulties arose because of the sharp decrease in the price of oil.  I and any rational person would accept that that has added to their difficulty, but it is not the basic difficulty in Dublin Gas.  If one looks back to when they first sought more money over and above the £126 million they already had made available to them by way of a reduction in the price of their gas supply from Bord Gáis Éireann, that was last August and the banks became concerned long before the drop in world oil prices.  Their story is just not credible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> It is unbelievable that these difficulties could have arisen in such a short time span.  The Government have a responsibility to look closely into that time span aspect of it.</P>
    <P>When we consider the financing of Dublin Gas and the money that was made available we find that the financial institutions concerned ensured that they would not be at any loss.  As Deputy Reynolds pointed out last night, the very strange financial arrangement entered into with the financial institutions benefited them considerably so that not only would they not suffer any loss but would make a considerable amount of money on the deal.  In other words, the financial institutions could have a good bet but with the taxpayer's money.</P>
    <P>I should like a straight answer to the question as to what financial risk the directors of Dublin Gas, either individually or collectively, are exposed to in this whole disgraceful business.  However, we do not have to pose any question regarding the taxpayers whose money financed this disaster without their being consulted or without any accountability to them by Dublin Gas either through this House or otherwise as to how the company mismanaged the huge amount of money involved.  To refer to a time before the Government made this made decision, we recall the very high profile public battle within Dublin Gas for places on the board, for control of the company.  When Mr. Kinsella was storming Dublin Gas neither he nor the people associated with him were doing that for a company that could have been bought lock, stock and barrel for £1.5 million.  This is the company to which the Government gave £126 million of taxpayers' money.  In the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Monday last one read that the price of the shares of Dublin Gas was 45p.  The capitalised sum was £1.5 million.  We are told now that the company and the fat cats who got their hands on Dublin Gas have come back to the Government to ask for more taxpayers' money in the form of a reduction in the price of their gas supply.  I have seen figures relating to a minimum reduction <Col N="445" /> of 20 per cent.  In money terms that probably represent more than the Gas Company are worth in their entirely.</P>
    <P>People here are used to hearing high figures quoted and can relate to them to some extent, but it is very difficult for the ordinary man or woman who is earning a week's wages and trying to pay off a mortgage and to feed, cloth and educate children to relate to such figures.  Neither could the many unfortunates who are trying to exist on social welfare payments be expected to relate to a grand figure of the order of £126 million.  We might consider more closely what that figure might represent.  For instance, it would represent the total budget for approximately six major hospitals without involving the closure of one bed.  A sum of £126 million would have allowed the Government to have doubled the relief provided for in the budget in respect of the PAYE catagory leaving an excess of up to £5 million.  Alternatively, £126 million would settle overnight the dispute with the teachers leaving change of £16 million or it would have allowed the Government to continue for another seven years that portion of the food subsidies that were removed this year.</P>
    <P>We might relate the £126 million also to the corporation of the second largest city in the State who are faced with the prospect of abolition because of a sum of £1.25 million.  Last week the Hope hostel, which catered for young boys sleeping rough in this city, had to close its doors, an event that a tiny proportion of that £126 million could have avoided.  If we take that figure together with the £120 million that was pledged to AIB when they became unstuck with their commercial gambling in the insurance business, we realise that some very unpleasant and difficult decisions had to be faced and voted on by Deputies in this House.  That could have been avoided if that £126 million had been available.  Instead the money was put at the disposal of a few private individuals.  The taxpayers or the Government neither own nor control the assets of Dublin Gas.  Apart from the £126 million, an additional £15 million of taxpayers' money is being used unlawfully <Col N="446" /> by the company for the Revenue Commissioners and for Bord Gáis.  Irrespective of political persuasion or so called ideology, could any sane person here make a rational case in political, economic or social terms for the use in that way of that kind of money?</P>
    <P>Hundreds of thousands of our people are suffering either by reason of what everyone acknowledges is an unjust tax system or by way of social welfare payments which by no stretch of the imagination are adequate, despite some people here foaming at the mouth in the past month or two about payments to unmarried mothers who are trying to rear their children on a few paltry pounds.  Those same people are not foaming at the mouth this evening in regard to the £126 million.  Dublin Gas should be taken over by the State for a number of reasons: to ensure that there is full control of the money that has already been put in by the State and other additional moneys, excluding that of the private individuals, to ensure there would be continuity of supply and to ensure that so far as possible employment in Dublin Gas would be safeguarded.  The reality is that when the conversion programme, which has been so generously financed by the taxpayer, is over, there will be redundancies. There is an unanswerable case for the taking over of Dublin Gas.</P>
    <P>When I resigned from the Cabinet on the issue of Dublin Gas I said that one of the beneficial effects of that was that the Tánaiste and leader of the Labour Party got the Energy portfolio.  I said I felt reassured by this development with regard to our natural resources.  Nothing has made me change my mind in that respect since.  Two weeks ago the Minister spoke about the exploration for oil.  He said publicly, courageously and properly, that there was a vicious campaign being carried out against the Government in relation to their policy on oil.  He said that this was carried out by individuals and by a section of the media, 35 per cent of the media who were represented by the <i>Independent</i> group.  I supported that statement.  It reaffirmed my belief that the fact that he was put in charge of <Col N="447" /> the Department of Energy was a very positive development, and not only for the Labour Party.  I do not believe that our natural resources are the exclusive prerogative of the Labour Party.  They belong to the people of Ireland irrespective of their political, religious or any other beliefs.  The Minister is behaving as a proper trustee in safeguarding the natural resources of the Irish people against very powerful, greedy and ruthless groups in our society.  That 35 per cent of the media, who had an effect on the people by giving, as the Minister said truths, half truths and distortions, relate to the written media.  But some of the same group who were after the natural resources of the Irish people are also after the radio&mdash; they want our airways.</P>
    <P>Before the last summer recess I spoke on the Local Radio Bill, 1985, on the basis of a Labour Party statement made at a full Parliamentary Labour Party meeting.  That statement was issued unanimously.  It was not, as some of the media suggested, that it was Cluskey taking a flyer, Cluskey on his own &mdash; Cluskey expressing the collective view of the Parliamentary Labour Party.  The handing over of our airwaves to the same small group was also a unanimous view. If we look at all of this, whether it is oil, gas, other mineral wealth, airwaves or satellites, it is like going through the list of diplomatic cocktail parties.  The same people are involved.  Numerically there are very few of them, but boy do they have political clout and influence.  They can call the tune with some political parties.  It has been made clear to them by the Tánaiste that they will not call the tune with the Labour Party.  We will not compromise, not only the rights of our children but those of our children's children to their own natural resources. Fianna Fáil have a motion down and if you were to send it to <i>Our Boys</i> you might get £5 or £10 for it.</P>
    <P>It is hard to take seriously the deal which Fianna Fáil made with Dublin Gas. Political opportunism is all that really counts.  That was not always so, but unfortunately it is now.  Be that as it may, <Col N="448" /> Fianna Fáil have committed themselves here to nationalisation.  Last night the Tánaiste said this in his speech in relation to nationalisation: &ldquo;My view and the view of the Labour Party on issues related to natural gas distribution has been made clear in the past.&rdquo;  All the members of the Labour Party in this House want to nationalise Dublin Gas.  Fianna Fáil want to nationalise Dublin Gas.  I do not know &mdash; I have not heard them yet because they have not had an opportunity to get in&mdash;but I suspect that the two members of The Workers Party will also want to nationalise Dublin Gas.  If the people who are still within the ranks of the Cabinet are anxious to give more taxpayers' money to these private individuals and if they won the day, it would be a distortion of democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer in that five minutes to the role of the present Minister for Finance who was the chief pilot of this disastrous arrangement with Dublin Gas.  As everybody knows, I resigned.  One would read in the newspapers that it had to be pushed around the corridors and lobbied to the ears of receptive journalists: &ldquo;Cluskey was not happy in Government.  He was frustrated for this reason or that reason.&rdquo;  I was frustrated because Dublin Gas came to my attention in January 1983.  I lived with that Dublin Gas file and arguments within the Cabinet until November.  I resigned in December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Minister for Finance, then Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, was, to say the least, vigorous and enthusiastic about this deal.  It went above and beyond the normal, natural and, in my opinion, obligatory commitment of a Minister to a Departmental position.  I was frustrated by being denied access to documentation by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on the question of Dublin Gas to which I was entitled not only as a member of the Cabinet but as a Minister in charge of a Department who because of the prices mechanism had a <Col N="449" /> legitimate right.  I was frustrated by not being told of meetings which were being held and on which the Department, which I had the honour of being the political head, was not represented.  I was frustrated by the selective circulation of memos in relation to Dublin Gas.  So, certainly if someone said I was frustrated, I was.  Those are the reasons I was frustrated because I put up with that for 12 long months.  Members of the Cabinet, with the exception of the Minister for the Public Service, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, who was not there, know that what I am saying is a statement of fact.</P>
    <P>I do not now see the high profile of the champion of Dublin Gas, a private company, who put £126 million of taxpayers money at its disposal which was undoubtedly there when he told us that this was a great deal for the Irish tax payer.  I will relate it to something else. In the Tánaiste's speech of last night he stated, apart from the company owing the Revenue Commissioners and Bord Gáis there was &ldquo;... non payment of State debt and deferment of other major creditors.&rdquo;  That means people are owed money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take that minute to relate the two.  The same Minister, Deputy Bruton, who rammed this deal through, sat on the Company Law Bill which I left and which would have given some protection.  It would have made the directors of this company to some degree answerable if this company goes into liquidation.  If the Minister had been as enthusiastic about looking after the workers and creditors in the many companies that have gone to the wall by pursuing what was already, when I left office, the Company Law Bill, which has not seen the light of day yet, he would have been better employed.  It is legitimate to say in the face of this that the same Minister, Deputy Bruton, should be examining his position and maybe should be giving consideration to doing what I would regard <Col N="450" /> in these sad and tragic circumstances as the honourable thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very intently to what Deputy Cluskey had to say and I must say that what he said made a lot of sense.  I quite understand the frustration he must have gone through.  What he said, of course, is a damning indictment of his colleagues in the party who are in the Cabinet.  That is a serious matter and calls for further questioning of Deputy Cluskey on these issues.  I have no doubt that Deputy Cluskey is very sincere.  Forgetting the fact of whether or not there is opportunism in this, the fact is that Fianna Fáil have gone on record as demanding nationalisation.  In those circumstances I am asking Deputy Cluskey why does he not support this motion tonight if what he says is true and if he is as sincere as he says?  If he wants to see an end to these gangsters, as he calls them, and Dublin Gas brought under State control, he has no alternative but to support the Fianna Fáil motion tonight.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have come out in unequivocal language in stating that they want nationalisation of the company.  It is the only option open to the State.  We have seen a situation where a grossly irresponsible and inefficient management have been operating the company.  I must say that the Tánaiste stands indicted in knowing about this body for so long which is supported so strongly by the State and which is actually withholding and using money belonging to its workers.  That is the first illegal act.  Any small company resorting to that have found themselves in liquidation overnight.  Still, the Tánaiste by his complacent attitude towards this company is actually conniving with them in this very serious situation. The company are using their own employees' tax money.</P>
      <P>A second point is that they owe £13 million to An Bord Gáis.  As Deputy Reynolds said last night, there is a great danger.  The Tánaiste has admitted the fact that there are other creditors.  There is a great danger with this company that other creditors may move through the courts to have a liquidator appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="451" /> This company have behaved irresponsibly and inefficiently; no measures will correct it at present.  Some years ago, in the same situation, the State gave Dublin Gas a massive loan to help them out of their difficulties.  The company repaid the loan when they found they were in profit and wanted to continue as a private company. I do not think we should give them the opportunity again.  The State investment is too heavy.  It is up to the State to recoup its investments and to guarantee and consolidate its investment by taking the company over and soon.  Let me say to the Tánaiste that there is a great opportunity for him now to show that the Labour Party have muscle in the Cabinet and that they cannot be walked on, which seems to happen at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's concern is very striking.  It touches my heart.  The Deputy has not said something sincere for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is sincere at the moment but the Labour Party do not have the necessary muscle in Cabinet and Deputy Cluskey has spelled this out.  It is up to the Minister to prove that they have muscle in the Cabinet and to come into this House and announce that this company will be nationalised in order to safeguard taxpayers' money. The Minister says he has the interests of the workers at heart and he has stated that he will nationalise this company. Prove it, and if Fine Gael do not accept what Labour want they will have no alternative but to withdraw from the Cabinet and to take a stand on this very important principle.  In my view it is very important that they do this.</P>
      <P>The company are using taxpayers' money, money they owe to An Bord Gáis and the Revenue Commissioners but not in the interests of the consumers.  Their consumer policy has been deplorable. They left consumers without gas supplies for long periods and they offer a very poor customer service.  They have a great opportunity to serve the public now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State has an obligation to the taxpayer, <Col N="452" /> to the employees of Dublin Gas and to the gas consumers to bring the company under the umbrella of An Bord Gáis not only to end price squabbles but to provide a decent service under State supervision.  The Minister's attitude to this has puzzled me because he has known about this for many months but he tried to run away from it.  Deputy Cluskey said this problem plagued him for eight months.  Last evening the Minister accused Fianna Fáil of opposing nationalisation and supporting it, as the occasion suited them.  Now he supports nationalisation when it suits him but he opposes it when it does not suit Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>The Gas Company are in a mess of their own making.  The State investment is as high as £200 million but the banks have a 25 per cent equity in this company for as little as £5 million.  This raises a number of questions and, unless we act now, the State may not be able to consolidate its investment.  Time is of the essence.  It is not enough for the Minister to say they are considering a number of options.  The time is ripe for the State to take over this company and they should offer the workers in Dublin Gas workers' shares at nominal prices.  This is an opportunity for the Labour Party who have preached worker participation and nationalisation, to give workers an opportunity to buy shares in their own company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate was proceeding along a certain course with Fianna Fáil arguing that An Bord Gáis should be involved in the operation of the Dublin Gas Company but, as a result of Deputy Cluskey's contribution, we have reached a more serious stage. Deputy Cluskey made some very serious accusations about the performance of Government since the Coalition came into power, charges which in my view leave the Taoiseach with no alternative but to come into this House and answer. I mention in particular the serious charge that, when Deputy Cluskey was a member of that Cabinet as Minister for Trade and Tourism, responsible for price control, he was refused a sight of memoranda <Col N="453" /> which were circulating within the Cabinet.  He charged that there was controlled circulation of memoranda with the Cabinet and that only some Cabinet members were allowed to see specific memoranda dealing with an investment of £126 million of taxpayers' money.  That is a major political charge which the Taoiseach has no alternative but to come in here and refute.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cluskey made a further charge that from January 1983 until his resignation he was refused access to files which he requested.  These files related directly to matters for which he had responsibility given to him under the Constitution.  The Trade and Tourism portfolio dealt with price control, including the price control of Dublin Gas.  I repeat that Deputy Cluskey made the accusation that he was refused access to files.  If that is so&mdash;or if it is not so&mdash;the Taoiseach has no alternative but to come into this House and clear the record, because these are constitutional charges.  They do not relate only to Dublin Gas; they relate to the performance of Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cluskey made very serious charges about Deputy J. Bruton, the present Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance has a very special responsibility in relation to the running of the country.  If the Taoiseach is to maintain credibility for his Government in the eyes of the country, he must come into this House and clarify the position as to Deputy Bruton's performance in the negotiation of that deal which involved £126 million of taxpayers' money. After the specific charges made by Deputy Cluskey the Taoiseach has no alternative but to come here and clarify the position.  Very serious political and constitutional charges were made by Deputy Cluskey,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey has tonight pulled back the curtain on what we all knew was going on in Cabinet but which had been hushed up by the handlers who kept the information from the public and portrayed the image of a united team. Deputy Cluskey's speech will go down in the record of this Parliament as the <Col N="454" /> first pulling back of the veil on the performance of this Government.  I repeat the Deputy Cluskey made the specific charges that he was refused sight of memoranda which were circulating among certain Ministers, despite the fact that he had constitutional responsibility for the Department of Trade and Tourism, for the pricing of Dublin Gas and for overseeing the operations of that company. He was refused access to files, to which he requested access, in relation to the Dublin Gas Company.  He made very serious charges about the Government's whole performance at that time and specifically the now Minister for Finance who was then Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy John Bruton, in relation to his handling of £126 million of Government funds.  Deputy Cluskey put it as follows.  He talked about the small group &mdash;who were the same group of oil share-holders&mdash;who were involved.  He described it as the embassy cocktail party list, and he commented that the same people had connections with some political parties but not the Labour Party.  Let me say to Deputy Cluskey in this House that all he has to do is judge the coverage that Fianna Fáil get in some 35 per cent of the media and he will see that they have no connection with the Fianna Fáil Party. The bedfellows whom Deputy Cluskey is talking about are in the Fine Gael Party, not in Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey said he was very reassured by the performance of the Minister since he took up responsibility for the Department of Energy.  To be fair to Deputy Cluskey, he said that natural resources were not the exclusive prerogative of the Labour Party.  I agree with him, as can be seen by the resolution that we have before this House tonight. Deputy Cluskey and others might talk about political opportunism.  We say it is responding to a dire political need. Deputy Cluskey might have confidence in the Minister, Deputy Spring, in relation to his performance in the Department of Energy but I have not much confidence in him.  How could one?</P>
    <P>Look at the Dublin Gas Company situation alone.  In August 1985, the banks <Col N="455" /> first stopped funding the operations of the Dublin Gas Company.  There has been no bank funding for them since 8 August 1985.  We are now in mid-April 1986 and it is only as a result of Fianna Fáil putting down this resolution that the issue is being discussed at this stage tonight and this milk and watery amendment is put down by the Government.  Dublin Gas Company have been left high and dry since August 1985 by the banks and by the Minister for Energy in whose performance some Members of this House have confidence.  We are told that BGE have not been paid for their gas for many months.</P>
    <P>In addition to all of that, a large debt is due to the Revenue Commissioners, somewhere in the region of £2 million, but what have this Government and this Minister for Energy done about it since August 1985?  From August, to September, October, November, December, January, February, March, April is eight months and no action was taken until Fianna Fáil put down this resolution, and now we are accused of political opportunism. Thanks be to God somebody is acting as a watchdog on behalf of the taxpayers.  The banks were still making profits on their interest charges and on their holdings, but what was happening to the taxpayers' money?  The taxpayer is the loser in this.  Only the taxpayer is losing, nobody else.  Government credibility was lost tonight, of course, as a result of the speech which unveiled that can of worms on the far side of the House.</P>
    <P>This Minister for Energy tells us that after September meetings took place between the Dublin Gas Company and BGE in relation to the set of circumstances that arose from the changes in the price of oil and the general financial situation that the Dublin Gas Company found themselves in.  The projections formed a basis for monitoring a project and were reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis thereafter.  The whole thing has been one comedy of errors.  We have BGE not being paid by the Dublin Gas Company, the Dublin Gas Company getting no money from the banks, but <Col N="456" /> they are using some of their cash flow to continue their conversion project which has now 72 out of 85 sectors completed. In the meantime they are going further into debt and the Minister for Energy sits there washing his hands of the whole situation and ignoring it totally until we put down this resolution.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Gas Company have over 1,000 people full-time employed.  Up to 400 are involved in the conversion project. If for no other reason than just the jobs of those workers, surely you would assume that the Minister for Energy who has the responsibility would involve him-self&mdash;or the Minister for Labour would involve himself&mdash;in the operation to protect the jobs and the investment.  No, he sat back.  The Dublin Gas Company and BGE got together, as was within the terms of their contract, to try to renegotiate the price being paid by the Dublin Gas Company in view of the fall in oil prices.  They could not come to an agreement and at that stage, in February they referred it to the Minister.  The Minister has had it on his desk since February and is only now bringing it to Cabinet and hopes to come to a decision within the next week.</P>
    <P>What would have happened if Fianna Fáil had not put down their resolution? It is not that we particularly admire BGE as an efficient and effective organisation, but we see them as the only vehicle to involve themselves in the operations of the Dublin Gas Company.  Nothing would have happened and the situation would have dragged on with no solution, and the taxpayer would continue to lose with nobody protecting his interests.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey told us in this House tonight, very accurately I assume, that a majority of the Members of this House support the idea of nationalisation.  We were told that the Labour Party support it.  They are in Government.  There are four of them at the Cabinet table, one with responsibility to handle the issue, a responsibility given to him by the Taoiseach and, under the Constitution, by the President.  They are the ones involved in the Cabinet, and the Labour Parliamentary <Col N="457" /> Party support the resolution that we have put down.  Deputy Cluskey presumed to speak for The Workers' Party and I will presume to do the same thing.  They would support it.  Fianna Fáil put the resolution down.  A majority in this House are in favour of national intervention whether by BGE or some other vehicle. BGE are the only vehicle available, so we suggest that they should be used for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Having listened to flowery speeches tonight on this subject let us test the mettle of the Labour Party on this issue and see whether they vote with us.  It is easy to make speeches about it, to churn out the cliches in favour of natural resources that we have heard time and time again from the Labour Party over the years.  This amendment put down in the name of the Minister for Energy by the Government was described by my colleague, Deputy Reynolds, as another bit of Coalition sellotape.  Let us see if the sellotape is strong enough tonight in view of the views articulated here by members of the Labour Party with regard to nationalisation. Let us see if the sellotape is strong enough tonight or whether their convictions are strong enough and whether they will vote with Fianna Fáil on this issue.  Let there be no doubt about it: they might accuse us of opportunism but what we have down is right.  They in their hearts support it and let it be supported here because only in that way can they take the right and proper course of action and carry it against Fine Gael. That is basically what it is about.  It is about the rest of this House having a particular point of view.  One person in Fine Gael was fingered tonight by Deputy Cluskey and unfortunately that man is the Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton. When the announcement was made with regard to this package Deputy Bruton gave interviews and said that if things went astray the banks will be the losers. The truth of the matter is that it is not the banks who have lost &mdash; they are still getting their interest &mdash; but, as always in dealing with this Government, the taxpayer. So we have an opportunity to vote tonight on loudly declared, deeply held <Col N="458" /> views with regard to the abuse of £126 million of taxpayers' funds.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of merit in the course of action we have proposed.  One aspect of it that I am very much in favour of is that the whole area of Dublin would be under the control of An Bord Gáis rather than having the narrow view that Dublin Gas takes with regard to the city and then a certain extension out to the outskirts. If An Bord Gáis were involved the advantages of natural gas would be made available to my constituents at a very early stage.  There would be an extension of the gas pipeline to the towns of Swords, Malahide, the areas around Portmarnock and the northern areas of the constituency. Logic dictates that if one has a resource such as natural gas it should be made available to our horticultural industry, users of a considerable volume of energy, so that they can compete against the Dutch and the other continentals who are themselves recipients of natural gas.  If An Bord Gáis were involved they would be more inclined to extend the gas grid and in that way build up the clients of the company to the eight times growth factor that was considered when this deal was originally announced.  We are probably at two or three times the growth factor rather than the eight which was required to make this £126 million a financial success.</P>
    <P>I want to see this Private Members' Motion of ours passed for very much the same reasons that Deputy Cluskey enumerated: to ensure the control of the money that has been invested and will be further invested by the taxpayer; to ensure the continuity of supply to those that have the supply and to ensure continuity to an extended area within the Dublin region; to ensure that the employment of those within the Gas Company will be maintained.  We have heard carping criticism of some of the operations of the Gas Company.  No public utility is perfect but on the whole the Gas Company do a very good job and the workers in that company are entitled to some security with regard to the maintenance of their employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> In conclusion, in view of the very serious charges which Deputy Cluskey made against the Taoiseach, the Taoiseach has no alternative but to take the first opportunity available to him to come and answer the accusations and charges made against him, against the performance of the Government in relation to the refusal to provide sight of the files, in relation to the refusal to circulate memoranda to particular Ministers of Government, and against the general performance of the then Minister for Energy and Industry, Deputy Bruton, who is now Minister for Finance.  In view of his position as Minister for Finance, I feel that the Taoiseach has no alternative, morally, constitutionally and politically but to come into this House and answer the specific charges made about the Government's performance and to answer the charges made tonight when the lid of the can of worms was lifted and there were no national handlers around to protect it and try to beautify it.  It is not a very pretty sight that was painted for us by Deputy Cluskey here tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few public words about this. Fianna Fáil are presented with a lot of ammunition which Deputy Burke has endeavoured to use.  He spoke about the Government portraying themselves as very united and said that that image has now been broken.  But there is quite a lot of political play around that and it is not very difficult to look back and see how Fianna Fáil portrayed themselves as a very united party until this image was broken.  He did confirm that big business has finally abandoned Fianna Fáil and that is the reason they have now to go to the United States to raise money to fund this depleted Republican party.  I think that can of worms has been opened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that explanations and redress are required and corrections must be made.  This happened in the early stage of Government and, maybe, in the first flush of power of Government.  Certain people would agree with Deputy Cluskey's implied criticisms that there are <Col N="460" /> certain people who think that private enterprise is the answer to all things and that whenever one has a project or a business or an industry one hands it over to them and they will have all the answers.  But we must remember that at the time there was a grab-all approach to Dublin Gas, especially from the point of view of some small vested interests who thought they were going to get their hands on a virtual gold mine and who thought they were going to print themselves money from then until the end of the century.  I remember myself, 25 to 30 years ago, going out of this country on the emigrant boat and noticing a few large companies that were around and the power that was vested in the directorships held by the members of the boards of those companies in Dublin.  I suppose it was akin to what is often referred to as the merchant princes of Cork but it is much smaller than Dublin.  When I came back years later I found all the same people controlling the same amount of power and now, a quarter of a century on, you will still find them, bowed, maybe greyed, balding, but nevertheless still hanging on there in the boardrooms of the big conglomerates of Dublin.  It is no accident that when oil is struck or other resources come within reach of the economic saviours of the country, the same people and their friends turn up in those places as well.</P>
    <P>It is also no accident that since the foundation of the State there is a cyclical operation whereby the same professional classes and vested interests for whom the State seems to have been founded keep turning up.  If you go to their funerals or read about them you will notice that the same people turn up there too, those who turned up at AGMs and EGMs.  The small man sends in his proxy vote because he feels very much out of place in those surroundings.</P>
    <P>Mistakes were made and at the time private submissions were made to nationalise Dublin Gas.  At the time I thought what they were trying to do was impossible, to pull a 19th century company into the 20th century without the technology to ease the transition.  Their resources, <Col N="461" /> materials and assets were rotting under the streets of Dublin and had to be replaced.  A few people thought that they could get their hands on a gold mine if they could become involved with and take control of the company.  I believe that they probably had innocent but willing co-operation from members of the Government and Departments.  At the time the advice of consultants was sought and although I have never seen it published, I understand that a report was furnished to the Cabinet.  These consultants were from the private sector, the same type of consultants who advise on massive take-overs and investments.  I think that the advice given then was not to privatise the company but to nationalise it.  Unfortunately, that mistake has cost us in the region of £126 million.  That is all very well if you have a pot to dip into and if a Government operate as though that pot was theirs to use as they will but, if things are to run properly, that is not the case and you are simply robbing the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Maybe we can make amends here by rationalising the company, making it work properly and preparing it for the 21st century.  We were dragged into the AIB debacle but if we let the present situation continue debts will accumulate and the State will have no option but to rescue the company.  Contrast that with the case of a company with small resources who try to operate a business out of a cash flow.  All the interests operating against those small businesses, including banks, will very quickly pull the rug from underneath them.</P>
    <P>I do not see why the sympathy of this House or the people with one-third of the population on social welfare, should be on the side of those who have had every chance to make a go of it.  They invested. They knew what they were doing, They carried out research and decided to go forward.  They made a mess of it and we should not take them out of that particular hole.  The basic aim of the project was to capture the premium market then and the Government adopted a policy of depleting the Kinsale gas field over a short period of time.  The whole industrial <Col N="462" /> and domestic market was there for the company to take advantage of.  The market targets were not reached and I realise, as everybody else does, that commercial decisions are made on the basis of the situation prevailing at the time.  It must have been clear to the company at all times that the targets had to be achieved to service the debt obligations negotiated and entered into by Dublin Gas.  Equally, it must have been clear that the premium part of the mix with its higher contribution of profits, had to be achieved.  In that, the company singularly failed and I do not think there will be much sympathy from the people of Dublin if the company goes under and has to be taken over.  We should remember that there are instances where the State has got involved very successfully and has run companies profitably.  On an operation of this size, the Government should step in to get the company back to where it was a couple of years ago, even though we have lost a considerable amount of money in the meantime.  I hope that the Minister for Energy, when considering all the options before he makes a decision, will follow that course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this important motion put down by Deputy Vincent Brady which has become even more important because of the serious charges regarding the operation of the Coalition Government which were made by Deputy Cluskey earlier tonight.  We all know that Deputy Cluskey took a principled and honourable stand in regard to this matter and the fact that he has now disclosed that he was refused documents about the pricing policy relating to Dublin Gas is very important and one which the Taoiseach is, in duty, bound to answer.  The people of Dublin and the rest of the country will want to know why a full Cabinet Minister who shares constitutional responsibility with the other members of the Cabinet was not given an opportunity to participate fully in the work of the Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important element arises here &mdash; why did the Minister for Energy stay in Coalition in these circumstances like a <Col N="463" /> pet mouse?  When Deputy Cluskey was treated in this disgraceful way why did the Minister continue in the Coalition Government?  This is one of the major questions which arises from the disclosures here tonight.  It is all very well to say that the Minister for Energy is favourably disposed towards Labour Party policy generally and that he will do his best but there are points of principle which should be observed.  Deputy Cluskey stood very clearly on a point of principle and it is quite clear that while he supported the Minister and held his peace until now in relation to this, he has made it very clear tonight what actually happened.  We have got a different view of the Coalition Government and one which the Minister for Energy and other Labour Party Ministers must answer because it is not sufficient for them to remain silent on such a major issue, a central element in national policy.</P>
    <P>Gas users in Dublin want a stable and competitive price regime with security of supply.  They need protection from the wide fluctuations of the international energy market.  The present pricing arrangements, which were known to management to be unsuitable a year ago because of falling oil prices and other factors, have failed.  That is obvious and that is the element Deputy Cluskey foresaw in 1983.  The present arrangements have also punished the Dublin householder as well as the industrial producer who uses gas.  This is not something that has had an indirect effect on people.  It has had major consequences for some producers in the last year.</P>
    <P>The price of natural gas did not fall in line with the general decline in energy costs.  Householders who have invested heavily in gas-fired central heating found that Dublin Gas were unable to protect them from this rip-off.  Disillusioned consumers have been cutting back on consumption and are considering a switch back to oil or solid fuels, both of which are imported.  Others who were planning a change to natural gas are holding off because of the uncertainty which was allowed to develop over the past year. <Col N="464" /> The Dublin housewife is nobody's fool and she is able to judge the uncertainties and decide on where she should spend her money.</P>
    <P>Initially, natural gas was hailed as a major development in the fight to reduce air pollution and thereby improve the health of Dublin's citizens.  This policy is clearly now in jeopardy as the Dublin Gas Company are unable to control their own destiny and are now losing out to the cheaper alternatives of oil and coal which heavily pollute the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>The Government are obviously happy to allow this scandalous position to continue even though the Labour Party are collectively involved in Government at present.  Therefore, they are collectively responsible for Government decisions. Have the Labour Party in Government forgotten their roots?  They should not forget that it was the workers of the Dublin Gas Company who stood by Dublin's emerging labour movement, sometimes at great personal cost to themselves, as in the great lock-out of 1913. They constituted the backbone of the worker's campaign for better conditions and a decent living wage.</P>
    <P>The interests of these workers, and workers at large, as well as those of each and every householder in Dublin were not considered by the Labour Party of 1986 although massive profits were accruing to the Government of which the Labour Party are a part.  By retaining the Dublin Gas Company, and by not nationalising the company, they would continue to bleed the Dublin consumer and allow the private company to carry the odium.  Margaret Thatcher would be proud to have such Labour Ministers in her Government.  I can hear her saying: &ldquo;Why cannot I have some docile Labour people who would comply with my medicine?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>While Dublin Gas were kept at arm's length, An Bord Gáis raked in the profits for the Government.  A look at the annual report shows that their profit before taxation rose from £17 million in 1981 to £80 million in 1984.  Even more interesting is the way in which these profits were applied as directed by the Minister for <Col N="465" /> Energy to the Exchequer: £71 million in 1984 and £63 million in 1983.  Included in that £71 million in 1984 is £17 million which went to the Gas Company to be repaid in 1991.  However, it is still coming back to the Exchequer.  It was the Minister, according to a statement by Bord Gáis, who directed that method of disposal of the profits.  Therefore, the Government continued to enjoy the rip-off while the Dublin consumer suffered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey was involved from January to December 1983 but he became so frustrated with what was happening that he could not take any more. He was also frustrated because he was being kept in the dark but he got enough information to realise that money was being taken away from this area with the result that consumers would lose out.</P>
    <P>The State, via Bord Gáis, brought natural gas to Dublin.  This involved a large capital outlay by the State.  To justify this there must be increased utilisation in Dublin of the order of seven or eight fold. A mere four fold incease has only been achieved.  How would a greater increase be achieved in present circumstances?  It could not happen up to now because of the uncertainty that has existed for almost a year in regard to Dublin Gas. While that uncertainty exists consumers are not going to invest in changing to natural gas.  They will hesitate and wonder if they would be better off changing to oil.  How can the board of Dublin Gas claim that they are on target if things continue as they are?  How can they justify their competitiveness when they need a big enough price reduction to compensate for the loss of competitiveness with oil?</P>
    <P>The reality is that a 20 per cent reduction in gas charges is needed and needed now.  The fact is that not only is gas a vital natural resource but the Gas Company are in a commercial strait jacket. This resource cannot fluctuate widely under external market factors.  It is a fundamental resource for the Irish people and responsibility for maintaining supplies and controlling prices in the best interests of the consumer must lie with the Government and not with the banks. <Col N="466" /> The dog should be wagging the tail and not the tail wagging the dog, as in this case.</P>
    <P>Our other energy board, the ESB provide a national grid as well as maintaining a sales and maintenance service.  Dublin Gas provide only a national grid without a similar commitment to the consumer. Now, we have the banks backing off.  This has led to uncertainty among the public. The public should be reassured that there is a definite policy for gas where their interests are concerned.  It is vital that their interests are protected and that we should consider the interests of consumers in Limerick, Cork and other centres. We must have a strategic policy for energy, a policy which must be in the interests of the Irish citizens, one which will protect the interests both of the private consumer and of industry and one which will insulate the consumer, as far as possible, from the fluctuations of the open world markets.  We know that prices go up and down in relation to the prices on the world market but the consumer must receive the protection which is possible. The arrangements that exist are designed, as the Minister said for occasions when the price will rise.  Whoever thought that the price of oil would keep on rising?  In my view it was obvious that it would not continue to do that.  The consumer needs to be protected from the fluctuations that are taking place at present.</P>
    <P>If Dublin Gas fail to reach their targets then the State will have to pick up the pieces.  It is preferable for the State to do this now and for Bord Gáis to take over the Dublin Gas Company, as suggested in our motion, to resolve the present crisis, to protect the substantial State investment and interests in the company and to ensure that the future supply of natural gas to Dublin will be available at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>This is one of the most important issues that has come before the House in a long time and it has been made more important by the disclosures tonight by Deputy Cluskey.  He has given us an insight into the working of the Coalition in regard to one of our basic resources, <Col N="467" /> one which is of extreme importance to householders.  As Deputy Cluskey and Deputy Burke have said, householders in Dublin city and county, and industrialists including those involved in horticulture, need to be able to avail of natural gas.  In Government we ensured that natural gas would be available throughout the country and, in fairness to the Minister, he has gone further than the policy we initiated.</P>
    <P>We have down a motion affording the Labour Party an opportunity to ensure that this will happen.  We know, from what has been said by Deputy Cluskey, that the Labour Party are in a very invidious, uncertain and unhappy position within this Government.  We know that are being manipulated by the handlers and by the business interests who feed <Col N="468" /> off this Government.  We know that to be the reality; it has been clearly stated in the House this evening.  We are affording the Labour Party an opportunity to be shielded and protected, to cross the House this evening as they did on other occasions when they were prepared to support social legislation we were promoting. We call on them here this evening to come across and support us on this motion, to put into operation the kind of legislation which they claim they want to support.  It is not sufficient for the Minister for Energy to say: &ldquo;Lord, make me pure but not today.&rdquo;  We want the Minister to be pure today, to be a pure Labour man and support this motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, thank you for allowing me to raise this very important question of the closure of Tourmakeady all-Irish secondary school in the west Mayo Gaeltacht.  It is one more educational closure bombshell which has struck at the very heart of the Mayo Gaeltacht and at all those who have a love of the Irish language.  Caithfidh mé a rá gur baineadh preab mór as mhuintir Mhaigh Eo agus muintir na tíre uile nuair a fuair siad an droch scéal maidin inné, nuair a fógraíodh é do na mná rialta nach mbeadh siad ábalta leanúint ar aghaidh leis on scoil i dTuar Mhic Eide.</P>
      <P>This was a shock announcement to all concerned and interested in the Irish language throughout the country, but especially in the Gaeltachtaí in the west. It was incredible news to give to any teaching team at 11 o'clock in the morning, completely unexpected.  One must think of the considerable sums of money put into that school for reconstruction in the past year or two.  This made the closure all the more incredible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has to be stated also that the Minister for Education and, indeed, all who have an interest in the Irish language, have been shocked by this announcement.  It is a thrust against the very heart of the language revival because of the great standards of Irish that have been attained <Col N="471" /> in Tourmakeady secondary school and the magnificent tradition which has existed there for half a century or more, for the protection and development of the Irish language.  There are many questions that one could ask, but we have to express our horror and shock at this terrible bombshell that has been dropped on the Tourmakeady district, the people of Mayo and, in particular, the students, parents and all those who, over the years, have willingly given their assistance and support to this school.</P>
    <P>We would like to ask &mdash; and it is important for us to know this &mdash; when exactly did the Department of Education know of the closure that was to take place and what reaction did the Minister and his Department give to the authorities if and when they were informed of the closure?  What exactly is the Department's interest at this time in the buildings and the institution known as the Tourmakeady all-Irish secondary school? What will the Minister for Education do to try to alter the decision announced yesterday by the Sisters of Mercy to the staff in so far as the closure and the phasing out of the school are concerned? Will he guarantee to seek what means are available to him to try to keep the college open?  We make no apology at all for raising this matter and expressing our great disappointment and dismay that the Sisters of Mercy feel it necessary to curtail their activity in the school.  We also wish to know what the Department of Education, as the real custodian of the school and of the protection of the Irish language propose to do to save the day for this very worthy educational institution.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, ba mhaith liom mo buíochas a ghabháil leat as ucht cead a thabhairt dúinn an t-ábhar seo a thabhairt os comhair na Dála anocht.  Mar adúirt mo chara, An Teachta Flynn, anseo tugadh buille tubáisteach don Ghaeilge agus d'oideachas sa Ghaeilge nuair a rinneadh an fógra seo inné.  Tá stair iontach ó thaobh múineadh na Gaeilge sa choláiste seo ó bunaíodh é i 1931 agus lean an <Col N="472" /> coláiste ar aghaidh leis an obair iontach seo ar feadh na mblianta cé gur cuireadh deireadh leis mar choláiste ullmhucháin. Chuir sé sin isteach ar obair na Gaeilge a bhí ar siúl sa choláiste sin i gcaitheamh na mblianta.</P>
      <P>Chuir sé iontas agus fearg ar phobal Thuar Mhic Éide go dtarlódh a leithéid agus fágann sé an Ghaeltacht ar fad, Gaeltacht Chonnachta, tig linn a rá, gan scoil a mbeidh an meán oideachas inti trí Ghaeilge.  Ní thig linn glacadh leis sin agus sílim go bhfuil sé de dhualgas ar an Rialtas féachaint chuige go ndéanfar gach iarracht leis an gcoláiste seo a choinneáil ar siúl.  Tá cheana i Contae Mhaigheo áit ar choinnigh an pobal iad féin coláiste ar siúl &mdash; i mbaile álainn &mdash; nuair a d'fhág na mná rialta an scoil ansin, agus sílim go dtig linn a rá i leith muintir Thuar Mhic Éide, an pobal Gaelach uilig, Gaeilgeoirí ar fud na tíre, iar-scoláirí, go dtiocfaidh siad le chéile le gach cabhair a thabhairt leis an gcoláiste iontach seo a choinneáil ar siúl agus ba mhaith linn go mbeadh an Rialtas agus an tAire, os rud é go dtagann sé ón nDáil-cheantar ina bhfuil an scoil seo dhá dúradh sásta lán-tacaíocht a thabhairt leis an gcoláiste seo a choimead ar oscailt.  Sin é an méid a theastaíonn uainne.  Tá éagóir á dhéanamh ar Ghaeilgeoirí de bharr an coláiste seo a dhruid.</P>

      <P>Tá an-díomá ormsa mar iar-scoláire de chuid an choláiste gur thog Siúracha na Trócaire an cinneadh seo.  Ní chreidimse gur inné nó athrú inné a socraíodh an cinneadh seo a dhéanamh agus tá súil agam go bhfreagróidh an tAire Stáit na ceisteanna a chuir an Teachta Flynn air.  Cuireann sé díomá orm thar aon rud eile gur iar-scoláire de chuid an choláiste an Mháthair-Abb atá ag na Siúracha Trócaire a thóg an cinneadh seo, mar cheap mé go mbeadh níos mo suime aici-se i gcursaí scolaiochta trí Ghaeilge ná go ndúnfadh sí an coláiste.</P>

Cuirfidh sé isteach ar thuismitheoirí ar mhaith leo scolaíocht trí Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil, gan a bheith i bhfad ó bhaile, dá gcuid páistí agus cuirfidh sé isteach freisin go mór ar an bhfoireann teagaisc sa choláiste a tharraingíonn go maith le chéile agus tá faitíos orm go gcaillfear an áis mhór léinn seo do phobal na tíre trí chéile.</P>

      <P>Caithfidh mé mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí a labhair ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo.  Ar dtús, ní cinneadh Rialtais é seo.  Is mó airgead atá faighte ag an gcoláiste seo trí dheontais leis na blianta anuas agus ní raibh brú ar bith ar an gcoláiste ón Roinn ná ar na Siúracha an cinneadh seo a dhéanamh.  Is meán scoil príobháideach é Coláiste Mhuire, Tuar Mhic Éide atá faoi bhainistíocht Siúracha na Trócaire. Tá oideachas trí mheán na Gaeilge ar fáil sa scoil do chailíní&mdash;idir lae agus cónaithe.  Is é 164 an líon dalta atá ag freastal ar an scoil i mbliana; tá 98 díobh siúd ina ndaltaí cónaithe.  Tamall ó shin, i Mí Eanáir, chuir na Siúracha in iúl do mo Roinn-se&mdash;ní raibh mé féin sa Roinn mar Aire Stáit san am &mdash; go raibh siad tar éis an scéal a scrúdú agus go raibh siad den tuairim nach dtiocfadh leo leanúint leis an scoil a thuilleadh &mdash; go mórmhór toisc na deacrachtaí a bhain leis an scoil chónaithe.  Shocraigh siad, mar sin, éirí as an múinteoireacht i dTuar Mhic Éide ach nach bhfógrófaí é seo roimh am na Cásca.  Tá brón ormsa nach bhfuair <Col N="474" /> mé féin scéal faoi seo go dtí oíche inné agus is ar an radio a chuala mé é sin.  Ní raibh mé ag caint leis na Siúracha faoin chinneadh seo ar chor ar bith agus cuireann sé sin an-bhrón agus aiféala ormsa.</P>
      <P>Is cúis aiféala nach bhfuil na mná rialta i riocht leanúint le meán oideachas i gColáiste Mhuire, scoil inar deineadh sárobair ar son na Gaeilge agus a raibh cáil ar de bharr an ard-léibhéal múinteoireachta agus oideachais a bhí ar fáil ann.  Is mór mo mheas agus meas mo Roinne ar an sár-obair a rinne na Siúracha agus foireann na scoile i rith na mblianta.  Is ceist iontach deacair dúinne go léir as seo amach é.</P>
      <P>De réir mar a thuigimse an scéal, áfach, níl sé i gceist an scoil a dhúnadh go díreach ach de réir a chéile amach anseo. Mar adúirt mé, chuir na Siúracha in iúl don Roinn nach raibh siad ábalta an scoil chónaithe a choinneáil ar oscailt de bharr na deacrachtaí a bhain leis.  Freisin, bhí na Siúracha den tuairim nach n-éireodh go maith le scoil lae amháin toisc an líon fíor-bheag daltaí a bheadh ag freastal uirthi.  Glacaim leis gur mar sin atá an scéal.</P>
      <P>Caithfidh mo Roinn deimhin a dhéanamh de anois go mbeidh oideachas, mar adúirt an Teachta Flynn, ar fáil do na daltaí lae atá ag freastal ar Choláiste Mhuire faoi láthair ón uair, mar adeirtear, go ndúnfar é.  Ar an mbonn sin tá áthas orm a rá go mbeidh spás go leor ar fáil dóibh san phobalscoil nua atá á togáil i mBaile an Róba, más gá é sin.  Tá sé beartaithe go n-osclófar an scoil seo i 1987.</P>
      <P>Cuireann ceist fostaíochta na múinteoirí nuair a dhúnfar an scoil isteach go mór orm-sa agus ar na Siúracha, ar ndóigh agus, freisin, ar an Roinn.  Cé gur léir go bhfuil na múinteoirí fostaithe ag lucht bainistíochta na scoile, bheadh mo Roinn-se toilteanach aon mholadh i dtaobh obair eile a chur ar fáil dóibh i scoileanna eile a scrúdú chomh báúil agus is féidir,</P>

    <P>One concluding remark.  This is a very serious matter.  It is a bombshell for County Mayo and for Connacht in general.

During the past three years about £750,000 has been expended on a variety of development works at Cork airport and it is planned to expend about £1.2 million on such works in 1986.</P>
      <P>I have received a submission from Aer Rianta proposing an extension to the main runway and the provision of improved navigational aids at Cork airport. The proposal would require expenditure of about £2 million.  There are no provisions in this year's Estimates for such expenditure and even if there were the proposal would have to meet the criteria governing capital investment in the public sector.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 to 22, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The general thrust of Government policy represents a movement away from detailed price controls in favour of new measures to promote greater competition throughout the economy.  Detailed procedures requiring prior notification and approval of price increases have been allowed to lapse but the basic powers in relation to price control in the Prices Acts are being retained.  These include powers to impose price controls where restrictive practices result in excessive prices and the new Fair Trade Commission will advise as appropriate in relation to prices.</P>
      <P>The degree to which consumer prices can speedily reflect the impact of more favourable currency movements on import costs varies with the established purchasing arrangements of importers. Some importers may be committed to purchasing arrangements involving forward purchases of currency and this may delay a favourable impact on prices in some cases.  Price reductions in line with currency movements and international oil prices have been effected in a number of areas and further developments are being monitored.  I have no information available to me which would suggest that intermediaries are behaving in a manner detrimental to the interest of the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that there is keen price competition in the retail grocery sector and that this should help to ensure that the benefits of lower import prices should <Col N="372" /> be passed on to consumers.  Buyers should use their awareness of prices to encourage such competition.  Any case where the benefits of lower import costs are not adequately reflected in consumer prices can be dealt with if necessary under the various powers available to my Department.</P>
    <P>I have already asked the Examiner of Restrictive Practices to examine the price of alcoholic liquor and soft drinks in view of the provisions of the Restrictive Trade Practices (Intoxicating Liquor and NonAlcoholic Beverages) Order, 1965, which prohibits certain practices which are collusive in nature.</P>

This is being done on an ongoing basis within the financial constraints necessarily imposed on all Government spending.

      <P>Following reinvestigation of his unemployment assistance claim, the means of the person concerned were assessed at £21.60 weekly, derived from the value of board and lodgings on his parents' holding.</P>
      <P>The method of calculation of the value of board and lodgings where the household income is derived from farming is to estimate the yearly profit from the farm and to divide that amount between the members of the household, including the applicant, on a weighted basis.  The profit from the farm in this case was estimated at £4,500 per annum and the person concerned was deemed to enjoy a quarter of the income, that is, £1,125 per annum or £21.60 weekly.  He was, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at £12.20 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £33.80 less means of £21.60.  He ceased to sign as unemployed from 13 October 1985.</P>
      <P>The person concerned appealed against the assessment of means and it has now come to light that the original appeal was mislaid in the post.  A duplicate appeal has been prepared and arising from contentions made in support of his appeal the papers were referred to the social welfare officer for further inquiries. When the inquiries, which will be completed as quickly as possible, are completed, the papers will be submitted to an appeals officer for determination of means, at the earliest available opportunity. The delay in this case is regretted.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of EEC Regulation 797/85, on which the new Farm Improvement Programme is based, Community funding is available only in respect of investments carried out by full time farmers. In view of the limited financial resources available it is not possible at this time to provide funds from the national Exchequer to make grant-aid available to part time farmers.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will confirm that the purchasing of stores, uniforms, motor vehicles and other equipment for the Garda Síochána is done through the Department of Defence; if he feels that this is the most suitable and efficient method through which these items can be purchased; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Arrangements for the purchase of some stores for Garda use, mainly uniforms and transport, are made by a central purchasing unit in the Department of Defence, which arranges for the purchase of such stores for all Government Departments and for the Defence Forces as well as for the Garda Síochána.  These arrangements are designed primarily to achieve economies through the purchase of bulk supplies and by having purchasing procedures carried out by agencies which specialise in this work.  The arrangements were introduced when it became necessary to reallocate the central purchasing functions of the stores branch of the former Department of Post and Telegraphs. I have recently agreed to have <Col N="382" /> the present arrangements examined to see whether they can be improved in any way.</P>

      <P>The Committee on Garda Training has presented to the Commissioner a report concerning the basic training of new entrants to the Garda Síochána and I have received a copy.  The committee are still working on some additions which they wish to make to that report and it is expected that the completed document will be submitted to the Commissioner in the near future.</P>
      <P>The document so far available is already under consideration in my Department.  My hope is that it will be possible to implement at least some of the recommendations in time to benefit the new entrants to the Garda Síochána who will come from the next recruitment competition.  I have not as yet come to any decision in regard to publication of the report.</P>
