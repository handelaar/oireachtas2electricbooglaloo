    <Title>Courts Bill, 1986: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Government will demonstrate in the course of this debate that they have more concern for the administration of justice than they appear to have for the conditions of our courts arising from what my colleague, Deputy Wilson said about the collapse of the Cavan courthouse.  This Bill deals with the effective administration of justice, ensures that justice is properly discharged and that the balance between the plaintiffs and the defendants is presented and determined fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night I reviewed the alleged reasons for the introduction of this Bill by the Government and why it seems to us that the proposal is neither appropriate <Col N="547" /> nor just in those circumstances.  I will recapitulate briefly.</P>
    <P>First, the Minister did not say why this proposal, namely, trial by judge alone, is preferable to any of the seven options considered by the Government.  He confined himself to mentioning the various options and then said, without any explanation, justification or argument, that the Government had decided to propose the system of trial by judge alone.  I think the House is entitled to more than that on a matter which has been accepted by all as an established right.  It is for the Government to justify the abolition of that right because they are proposing to abolish what has been a central feature of our civil legal system in the High Court.</P>
    <P>Secondly, arguments have been made that juries are inconsistent but it can be demonstrated, even by those who have spoken in favour of the Government's proposals, that judges have not been consistent when imposing sentences after criminal trials.  Many Deputies, including Deputy Harney, who are supporting the abolition of the jury system but not with much enthusiasm say they are doing so to get a greater level of consistency but they acknowledge that they are concerned about the inconsistency in sentencing. I suggest that there is an inconsistency on the part of those who argue that way.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting for a moment that judges, particularly the High Court Bench, are not people of the highest integrity.  I believe we are particularly fortunate to have people on the Bench with such high qualifications and integrity. Everyone will acknowledge that each individual has his own view and if that is reflected in the sentences imposed &mdash; and this is a matter of concern to some Members of this House &mdash; is there any reason that that should not also be reflected in the decisions of an individual judge who is determining the issue of liability and, having determined whose fault it was, measuring the damages appropriate in each case?  That is where the jury system establishes a balance. <Col N="548" /> the judgement of reasonable people, the person who used to be described in Britain as the man on the Clapham omnibus. These people set the standard of reasonable care which should be taken by citizens to avoid injury to others through fault or negligence.  These 12 men and women from all classes of society decide in terms of the judgment of standard of reasonable care or the judgment of appropriate damages and compensation. The balance of the judgments they make after discussing the matter must be at least as reliable and as consistent as the judgment of any one man, however well intentioned, well qualified or whatever his integrity.</P>
    <P>The case for the abolition of juries is not being made on the basis that it will reduce insurance premia.  If that were so, one would have to give more serious thought to it.  Spokesmen for the industry have acknowledged that this will not reduce premia.  We all appreciate that the level of insurance cover for employers and motorists particularly is a matter of concern.  We do not want to see either motorists or employers burdened with unnecessary or unfair costs but the fact is that it has not been argued &mdash; and I believe it cannot be argued &mdash; that the abolition of the jury system will result in a reduction in insurance costs.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last night that we had examples of reductions in insurance costs as a consequence of Supreme Court decisions, notably the decision in <i>Cooke and Walsh</i> where the Supreme Court determined that henceforth the medical and hospital expenses in motor accident cases are not now chargeable against the defendant, namely the insurance company, and that they are paid by the State under the normal terms of State cover for insured persons or persons with medical cards.  The fact that the insurance industry has been relieved by the decision of the Supreme Court of a figure which has been estimated at between £3 million and £5 million in one year, has not meant one penny reduction in the level of insurance premia.</P>
    <P>That is not to charge the insurance industry with bad faith.  I suppose they <Col N="549" /> see it as an example of the swings and the roundabouts and if they get a windfall like this which helps to enhance their profits or in some instances to reduce their losses, they are prepared to take that as part of the normal hazards in which the insurance industry are involved or the benefits that accrue without passing on the benefits of that to the insured public.  If the benefits of <i>Cooke and Walsh</i> have not been passed on to the insured public, why should we assume that such benefits as would accrue &mdash; although nobody suggests that they will accrue &mdash; to the insurance industry because of this decision will be passed on to the insured public?</P>
    <P>Let me return to what has become a very important feature of the reason for the major accident awards.  I want to give some figures which were not available to me last evening.  Uninsured drivers account for 20 per cent of all driving in this country.  The average for Europe is 4 per cent and in some countries like the FDR it is as low as 1 per cent.  In the UK it is about 9 per cent, the next highest to us.  If one out of five drivers on our roads is uninsured we have immediately the major cause of problems &mdash; there is no absolute exclusive cause &mdash; in terms of costs, particularly in motor accident cases, of insurance cover.  We all know that, first of all, under the Motor Insurers' Bureau agreement the Department of Finance provide 50 per cent and this is a direct levy on the taxpayer, and the insurance companies between them provide the balance in proportion to the general state of cover which each of them has on the insurance market.  Therefore, the compensation for injuries suffered through uninsured driving is a matter of major cost to both the taxpayer directly and to the insurance industry and accordingly, it has to be passed on in terms of premium claims and premium costs.</P>
    <P>It must be said that the major awards, the biggest awards that have been made, are in respect of uninsured driving or drunken driving.  In the nature of things the normal, prudent driver who makes a mistake, as any one of us can do, in terms <Col N="550" /> of judgment, not keeping a proper look out, not giving an indication of turning right or left, driving across the path of another car, or suddenly facing emergency and not coping properly with it, does not cause horrfic injuries.  They are caused when cars are stolen by joyriders and driven at a terrific pace through our cities and towns and on our roads.  In many such cases the most horrific injuries are suffered by people who are unfortunate enough to come in the path of cars driven in that fashion.  Similarly cars driven by people who are unfit to drive due to the consumption of alcohol can cause horrific injury.  Here we are faced with the fact that our level of uninsured driving&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy unduly, but I think he will agree with me that the detail into which he is going would be more appropriate on a Road Traffic Bill or on some Estimate.  He may, of course, deal with such matters in passing but to go into detailed discussion of them is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go into it in too much detail but when we are talking in terms of the cost of reducing insurance premiums which the Minister says is the major element here, I think what I am saying is relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant to refer to it but not with too many nuts and bolts in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not put too many nuts and bolts in it but I hope at least that the general structure if not finally completed will be visible enough after the few comments I want to make. I will demonstrate that by saying that the amount of claims faced by the Motor Insurers' Bureau has grown from £2.1 million to just £9 million in 1985 and it is estimated that in 1986 it will be of the order of £9.5 million or £10 million, and that is caused exclusively by uninsured driving.  For this reason if we want to deal with that escalating factor it is important <Col N="551" /> that we deal with it in the most appropriate way, that is, by a proper application of the law in relation to insurance.  I will not go into this in detail because it is a matter for road traffic legislation but it would concern insurance discs or whatever and proper enforcement of the law. That is the only guarantee that increases of that nature will not be a feature of the claims faced by the Motor Insurers' Bureau which in turn must be recouped from all the insurance companies who operate in the motor insurance market.</P>
      <P>I understand that the estimate for outstanding claims in the bureau as on 31 December of last year is £55 million.  The corresponding estimate at the end of 1984 was £48 million.  This is the estimate, which is all one can make, of the claims that are already lodged against the Motor Insurers' Bureau that will have to be paid. Again that demonstrates that the real action which must be taken here is to protect the public in every sense, (a) in the first instance against injury from uninsured driving, (b) as either taxpayers or policy holders from having to face the level of compensation that follows serious injuries.  That will exist whether we have judge or a jury trying the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say that, as the Chair sees it, the issue here is whether what are known as running down actions can be more fairly and adequately tried by a judge sitting alone or a judge with a jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am saying.  This problem of uninsured driving and the cost of awards following will continue to be there whether you have a judge dealing with the issue alone or a jury determining the issue.  For that reason the Government owe it to us to explain in greater detail how they are going to avoid those costs if they are heavy costs to the motorists &mdash; and they are &mdash; and to the insurance industry or whatever.  That is vital, and the Government have failed to do that.  They should do it before coming in here and saying that they propose the abolition of juries <Col N="552" /> because some people say they are too costly without taking into account the major reasons why juries have operated here and elsewhere for a considerable time.</P>
      <P>International comparisons in relation to the incidence of accidents in this country indicate that it is very much higher than in other European countries.  In terms of the number of road deaths per 10,000 vehicles, surveys indicate that we have a much higher rate of fatality than any other country.  Figures for European comparisons in terms of the level of road fatalities and injuries in road accidents are much higher in Ireland than in other countries.  This is a matter for the administration of law and it probably also has something to do with the condition of our roads, although I will not go into that.</P>
      <P>It could also be as a result of the condition and supervision of vehicles and if we are concerned about these things it is a matter for the normal administration and implementation of the law to ensure that we reduce the level of accidents which puts us at the top of the list in Europe with Northern Ireland coming a close second.  In terms of fatalities our figure is 7.2 per 10,000 motor vehicles; the figure for the North of Ireland is 6.7; Great Britain 3.4; France 4.9; Italy 3.6; Denmark 3.7; and Norway 2.9.  It is time that we faced these realities and dealt with them thereby reducing not just the level of accidents but also insurance costs as a consequence of injuries suffered in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the collapse of the PMPA which covered the major portion of motor car insurance, two or three very interesting facts have emerged.  In the first instance, juries who do not live in isolation have moderated their awards to a considerable extent.  Any practitioner will tell you that the levels of such awards for damages are less than they were three years ago before the collapse of the PMPA.  The impact which that had on the public and on premium holders was of such significance that men and women sitting on juries realised that it was a matter of obligation <Col N="553" /> not just in terms of the public interest but also in their own interest to look at the balance of justice to be determined between the plaintiff and the defendant and to decide accordingly.</P>
    <P>In terms of the administration of the insurance system, the PMPA are a good example of where the real costs may arise and how they can be coped with.  The administrator of the PMPA, clearly a man of very sophisticated and professional skill in this area, and his staff have succeeded in halving the losses which stood at £27 million in 1983.  These were reduced to exactly £13.5 million by efficient management.  He also indicated that he hopes to halve those losses again this year.  Therefore, the figure of £27 million in 1983 could be reduced to about £6 million in 1986.</P>
    <P>Clearly, if a reduction of that level can be achieved by a competent professional team, it is obvious that it has much to do with efficient management of the insurance industry and nothing to do with jury awards.  A number of factors enabled the PMPA to achieve this.  One is the earlier settlement of cases, long before they come to trial.  Another factor is the much more constant appraisal of the development in terms of medical reports and discussions between solicitors on both sides with a view to concluding the negotiations successfully as quickly as possible without incurring extra costs that normally accrue when one has to go to trial.</P>

      <P>If somebody came in here who did not know what we were debating he or she would certainly <Col N="554" /> think that it had something to do with insurance companies, running down actions and nothing else.  This Bill deals with personal injuries sustained as a result of a motor accident, an accident on a building site or where someone takes a gun and shoots another in the leg and a whole series of other matters.  The issue is not the efficient running of insurance companies or even the efficient running of the courts.  It is whether having a jury is a better way of adjudicating on these issues than a judge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do intend to spend much longer on this issue beyond saying there are obvious ways in which the insurance industry can operate more efficiently to ensure that the cost to the policy holders or to the public generally will be minimised.  It is not necessary to abolish what has been an established feature of the law, namely, trial by judge and jury, to achieve that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the case cannot be made that insurance costs arise from jury awards only, we should look at the real <Col N="555" /> issues in regard to trial by judge and trial by judge and jury.  When you have eight or ten competent judges of the highest integrity but with different personalities, different monetary values and, inevitably, different social attitudes, clearly plaintiffs and their advisers will wait until the very last minute to determine whether they will let the matter go to trial or settle.</P>
    <P>What will happen is that plaintiffs will tend to wait until the last minute to see which judge they draw in what will be a game of hazard before deciding whether to let the case go to trial or settle out of court.  Certain judges are known in the trade to be plaintiffs' judges and others defendants' judges.  So, instead of speeding up the process of trial this change proposed by the Government will have the opposite effect.  Cases that are now settled well in advance because of the general norms of jury awards will be held up until it is known which of the judges will be dealing with the case and if it is Mr. Justice X &mdash; I obviously must refrain from mentioning them &mdash; the plaintiff may say there is a good chance of a favourable result in terms of damages whereas if it is Mr. Justice Y who is dealing with the case there may be little chance of a favourable result.</P>
    <P>Judges have different attitudes to money and one judge may not be at all in tune with the demands of modern life in the same way as his colleague.  Judges recognise this about themselves just as much as any of us would.  If each of us were asked individually to value something, we would give different values and it is the average that is important.  I suggest there is no reason why juries who can strike an average on the basis of the normal judgements of people cannot be given guidance they are not given at the moment.  They cannot be told anything in relation to what awards would be accepted by the Supreme Court or the general standard of awards that will not be overthrown by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court have taken a new role in recent years.  Previously the Supreme Court could only send a case <Col N="556" /> back for retrial if they thought a jury award was perverse one way or another. Now they decide what is the appropriate level of award and, consequently, we now have norms that I think should be indicated to juries so that they will not be at large, so to speak, in fixing the amount of general damages.  This is one of the options proposed to the Government by this side of the House.  The Minister dismissed it and did not explain why, but decided to propose the option of trial by judge alone.</P>
    <P>I feel juries would welcome a situation where there would be a balance between the judgment of 12 normal people and guidance from the Supreme Court in issues of negligence between fellow citizens. The Government should at least answer the case.  If they will not accede to it they should say why it is not acceptable to them.  It may be that my colleagues in this House or elsewhere will disagree with me in this but I see no reason why counsel for both the plaintiff and the defendant should not suggest to the jury the amounts they think are appropriate for general damages and let the jury decide which of the estimates is acceptable, having heard all the evidence. That would be a welcome innovation. The jury would get the benefit of the values presented by both sides who would have to justify them by medical or other evidence.  There has been no attempt to consider modifications of that kind.  There is only the very blunt instrument of abolishing juries and having a judge sitting alone.  That is regrettable. The Minister will have a report of this detailed debate to which many have contributed and I hope he will assess all of these matters and will deal with them in his reply because that is what is required before we take such a major step as is now being proposed.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to two other matters before I conclude.  The first is in relation to legal costs.  I do not know if my colleague, Deputy Taylor, will concur with everything I will say here but it does not matter.  It is suggested that the arrangement whereby a large number of lawyers are involved in cases has heaped <Col N="557" /> very considerable costs onto the insured public.  I do not accept that that is a significant factor in the costs.  I do not have much time to practise at the Bar these days, unlike some of my predecessors who sat on these Opposition benches some 15 or 20 years ago, because the Dáil is becoming much more demanding, and properly so.  Nevertheless I and many of my colleagues at the Bar would acknowledge that there is a case for abolishing the two senior system.  We are not talking about abolishing the two senior system. here we are talking about abolishing juries.</P>
    <P>If we want to get rid of the two senior system, abolishing juries is not the way to do it.  That is turning the thing on its head.  We could go on the basis that costs would only be allowed for one senior counsel and if a second is required it would be at a person's own expense.  The fact is that insurance companies have been engaging two senior counsel.  It is a matter for them to consider if this is efficient.  I think in most cases they have come to the conclusion that it is.  There is nothing sacrosanct about the two senior system.  But if trial by judge alone is introduced in the expectation that it will get rid of the two senior system, that is a false expectation.  The real reason this system exists is the listing system and the number of courts.</P>
    <P>If a senior counsel is expected to take on a case and give it his exclusive attention and not take on any other responsibility on that day or the following day or for as long as the case goes on, he will have to charge an appropriate fee which would be on a higher scale than he would charge under the two senior system.  In England, the fees to counsel in court cases are very much higher than they are here for that reason.  I am not one, however, to say that one has to adhere to the practice of the two senior system, but this has nothing to do with jury trials. It is a different matter, although people have tended to confuse the two issues.</P>
    <P>Juries offer an opportunity for all the public to engage in the essential legal process.  To that extent it is a very healthy <Col N="558" /> exercise of a democratic right and obligation. People are given an opportunity to make a judgment between their fellow citizens as to reasonable standards of care and appropriate compensation where those standards have not been adhered to.  It is essential that we promote and encourage that sense of responsibility. There has been a recent tendency in representation on juries to have mainly young, unemployed jurors.  That may be because the very people who complain about the jury system avoid serving on juries, for example, professional and business people who say that they cannot afford the time to attend.  If we had a proper spread of representation on juries, not only would we have a much more effective discharge of democratic obligations, but perhaps we would get a different balance of opinion both as to liability and as to the appropriate level of damages.</P>
    <P>It is important that unemployed young people should take part in this democratic process &mdash; there is no reason why they should not &mdash; but a balance of representation would be an advantage.  Can business people or professional people who complain about heavy insurance premiums on their cars or property reconcile those complaints with the fact that almost 70 per cent, when asked to discharge their civil obligation by serving on juries, avoid doing so?  I should not have imagined that the number attending would be as low as 30 per cent.  If people are not prepared to discharge a civil obligation, can they complain afterwards that those who do are not doing their job properly?</P>
    <P>If we are to have the judge only system, there will be more cases going to trial; there is no question about that.  People will not settle in advance.  At the moment 0.2 per cent &mdash; one out of every 500 cases &mdash; go to trial determined by a jury, which is a very small proportion, and we are talking here about the way juries are supposed to abuse the system.  When trial by judge alone was introduced in England in 1965, the number of extra judges who had to be appointed at that level was 42, to cope with the growth of the burden of cases.  Scaled down to our proportions, <Col N="559" /> that would come to perhaps five extra judges and a back up staff.  That will give rise to considerable extra cost.</P>
    <P>A case had not been made to justify the Government's proposal.  If a jury of our fellow citizens had been listening to this debate, trying to make a fair assessment as to whether the plaintiff &mdash; in this case the Minister for Justice &mdash; who proposes to the jury to change a system which has been well and truly established, has proved his case on the grounds of probability, the citizens would have to come to one conclusion only, that he has not.  The Minister has stated his complaint and has proposed his way of curing it, but they would come to the conclusion that he has not done so in a way that satisfies them that what he is proposing is either fair or reasonable.  That is why we are proposing the retention of the jury system, subject to the amendments which our spokesman, Deputy Woods, has mentioned and which I have outlined in some detail this morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is really illthought out.  I have studied carefully the Minister's speech in this connection and find the arguments propounded in it unconvincing.  One of the reasons put forward by the Minister and the Government is to reduce legal costs in connection with jury actions in the High Court, thereby reducing insurance company expenses and, presumably, insurance premiums.  I find that argument pretty poor, coming from the Government.  If there was one single factor that escalated legal costs over the past few years by an appalling amount, it was the Government's decision to apply valueadded tax at 25 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on all legal fees, solicitors', barristers', the lot.  That had a disastrous effect on legal costs.  That a Government who at one fell swoop added a massive 25 per cent on to those costs of insurance companies and plaintiffs should say legal costs are too high and we must find ways of reducing them is <Col N="560" /> too much.  They should hang their heads in shame at putting that aspect of the matter forward as an argument.  That has had a major effect on the insurance scene, the VAT rake-off by the Minister for Finance from solicitors' fees, barristers' fees, court fees, witnesses' expenses, the whole gamut.  This amounts to a massive sum, even on one side, in any typical High Court action. There is often criticism about the high level of solicitors' fees, but the biggest single burden in recent years came from the quite unnecessary imposition of VAT on legal fees.  It is rather a pity that that was done.</P>
      <P>I find it very difficult to know why this measure was brought forward.  I cannot get any clear guidance from the Minister's speech as to the reason.  Is it put forward that juries have been irresponsible, that they have brought in excessive awards away beyond what is reasonable or appropriate?  There is a kind of covering the whole issue and it appears to run this way: juries have gone wild, are bringing in huge awards that bear no relationship to what is fair and reasonable and if one brings in trial by judge alone these amounts will be reduced, and consequently the insurance companies will do considerably better and the premiums, the hard pressed members of the public have to pay will be thereby reduced.  That seems to be the basis of it although each and every one of those steps is clouded in a smoke screen.</P>
      <P>If we take the proposition that the juries have gone wild and that the amounts of the awards they are making are excessive and too high, the corollary has to be that the awards of a High Court judge sitting on his own will be considerably less than the awards of juries.  The Minister and the insurance industry freely admit that that is not so.  In one part of the Minister's speech he referred to the high level of awards.  In another part he said there is an assumption in some quarters that the object of the Government's proposal to replace civil juries is to reduce awards in personal injury cases generally. He said that is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="561" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Minister talking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>If he is saying that is not correct it can only mean that the awards given by judges will be more or less the same as the awards given by juries.  If that is so, what precisely is the object of the exercise?  The insurance industry take the same view, the Minister said that spokesmen for the insurance industry are not presuming that damages will fall when assessed by judges.  In fact, they have expressed the view that it is unlikely that judges will reduce awards from the prevailing levels.  If the awards given will be the same, why do we have to set about abolishing the juries?  The thrust of it seems to be cosmetic.  It puts forward the appearance of doing something about a matter which may need to be tackled in various ways.  The implications are that jury awards, with exceptions, are fair and reasonable enough.  There are always occasional jury awards that go wrong. There have been cases where jury awards have been considerably too high and there have also been cases where jury awards have been too low.</P>
      <P>Recently I read about a case in the newspapers where the Supreme Court increased the amount of a jury award. The Chief Justice described that jury award as being a mean award.  Is it suggested that awards made by High Court judges alone will not have the same degree of variance &mdash; and will be either too high or too low &mdash; as those of juries on odd occasions?  That proposition does not hold water.  In the UK where the judge system alone has been operating for many years the system has not worked with any delightful degree of consistency. If we are to emulate and copy the British system we will be in for a shock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A UK Queen's counsel who is also a Member of Parliament referred to this when introducing a Private Members' Bill in the House of Commons on this subject.  He referred to the level of compensation awarded by the High Court in road accident cases.  He said the law on compensation for road accident victims is an archaic lottery.  That system is put <Col N="562" /> forward to us as being some kind of panacea that will bring in some magical degree of consistency into the system.  If having judges alone produce an archaic lottery in the system in England, I do not see why we should rush headlong into that system.</P>
    <P>Certain guidelines should be established between the awards given and the Supreme Court rulings on appeals so that people involved can settle the cases under these guidelines and not fight them in court.  The object of setting up a position that will involve a fight in court should be avoided.  That does not happen and has not happened under this system.  As Deputy O'Kennedy rightly pointed out, the number of these cases fought out in court is minuscule.  Thank goodness it is. If the number was doubled, minuscule as it is, the whole system would break down irretrievably.  Deputy O'Kennedy said that only one case in 500 is fought out in court.  The guidelines that have been established work very well.  On odd occasions the Supreme Court have intervened and set a standard and a guideline.  People settle their cases accordingly based on those guidelines.  The system has worked tolerably well on that basis.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies leave much to be desired in the way they manage their affairs.  They bring much of their troubles on their own heads.  They have an inbuilt reluctance to settle a case at an early stage.  I do not know why that is.  Is it that there is not an adequate delegation of responsibility and authority in the insurance companies that enables that to be done?  A person who is injured in a road accident or at work does not wish to see his case drag on for years.  That is what happens in the normal course of events.  There are very few cases, if any, in the High Court that are settled within three or six months.  This is not because the solicitors acting for the injured parties would not favour that.  They favour it very strongly.  Insurance companies seem to think that the longer they put things off the better.  They raise pernickety objections to stall them off for years on end.  It has been proved many times that the longer they put them off the more <Col N="563" /> they cost them in the end.  This contributes to the enormity of their costs and in many cases to the poor results that some of them show on the motor side of their business.</P>
    <P>Many things could be done to improve the position.  Much of the evidence is common between the two sides, and yet there is no procedure here that enables agreement to be reached at a very early stage.  There is a procedure in the UK which has been in operation for a long time under which at a very early stage of proceedings the parties are called before a lesser official of the courts, a master, and he examines what evidence is common to both sides.  He puts pressure on the two sides to agree the medical reports, thereby, saving a tremendous amount in time costs and expenditure.  If some measures along those lines were being proposed it would be a worth while contribution to the entire debate, could reduce costs on both sides, improve the position of the insurance companies and, hopefully, have that translated into a reduction in premiums.</P>
    <P>Some hard things have been said in the course of this debate about the members of the legal profession.  No doubt the legal profession have their bad eggs the same as the members of any other profession, be they the medical profession or politicians.  I do not deny that.  However, by and large, they go about their tasks in a responsible and careful manner.  The legal profession offer and provide what amounts to a free legal aid system.  To a very large extent it is a system which rightfully ought to be provided in a proper manner by the State but which has never been done by this State in civil actions of the type this Bill comprehends. It is high time that was done.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word about the role of the medical profession in High Court jury actions, in running down cases and cases involving injuries at work.  I am afraid that many members of that profession behaved in a rather irresponsible manner.  They caused costs to escalate and delays to take place.  There seems to be no real measure of control over the <Col N="564" /> situation.  For a person injured in an accident to get their case moving they require a medical report.  That can be an incredibly difficult and prolonged item to get. One can expend hundreds of pounds in costs in trying to get that.  Some doctors charge £40 for a medical report while others charge £150 when it can be extracted.  Many of them are reluctant to make themselves available to come to court to give evidence.  Many of them are the cause of cases having to be adjourned, thereby escalating the legal costs involved. Efforts have been made to bring some regularisation into the situation, but I am afraid it has not worked very well.  That aspect of the matter, if looked at, could bring about a very large improvement in the situation.</P>
    <P>On the question of judges' decisions, the implication is that their decisions are going to be consistent.  Is the objective of this Bill to bring about lower awards or is it to bring about consistency in awards? The Ministers speech on this is rather obscure.  Quite frankly, I do not follow the broad thrust of his argument.  If it is consistency he is looking for, all I can say is that High Court judges are not consistent in the judgments they give in other matters.  Their opinions vary and are frequently overruled by the Supreme Court.  Circuit Court judges, who already hear these cases without a jury, do not give consistent awards in running down accidents or in cases involving factory injury.  There is no reason to suppose that the response of High Court judges will be any different from those of the Circuit Court judges.  Circuit Court judges now have quite a high jurisdiction, up to £15,000.  That may well be increased. Their judgments and the amount of damages they award vary quite a bit. Therefore, there is no consistency.  The attitudes of the judges vary quite a bit.</P>
    <P>Is it that the insurance companies want the abolition of juries for some particular reason?  I wonder about that.  I was interested to see a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 18 June 1986 regarding a statement by Judge Diarmuid Sheridan of Carlow Circuit Court.  The report stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> A judge has criticised insurance companies for insisting on costlier High Court actions rather than Circuit Court trials.</P>
    <P>Judge Diarmuid Sheridan said at Carlow Circuit Court yesterday that insurance companies had moved heaven and earth to do away with High Court jury hearings, but the opposition to leaving such cases in the Circuit Court jurisdiction, where they are dealt with by a judge alone, was coming from the insurance companies themselves.</P>
    <P>He said the insurance companies had mounted a very large campaign for waiving jurisdiction of High Court juries.  To his certain knowledge since last October he had transferred at least 15 to 20 cases from the Circuit Court to the High Court.</P>
    <P>Where they would be heard by a jury.</P>
    <P>In each case he had inquired as to whether the parties would leave the cases in the Circuit Court and consent to jurisdiction, but in each case one party objected to that course and that invariably was the defendant who almost always was involved with an insurance company.  He could not understand this.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly, neither can I.  If the insurance companies, based on that report, were so anxious and thought it would lead to their advantage to have the cases tried by a judge alone, all they had to do was to consent to the request made by Judge Diarmuid Sheridan and leave their cases in the Circuit Court where they would be determined.  But no, it was the insurance companies who insisted on going forward to the High Court where they would be tried by a judge and jury. Therefore, I do not know what they are about.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech states:</P>
    <P>The high level of damages awarded in the courts in such cases have a major bearing on the amounts for which insurers will settle personal injuries claims outside the courts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" /> That is true.  The amount of awards are a guidance, but the number and the effect of the appeal decision to the Supreme Court is a major factor in giving that guidance.  It is a fact that very few of the damages awards from juries in the High Court are appealed to the Supreme Court.  As we have said, the numbers which will go to a full hearing in the High Court are very small compared to the total.  Of those that are heard and those where jury awards are given the number which are appealed &mdash; the number, in other words, that either party complains about &mdash; is minuscule.  The guidelines are there.  That system works well.  Those figures are the guidelines under which these settlements operate.</P>
    <P>The Minister says such claims are settled under the shadow of a court hearing and that the proven unpredictability of jury awards has had a destabilising effect on the settlement process.  That is palpably not correct.  The settlement process works very well.  The number of cases which are not settled is minuscule. Therefore, it has had a very predictable effect.  Otherwise, far more cases would be sent on for trial to take advantage of this alleged unpredictability of jury awards.  The Minister went on to say that one judge of the Supreme Court in a recent case observed that the proliferation of personal injuries claims and a significantly high number of serious cases appear to have induced among lawyers and insurers alike a degree of what he called monetary punch drunkeness that had tended to remove reality from such settlements.</P>
    <P>The Minister quotes that as a plus factor in advocating the abolition of juries.  The one thing which the judge did not say in that quote is that the situation had anything to do with high jury awards. The first point the Supreme Court judge is quoted as making is that there has been a proliferation of personal injury claims. Probably that is true.  No doubt the number of claims is large and there are various reasons for that.  But the reasons for the proliferation of claims has got nothing to do with the fact that jury awards are too high, too low, inconsistent <Col N="567" /> or whatever.  There may be various reasons for their proliferation.  Perhaps one is the extension of the licensing laws; perhaps that is a factor.  I note that the Government have proposals to extend the licensing hours even more.  I wonder are they taking into account that that action &mdash; thereby encouraging more drinking &mdash; will cause an even greater proliferation in the number of personal injury cases that will be brought about.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there are inadequate safety precautions in factories.  Perhaps that is a factor that has brought about a proliferation in the number of personal injury claims.  Are there sufficient inspectors going around checking factories for safety?  Are the Government doing enough to ensure that the factory inspectors' reports &mdash; where they point out defects &mdash; are being complied with in such factories, thereby reducing the number of factory accidents, which are many?  That may be a factor in the proliferation of personal injury claims.</P>
    <P>The second quotation of the judges of the Supreme Court by the Minister is that there was significantly a high number of serious cases and that appeared to have induced among lawyers and insurers alike a degree of &ldquo;monetary punch drunkenness&rdquo;. There may well be a high number of serious cases but, for the life of me, I cannot understand what that has to do with jury awards.  If a case is a serious one, then it is a serious case and an award will be high whether awarded by a jury or by a judge alone.  To quote those two examples of the number of cases having proliferated, that there are a high number of serious cases, and to go on to relate that in some way to the abolition of juries is puzzling.  Quite frankly, I do not see the interconnection between the two.  The Minister continued to say:</P>
    <P>The levels of awards by juries for personal injuries are inevitably reflected in the amounts agreed in settlements which comprise about 95 per cent of personal injuries claims.</P>
    <P>Of course the amounts of the awards are a factor; so is the Supreme Court review <Col N="568" /> of the situation.  That would apply whether decisions on awards were made by juries or by a judge alone.</P>
    <P>The Minister continues to say of the Bill before us:</P>
    <P>The purpose is to avoid excessive awards as far as possible and to bring consistency and predictability into awards given.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that many of these cases that appear as similar to members of the public &mdash; looking at short reports or whatever of them in newspapers &mdash; are not similar at all.  When one gets down to the nitty-gritty many of these cases that appear to be the same can be quite different in their effect on the person who has suffered the injury. Then the Minister had this to say:</P>
    <P>Moreover, although the incidence of personal injuries cases heard in the High Court by a judge sitting alone with the consent of the parties has not been great, what indications there are show that a judge can be no less generous than a jury when it comes to assessing damages in serious cases.</P>
    <P>Here again the Minister is saying that the awards of a judge will be comparable with those of juries.  One comes back to the point: what is the object of the exercise?  What is the purpose of this Bill? The awards will be the same.  That appears to be conceded by the insurance industry and by the Minister.  If the awards are to be the same it will leave insurers in the same position and will have no effect on insurance premiums.</P>
    <P>I know that in the United States a very serious position has arisen in the area of insurance.  I am sure we have all seen reports of the colossal awards running to millions of dollars in many of these cases. A very serious position has arisen in virtually all of the States in the United States where many firms now find themselves in the position of being unable to obtain insurance cover at all.  Of course it is very important that we so organise our affairs to ensure that insurance cover is always available at reasonable costs to motorists and, in particular, to factory owners.  By <Col N="569" /> and large I think that is still the position. It is not helped by the factors adverted to by Deputy O'Kennedy, that so many motorist are not taking out insurance cover which is compulsory on them.</P>
    <P>It is also not helped by the fact that very many people who own and run factories with hazardous and dangerous machinery are not taking out insurance cover for their employees.  That line of insurance is different from the motor category because, to date, it has not been compulsory. I believe it should be made compulsory. I believe that a worker in a factory, involving hazardous or dangerous machinery, on building sites or wherever, is entitled to the same protection as any potential victim of a motor accident. Indeed, it would be very helpful to many workers who, unfortunately, on occasion suffered injury in their places of employment, in factories, and have been unable to recover compensation because their employers did not have insurance cover and were not in a position to meet the amounts of those awards.  There have been quite a number of such cases.  It is a matter of importance and no doubt would also help insurance companies if that form of insurance cover were made compulsory.</P>
    <P>The whole field of insurance is in a state of disorganisation; it is extremely difficult to supervise it in a proper manner.  The Minister talks rather optimistically of effecting reductions in premiums, for example, when he had the following to say:</P>
    <P>Insurers say that the benefits of this will be passed on to the general insuring public, through, at the very least, a reduced need to increase insurance premiums and, depending on the overall outcome of the new arrangements, in possible reductions in premiums.  I can assure you that my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who has responsibility for supervising the insurance industry, will be concerned to ensure that economies that arise for insurers from the changes that are proposed in this Bill will be passed on to the insuring public.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="570" /> All I can say to that is that the experience of the Department of Industry and Commerce to date of exercising any kind of worth while control over the insurance industry has not been very reassuring. We have had the examples of the ICI débacle and the PMPA when the supervisory responsibilities of the Department of Industry and Commerce failed in what this House could reasonably expect, that is, to ensure that that kind of situation would not arise.  Therefore, I cannot say I would have any great confidence in the supervision of the insurance industry in ensuring that any benefits&mdash;if there were any from this Bill &mdash; were passed on to members of the insuring public.</P>
    <P>I believe the purpose of this Bill has not been established.  The concepts that have been put forward in its favour are full of inconsistencies.  The purpose of it is cosmetic and I do not think it has any prospects of achieving any worth while improvements in the administration of justice.  I do not believe it will lead to a reduction in the amounts of awards made by courts with or without a jury.  The Minister conceded that point in his speech.  If the legislation will not reduce the awards, what is the purpose of it? It will not affect the overall position of insurance companies and will make very little difference overall.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the remarks made by the various contributors to this debate, the Minister should seriously consider deferring the measure after Second Stage and have a rethink about it before bringing it forward again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to speak briefly to much the same effect as Deputy Taylor and Deputies on the other side of the House.  It is not an issue of conscience and I have no intention of making any difficulties for the Government I support, but I share the misgivings which have been expressed by other Deputies.  I do not believe the measure will achieve the benefits which have been promised for it and to change the existing system for reasons which are so slight is mistaken.  I naturally submit to the judgment of the majority of which I am part and will, if I <Col N="571" /> have to, vote for this Bill, but I will do so with misgivings for reasons which have been given here already.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether any speaker has begun by saying that the basis of the law we are talking about when dealing with actions for negligence is the system of justice called commutative justice &mdash; the idea that if I inflict an injury on somebody else by my fault I am obliged to make good that injury to him.  That is an impermeable, absolutely rock bottom feature of any conception of justice.  Even the most primitive peoples with the most unsophisticated legal ideas and systems can understand that.  Every human being who goes through life in a civilised society carries a range of responsibilities and liabilities, chief among which is the liability out of his own pocket &mdash; and therefore at the loss of pleasures, facilities and amenities which would have been available to him &mdash; to make good to somebody else, so far as money can do it, injury which he has inflicted on that person by his fault.  That may involve a sacrifice in his lifestyle and expectation and may also affect those who depend on him, but it cannot affect the right in justice of the person injured to expect compensation from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That primary legal idea, which is not peculiar to the Irish system or the common law but is common, I would imagine, to all civilised mankind, is very much mitigated in its impact on individuals in a society like this by the system of insurance.  We allow as a matter of public policy &mdash; some would say wrongly, but I believe rightly &mdash; the individual to reduce almost to vanishing point the impact of his own risk and wrongdoing by insuring himself against the consequences of negligent actions.  Nobody would find insurance to cover him in respect of this malicious actions.  Since most people do not really want to injure other people or. to get into trouble of any kind, negligence is something which is an insurable risk. It is calculable to some extent.  We allow individuals to throw off the effective burden of the ordinary rule of law by insuring themselves.  This involves joining <Col N="572" /> a pool to which everybody contributes a little so that, when a very heavy burden falls on an individual, it will be carried by all.</P>
    <P>I do not need to lecture the House on the basics of insurance.  Some forms of insurance are prudential, that is, they are availed of by the individual at his own option.  This type of insurance includes house insurance, fire insurance or the comprehensive dimension of car insurance. Some forms of insurance are compulsory in all civilised system such as third party motor insurance and certain forms of employers' liability.  The insurance system is an obviously valuable facility and its evolution in the late Middle Ages was one of the great achievements of the European mercantile mind.  I do not want to decry it or belittle it on moral grounds or anything of that sort.  We all have benefited in one way or another but there is a point at which the convenience of an insurance system must not be allowed to take precedence over the fundamental idea of justice which underlies this area of the law.</P>
    <P>When I find, as I have to find here, that the change which is before us today has largely resulted from agitation from the insurance part of the world, I have to ask whether we are not in danger of losing sight of the idea of justice in our anxiety to oblige those who have an interest in insurance, whether because they are insurers or policy holders paying premiums. We cannot do that.  We need not get into abstruse areas here but if there were any suggestion that this was the purpose &mdash; that convenience or cheapness of insurance was the reason behind a system which would perhaps have the effect of diminishing the level of damages, that is, diminishing what would appear to most people to be the just level of awards &mdash; then I think we would have a constitutional problem on our hands.  I do not want to raise a here of this sort at this stage because I do not think that is the only purpose of the legislation.  I am sure it has an articulate purpose based, need I tell the House, on an observation of what happens in the jolly old UK.</P>
    <P>In the jolly old UK from which we <Col N="573" /> were so keen to be free, it is observable that judges sitting alone do not award, as a rule, damages of a level which are common here in jury awards or even awards given by a Circuit Court judge who sits without a jury.  The British, among other differences from ourselves, are meaner about money.  They have a different perception of a £1 note from ours.  That is only another facet of the thrift and prudence and generally the Protestant ethic which has made them what they are and put them in several respects so far in advance of other peoples.  It is undoubtedly a fact that they have a more sober view of a £5 note than an Irishman has.  That I believe inarticulately contributes to the less generous level of awards to which the Minister referred. He spoke about the less generous &mdash; some would say meaner &mdash; level of personal injury awards which are common in England.</P>
    <P>If I thought the only purpose of this Bill was artificially to force down awards to English levels by the employment of a judge sitting alone, I would be unconditionally against it because that would be a wrong, unjust and immoral thing to do. I accept that is not the purpose of the Bill, or at least not one of its main purposes. Nevertheless many insurers will be expecting that the damage award levels will fall after the enactment of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the national difference between the English and the Irish, their different attitudes towards money and the substantially more flaithiúil approach of the Irishman to a £5 note, there is a difference in the perception of money as between a judge and a juror. It is not based merely on the fact that the juror is an anonymous person who, when the jury term is over, will be dispensed from service and will not have to account for having been extravagant with the money of an insurance company, but I think it is because a judge is usually half a generation older than the average age of the jury.  The judge may be a complete generation older than them.  I hope the House will not think it a far-fetched belief when I say that one's ideas about money, <Col N="574" /> leaving aside national differences, are formed in youth.  I first became conscious of money as a four of five-year-old in the years just before the Second World War and I cannot rid myself of the idea to this day that a £1 note is a substantial little sum of money even though it will not even buy a drink.</P>

      <P>My children find my attitude towards £1 and £5 notes laughable. They have a different perception of money which I have to complain about because it is my money they have a different perception of and it is my money they are extravagant with.  However, I have to recognise that these perceptions are formed in childhood, or early youth, and are difficult to shake off.  Who is to say which is the more just perception of the value of a monetary award?</P>
      <P>If I were a plaintiff who had been seriously injured in a motor accident and was half way in age between my children's age and my own age I would be very aggrieved if I felt that a system was being introduced which would quite exclude the money perception of the younger generation but enthrone the money perception of my generation, not to speak of people who are half or a whole generation older than I.  One must remember that one can be a judge and be nearly 20 years older than I am.  A plaintiff would be right to feel aggrieved in such circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The jurors who nowadays can include 18-year olds will likely have a better idea of what the current conception of money is, its buying power, its consolidatory power for a person who has suffered an injury, than I would have.  I am baffled by the size of awards I see but I can equally appreciate that a person who has suffered a very serious injury, who has <Col N="575" /> become paraplegic or lost a limb, may feel that no amount of money will compensate him for the felicity he has had to forego through his personal injury.  I would feel that way if I were injured.</P>
    <P>I would disagree with the Bill if I thought, notwithstanding that the Minister has disclaimed it, that its purpose, or its unintended effect, would be to reduce the crude level of money awards in such a way that what would now get through to a plaintiff would be a judge's perception of what his injury was worth as distinct from a juror's.  One can make too much of a point like that, and I do not want to unduly labour it, but the involvement of a jury in the assessment of awards is a valuable thing and one that conduces to justice.</P>
    <P>I know that in the United Kingdom for 20 or 30 years juries have been removed from this area and I am absolutely certain, had the British not made this change, we would not be making it here today.  How often have Members heard me say something similar in the House? Does anybody seriously think that, if the British saw fit to hold on to juries in civil actions for personal injury, we would not be doing the same thing?  We would move heaven and earth to find reasons why the system could not possibly be departed from but as soon as the British do it, after the usual timelag of 20 years or thereabouts, we are traipsing along behind them again.  I am convinced that, had the British not made this change, the House would not be asked to make it.</P>
    <P>The strongest argument in the Minister's case &mdash; I must confess that it is a strong argument &mdash; relates not so much to the crude level of jury awards as to the element of unpredictability of them.  That is a strong and sound argument and I would have liked the Minister to meet that point which is undeniable.  Even Deputy Taylor was inclined to concede that point and Opposition spokesmen were willing to concede it.  The Minister should have tried to deal with that point in a somewhat more conservative way, not by ditching the whole system but by holding on to it and trying by some other <Col N="576" /> means.  It might have meant inventing something for ourselves.  It might have meant a brand new Irish innovation, an Irish solution to an Irish problem, instead of a 25-year old British solution to an Irish problem.  We might have taken a step away from mother England and waddled away from the playpen for half a day and thought up some system of our own, even on an experimental basis, for excluding the unpredictability element in jury awards.</P>
    <P>The Minister was right to say that unpredictability in jury awards is a very serious matter for insurance companies. It slows up settlements; it tends to inflate settlements; and it has an impact on their work and, indirectly, on the amount of the premiums which policy holders have to pay, but that might have been excluded by a much more conservative means such as was suggested by the committee on motor insurance which I had the honour of setting up in 1981 when I was in the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  That committee suggested that the judge might have a role which would be integrated with the jury's role, not for determining the issue of liability, who had been at fault in causing the accident, but for determining the appropriate level of compensation.</P>
    <P>I do now wish to substitute a 60-year old judge's perception of money for that of a 25-year old young man or woman.  It is not just to aim to do that, but one could fairly ask a judge to sit with a jury during at least that part of their deliberations, once they had settled the issue of liability, to instruct them on what was a currently normal or acceptable range of awards for injuries of the kind which the accident had caused.  The judge would not be imposing his own opinion and, no matter what his opinion was, he could be trusted faithfully to transmit what he knew from his own experience to be the current level of award.  The jury would then be constrained within a certain range in regard to their awards.  They would be expected to keep their awards within that certain range of reason.  There would be an appeal court to put the jury right if they <Col N="577" /> exceeded what they had been told at either end, whether the award was too low or too high.</P>
    <P>Alternatively, although this would be less satisfactory, there would be a basis for a system of appeal other than to the Supreme Court.  One cannot exclude Supreme Court appeals except by law and I would not wish to do that here, but we could have a parallel system of appeal, merely on the issue of damage, to a small court consisting of two or three judges who would fit the award inside the acceptable and normal range given by juries for this kind of case.  That would increase the predictability of awards and would tend to answer the objections raised by insurance companies which, in this connection, are quite justified.</P>
    <P>The Minister adverted delicately to the point that jury trials tend to take longer. I can confirm that from my recollection of the Bar.  Counsel dealing with a jury feels he has to labour points, to bring them out with excruciating repetitiveness in order that they will lodge with the jury, in order that a jury of untrained laymen &mdash; they are not supposed to be anything else &mdash; will grasp something firmly and permanently.  Counsel must spend much longer on his feet on examination or cross-examination to get the jury to grasp something that he would not have to do with a judge sitting alone.  A judge sitting alone who has been through the mill of the Bar will not require to have the ears bored off him by counsel labouring a point.  While the judge will not be rude to counsel he will, by a gesture of impatience, hurry the case up.  One cannot do that with a jury and a judge would feel outside his rights if he tried to hasten counsel's behaviour with a jury. If counsel feels it necessary to labour a point he will do so.</P>
    <P>Not so deeply hidden, there is, of course, an obvious benefit for counsel because if a case is spun out into a second day which, if heard by a judge sitting alone, might take only one day or half a day, counsel will get an extra fee of perhaps 60 per cent.  Fees have gone so much out of the range that was common when I was at the Bar that I would hesitate to put a figure on them, but counsel would <Col N="578" /> get a substantial increase if the case were to stagger into a second day.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that that necessarily is an inducement to try to make the case last for a second or third or fourth day, but counsel is cushioned by the expectation of an enhanced fee if the case were to go on longer.  I do not say that any counsel would deliberately make that happen because they have got other cases to attend to and as often as not they want to get finished and get out.  They would have other cases to deal with before a case went to court at all.  I think it is true that cases take longer before a jury than before a judge.</P>
    <P>I would regard that, though, as a subordinate element and I do not think I would throw out the jury system merely to take account of it.  It would be useful if the Bar looked at their system of multiplicity of counsel.  That does not exist in England, but we have not followed the British example and it is quite common for a senior counsel and a couple of juniors to appear on both sides of a very simple, legally speaking, running down action or an ordinary accident case which could very well be disposed of by a single experienced junior on both sides.</P>
    <P>The Bar's defence, or explanation, of that has some substance, though it would not appeal very strongly to the public when they see the kind of money involved. The Bar's answer is that because counsel cannot foresee the days on which cases will come on &mdash; that is true; one cannot ever foresee when a case will be heard, and even though the trial may have been fixed up to the last moment, some unforeseen circumstance, like the failure of a witness to turn up on either side might mean its adjournment &mdash; because of the unpredictability, in chronological terms, of the way in which cases are set in the court list, counsel have to take on three or four cases simultaneously. In theory they cannot possibly do it simultaneously because they cannot be in three or four places at once; but in the ordinary way three or four cases might be settled, one might be adjourned for some reason, and counsel would find himself left with one case.  Cases are <Col N="579" /> settled in an unpredictable pattern, and therefore solicitors and insurance companies tend to retain two or three counsel, realising that, even if two of them were called away on some other case, they would have at least one counsel left to do a case.</P>
    <P>I am not giving my argument so much as the Bar's as I understand it.  If there was to be a system whereby only one counsel could possibly be engaged on either side of a personal injuries case, that counsel would have to undertaken to abandon all other competing work.  That would mean that he would clear everything from his desk for, say, the following Monday and Tuesday if he foresaw it would be a two-day case, and send back other work.  At the last moment that case might be settled or a witness might not turn up or one of the parties might be ill, and the case would be adjourned, and counsel would not earn anything in that case, his brief fee would have gone and he would have given back his other cases. In order to keep himself busy, counsel has to take on more than he can do, but knowing he is part of a little team of which at least one can be relied on to do a case properly when it gets to court. If he were expected to commit himself irrevocably to handle a case personally whenever it came up, counsel would have to reflect in his fees the fact that in order to do that he has been obliged to send back or refuse other work.</P>
    <P>That is not my argument; it is an argument of the Bar, and I recall from my own experience the elements of unpredictability of case lists, and it seems to me to have some substance.  Therefore, when insurance companies talk about multiplicity of counsel and so forth they are talking about an Irish system which does not exist in Britain any longer which, to some extent, represents a facility for them; they are obliged to employ a little team rather than a single counsel and they know that at least one man will be there to handle a case.  If it were otherwise, they would probably end up with much the same fees but for one man <Col N="580" /> instead of three.  Whether that argument is sound or not, it deserves to be ventilated. The profession to which I have the honour to belong, though not in practice, is entitled to have that point made.  I do not know what the House will think of it. I feel that the idea that you could save a great deal of money in non-jury actions by reducing the number of counsel is not as obviously correct as it seems.</P>
    <P>The only area in which I can see much room for improvement and through which the Minister's legitimate object could be met is by integrating a judge, somehow, in the jury's deliberations in regard to the amount of an award; he could instruct them on the normal contemporary range of awards so that they will not exceed them.  The Minister might have made that justified change in the Bill.  I am sorry to see the proposal that the entire jury system should be scrapped. I do not think it will produce the benefits which are promised and I am afraid it will produce a crude reduction in jury awards which is not necessarily in consonance with Irish perceptions of justice.  I think that on balance we will lose more than we gain.  Even if we pass Second Stage of the Bill, I should like the Minister to reconsider it before Committee Stage so that in the remaining Stages he might be able to limit the scope of the Bill in the way I have suggested.</P>
    <P>I will make one Committee Stage point in the hope that the Department will consider it before we reach that Stage. Although the object of the section seems to be simple and obvious enough, it would be no harm to say that as a further clause in paragraph (a) of section 1 (1) this new dispensation will apply to actions for the recovery of damages for personal injuries whether the plaintiff claims damages for other than personal injuries. I do not believe any problem will arise in regard to this paragraph, but so that it will be absolutely clear it would be as well to state that the system of non-jury trials would apply to any action in which there was a personal injury dimension, because as the clause stands it may be arguable that if there is any non-personal injury dimension in the claim &mdash; for instance, if <Col N="581" /> a person claimed for the destruction of his car &mdash; that that would suffice to take it outside the ambit of the Bill and leave the claim with a jury as before.  I would not mind that, but I know that is not what the Minister intends, and I wonder if the Department might look at whether a further clause would not be more in keeping with their intentions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important and serious matter.  There are two important facts one must address when considering the Bill.  If we abolish juries will their abolition ensure that the existing system will continue to be fair to the injured party?  In other words, will we be changing from a system that has been proved to be fair to the injured party, and, if so, will the change result in a reduction in motor insurance premiums? Will the cost of employers' liability be reduced?</P>
      <P>From what insurance companies have said, I have doubts that they intend to reduce the cost of motor insurance premiums. Prior to the publication of this Bill we heard continually from representatives of insurance companies that motor insurance would continue to escalate in cost because of the awards made by juries.  They hammered home that point regularly but shortly after publication of this Bill it was stated publicly by representatives of the insurance industry that they did not see how abolishing juries would lead to a reduction in the cost of motor car insurance.  There was considerable discussion and controversy in the newspapers and on radio and television as to why insurance companies were changing their viewpoint and, as a result of public attention being drawn to the statements made by representatives of the insurance industry, they adopted a somewhat different approach.  It appears now that insurance companies are reluctantly conceding that there may be a reduction in the cost of motor insurance premiums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning I tell the Minister for Justice and his advisers that before we enter into Committee Stage or have further discussions on the Bill he should have immediate discussions with the <Col N="582" /> insurance industry and obtain from them a copper-fastened guarantee that they will reduce the cost of premiums.  This Bill should not be processed further until the Minister and the Government get that assurance.  It is absolutely essential that such a guarantee be obtained and all of us have an obligation to help in this matter.</P>
    <P>On occasion there has been a public outcry because of the size of awards made by juries.  However, it is on very rare occasions that they have given exorbitant awards &mdash; perhaps up to £500,000.  It has not been outlined as fully as it might have been by the media that insurance companies have the right of appeal to the Supreme Court.  That process can take up to two years and during that time the company concerned has the benefit of the money.  In many instances the Supreme Court has stood by the original award but in some cases it has been reduced. Nevertheless, that important safeguard existed and it was used by the insurance companies.  That right of appeal will remain.</P>
    <P>Now we are proposing to leave the making of an award in the hands of one man.  Members of this House will be aware that there is intense criticism levelled against the Judiciary because of variations in sentencing or in awards made by judges.  Judges have varied considerably in their decisions with regard to drunk driving cases and even in minor cases.  That is a human problem and it is something that must be expected when matters are decided by human beings.</P>
    <P>Even when juries are abolished in civil cases, there will still be huge variations in the decisions made by the various judges.  I will not mention here the names of judges but if I were acting for a plaintiff, or if I were the plaintiff, there are some judges whom I should like to come before because I know their approach and I know of their active participation in society.  I know they understand the importance of medical expenses and other costs incurred by an injured person. Some judges will continue to be generous in their awards, but others will make awards on a much smaller scale.  On the morning of a court case when the person <Col N="583" /> involved in the litigation knows the judge before whom he will have to appear, his counsel or solicitor will be able to advise him whether he should accept or reject an offer from the insurance company.  It is inevitable that there will continue to be variations in the size of awards as there will be in the decisions made by district justices in many cases.  The human factor must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Personally, I regret the passing of the jury system.  We are living in a democracy and it is good for the ordinary man in the street to involve himself in politics.  It is good for the individual to support the party of his choice, whether it be Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, The Progressive Democrats, The Workers' Party and so on, and get involved in elections, because in a healthy democracy people should be involved in the day to day running of the country.</P>
    <P>I believe it has been healthy for our judicial system that the ordinary man and woman in the street has been involved in the legal system.  At present individuals are asked to do jury service.  Sometimes they find it irksome, troublesome and time consuming to have to go to court for two, three or four days and they find it very boring, but not very long ago there were many Irishwomen who were anxious to do jury duty and they fought for that right.  I am pleased they were given that right.  The point is that the jury system as we know it involves the man in the street in the day to day running of our courts and they see at first hand the legal system in action.  Now the ordinary man in the street will not be able to see or to participate in the working of our courts.</P>
    <P>Some people say our judges are austere and far removed from reality, but I have found most of our judges to be courteous, helpful and polite to litigants and those who appear before them.  Our judges have gone out of their way to be helpful and to put people at their ease.  Of course there are exceptions, but in general our judges make a great effort to see that the people coming before them are relaxed. People serving on a jury see the legal <Col N="584" /> system working at first hand and have an opportunity of participating in it.  This is good for everybody, but now this right will be removed from our legal system.</P>
    <P>The Minister, his officials and the media will have noticed the considerable amount of advertising undertaken by insurance companies to attract new motor insurance business.  I believe that if an insurance company go to the trouble of advertising for this business, it is obvious they are making a profit.  No sane person will look for business if he is making a loss.  That is a fact.  It is obvious from the number of advertisements we see regularly in our newspapers that there is money to be made in the motor insurance business.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an obligation to ensure that motor insurance premia are reduced.  If he is having discussions with the motor insurance industry I want him to raise the subject of motor cycle insurance and particularly insurance for pillion passengers.  The cost of motor cycle insurance is prohibitive.  I can understand the reluctance of insurance companies to accept the risks because once a motor cyclist is involved in an accident the injuries are horrific.  A motor cyclist has no protection if he is involved in an accident and he may suffer from serious head, leg and back injuries.  Nevertheless, many young people require transport to and from work.  It is important that people who do not have the money to buy a car should be able to afford a motor cycle and to get motor cycle insurance.  I ask the Minister to bring this matter to the attention of the insurance companies and to see if a scheme can be devised so that motor cyclists will be able to obtain reasonable insurance cover at a reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>I want to discuss pillion passengers now.  I am sure the Minister has the necessary statistics, and I am relying on my memory when I say this, but only about 10 per cent of people riding motor cycles have insurance cover for pillion passengers. In other words, nine out of ten pillion passengers are not covered by insurance.  A pillion passenger involved in an accident cannot claim against the <Col N="585" /> motor cyclist because normally the cyclist does not have insurance cover for a passenger. Unless the pillion passenger can prove negligence against the other party, if they can even prove one degree of negligence, then they are covered.  We cannot allow pillion passengers to be uninsured.  I know a young girl in my constituency who received the most horrific injuries &mdash; serious leg and back injuries &mdash; she is unable to work, her future has been changed as a result of that accident, and yet she did not get one penny compensation.  I put it to the Minister that we cannot in this House allow that people who get up on a motor cycle in all good faith and are involved in an accident &mdash; the motor cyclist perhaps running into a wall and the passenger sustaining head or back injuries &mdash; be left without compensation.  This Bill proposes to do away with juries.  There is an obligation on the Minister, on the Department, on us as a Government and on everybody in this House to ensure that that drastic situation is changed immediately so that people who travel on motor cycles will be allowed insurance cover for injuries.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the President of the High Court and his predecessor who is now Chief Justice, for an improvement in regard to time.  The delay before a case would be heard could be up to two years after it was set down.  Through the appointment of additional judges and the improvement of the High Court system that time is now down to ten months.  I have seen juries in action over the years, and with reluctance I see their passing from our courts.  The jury system was set up centuries ago.  It is to be retained in some instances.  I believe that in general the jury comprised of 12 ordinary people from every level of society, men and women, has served society and the legal system well.  It is with regret that I see this change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate on Second Stage of the Courts Bill, 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many points were made.  I hope to <Col N="586" /> cover what seem to me to be the main issues raised in the debate so far in these closing remarks.  If I do not seem to answer each and every point raised that Deputies regard as important, I hope that an opportunity will arise during Committee Stage to deal with any remaining matters.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that the issue raised by the proposal in the Bill &mdash; the question of the abolition of civil juries in the High Court in personal injuries cases &mdash; is a controversial one that arouses deep feelings and divergences of opinion among any group of people considering the matter.  That has been evident from this debate also.  No one would have expected to find a unanimity of views on the matter among Deputies.</P>
    <P>However, I must confess to being somewhat taken aback by the opposition expressed by the main Opposition party to the proposal in the Bill.  Deputy Woods said that his party had considered the matter at length and had taken full account of the views expressed by the various groups who have been campaigning for and against the proposal, but as recently as 29 April his party's Front Bench spokesman on insurance matters, Deputy Flynn, was criticising the Minister for Justice for not proceeding with this legislation.  That was during the debate in the House on a Private Member's Motion on the subject of motor insurance, when he referred to the fact that our personal injury awards are the highest in Europe, inflicting:</P>
    <P>...crippling losses of up to £100 million in the general insurance area... Those, together with high legel fees, contribute to equally high levels of insurance dodging and to high premiums for those who pay.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's remarks are contained in the Official Report, volume 365, columns 2060 to 2062.</P>
    <P>It is surely no coincidence that Ireland is the only country in Europe where the jury system operates for deciding personal injury cases.  In Scotland, although civil juries remain available in the Court of Session, which is roughly <Col N="587" /> similar to our High Court, they have gradually dwindled away to almost nothing because parties apparently no longer ask for them due, it is suggested, to generous awards made by judges.  In the case of Northern Ireland the most recent consideration of the issue of jury trial by the Pearson Commission in 1978 yielded no recommendation one way or the other.  But it is clear that, in deciding not to recommend the abolition of civil jury trial at that time, the commission were influenced by the importance attached by lawyers in Northern Ireland to consistency with practice in their jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>In the same debate in April another Opposition member, Deputy Fahey, was equally explicit.  He said, I quote: &ldquo;There is no question or doubt in my mind but that the jury system is a significant contributor to the high cost of motor insurance&rdquo;. He promised that under a future Fianna Fáil Government jury trials in civil actions will be discontinued and accused the Government of not having the backbone to bring in this legislation because, he alleged, of opposition from a lawyers' lobby.  There were other criticisms of the jury award system from other Opposition Deputies during that debate. These remarks are contained in the Official Report, volume 365, columns 2296 to 2238.</P>
    <P>As I see it, Deputy Woods is opposed to the measure for two main reasons. First, he believes that the standards of the ordinary citizen are the best to apply in deciding personal injury cases and are superior to the standards that would be applied by members of the legal profession, including our judges, in deciding these cases without a jury.</P>
    <P>Secondly, he believes that the elimination of civil juries will not produce any savings to the public who pay insurance premiums, and that savings can be achieved only by adopting various recomendations advocated by the MacLiam Committee in their report to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1982; by taking certain measures to reduce legal costs, and by greater law enforcement <Col N="588" /> and accident prevention measures.  He apparently accepts the need for reform of the jury system, but only to the extent recommended by the MacLiam Committee, which was to empower judges &mdash; but not counsel &mdash; to indicate a going rate for general damages in personal injury cases to the jury but leaving the decision on general damages still in the jury's hands.  I have to disagree with the Deputy on both counts.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is such a thing as a standard for compensation for injuries which the ordinary citizen has and which may be ascertained in the context of a personal injury case by consulting 12 people on a jury.  In truth there are many different standards varying from one citizen to the next and, of more significance in conection with the present debate, varying from one jury to the next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly.  Indeed, it varies a good deal.  It varies so much even in the Deputy's party and possibly people on this side of the House cannot agree fully on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>All the evidence goes to show that the civil jury system provides awards which can be remarkably unpredictable, varying widely between cases where the circumstances are comparable. This is what the MacLiam Committee accepted.  They agreed that widely different awards, where the circumstances were comparable, were inconsistent with fairness, and concluded that it would be conducive to the proper management of motor insurance if a greater degree of consistency could be achieved in the assessment of damages, bearing in mind the overriding requirement of doing justice between the parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This propensity towards inconsistent and unpredictable awards is an inherent fault in the jury system of assessment of damages, which involves thousands of <Col N="589" /> people every year in a once-off task of putting a financial value on injuries and in deciding issues of fault as between the parties in personal injuries cases.</P>
    <P>The problem for juries is compounded by the fact that some of the matters to be decided are entirely subjective, such as the assessment of general damages for pain and suffering and loss of amenities.  In these circumstances I believe that it is unreal to talk about the standard of the ordinary individual for deciding the issues that arise in the personal injury case. Indeed, the only attempt to introduce a standard or guideline in assessing general damages has come from the Judiciary in the form of the rough limit of £150,000 suggested by the Supreme Court to apply in very serious injury cases.</P>
    <P>Although Deputy Skelly was critical of this limit, I am not aware that anyone else has seriously criticised the judges as having set an unreasonable standard that is out of line with ordinary standards.  I am aware that this particular amount is quite generous by comparison with the maximum awards for general damages in Britain.  Deputies may be interested to know that in the USA excessive awards by juries of compensation for non-economic damages, such as general damages for pain and suffering and loss of amenities, are greatly worrying legislators there and have led to various proposals that are currently before the US Legislature for tort reform, including a proposal from the Reagan administration to introduce a limit of $100,000 on jury awards for all non-economic loss, in personal injuries cases arising in the area of product liability.</P>

Deputy Donnellan is Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry.  Is the Minister of State at the Department of Justice not available to deliver this speech?  Is the Minister of State delivering the speech on behalf of the Minister for Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry?  Does the Minister for Justice <Col N="590" /> not think it is important to come into the House to reply to a debate of such major importance where the rights of citizens are very seriously affected by the removal of the right to trial by jury?  This is the conclusion of a major debate which has gone on for some time and where points have been made on both sides of the House against this measure.  Does the Minister not think it worthwhile to come into the House, when such a right is being abolished, to reply to the debate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>This leads to another point.  The standards of the Judiciary are those that already prevail, ultimately, in deciding personal injury cases.  This is because all High Court jury decisions are appealable to the Supreme Court, and that court consists of judges sitting without juries.  The Supreme Court have become quite active in this area and have been prepared to substitute their own assessment of damages for that of a jury in an appeal or quantum to an increasing extent in personal injury cases.  The court confirmed their constitutional right to do so in a recent case.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the point made by some Deputies that the standards that judges will apply in evaluating injuries will be seriously out of line with other standards in the community, due to their alleged elitist social background.  The fact is that judges all come from within the ranks of the Senior Bar, whose members are continuously involved in evaluating injuries in personal injuries cases, and in settling about 95 per cent of cases where proceedings are instituted, based on such valuations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister asked members of the Judiciary to give their <Col N="592" /> views in relation to the question of whether they would prefer to have juries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that on Committee Stage the Deputy will have an opportunity to raise these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not be allowed to as no section deals with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy's ingenuity will ensure that he will raise it on some other section.</P>
      <P>There is experience already with the assessment of damages without a jury in a large number of serious personal injuries cases.  That is in the operation of the Stardust Victims' Compensation Tribunal currently sitting.  That tribunal, consisting of a judge and two lawyers, have already dealt with about 400 cases, and a further influx of cases is expected before the extended closing date for submission of cases expires.  I understand it can be said that there is general satisfaction among injured parties and their lawyers with the way in which their cases have been dealt with and the level of compensation granted, which have included awards up to about £200,000. Also, awards are decided by lawyers acting alone on the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal which has dealt with over 3,000 cases since it commenced operation in 1974.  Individual awards made by the tribunal have exceeded £300,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be expected that under the new arrangements proposed in the Bill the Judiciary will quickly develop a range of standards or guidelines in relation to quantum for damages.  Such a development would contribute to greater consistency and predictability of awards.  The value of such a development is likely to be considerable in relation to stability in the insurance market.  Deputy Woods made the point that as only a very small percentage of personal injuries cases actually go to trial the savings that could result from the abolition of juries would not, therefore, be significant.  But this conceals the fact that there has been considerable growth in the number of jury <Col N="593" /> actions in the High Court in recent years. Statistics published in the Comprehensive Public Expenditure Programmes, 1985, show that between 1978 and 1984 the number of jury actions disposed of in the High Court increased from 1,550 to 5,650.  While separate figures are not available for personal injuries cases, the overwhelming majority of jury cases &mdash; well over 90 per cent &mdash; are in that category.</P>
    <P>Also, it should be borne in mind that the implications of having very excessive awards given by a jury in even a small number of cases can have the most serious and wide-ranging effects over a whole range of insurance premiums.  The matter is put, rather succinctly I think, in the following extract which I would like to quote from a recent article in <i>Time</i> magazine, which reported on the crisis that has arisen in the area of liability insurance in the USA.</P>
    <P>If a few giant jury awards, actual or merely possible, can offset the premiums on an entire line of insurance, the companies feel they must raise premiums for everybody until there is some hope of making a profit.  This means that premiums may bear no relationship to an individual policyholder's record, and buyers of many kinds of insurance are suddenly paying three or four times as much as they did a year or so earlier.</P>
    <P>The serious implications of unpredictable verdicts by juries extend beyond the area of quantum of damages.  In relation to such important issues as the issue of contributory negligence, for example, juries may vary considerably in regard to the degree of contributory negligence that will be attributed to a plaintiff for failing to wear a safety belt in a motor vehicle. I understand that some juries have taken the view that a degree of fault of 2 per cent should be attributed to the plaintiff, while others have assessed the degree of contributory negligence as 20 per cent or more.  Such variations in the outlook of different juries can have very substantial influence on the actual damages that a <Col N="594" /> plaintiff will be awarded in one case compared with another.</P>
    <P>Finally, as various commentators have remarked, to an increasing extent more sophisticated and technical matters have to be decided nowadays in personal injury cases.  These are matters which call for an increasingly high level of comprehension and intellectual capacity.  For example, questions relating to the proper allowance to be made for future inflation, what discount rates to apply in calculating the present value of future costs or losses, what contingency or risk probabilities should be used to allow for the vagaries of employment, redundancy, illness or early demise.</P>
    <P>Actuarial evidence, which is frequently adduced in such cases, is no doubt a help; but the Supreme Court has made it clear that such evidence is only a guideline, so that a range of decisions may have to be taken by juries and they are becoming increasingly complex and difficult in many personal injury cases.</P>
    <P>In saying all this I do not intend to denigrate in any way the contribution which many citizens have made, as jurors, to the administration of justice. What I am saying is that the Government believe that there is a better way to decide personal injury cases and that the time has come to adopt new arrangements more suited to present needs and circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods and some other Deputies accepted that some reform is needed in the present jury system and suggested that the recommendation of the MacLiam Committee that I have referred to already should be implemented.  As the Minister indicated in his opening speech, the Government did consider this option but rejected it.  Briefly, the reasons for this were that it would be difficult to estimate the effect, if any, that such a change would have on the level or consistency of jury awards, mainly due to the discretion that would apply both as regards the judge and the jury.  It could be difficult for a judge to know what the going range for damages in relation to different injuries actually was at any time.  And, if a judge were permitted to <Col N="595" /> mention a figure to the jury, it might be the cause of many appeals on the grounds that he had given the jury the wrong information, or that the figures he used were out of date or represented totally different types of cases.  Also, it is clear that there could be a great deal of argument about what was a comparable case and there would be wide scope for appeals on that issue too.  There could also be serious objections to empowering a trial judge, but not counsel for either party, to suggest a figure to the jury.  In fact, even if counsel were forbidden to suggest a figure to the jury, it would be extremely difficult to defend a situation where, if the judge had that role, counsel would be forbidden to address the judge on the subject in the jury's absence.</P>
    <P>Most of the judges of the Superior Courts who were consulted by the Minister's predecessor, and who commented on this matter, indicated that they did not favour this recommendation.  Some judges thought the idea unworkable in practice.  Insurers believe that the implementation of the MacLiam Committee recommendation would not constitute any real change in the present system or reduce legal costs.</P>
    <P>Also it is relevant to point out that the MacLiam Committee reported in 1982 before the recent debate on the jury issue came to the fore, after the intervention of the Supreme Court in 1983 and 1984 to restore reality into the assessment of damages, following some very high awards in personal injuries cases, which had received considerable publicity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods quoted with approval the words of Justice Douglas of the US Supreme Court in support of the role of juries.  I wonder would he repeat these sentiments today?  By all accounts a national crisis exists in the US at present in relation to liability insurance, so much so that President Reagan has placed the subject of civil liability reform on his legislative agenda.  Six liability reform Bills are reported to be before the US Congress at present and every State Legislature sitting this year is considering some measure of liability reform.  Excessive <Col N="596" /> jury awards are among the reasons advanced for the present crisis.  Many instances are quoted, none more dramatic perhaps than the reported award of £3.5 million punitive damages to a couple who sued an insurance company for wrongfully refusing to pay a hospital bill of £1,650.</P>
    <P>Coming on to the reasons advanced by Deputy Woods for not supporting the Bill, I have to say that he is wrong to imply that we do not expect that benefits will arise for the insuring public from the abolition of juries.  In their most comprehensive statement on the issue, made since the debate commenced in the House, the Irish Insurance Federation said that the abolition of juries will produce savings of the order of 25 per cent in legal costs, which have a major hearing on their total claims costs and that these savings will have a direct and positive effect on premium levels.  On the question of reduced premiums they said:</P>
    <P>The industry has been reluctant to create false hopes or expectations of an immediate reduction in premium levels because it recognises that many of the existing cases in the pipe line would continue to have the option of jury trial.  However, it is incorrect and blatantly misleading to suggest that because premiums will not reduce overnight no benefits will accrue to policyholders.  It must be remembered that over the past 3 to 4 years premium rates for motor insurance have increased annually by an average of 20 per cent.  Premium rates for employers and public liability insurance have increased by much higher percentages. Consequently, the stabilisation of premiums at their current levels or a reduction in the rate of increase that otherwise would have been applied, will represent a significant real saving for policyholders.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods advocated that certain changes should be made in the operation of the legal system and arrangements for hearing personal injury cases aimed at reducing legal, medical and expert witness costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Woods suggested a doubling of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to allow more cases to be dealt with in that court, which sits without a jury, and urged greater law enforcement to eliminate the cost of uninsured driving, reduce motor accidents and accidents in the workplace.  He made a case for introducing a system of periodic and provisional payments to equate compensation for personal injuries more closely to needs.  He also advocated a review of the social welfare code as it applies to compensation for personal injuries.  The Deputy believes that such reforms, if implemented, will reduce insurance costs and he has put them forward instead of the proposal in the Bill, which he believes will not affect insurance costs.</P>
      <P>I would not disagree about the need for reforms in the area of legal costs and in the wider operation of the legal system as it applies to personal injuries cases. Various Deputies, including Deputy Allen and Deputy Yates, in their contributions laid particular emphasis on these matters.  But these are further measures which need to be looked at after the most important single reform in this area has been introduced, that is, the abolition of the civil jury system for deciding personal injury cases.  That is the first necessary step in our view.  The question of a major &ldquo;root and branch&rdquo; reform of our whole civil litigation system, which some Deputies have called for, is obviously a matter for separate consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next thing that should be said is that the replacement of civil juries by a system of judges sitting alone should help to secure some of the reforms that have been advocated in the legal system during <Col N="598" /> this debate and that, by itself, should provide Deputies who are opposed to the proposed measure, with sufficient grounds for supporting it.</P>
    <P>For example, it is accepted by almost everyone who has considered the matter that there will be substantial reductions in the length of trials before a judge sitting alone.  This should produce some savings in legal costs.  The insurers expect so, too. But more important, with less functions to perform for counsel in the absence of juries, the case for multiple representation of counsel is weakened.  Much has been said about the so-called three counsel rule.  Apologists for lawyers frequently blame the listing system in the High Court for the need to brief two senior counsel in a High Court case so that one senior can be sure to be available to take the case, but I cannot accept that the matter is as simple as that.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the uncertainties that exist in relation to the availability of counsel have much more to do with the high incidence of late settlements in personal injury cases and the restrictive practices operated by the Bar, rather than with the present listing system for cases.  The practice of settling so many cases after lists have been called over and finalised seems to make a nonsense of planning the hearing of cases.  I am not against settling cases but have to seriously question the necessity of waiting until so many cases are literally ready to go on before serious attempts are made to settle.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Small Businesses have made a recommendation aimed at reducing the incidence of settlements &ldquo;on the steps&rdquo; and I am having the matter examined as quickly as possible. I am aware that the question of restrictive practices in the legal professions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should love to get into this argument and do my thing, as well.  I am aware that the question of restrictive practices in the legal professions is at present under consideration by the Restrictive Practices Commission in connection with their general examination of restrictive practices in the professions. I expect that the operation of the so-called three counsel or two senior rule will receive attention from the Commission in this regard.  Deputy Yates and other Deputies expressed strong views about this matter and I am aware that the Joint Committee on Small Businesses have recommended that the three counsel rule should be terminated voluntarily by the Bar Council and, failing that, that legislation should be introduced to deal with the matter.  The Minister already said in his opening speech that the need for multiple representation of lawyers in personal injury cases will be looked at critically in the context of the new arrangements.  I am sure the abolition of juries will affect the position positively and reduce the need, if indeed there is any justifiable need at all, to brief so many counsel in High Court cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point about increasing the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, the last increase in the jurisdiction of the lower courts was effected in 1982, under the provisions of the Courts Act, 1981.  That relatively recent increase &mdash; the previous one was in 1971 &mdash; effected a more than seven-fold increase in the jurisdiction of <Col N="602" /> the Circuit Court &mdash; from £2,000 to £15,000.  It provided for a substantial real increase beyond what would have been justified by reference to inflation alone. In these circumstances it would be difficult to justify a further review of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court now.  In England the jurisdiction of the County Courts is only £5,000.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the serious concern being expressed by staff and parents of St. Michael's House due to a very acute shortfall in revenue particularly arising out of a reduction in the budget by £342,000; if he has been informed that because of this shortfall some units will close, staff redundancies will occur, the staff/child ratio will become more unfavourable and the staff morale at St. Michael's House is presently very low; if he has any proposals for additional supplementary funding for this organisativel <Col N="603" /> tion in view of its vital importance in the provision of care and education for mentally handicapped children; if he has any proposals to provide additional capital funding to take account of the immediate need for placement of at least 50 people in residential care; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concern expressed by various non-statutory organisations with the level of funding provided in 1986 in respect of mental handicap services. Where budgeting problems are envisaged the situation is being assessed and in this connection I have arranged for my Department to hold discussions next week with representatives of St. Michael's House regarding the general financing of the association's services. The various matters raised by the Deputy will be considered in the course of these discussions and I will continue to treat the situation as sympathetically as possible in the light of the available resources.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will be pleased to know, however, that despite the heavy demand on funds generally in the health services, I have made provision this year for the opening of the Belcamp unit for day care by St. Michael's House.  The question of providing additional capital funding for residential care is being kept under continuous review, having regard to the present level of resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that the Minister is taking into account the opening of the Belcamp unit, would he accept that it is not possible for this organisation, St. John of God or other non-statutory organisations to manage on an annual cut of 7 per cent? That is what is involved in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may have figures but I have the actual departmental allocations in front of me.  Having met members of St. Michael's House, I know their position.  The original allocation for St. Michael's House last year was £3.895 million.  There was a revised allocation during the year bringing it up to £4.06 million.  The first allocation for 1986 is £4 million.  There is a meeting arranged with St. Michael's House for Thursday, 26 June to discuss the implications of their budget for 1986.  I think it will be a useful meeting.  I am quite certain we will be well able to deliver the ongoing services of St. Michael's House during 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many aged parents of mentally handicapped children are simply no longer able to cope?  Those children are in need of residential care.  St. Michael's House and other similar organisations are aware of suicidal tendencies in some of these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying to a question in relation to St. Michael's House but I would be glad to deal with any other questions relating to the other facility mentioned by the Deputy, namely, the Brothers of St. John of God. In relation to St. Michael's House, at the meeting on 26 June we will discuss with that body their current budget and the opening of the adult special care unit which was completed last year at a capital cost of £1 million.  It will be fully operational by the end of this year at which time it will cater for 70 moderately and severely handicapped adults.  The annual cost of running that unit in Belcamp will be £300,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister how he intends to deal with the crisis in the emergency waiting list for residential places?  In the Eastern Health Board area alone there are known to be 250 on the super emergency list, including <Col N="605" /> the 50 I mentioned.  It is a real crisis. Whether or not it is relevant to the wording in questions, there are a number of parents in the plight I mentioned.  I am sure the Department are concerned about the situation in the Dublin region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad to discuss with the Deputy the general question. There is a specific question in relation to St. Michael's House.  I currently am awaiting proposals &mdash; if I may take the general question very briefly &mdash; from the Eastern Health Board regarding the general provision of residential care.  As the Deputy knows, I have decided to recast completely the proposeals in relation to the Loughlinstown project and instead to spread out throughout north County Dublin, the west of the county and into Kildare and Wicklow that £9 million of investment in residential care. I do not believe in building, as we built elsewhere, large institutional structures for 200 to 300 mentally handicapped people with 400 or 500 staff.  That is not the right way to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My question refers to the need for places for at least 50 people in residential care.  In that context, if the Minister is not considering capital funds, is he considering immediate supplementary current funding to provide staff to enable adequate care to be provided and for those 50 people to be taken in?  It is relevant to the wording of the question.  If he is not agreeing with the capital funding side, is he saying current funding is needed?  If so, is it going to be provided?  It is not good enough to say he is dealing specifically with the question when the wording of the question refers to the urgent need for residential placements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will strongly make the point to the Deputy, and I have made it in relation to St. Michael's House, the two facilities which I have been most concerned about in relation to St. Michael's House are the day care center at Belcamp which will employ about 50 <Col N="606" /> staff who have been sanctioned at a cost of £300,000 additional moneys a year and to bring on stream Cheeverstown House which is partly occupied at this stage.  It has a number of day care attenders and has now got some residential places taken up.  The management of the house are currently examining the feasibility of providing additional places at a marginal extra cost.</P>
      <P>Already, substantial moneys have been provided by the Department of Health to St. Michael's House in the past two to three years.  I regret that some time last year, particularly around local election time, there was a lot of unfortunate and disturbing political propaganda in relation to the work of St. Michael's House, particularly on the north side of Dublin where letters to parents were issued by various people.  This was unfortunate and I do not think there will be a recurrence of that this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept from the figures given by himself in this House that the Brothers of St. John of God had an outturn last year of £11.7 million?  Their allocation for the current year is £11.2 million.  This is a reduction of £500,000.  Similarly, every other voluntary organisation have had their allocations cut.  It is far too blasé to come into the House and suggest it is political agitation.  We are now at the end of June and he Minister is still meeting with them to discuss the situation.  I would ask the Minister what he means when he says he will consider their cases sympathetically. Does that mean he intends to give them the necessary funding to continue the excellent work they are doing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy well knows from his long experience, particularly at health board level, that there is a fundamental difference between original allocations at the beginning of a financial year and revised allocations as the year goes on in terms of additional pay costs provided.  In relation to St. John of God the Deputy is contrasting the outturn for 1985 with the first allocation for 1986.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>They are two entirely separate things.  We have to take into account that 75 per cent of those allocations are for pay and pensions.  We have to take into account the changing features of the pay situation which have a considerable impact on the allocations.  I can assure the Deputy that in relation to the mentally handicapped I have taken very special care to ensure that the budgets of the voluntary bodies throughout the country have been fully protected within the level of inflation.  We have provided substantial additional moneys.  For example, we have the extra 15 staff at Drumcar alone in this financial year.  That is growth in services in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from what the Minister said that the voluntary organisations can expect a further allocation of money to ensure that they will be able to provide their services at the same level as last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not make any blanket statements.  I will simply say every week my Department have meetings with the voluntary organisations in the mentally handicapped area.  I stress that their budgets are 95 per cent State budgets.  The Department fund the bulk of the budgets of those bodies.  Each week we meet them on an individual basis.  So far we have received a great deal of co-operation and have been able to give them considerable assistance.  I am not making blanket statements because unfortunately in the old days, and I refer to the Deputy's party, when anybody turned up at the door of the Custom House looking for a few bob, they were just asked what they wanted and off they went.  It is different now.</P>

Furthermore, of the posts he has outlined to the House, would he say how many are newly created ones? Would he please outline the details of the six posts approved for the Western <Col N="612" /> Health Board area, saying whether any of them are for Roscommon County Hospital, particularly for the maternity unit there, and if he is appointing a second physician and/or second surgeon to Roscommon County Hospital?</P>

      <P>I do not have any proposals before me for the appointment of a second physician in Roscommon County Hospital, nor indeed for a second surgeon there.  Regarding the post of obstetrician-gynaecologist in Roscommon I recall quite vividly that the Leader of the Opposition persuaded &mdash; I think that is the most gentle word I could use &mdash; Comhairle na nOspidéal to give sanction to that post against all professional advice.  Since then my Department, the new Comhairle na nOspidéal, and, for that matter, the Western Health Board regard that appointment as being totally unnecessary and undesirable in the light of cover which is available in Sligo, Galway and Portiuncula.  It is a classic example of where the Leader of the Opposition led his party when he was Minister for Health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if in his hospital building programme any efforts are made to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, equipment of Irish manufacture is used, in order to protect employment in native industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>EC legislation prohibits this country from giving preferential treatment to Irish manufactured goods.  Equipment used in the hospital building programme is purchased on the basis of competitive tendering and the policy of my Department is that health <Col N="616" /> agencies should give Irish manufacturers every opportunity to submit tenders. There has been no change in Department policy in this matter during the period of office of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the case of St. James's Hospital, for instance, in regard to a contract for the supply of electrical equipment, a small local firm who were competitive in every way were not given the contract, with the result that they had to lay off a number of employees?  Is he satisfied that throughout the health services where possible &mdash; that is all anybody asks &mdash; work is given to Irish firms with a view to preserving employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that an important objective of our industrial policy is to ensure that Irish contractors are given every opportunity to secure contracts in competition with other EC countries.  We are fully aware in the Department of the importance of the employment implications of those contracts funded under the health capital programme.  I do not in any way interfere with tenders or with contracts, nor do I issue special instructions in that regard. To do so would be in total breach of Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome.  This is very specific and, as the Deputy knows, it is so rigid and stringent that the Guaranteed Irish Campaign sponsored by the Irish Goods Council was found by the European Court in 1981 to be in breach of Article 30.  If there are any specific incidents or contracts about which the Deputy is worried, I will certainly take them up.  I would make the broad point that many contracts, for example, go to Northern Ireland.  Quite tragically and horrendously one of our principal contractors for Cavan Hospital was buried this morning.  He had the electrical contract there and was doing outstanding work.  Whether companies come from Northern Ireland, the Republic or elsewhere we must have an even-handed approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I accept that <Col N="617" /> the Minister does not interfere in individual contracts, but in the case of the supply of electrical equipment to St. James's Hospital I would expect that, if something were brought to his attention, he would have it investigated with a view to ensuring that the Irish firm were given every possible chance.  Is he aware that in this area of supplying equipment, which can be infinitely varied and often very sophisticated, there are many tricks and practices which can be availed of by outside foreign suppliers to the disadvantage of local manufacturers?  Would he agree that it is not enough for architects, engineers and purchasing officers generally to be passive in this regard and that they should be alert to ensure that Irish manufacturers are given a reasonable break on all occasions?  There are such things as dumping and special discounts and many practices can be engaged in to overcome the total objectivity which we would all like to see in the awarding of contracts. Is the Minister satisfied that this alertness is practised throughout the system?  Does he agree with me that it is very disheartening, particularly for small local firms, to lose contracts under conditions of unfair competition from large multinationals and others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept the spirit and the broad thrust of the view of the Leader of the Opposition on this matter.  I can assure him that, where individual Irish manufacturers have come to me or to senior officers of the Department in relation to tendering for local contracts, they have been given every possible co-operation and assistance. Many of them have been quite small firms.  In quite a number of cases I have had investigations made on the outcome of the contracts after the tenders were opened and after the matter was settled.  Up to that stage we have to act in a very circumspect manner and we cannot issue written directives to any health agency because these could be picked up immediately by foreign contractors. I assure the Deputy that we are very sensitive to this area.  Any information <Col N="618" /> from Deputies or any individual representations will be willingly received.</P>

Is he aware that the opening of this new unit would be of enormous benefit to the hospital in its general running and would take a great deal of pressure off the health services generally in the north city?  Can he give any encouraging report on the provision of equipment for that new unit?</P>

We are having discussions tomorrow with the Mater Hospital authorities on their 1986 budget.  I am sure the discussions will be conducted in an atmosphere of co-operation and I do not envisage any major difficulty.  We had considerable difficulty in regard to the impact of the Mater Private Hospital on the VHI but that is an entirely different matter.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of hospital services cards is an administrative arrangement and provides proof of entitlement to all limited eligibility services.</P>
      <P>While such voluntary contributors are currently entitled to a hospital services card on a permanent basis, health boards generally consider that the current cover of the card should not extend beyond one year because of the possibility of changes in the circumstances of holders such as death or eligibility for a general medical services card.  The dependants of such persons could lose entitlement on the death of such a hospital services card holder.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that the requirement to apply annually for renewal of hospital services cards is a serious inconvenience.</P>

      <P>I have a full hospital services card despite my income.  I would have difficulty getting health boards to issue permanent cards because if a card holder dies his or her dependant automatically lose eligibility.  Quite a number of those people might, if their income status suddenly changed, become eligible for an ordinary medical card and, as such, would be covered on a different basis.  If there are any special cases the Deputy is concerned about &mdash; for example in regard to an elderly person &mdash; I am prepared to take them up with the health board concerned.  I understand that there are about 2,000 people in this category.  I can imagine an elderly person being upset at having to apply annually for a card.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the health boards to allocate as they see fit the funds available to them between the different services they provide.  The <i>ad hoc</i> dental scheme whereby adults are referred for dental treatment by private practitioners has been suspended in the Mid-Western, Southern and Western Health Boards and curtailed in the North-Eastern and North-Western Health Boards.  However, the dental staff of these health boards provide dental treatment for eligible adults in priority groups such as expectant and nursing mothers, the handicapped and the elderly.  Emergency treatment for the alleviation of pain is available to all eligible adults in all health boards, but eligible adults who require routine dental treatment but do not belong to a priority grouping are placed on a waiting list for treatment when resources become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the budgetary cut-backs to the North-Western Health Board amount to more than £3 million and because of that the board find it difficult to provide a proper dental service?  Is the Minister aware that 3,575 children are awaiting treatment in Sligo and Leitrim, that the children have been tested and identified as needing treatment but cannot get it because of the long waiting list and the shortage of dentists?  Is the Minister aware that 56 adults urgently need treatment and that 181 are waiting for orthodontic treatment in Sligo and Leitrim? Those figures are frightening as, I am sure, the Minister will agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I must make the point that during my period of office there has been a substantial increase in the number of adults in the Deputy's health board area who have received treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="623" /> In 1982, 5,962 received treatment and that figure rose to 7,893 in 1985.  I accept that the waiting list of 1,800 is still substantial, but the volume of work is increasing all the time, particularly in that health board area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that if I added the figures for Donegal to the figures for Sligo/Leitrim which I quoted the picture would be even worse.  What does the Minister propose to do about the 3,575 children who are awaiting treatment and the 181 who need urgent orthodontio treatment?  I am aware, from representations I have made, that the waiting list is very long, particularly for orthodontic treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister know, or is he concerned that the poorest people in the country cannot receive a dental service unless they are in the priority group he referred to, that they are handicapped or awaiting major surgery? Is he aware that the ordinary adult who needs a filling can go on a waiting list in the sure knowledge that he will never be attended to?  Is he aware that in many community care areas such people are not put on a waiting list because nobody will suggest that they should?  Is it not dishonest to put people who are <Col N="624" /> waiting for a filling in a waiting list knowing that they will never be attended to? The Minister may tell Deputy Brennan that more people are being attended to in the North-Western Health Board area, but I wonder if he is aware of the extent of the problem.  I met a woman last week who was on her way to the credit union, or the bank to borrow money to pay for treatment for her children because she could not get it under the health services. Many genuine cases are not being attended to because the facilities are not there due to lack of funding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very strange that health boards, including the Deputy's, could spend £10.5 million last year on travelling expenses and cut back on the dental scheme.  That is the kind of priority which I call into public question. I have provided for the Deputy's health board area and all the other areas a full scale scheme of consultant orthodontists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of the work on the waiting lists is orthodontic work.  On the <i>ad hoc</i> side, the general dental side, I am very much opposed to the policy of health boards not to take on full time dental officers.  Health boards have been endeavouring to farm out this work on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to private practitioners. It would be far better and less costly to have a proper dental staff for the treatment of adult patients considering the high fees charged by private practitioners. The number of dental officers has not fallen, generally speaking, but the demand has increased because everybody is far more conscious these days of the need for dental care.  I hope the health boards will review their decisions on expenditure, particularly in regard to the <i>ad hoc</i> schemes.  In the Western Health Board and elsewhere they have taken up the post of consultant orthodontist and there has been remarkable progress made with the waiting lists, which have been slack.  It is a matter for the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" /> The money is being allocated and there has been no reduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the health boards find themselves unable to provide the service because of lack of funding, and the Minister must accept that there has been a real decrease in the moneys allocated to health boards since he came to office, will the Minister increase the funding?  He referred to travelling expenses.  Surely the Minister will accept that travelling expenses for public health nurses is a necessary part of the service.  Health boards cut by 10 per cent the travelling expenses of public health nurses when the Minister told them there must be a shift to community care.  If health boards find that they cannot provide a dental service without curtailing other essential services, will he allocate funds to them to ensure that the poorest in the land will be provided with a proper dental service?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there be any public misapprehension about it, I would stress that the proportion for members of health boards is fractional.  However, there is a question to be asked about why thousands of people delivering the health services throughout the country crisscross county boundaries, sometimes three times a day, day after day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no increased charges for ordinary VHI subscribers arising out of any costs associated with the new plans which provide cover for certain high-technology private hospitals.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that the VHI incurred a small cost in notifying subscribers of the new scheme, but I stress that the new scheme is optional. Subscribers were notified generally. Cover is being provided in the two hospitals, at the Mater and in Blackrock, for those willing to pay the additional premium. There was some press and radio advertising of this scheme but the money spent was very small.  I am insisting that the scheme will be entirely self financing.</P>

I can assure the Deputy I kept a very close eye on this and I had enormous difficulty in regard to it.</P>

    <P>Cork Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital: ENT services will transfer from this hospital to the South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital complex by the end of August. Ophthalmology services will transfer to the Cork Regional Hospital and a project team is at present preparing detailed plans to enable this to happen.</P>

Further, in relation to Carlow and Castlerea mental hospitals, will the Minister say if there is agreement that patients who have been in those hospitals for many years will be moved out?  Will he accept that these hospitals will not close in the current year?</P>

      <P>They have agreed to it but many arrangements have to be made with consultants and with nursing staff and we have had individual discussions <Col N="630" /> with each of the trade unions concerned. As the Deputy will understand, it is a complex and difficult exercise but the hospital will close on that date.  I am anxious to provide in that area some other health facility, notably a health centre, because the inner city is increasing in population and a health centre would be very useful.  The hospital is totally unsuitable and is very old.  With regard to the hospitals at Carlow and Castlerea, we have made considerable progress.  The remaining issue in both hospitals is the precise location and the type of facility we want to introduce for the acute admissions in the psychiatric sector.  These discussions are ongoing. I have had lengthy discussions with the principal trade unions concerned and I think they have a full appreciation of our efforts to implement the Government decision.  We are going down that road quite rapidly.</P>

What does he propose will be the future of the patients who have been in the hospitals for many years? Does he intend to take them out and place them elsewhere?  Will he not accept this would be most unreasonable to people who have made the hospitals their home for the past 20 years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be closed as psychiatric hospitals and it is important that they should never again be reopened as such.  It is important that the Deputy or whoever is my successor should not have the prospect of so doing, although in fairness to the Deputy I do not anticipate <Col N="631" /> he would change the decision.  Part of St. Dympna's Hospital will be redesignated as a geriatric unit to cater for the elderly persons who will require geriatric care and part will be redesignated as a unit for mentally handicapped persons who are now in the hospital.  Those are only two of a large number of decisions relating to the area.</P>
      <P>For example, a number of domesticscale residences will be acquired in County Carlow, day-care facilities in Carlow will be developed further and an acute admission facility will be provided in Carlow while we are developing the proposed unit in Kilkenny.  I can confirm there is still disagreement between the health board and the Department as to the precise location of the acute admission unit in Carlow and I hope I will be able to resolve that issue.  I do not wish to go into the services we are providing in County Kildare which is in the catchment area for Carlow but we are substantially down the road with regard to that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that some hospitals will close wards for periods during the current year.  It is normal practice to close some wards during holiday periods, especially in the summer months, when patient demand tends to be at a lower level than at other times of the year and consultant and other hospital staffs are on annual leave.  Temporary closures are also necessary to enable essential maintenance and repairs to be carried out at minimum inconvenience to patients.</P>
      <P>Such closures may result in some patients having to wait a little longer for elective admission to hospital, but I can assure the Deputy that adequate arrangements will be available to treat emergency cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is not suggesting that the closures being announced in every health board area and in the voluntary hospitals are the normal closures for maintenance associated with the summer holiday period?  I will take just one example, namely, the Mater Hospital where the cardiac surgery unit will close for the month of August and where 50 beds are closed for the remainder of the year.  Surely the Minister accepts that this is not a normal pattern of behaviour in Irish hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Deputy mentioned the Mater Hospital, a widely publicised letter was issued by the chief executive officer of that hospital.  I do not want to sound harsh about this but that letter will be the subject of a very critical discussion with the representatives of the Mater Hospital when my officials meet them tomorrow to discuss this issue for the first time.  Meanwhile, officers of my Department have been meeting some of the officers from the Mater Hospital and we are coming up with some rather interesting information, including the fact that not one of those proposals was even costed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that there will not be any closure of the cardiac services in that hospital in the month of August. I am certain of that.  If the Deputy has any difficulties finding out the facts, he can consult the Deputy in his party who is in the employment of that hospital.  He will know that a lot of what happened in relation to this incident is very disturbing not least in terms of the role of the consultants &mdash; and I am not necessarily holding them responsible for that decision.  I believe the decision will be dramatically changed, but it is all part of a major campaign to try to screw an extra few million pounds out of the Minister of the day without the slightest shred of justification.  A couple of consultants, quite rightly, blew the gaff on the board. I am grateful that they exposed what was a most distasteful and undesirable effort on the part of the hospital, which has a very good budget of £25.4 million.  The cardiac unit in that hospital was running <Col N="633" /> well to budget this year and, if the Deputy wants to ask the consultants how that unit was running, he can easily get that information.</P>
    <P>The way hospitals have deliberately politicised their budget problems is almost unique to these islands.  I am not for one second suggesting that the Deputy is in any way involved, but his good offices and his good sense in relation to the Mater might have been taken for granted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>On what does the Minister base his categoric statement today that these proposals were not costed?  Why did he issue statements that consultations had not been held with officials of his Department when apparently consultations have been held on a number of occasions and letters have been written to the Department pointing out what cut-backs would be involved?</P>

      <P>There are ongoing discussions with the Mater Hospital but the decision of the board to publish a letter &mdash; and I am going on memory because I do not have the letter in front of me &mdash; on 28 May to the general practitioners of the catchment area, and I think it was notified to the Department on 6 June, was taken without consultation with the Department.  This decision was taken quite deliberately with a view to stirring things up.</P>

      <P>The costings were not made available to the Department of Health.  To the best of my knowledge the only information made available to the Department was a copy of the notice issued to the general practitioners in the area.  I want to stress that at the meeting with the general practitioners when the <Col N="634" /> board representatives were asked what would be the savings under those headings, the board were unable to answer. All they indulged in was cheap abuse of myself and the Department.</P>

      <P>As regards the medical and specialist expert witness costs in personal injury cases, it is hoped to introduce legislation fairly soon that will facilitate the introduction of a system of pretrial procedures in civil cases in the High Court.  The object of this would be to streamline procedures in these cases and to reduce to the minimum the issues that have to be tried by providing new procedures to agree medical and expert witness reports between the parties before the trial.  It would be the type of reform Deputy Yates would like to see made. The elimination of civil juries in these cases would assist this process.</P>
      <P>The point Deputy Woods made in relation to over-compensation for injuries because social welfare payments were not deducted in assessing damages for personal injuries in a civil liability case is no longer valid since the enactment of the Social Welfare Act, 1984.  Section 12 of that Act provides that the amount of disability benefit, associated pay-related benefit, or invalidity pension payable for up to a period of five years to a person arising from injuries received in a road traffic accident shall be taken into account in assessing damages for personal injuries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The statistics for the State as a whole show a decrease of 20 per cent in the number of unauthorised taking of vehicles in 1985 as compared with 1984 and the figures for the first three months of 1986 showed a similar decrease of 20 per cent in the number of unauthorised takings as compared with the same period last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the case I was making.  Since these figures are coming down, insurance rates should be coming down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction in the rate of road accidents should also help to stabilise motor insurance costs.</P>
      <P>In recent years there has been a significant improvement in road accident trends.  The number of road deaths dropped from a peak of 628 in the year 1978 to 410 in 1985, a reduction of 35 per cent, and provisional figures for the first four months of 1986 show a reduction of 25 per cent on the same period in 1985. There is also a significant decrease in the number of injuries reported from 9,313 in 1984 to 7,327 in 1985.  I understand that the total annual road deaths are now lower than at any time since the present system of accident reporting was introduced in 1968 when there were only 500,000 registered vehicles compared with the present day figure of over 900,000, and that we compare very favourably with other EC countries in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" /> A contributory factory in the improvement of road safety is Garda traffic law enforcement particularly in relation to drink and driving, and dangerous and careless driving.  The number of proceedings taken for these offences is evidence of Garda attention in this area.  Provisional figures for 1985 show 8,219 prosecutions for drink and driving offences of motor vehicles, and 10,925 for dangerous and careless driving.  The Garda are now giving special attention to vehicle defects and the wearing of safety belts.</P>
    <P>The point Deputy Woods raised about the possible introduction of a system of periodic payments and of risk reviews to relate compensation more closely to the real needs of injured persons is an interesting one that could, I feel, be studied. However, that would be an exercise that would have to be done separately from consideration of the proposal in this Bill. I am aware that provisions for interim and provisional awards have been introduced in Britain.  They have one considerable disadvantage in that they have the effect of prolonging litigation.  On the other hand the introduction of a system whereby damages are paid in the form of periodic payments has been firmly rejected by the authorities in Britain.  I think that this area would be a suitable one for consideration by a specialist body here.</P>
    <P>The question of adequate accident preventive measures in the workplace is primarily a matter for the Minister for Labour and I understand that this matter will be dealt with in the context of proposals for legislation which he is developing arising from the report on safety, health and welfare to which Deputy Woods referred.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly thought the proposal was anti-social legislation.  He was concerned that the result of this measure will be to deprive citizens of rights and to introduce financial hardship for unfortunate people who are the victims of accidents caused by the negligence of others. The Minister indicated in his opening speech that he does not believe that this will be the outcome and gave reasons <Col N="679" /> why awards are unlikely to fall substantially in the new situation where a judge sitting alone will decide all the issues in personal injury cases.  In so far as some people are worried about reports that judges award significantly less damages in Britain compared with juries here, reasons were given why the position in England has no valid comparisons for us.  I have no doubt that our judges will exercise the functions granted to them under this Bill fairly and properly and with compassion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly was critical of the behaviour of insurance companies particularly in regard to their unwillingness to settle cases earlier and in dragging out serious cases without attempting to settle.  The insurance spokesmen have stressed that the new arrangements will enable them to settle cases earlier and that savings in insurance costs will result from this.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce will be monitoring carefully the results of the new arrangements and their effects on insurance costs to ensure that savings arising from the implementation of the proposal in the Bill will be passed on to the public.  A general trend towards earlier settlements will have obvious benefits also for injured parties, who will receive their compensation earlier and be able to make more use of it during their lifetime.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland and Deputy Doherty covered much the same ground as Deputy Woods in his contribution.  I have to correct Deputy Hyland on one point. He said that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses, the most recent body to consider the matter of civil jury trials &mdash; and the only one composed of public representatives to do so &mdash; recommended that the system be retained. That is not so.  That committee referred in their report to the Government's proposal contained in this Bill to abolish civil juries in terms that I would interpret as implying support for the measure.  They certainly had no objection to the proposal.  The Chairman of the Committee, Deputy Yates, has spoken in favour of the measure during this debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> I do not share Deputy Cowen's concern that injured parties will not be able to afford to appeal low awards made by judges sitting alone to the Supreme Court.  Under the existing system juries may occasionally make awards that are too low.  In a case reported last month, the Supreme Court, on appeal by a plaintiff, increased a jury award on the grounds that it was too low.  Deputy Taylor referred also to that case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Flynn stressed that more far-reaching reforms are needed to deal with the problems of insurance costs and availability.  I would accept that, and repeat that the abolition of the civil jury system is the first essential step in dealing with these problems.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn accepted the important influence which jury awards in a very small proportion of cases can have over settlement costs in the vast majority of cases which do not go to trial.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn suggested that the Minister had not acknowledged the fact that judges sitting alone decide civil cases in the lower courts.  That is not correct. The Minister referred to the matter in his opening speech.  He said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Furthermore judges sitting alone have been deciding personal injuries cases in the Circuit Court since 1972, and there has been no public reaction as far as I am aware against the level of damages awarded in the Circuit Court. Since the jurisdiction of that court to hear tort actions was increased to £15,000 in 1982, more serious cases are now being decided in the Circuit Court and I am not aware of any claim that Circuit Court judges are making inadequate awards, even in cases where minor injuries are involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn said that provisions should have been included in the Bill for a book of quantum of damages for personal injuries.  A book of quantum exists in Britain, but it has no statutory force at all.  It is simply a collection of data on all judicial decisions on personal injuries, which may be referred to by lawyers and judges.  It is published privately, and first appeared in 1954&mdash;almost 30 years after <Col N="681" /> jury trial was replaced by a judge sitting alone in personal injury cases in England.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy said or implied that the Minister in his opening speech had misrepresented the views of the judges of the superior courts, who were consulted by the Minister's predecessor, to the effect that the majority of the judges were in favour of the change proposed in the Bill.  This is incorrect.  The Minister in his speech said that the views obtained from the judges indicated that they were sharply divided on the issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy suggested that there may well be an increase rather than a decrease in the number of cases that will go to trial under the new arrangements proposed, based on experience in Britain where, he said, 42 judges had to be appointed following the abolition of juries.  However, insurers have stated that the change proposed will enable them to settle more claims more quickly and there has been criticism in the past, and during this debate, of insurers for making unrealistic settlement offers and thereby drawing out the process of settling claims to the last moment.</P>
    <P>In Britain the statutory changes relating to civil juries date back over 50 years. I would suggest that it is much more likely that any expansion of the Judiciary in Britain since then would have been caused by increases in the volume of litigation and crime in the intervening years and in legal remedies in, for example, the labour and employment areas.  In his opening speech the Minister referred to the fact that the number of judges sitting in our High Court had quadrupled from four to 16 since the issue of civil jury trial was first considered by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure in 1965. That was due simply to increased volume of litigation.  I have already indicated that the volume of jury actions disposed of by the High Court increased by about 260 per cent between 1978 and 1984.</P>
    <P>On Deputy O'Kennedy's point about consistency of awards, I would reiterate what the Minister said in his speech, that <Col N="682" /> even allowing for some possible differences between judges, there will be more consistency when personal injury cases are being decided by a group of 16 judges, compared with the present jury system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact that a survey carried out among the Judiciary showed that in 75 per cent of cases which had been tried by a judge and jury, the jury agreed with the amount of compensation suggested by the judge, that in 15 per cent of cases the jury awarded a lower figure and that in 10 per cent of cases the jury awarded a higher amount?  Does the Minister agree that that survey gave a reliable result in contrast to what he said earlier?  In another survey, a majority of the Judiciary were against the abolition of juries and indicated that they would prefer cases to be tried by juries instead of judges sitting on their own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This indicates the problem of putting questions to a Minister who, I appreciate, is not directly involved in this matter.  A questionnaire was sent by the Minister to try to establish what the Judiciary thought in regard to certain matters.  It has been done twice in the recent past and, on both occasions, the results indicated that there were as many in favour of a jury sitting as there were for a judge sitting alone.  The Minister also said that insurance spokesmen stressed that the new arrangements will enable them to settle cases earlier and that there would be savings in insurance costs as a result.  Will there be any savings to the motorist as a result of the measure he is proposing?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

      <P>On Committee Stage we will be limited to particular amendments and sections.  In the part of the speech marked for omission, the Minister gave very valuable information which shows there is a striking reduction &mdash; and that there will be further reductions &mdash; in the accident levels and, therefore, it should be possible for the Minister and the insurance industry to say if there will be reductions. The abolition of the jury system will not lead to a reduction in costs for the motorists; this is a red herring.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I congratulate the Minister of State on his observations in that respect because they are very good. They are also relevant to the debate and indicate that the cost of insurance, especially to the motorist, should be coming down now because of the reductions achieved last year and at present.  I am grateful to the Minister for indicating that because it puts the irrelevance of the measure which we have been debating here in true perspective.  Our accident rate is twice that of Great Britain but, as a result of various actions taken by successive Governments, it is now being reduced.  However, I accept that there will be no reduction in any real sense in the foreseeable future as a result of the abolition of the right which the ordinary man in the street has to elect for a civil jury trial in such cases.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The proposals in it represent a frightening abandonment of the citizens, particularly the property owners, here.  In normal times and in different circumstances there would be some justification for minimising the effects of malicious injuries claims on public funds.  But these are not normal times.  I am sure the House will agree that property has been placed at the gravest possible risk as a result of the increasing level of crime and vandalism.  It is becoming impossible to insure property against <Col N="685" /> this because of the cost which is now at an all time high.  It is almost impossible to get insurance at any price.  That problem has been referred to on many occasions in this House in other debates relating to the Department of Justice and the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>The Minister, by his action in introducing this Bill, is literally throwing property owners to the wolves, these being the vandals who have embarked on a deliberate campaign of the destruction of property. He is not able to contain the level of vandalism and neither will he pick up the bill for the damage and destruction of property following his failure to contain crime in the first instance.  In the past 12 months I and my colleagues have found it necessary to bring to the attention of the Minister the increasing problem of crime and vandalism not only in the city of Dublin but throughout the country. For that reason I hope the House rejects this Bill.  It will have frightening effects on property owners and people who own private houses but, in particular, it will have very damaging consequences for industry where high insurance costs are already a frightening burden.  It is hardly necessary for me to remind the House of the increasing vulnerability of public property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well to say that when we abandon malicious injuries claims provisions, they can and should be replaced by private insurance of property.  But it is almost impossible to get ordinary insurance cover for a normal family house at present.  This is certainly the wrong time for the Minister to contemplate bringing legislation of this kind before the House. Community organisations will also be under threat as a result of the passing of this legislation.  Parish property, particularly schools and community halls, have in the past been obvious targets for vandals. The Government have got their priorities wrong in terms of national development.  All of their policies have been of a reactionary nature, reacting to events after they have occurred rather <Col N="686" /> than taking action to prevent their occurrence in the first instance.  There can be no doubt that the present unacceptably high level of crime is a product of the society which the policies pursued by this Government have created.</P>
    <P>Nobody would disagree that unemployment is a major factor in the very high rate of crime.  While we do not condone vandalism it is easy to understand the reactions of young people in a society which does not provide them with the opportunity to work and to use their education and skills as they were intended to use them, in the work of nation building and as a means of self fulfilment.  Youth leaders and social workers in any city or town will say that crime and vandalism are the product of the society which the politicians have created.  For that reason I regret that we have not been more positive in our efforts to generate employment and to provide a fulfilling role, through work satisfaction, for our young people who are now highly qualified and capable of taking up employment.  They are denied that opportunity because of the policies which are formulated here in this House.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example, in passing, of the kind of opportunity we are missing for the purpose of stimulating fast economic growth and generating employment.  I refer to the construction industry where the potential for job creation is.  The economy would benefit from accelerated growth in that industry.  In fairness, the Government recognised that potential and to some extent legislated to try to deal with it when they introduced the house improvement grant scheme.  We now find that there are thousands of applications unprocessed in the Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to have a dispute with the Chair but I feel it should be acceptable to demonstrate one's point.  I will leave it at that.  There is ample opportunity for job creation within the Government proposal to which I have referred.  We are not maximising our efforts in this House, even within the framework of the existing schemes introduced by the Government, from the point of view of getting the best possible return in terms of employment.</P>
      <P>If the Government had taken the decision to delegate to local authorities rather than trying to control schemes like this from national level, more employment could have been generated.  Centralised bureaucracy is inhibiting the country in the creation of productive employment. I agree with many informed sources such as teachers, clergy, community leaders and workers that unless we can tackle unemployment we will have to provide more money for security, which is of its very nature unproductive.  The Government should get their priorities right.  We would get a far better return for the nation if, instead of having to provide vast sums of money for increased security, we made more advanced preparations in terms of legislation for investment in the economy for the purpose of creating productive employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government cannot have it both ways.  One cannot allow crime and vandalism to be at the present unacceptably high level and at the same time wash one's hands of the effects of the deteriorating situation in society.  Property, private and public, is no longer safe and is subject to damage by vandals.  In different circumstances, given the present high incidence of vandalism one could <Col N="688" /> envisage legislators seriously examining proposals to protect the citizens and property and to compensate for malicious damage.  It would not be difficult for the Minister to envisage some Government bringing before this House proposals to safeguard the property, and indeed the lives, of the citizens.  Yet this evening we are proposing to dismantle the only system through which people can have their investments protected from malicious damage.  That is not acceptable.  It is an abandonment of the citizens at a time when they are most vulnerable and least protected in terms of the safeguards they are entitled to seek from this House.</P>
    <P>The malicious damages scheme as it operated up to now was tightly administered and there was no easy access to compensation until the case could be clearly established and fully proven.  There was never the option of getting either easy money or easy compensation.  Many have suffered serious financial loss because of what seemed to them to be excessive delays and unfair and tough State opposition to the claims.  I am not saying it should not happen like that.  The Government would be absolutely correct in contesting, as far as reasonable, any malicious damage claim, but the scheme was very tightly administered.</P>
    <P>While this Bill may not of its nature be unconstitutional, it undermines the spirit of the Constitution which gives assurance to protect the citizens and property.  I regret that the Government, at this of all times, should make this decision for whatever reason.  I studied carefully the Minister's speech to see if I could find any justifiable or sustainable reason as to why the system should be changed.  The cost of the scheme to the Exchequer was the only valid reason I could find.</P>
    <P>Where is the social justice of a Government who would decide to cut back seriously on a scheme to provide personal compensation for the victims of the now rampant crime and vandalism?  Within the past couple of months we saw the despicable performance of saving £1 million on this very vital and important <Col N="689" /> scheme, the only legislation on our Statute Book providing some level of protection for the victims of crime.  The Vote was in the region of £3 million and the Government decided in 1986 to cut that small amount by £1 million.  This leaves the citizen vulnerable and unprotected in the teeth of crime which is raging at present.  The Minister proposes in this Bill to extend that drastic measure to the point of dismantling the scheme for malicious injuries compensation.  That is totally unacceptable at this time.  If this Bill goes through the House, which I sincerely hope it will not, there will be no means by which individuals, committees and communities can be protected against damage to property.  All this is happening in an environment in which the citizen feels helpless to protect his property.</P>
    <P>In this city, and in most urban and indeed rural areas, people have to form local committees to protect themselves and their property.  Security is a big business, costing industry and private property owners a vast amount yearly &mdash; not even considering the amount of money which has to be spent on equipment to provide security.  Industrialists and business people will tell you of their worries in this connection and the trouble to which they have to go to protect their property. They will say that insurance cover, when they can get it, is becoming an intolerable burden and in some cases can be the straw which breaks the camel's back.  I have known of small industries, even in rural Ireland, where the insurance premiums have increased at such a rate that the owners and operatives of the businesses no longer found them profitable.  While trying to provide maximum insurance cover for their business, they were still under attack and losing money.</P>
    <P>Did Members of this House ever think they would see the day when just down the road from Leinster House business premises would display a notice: &ldquo;Please ring the bell for admission&rdquo;?  There are many businesses on the short stretch of road from Leinster House to Grafton Street displaying such notices.  That is a <Col N="690" /> frightening example of the level to which crime has risen and the insecurity of owners of such properties.  It is totally unacceptable, given that kind of activity, that the Government should say they will not do anything about it.  Did we ever think it would come to the point where firms would have to pay private security companies to protect their property?</P>
    <P>The Government will say, as they are saying in this Bill: &ldquo;Hard luck, but we are now going to leave you the victims of our inability to contain crime and you will have to bear the cost of any damage which occurs&rdquo;.  Is there any justice or fair play in a system which would allow this kind of situation to develop?  Is it any wonder that this House is being treated with a very high level of cynicism at present?  Instead of looking towards this House for protection, the citizens will now be totally abandoned and left without any support or any security, particularly under the heading which we are discussing.</P>
    <P>I referred to the risk at which community property is being placed arising not only from the level of crime which we experience but also as a direct result of this Bill if it passes through the House. We all know the high cost of securing insurance.  We know that as a result of this Bill, and we have done a certain amount of research on it, insurance on schools in urban areas in particular will increase by 45 per cent.  The cost of insuring the glass in these properties will increase by over 100 per cent.  Fire insurance will rise by from 35 per cent to 40 per cent.  These are all intolerable burdens being placed on local communities.  There is no other means by which the necessary level of insurance to cover this property can be got except from the local communities concerned.  Therefore, there will be an increased demand and an increased burden on local communities to provide insurance cover for the property for which they are responsible in their own areas.</P>
    <P>It may not be generally known that in rural areas since 1982, which is only a few short years ago, insurance cover on rural schools and community halls has <Col N="691" /> increased by 100 per cent.  The reason the Minister is bringing this Bill before the House is the cost to the Exchequer arising from malicious damage claims.  It is true to say that these claims have escalated from £5.6 million in 1982 to £18.7 million in 1985.  That is a very substantial increase and a very substantial drain on State funds.  Unfortunately, it also reflects the cost to the State of vandalism and crime. More frightening still, the Bill before us will transfer that cost and that expenditure from the State back to the individual, to the private property owner, the factory owner and the community organisations in terms of schools, churches and community halls.  In many cases the people concerned will not be able to meet the level of insurance which is sought.  That will create other problems which I will not go into in this debate.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the cost of car insurance. We all know car insurance is at an intolerable level at present.  All the indications from insurance companies and people who do research into this kind of work are that motor insurance will increase by at least 5 per cent on top of the present intolerable burden if this Bill goes through the House.  Last year damage to cars amounted to 50 per cent of the total compensation paid out in malicious damage claims.  Cars are no longer a luxury as far as the vast majority of the citizens are concerned.  I say that particularly in relation to rural areas where, if a man or woman is lucky enough to have a job, it will be a considerable distance from their home which means they must have a car to get there.  From their point of view a car is an agent of production.  For that reason any increase in car insurance would be a detrimental blow to these people.  I can envisage a position where, instead of trying to reduce the number of uninsured cars, we will have an escalation.  Nobody wants to see that because uninsured cars and uninsured drivers are a menace on our roads.</P>
    <P>By this method of trying to bring about a reduction in public expenditure the <Col N="692" /> Government will lose substantially more under other headings.  Community organisations, schools, churches, halls and GAA playing fields will all be seriously affected.  This Bill, if enacted, will no doubt have serious repercussions for all these organisations and communities. Did anybody ever think we would see the day in this little country of ours, known as the island of saints and scholars, when churches would be locked during the day? People cannot gain access to churches for the obvious reason of damage by vandals. The pastors, priests and clergymen in all these churches find it necessary to turn the key in the door when no service is taking place.  That reflects very seriously on this House and on our failure to come to grips with the problems of crime and vandalism.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear in highlighting today the unacceptable level of crime and vandalism and the effect which it has on malicious injury claims, that I am not in any way casting a reflection on the Garda who are doing a marvellous job.  At present they are doing a job far beyond the call of duty in terms of protecting our citizens and their property.  I know the Acting Chairman will remind me that I should confine myself to the Bill, but it is relevant to the extent that our gardaí at present are operating in an environment where, if they cannot perform their duties within the limits of the amounts of money available, they are expected not to do that duty.  It is to their credit that, even when they cannot get overtime or adequate financial compensation for their work, they still beyond the call of duty, do the work which they have so ably undertaken on behalf of the State. Instead of trying to pinch money by way of a saving in relation to this operation which we are discussing, the Government would get a far better return by channelling more money into the protection of our citizens and their property.</P>
    <P>In the long term, and this is where I have the greatest possible complaint about the Government, they would have been far better off to get their priorities in order and concentrate, as far as Governments can, on the creation of productive <Col N="693" /> employment.  We react to events after they have occurred and have to provide more and more money for State security whereas, if we had different priorities in terms of job creation, that security would not be necessary.  I appeal to the Minister of State, as my colleague appealed to the Minister of State on the Courts Bill, to look seriously at the proposal before the House.  It will have a detrimental effect on the economy, on individuals and on the community. Instead of contemplating taking the Committee Stage, the Minister and the Government should withdraw the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputy Hyland for allowing me in on this debate. I accept that his submission was sincere from the point of view from which he argued it.  Over the past couple of weeks we have discussed a number of Bills which seriously affect the citizen.  The Minister said this Bill is the end result of a number of measures aimed at reducing public expenditure.  They were also the main reason for bringing in the Courts Bill to abolish juries.  There is always a human cost involved.  We have to take into consideration the situation in relation to malicious damages which pertains in the State.  We should look back on it to see its extent, whether we are getting value for money and whether we can curtail it in any way.  I do not think the sole reason for change should be the rising costs in meeting claims for malicious damages and the consequential effect on the level of expenditure.</P>
      <P>As I said on the Courts Bill, there are some things the insurance companies can do to mitigate the high cost of insurance. As on that Bill, the initial plea by the insurance companies was that, because of the high cost which had to be passed on to the motorists in that case, juries should be abolished.  In this case it is because of the high cost to the insurer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> Because of payouts on malicious damages they are again looking for a reduction. I do not think the insurance companies have contributed in any way, given their strength, muscle and the huge amount of resources at their disposal.  They have not tried to reduce the high cost of insurance by their own efforts in the case of the abolition of juries in civil actions for personal injuries, nor have they contributed in any way in this case.  They spend huge amounts of money, a very large proportion of their total expenditure, on marketing and advertising in trying to draw the public to take out insurance policies.  They could direct that expenditure to the public in a way that could influence them to respect property and inform them of the high cost in the end to the taxpayer because of an increased amount of vandalism and malicious damage to premises.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there are many abuses by those in business and by those who have a need for public liability insurance and who make claims against local authorities for malicious damages.  These are often badly abused.  I can think of one instance where a business was run by telex from New York to here.  This business was run on a daily basis by telex. The managing director as part of his daily report informed the principal in New York by telex that there had been a storm the night before and some corrugated iron fences had been blown down.  A telex came back from New York asking if any damages could be claimed.  The managing director responded by saying there was no damage done.  Another telex came back asking him if damages could be claimed and to send a list of damages which could be claimed.  That went on until such time as a large claim was put in.  This just goes to show that there are tremendous abuses of the system.  On the other hand, there is the small business person who cannot afford to pay the increased cost of insurance as a result of malicious damage.  If he does have a claim, he is in a Catch 22 situation. Immediately, his premiums will be reassessed and he will not be able to pay.</P>
    <P>There is a certain amount of disquiet <Col N="695" /> in the country as a result of what some people might say is the removal of a civil right by abolishing juries in civil actions. In this case, it will fall to the citizen to pick up the tab of £20 million which the Minister is trying to save for the Exchequer. The insurance companies will increase it.  The administration of justice, the monitoring of cases involved in malicious injuries, personal injuries and criminal injuries have to be examined. For example, there has been tremendous disquiet in the last week or so concerning the case of Fr. Molloy and Richard Flynn. Throughout the country people are very unhappy and feel disturbed as they did after the Fairview Park murder case.  In this case, the judge ruled that there was no case to answer.  Many people feel they need juries and tribunals.  They are comforted by the fact that they can be tried by their fellow citizens.</P>
    <P>Many people would say that in the Flynn case the judge was wrong in his instructions to the jury, that he should have taken particular note of the medical evidence which was available and there was a case to answer, that he should have taken note of the marks and cuts on the priest's body, that there was a death and an assault.  Richard Flynn was charged with the unlawful killing of Fr. Molloy and with a second count of actual assault.</P>

      <P>I am talking about courts, juries, malicious damages, about the administration of the law, its costs and effects on citizens.  I am talking about the terrible disquiet that will arise as a result of the provisions of this Bill and the disquiet occasioned as a result of cases that are heard daily in our courts.  Of course we can talk about them in here.  That is what this Assembly is for.  With respect to the Chair, I beg to differ from him.  I hope he will allow me to continue making my submission.</P>
      <P>In that case I and many other people felt that case should have been put to the jury.  On the other hand, of course, the judge was entitled to take the decision he did.  There are other questions I will be putting to the Minister in relation to this case, to cases that arise from time to time, in relation to the monitoring of the administration of the law, civil and criminal, and the questions we can refer to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions about the manner in which that particular case was approached.  For example, questions arise with regard to the slowness in having the defendant arrested, why three months elapsed before there was an arrest.  Indeed, questions arise as to why it was necessary for the Cardinal and the local Bishop of Elphin to become involved.  It appears the Molloy family are very upset by what has happened, some of them feeling that justice has not been done.  Indeed, if this happened in my constituency in, say, Ballyfermot or in the inner city area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Finally, in relation to that particular case, last Sunday's edition of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> outlined it in fairly good detail, as did also <i>The Irish Times</i> and the other Sunday papers.  There remain a lot of questions unanswered.  There is much unhappiness and disquiet about the case throughout the country.  One might well pose the question: is there now a new rule which says it is all right to beat a person to death as long as it is in a public park at night time or in a bedroom?  Is that the proposition put to citizens as a result of the decision in this case?  Questions will continue to arise about this case.  Indeed, they will continue to be asked in this House until such time as they are answered satisfactorily.  It is the job of the parliamentarian to ask such questions.  Otherwise I would suggest that every citizen saves up sufficient money to get out of the country at a moment's notice if the administration of justice continues down this path.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="698" /> I could list 20 or more questions that remain unanswered in relation to this Flynn case and another.  The matter should be debated in this House and I shall be asking the Minister concerned to allow time for discussion of this most serious case which has caused so much disquiet.  A man has died whose name has not been cleared.  There has been much innuendo.  The Church have taken up a position in relation to a nephew of the dead man in that they have not accepted him into the Church.  It appears they are regarding him as guilty.  This is hypocritical of a Christian Church with so much influence in the country at present, who are now taking up a position on an amendment we are endeavouring to make to the Constitution.  The Church and Cardinal must answer for their interference in this case.  We must all know why it was necessary to have this interference, why it is that people are so anxious to hush up the facts of this case.</P>
    <P>I am not saying at all that the judge was wrong to acquit the defendant at the time.  I admire the solidarity of Mr. Flynn's family.  I do not suggest for a moment that the defendant should have been found guilty, sent to jail or anything like that; that is not always necessary. But I do believe there was an assault, there was a death.  The judge said there was no impropriety on the part of the priest, even though the defendant put up a case of self-defence against the priest. The case leaves many questions unanswered. In the interests of the administration of justice I hope time will be given in this House for its discussion.  Certainly I shall be asking that that be done within the coming week and I hope some other Members will join me.</P>
    <P>We had an answer today from the Minister who, understandably, could not be present, in relation to the Bill that preceded this one.  We are really in the business of amending our laws in a far-reaching manner as far as the administration of justice and the individual citizen are concerned.  I had been talking about the great difficulty experienced by business people in this city where most of the malicious damage takes place.  It is <Col N="699" /> becoming impossible for such people to afford insurance cover bearing in mind the premiums being charged.  The insurance companies are very quick to select particular businesses, to put a loaded premium on them, either because they do not accept the information they are given or they feel they are high risk.</P>
    <P>For example, the construction industry has been paying much over the odds for insurance cover.  It is reaching the stage when business people will be unable to afford insurance cover at all.  They dare not make a claim.  I know of many business people who have experienced many break-ins, with much malicious damage, their roofs and windows smashed, their property stolen.  Yet they have not lodged claims with insurance companies because they cannot afford to pay the increased premiums.  The Government should examine this closely before taking the drastic step of leaving citizens or business people to pay increased premiums.</P>
    <P>The record of insurance companies is appallingly bad, as was demonstrated in our discussion of the Courts Bill and to date on this one.  These must be lucky times for insurance companies, or they must have very great influence in this House because they appear to be receiving such favourable treatment.  Everything they are seeking is being given them without much effort on their part.  It is not as though they need the money.  It is just that they are not making sufficient profits in certain areas.  They are not asked to put into the pool all of their profits in certain areas to offset losses in others.  Just as in the case of the banks, who are not prepared to lend in high risk areas, the Government must then become involved.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="700" /> That a sum not exceeding £223,905,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1986, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain services administered by that Office, and of the Irish Land Commission, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The major challenge confronting farmers in 1985 was that of maintaining their incomes in a difficult environment.  They experienced very serious adverse effects of unfavourable weather conditions, and this is a reminder of the extent to which farming is still at the mercy of the elements.</P>
    <P>These adverse effects were reflected in agricultural output and farm incomes.  In the period 1980 to 1984, gross agricultural output increased by almost 19 per cent in volume terms while average real farm income per head rose by about one-third. At the same time real incomes outside agriculture were generally either stagnant or in decline.  However, 1985 brought a reversal in this trend.  As a result of the bad weather gross agricultural output fell by 1.6 per cent in volume terms and this, combined with changes in prices and a small increase in the volume of inputs of materials and services used on farms, led to a 10 per cent drop in family farm incomes in 1985.  Even so, average real farm incomes per head were better last year than in the preceding years of the eighties, apart from 1984. This shows that one should not view the overall situation merely in terms of those who undoubtedly were badly affected by last year's bad weather.</P>
    <P>There have been some suggestions of a further fall in farm incomes this year. The weather in recent months has, of course, been particularly unfavourable but it is far too early to make any reliable predictions about the outcome for the year.  A good summer could bring an improvement over last year in the returns <Col N="701" /> from crop production, while an improvement in fodder supplies would help the winter feed situation.  Obviously some farmers are encountering severe difficulties at present but at this stage one cannot forecast the overall outcome for 1986 for Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>As a race we are only too glad to forecast bad results.  It is a national characteristic. I am glad to say that the improvement in the weather over the past ten days has done a world of good.  It is better than any subsidy that I or the Government could give and it has brought about a tremendous change.  I am always blamed for bad weather but I am never praised for good weather.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister never looks for praise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not get it anyway. Despite the restrictions imposed by the EC, the uncertainty in relation to the Common Agricultural Policy and the generally difficult world markets for many farm products, I would still hope to see a recovery in farm output and incomes this year.  Furthermore, the declines in interest rates and inflation together with the significant drop in oil prices will create an environment that should help towards restoring the pattern of growth of agricultural output and farm incomes that we had in the first half of this decade.</P>
      <P>Despite the drop in agricultural output in 1985, agricultural exports last year exceeded £1,670 million, an increase of some £40 million on the 1984 figure.  The growth came largely from a volume increase, particularly in beef.  When combined with estimated FEOGA guarantee section receipts of some £835 million, which are largely dependent on the level of exports, the contribution of agricultural exports to our balance of payments position last year was about £2,500 million, a staggering figure.  This is a record both in value and in volume terms and is particularly welcome because of the low import content in agricultural exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already spoken in considerable <Col N="702" /> detail in the House on the EC prices package for 1986-87.  While the belt tightening aspects of that settlement are of course unwelcome, they are being borne by all the member states and they constitute an attempt to get the various agricultural markets back into a healthy trading situation.  Success in that endeavour would be of major advantage to this country.  It would be very much to our advantage if the surpluses which are at present so considerable could be got rid of or drastically reduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The very serious problems for Community agriculture which formed the background to this year's negotiations were described in detail by the European Commission in their Green Paper of July 1985.  The Commission gave notice of how they meant to tackle those problems in their subsequent guidelines document entitled <i>A Future for Community Agriculture</i> and in related policy documents and proposals.  The Commission noted in particular the existence of serious surplus and budget problems.  These problems would not just go away.  They had to be tackled and this country, for which the market unity and financial solidarity of the CAP are so important, had a greater interest in tackling and solving them perhaps any other member state.</P>
    <P>Our analysis of the causes of these problems did not coincide with the Commission's views on all points.  For example, we have maintained that the current large stocks of beef constitute essentially a short term supply problem stemming from temporarily heavy cow slaughterings in the Community as a result of the milk super-levy.  In this regard, we succeeded in averting the drastic proposals on intervention which had been made by the Commission.  That point is not understood or acknowledged by very many people.</P>
    <P>The Commission proposed in this year's price package that there should be no possibility of intervention for carcase beef in the autumn.  One does not need a great deal of imagination to realise what would happen to cattle prices in that event.  We are given very little credit for <Col N="703" /> being the country which stopped that from happening.  It would have meant a crisis in the beef industry.  I cannot guarantee that it will not happen in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a crisis in the beef industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not.  There would be a real crisis if prices were reduced by a considerable amount and that would have happened if there were no possibility of full carcase intervention in the autumn.  The possibility is still there and I am hoping we will convince the Commission that it must be retained. They wanted to eliminate any possibility of full carcase intervention.  Instead, the present rules are to continue unchanged for this year and there is to be a review of the system by December next.  We think that by then there may be greater evidence to support our analysis of the situation.  We want the Commission to adjust their proposals for beef so as to provide for the continuation of realistic and clearly defined intervention support arrangements.</P>
      <P>In other words, we are saying to the Commission that we think the beef mountain, and the problems in the beef industry, are temporary and are largely due to the killing of cows as a result of the milk super-levy.  We are saying that, given a year or two, we will get rid of that beef surplus.</P>
      <P>We also sought in the Council discussions to have greater account taken of other broad aspects such as the levels of farm incomes and the varying production and marketing conditions in the different regions of the Community.  We persuaded the Commission to make a fairly substantial green rate adjustment for this country, the result representing a gain of about £75 million a year for the Irish agricultural sector.  Also, the most stringent aspects of proposed quality standards for cereals for intervention, which we maintained were unrelated to the needs of regional markets, were adjusted by the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> It is important to note that the milk quota reductions apply to all member states and that we accordingly retain in full the quota advantage relative to other member states which we achieved in the 1984 negotiations.  That advantage is approximately 20 per cent.  As regards the quota reduction to be made here over the next three years, I am confident that the compensatory payments under the voluntary scheme will be attractive enough to induce a sufficient number of farmers, particularly farmers nearing retirement age or without dependents, to leave production.  A successful scheme of this nature will make compulsory acrossthe-board cuts unnecessary.  I am confident that there will be sufficient people prepared to give up milk production voluntarily thereby averting the possibility of having to make compulsory cuts.</P>
    <P>There are now over a million tonnes of butter in intervention and these are having a very depressing effect on the international butter market.  Also, it has to be recognised that consumer preferences and habits are changing, and we must provide for this.  Now that I have negotiated as part of the prices package the restoration of FEOGA investment aid for certain milk processing projects, it will be easier for the milk processing industry here to intensify their efforts to develop new products and to become more market-orientated.</P>
    <P>The butter surplus is a very serious problem with more than one million tonnes in intervention.  That amount is increasing rather than decreasing.  The amount of butter that went into intervention in 1985 was a record.  It is unfortunate that butter consumption is dropping, primarily because there has been medical advice that it gives rise to certain health hazards.  That advice may not be true but the trend is that people are switching to other products.</P>
    <P>Overall this year's price package has been one of mixed fortunes for all the member states including ourselves, but looked at in a longer perspective it represents a step towards solving very real problems facing Community agriculture. As of now, we are heavily dependent on <Col N="705" /> the Community support systems for our agricultural production.  That is why I put so much effort into safeguarding the vital elements of those systems, but it is clear that both farmers and processors will have to become more market-orientated and much less dependent on Community support.</P>
    <P>That is the direction in which other food production countries have gone, and it is the only direction that holds out hope of real and lasting prosperity for our agricultural sector.  Help is available for those who have the will to adapt, and more is likely to be available in the future. For instance, the Council also agreed to take new action at an early date on the social and structural aspects of agriculture. That is a development which I welcomed.</P>
    <P>The money countries, the countries that keep the CAP going financially are getting fed up with having to pay for huge surpluses.  They see that as wasteful and they want to erode the support systems such as intervention which we have been utilising more than anybody else proportionately. Therein lies a real danger to agriculture here.  We must be able to sell our produce on the open market and not be resorting continuously to intervention. To be selling most of what we produce into intervention is an ill-advised path to travel.  Not alone would we be safeguarding ourselves by selling on the open market in the event of those supports being cut but farmers would get a better price for their produce.  That is one of the reasons why continental farmers get better prices for their produce than Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are parts of the prices settlement that we would have preferred to avoid, but there has never been a prices package in which an Irish Minister for Agriculture, or any other Minister for Agriculture for that matter, got everything he sought.  The results were, from Ireland's point of view, the best that could have been obtained and, all in all, the package provides a sizeable net benefit to our agriculture.</P>
    <P>To deal with the Estimate itself, the gross sum is £365 million which is about <Col N="706" /> £11 million or 3 per cent above the amount spent in 1985.  However, as receipts also are projected to rise by about £11 million the net estimate of £224 million is similar to the amount spent in 1985.  The main increases in expenditure are for the 1985 weather damage relief measures which were paid early this year, the farm improvement programme, western measures and market intervention. The main decreases relate to food subsidies, the calved heifer scheme, disease eradication and exchange rate guarantees. The principal items giving rise to the higher receipts are EC contributions in respect of market intervention and the disadvantaged areas schemes.</P>
    <P>While the food subsidies are included in the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture they do not affect that Estimate; they could be in the Estimate for any Department.  With regard to the farm improvement programme I should like to state that it is a new edition of the old farm modernisation scheme.  The calf heifer scheme has been done away with. It was introduced for a three year period to try to increase the national herd but there is no evidence to indicate that there was an increase as a result of the scheme. Farmers received £70 for every extra heifer but that did not encourage people to increase their herds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>If we did not have that scheme what would the position be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The evidence is that the scheme did not increase the national herd by even one animal.  Disease eradication is a very thorny question.  We would need about £4.5 million more to carry out the same intensive programme of testing in 1986 as we did in 1985 and I am still hopeful of getting that money by savings elsewhere in the Estimate.  If we continue the level of testing which commenced in June 1985 I am confident we will eliminate bovine TB as far as is practicable within two years.  The progress made last year was dramatic and I do not intend to let that progress slip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out that between the increase in headage grants for beef <Col N="707" /> cows and the extension of the disadvantaged areas scheme we are providing in the region of £18 million extra this year. Some people are critical when piddling schemes are done away with.  Schemes are introduced for a certain length of time, not for an eternity.  They are introduced to give a boost to a certain sector and, when it is felt that they have served their purpose, they are discontinued.  We are criticised for discontinuing some schemes that cost a few million pounds but people conveniently ignore the fact that this year we will be spending £17 million or £18 million extra in disadvantaged areas by increasing the rate of payment for beef cows and spending a considerable amount of money in the parts of the country that are either seriously or moderately handicapped.</P>
    <P>Of course, the gross estimate of £365 millions represents only part of the total amount spent by my Department.  For 1985 this overall sum amounted to about £1,555 million including some £790 million of expenditure fully funded by the EC in respect of agricultural support measures and about £400 million borrowed by my Department for intervention purchases of beef, butter, skim milk powder and cereals.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with some of the main agricultural products.  During 1985 cattle output increased by 1.1 per cent in volume terms.  Exports of cattle and beef and by-products amounted to £1,025 million.  This was more than 10 per cent above the 1984 level and represented 10 per cent of total national exports.  Slaughterings at meat factories were up by 12 per cent on 1984.  During the year there was a further and welcome increase in the exports of beef in processed form.  In particular, exports of vacuum-packed beef increased by 12 per cent over the 1984 level and now account for approximately 10 per cent of total beef exports.  A particularly encouraging aspect was the increases of 30 per cent and 20 per cent respectively in the level of vacuum-packed exports to the UK and Continental markets.  In reports on the beef industry these markets have consistently <Col N="708" /> been identified as those where our long term interests lie, and, of course, they are free from the risks associated with exports to third countries.</P>
    <P>It made interesting reading in the newspapers today to see that EC experts who came here to examine our meat plants came to the conclusion that the standard of our beef processing plants here was as good as &mdash; and better than most &mdash; any plants in Europe.  Therefore, when I hear criticism of our progress in food processing I regard it as most unfair that people cannot see the positive side. Our beef processing is the largest part of our meat industry and it is second to none.  Progress in the past five years has been tremendous.  Our beef processing industry is a credit to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the beef producers and the profitability?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The more we process our product the better the price will be.  It must be remembered that instead of exporting cattle on the hoof the vast bulk of our beef exports are processed and it is becoming more and more profitable. Last year there was an increase of 40 per cent over 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet the producer lost money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>When we entered the EEC in 1973, 70 per cent of our beef was exported live.  The percentage now is between 10 and 12.  Some plants sell nearly everything they produce in the EC.  There is great uncertainty about third countries and as supports lessen those markets become less lucrative. People are much safer selling within the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the background against which they were conducted, the outcome of the price negotiations with regard to beef was quite satisfactory. While there was a theoretical price standstill, the green rate change coupled with the final stage of transition to the beef grid ensured an average increase in support <Col N="709" /> prices of 4 per cent, and indeed as much as 5.6 per cent for the better qualities of cattle.  We also retained the calf premium, the special supplementary suckler cow premium for Ireland, and the Irish entitlement to the variable premium payable in Britain.  All in all, these are worth more than £30 million.</P>
    <P>An important consequence of this year's developments is that there are now identical support prices for identical qualities of beef in every member state apart from the two new member countries. This removes a long-standing anomaly and creates the conditions which favour the production of leaner, betterconformed cattle from now on.  Until 1984 intervention buying-in prices were based on a system of coefficients which varied widely from one member state to another &mdash; with ours very near the bottom, even for the best quality.  Since 1984 we have been harmonising these prices &mdash; in our case upwards, in the case of some other countries sharply downwards. That process is now complete and, as I have already said, there are now the same support prices for the same qualities of beef throughout the entire Community, except in the two new member states of Spain and Portugal.</P>
    <P>The Council agreement on beef runs to 31 December next.  There are important issues to be settled before then.  The Commission had proposed a radical reorganisation of the beef market support system over a short period of time.  If this had been agreed to it would have had serious consequences for Irish producers. The main element was the proposed dismantling of intervention and the disposal of current intervention stocks by November 1987.  After that date intervention would only be used as a last resort at the discretion of the Commission, in conditions to be determined by the Commission.</P>
    <P>As compensation for the loss of intervention the Commission had proposed a system of annual premia for specialised beef producers, including continuance of the suckler cow premium.  I stressed at the Council of Ministers meeting the special position of the Irish beef industry: <Col N="710" /> the fact that we have the lowest beef prices, the largest surplus, the greatest seasonality problem, the largest Third Country trade in beef, and the most vulnerable price structure.</P>
    <P>The Commission proposals were withdrawn for further consideration and for decision before December next.  I will be doing my utmost to ensure that whatever emerges will support the Irish market effectively at all times and will not give rise to distortions within the beef chain, with windfall gains at one point and unacceptable losses at another.  I am sceptical that a better overall market support than intervention, judiciously managed, is to be found.  We will, however, have to examine all the options on the table at the time.</P>
    <P>The decision by Canada to impose a countervailing duty on beef imports from the Community pending the outsome of an investigation tribunal has been a blow to some of our exporters.  This market had developed as a useful outlet for cow beef from this country in 1984, when exports of more than 17,000 tonnes took place.  Following complaints by the Canadian Cattlemen's Association, a Community quota of 10,668 tonnes was finally arranged for 1985, out of which Ireland exported almost 8,000 tonnes. Following discussions, the Community agreed with the Canadian Government to continue the quota for 1986.  However, because of a further complaint by the Canadian Cattlemen's Association, the Canadian Government had to suspend this arrangement and impose countervailing duties pending the outcome of an import tribunal.  This is a GATT issue and discussions must be conducted by the Commission on behalf of the whole Community.  I have been pressing for a speedy resolution of the matter.</P>
    <P>In 1985 CBF published a five-year plan outlining the strategy which that body intends to pursue in the period 1986 to 1990.  The task of marketing Irish cattle, sheep, beef, mutton and lamb is an enormous one and CBF have sought phased increases in funding over the period of the programme.  The Government have displayed their commitment to the <Col N="711" /> board's work by providing a grant-in-aid of some £1.1 million for the year 1986 &mdash; an increase of nearly 40 per cent compared with 1985.  I have also increased the levies payable to CBF from 70p to £1 on cattle and 7p to 10p on sheep.</P>
    <P>To achieve successful marketing in the present day it is essential that we produce a top quality product.  I have said this before and I make no apology for reiterating it.  The first necessity is that our farmers produce prime quality animals, free from disease and without residues of veterinary medicinal products or other substances which might prove hazardous to human health.  Both on home and on export markets consumers are becoming more conscious of the possibilities of residues in food products generally, and are anxious to avoid even the remotest possibility of danger.  My Department are at present expanding their programme of testing meat for residues.  A few months ago I opened a new meat control laboratory at Abbotstown which contains some of the most sophisticated equipment available anywhere for residue testing.  It is important that we have meat that is conclusively free of residues.  Continentals in particular are very health conscious where food products are concerned and it is essential that our meat be marketed on the basis that it is entirely fresh and from a drug-free environment.</P>
    <P>The various measures for the improvement of the genetic merit of our livestock were continued by my Department during 1985.  Inseminations by the AI service at 1,186,000 in 1985 were down somewhat on 1984, with beef breeds accounting for 60 per cent of the total as against 40 per cent for dairy breeds.  By the end of 1985 a total of 186 licences had been issued to herd owners to carry out DIY-AI under the arrangements which I had introduced in 1984.</P>
    <P>I am under pressure from two sources with regard to DIY-AI.  There is one source of pressure coming from farming groups throughout the country who want the right to carry out this service on a free-for-all basis.  At present a farmer can only operate the service on his own herd <Col N="712" /> but there has been an increasing number of requests from people to operate it freely: in other words, they want to work for other people.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there is pressure from the unions who want the system to remain as in the past: in other words, they want the stations to control all the AI servicing.  I can see advantages in opening up the system because I think it would lead to a cheaper service for farmers at the end of the day.  However, the unions want to protect the interests of their members.  There is a delicate balancing act in operation at the moment but I am considering certain measures I shall disclose at a later date.</P>
    <P>In 1985 the Control of Bulls for Breeding Act was passed by the Oireachtas. Regulations at present being drafted will provide <i>inter alia</i> that for a period of three years beef suckler herd owners with 20 cows or less may use good quality nonpedigree beef bulls which have passed inspection by officers of my Department.</P>
    <P>Since the end of 1985 my Department have ceased to provide a direct milk recording service and full responsibility for the provision of the service throughout the country has developed on the Irish Dairy Records Co-operative which is representative of creamery co-operatives, milk boards and AI stations.  I have provided £450,000 under subhead CI to finance this revised milk recording service. Some 115,000 cows were milk recorded in 1985 &mdash; double the figure recorded in 1979 &mdash; but the level of milk recording here is still low by international standards.  However, I am confident that the Irish Dairy Records Co-operative will generate a continued expansion in the level of milk recording in coming years.</P>
    <P>Last year my Department imported a number of top-class rams of the Suffolk, Blackface Mountain, Border Leicester and Blueface Leicester breeds for leasing to selected breeders of high quality flocks.  This enables pedigree breeders to improve the genetic potential of their flocks, and progeny from those flocks in turn helps to improve commercial flocks. Further importations are planned for this year.  In addition, my Department <Col N="713" /> imported 50 Blueface Leicesters and 20 Border Leicester rams last year for leasing to a number of producer groups to provide prolific crossbred ewes for sale to lowland farmers.  This project is now in its third year and groups have been established in most of the major hill areas.  The continued development of the producer group strategy is essential if the lowland producer is to have available a supply of prolific replacement ewes.</P>
    <P>Developments in the milk sector have a major bearing on the agricultural economy. Despite the very bad weather, 1985 was a relatively good year for milk.  I mean this in the overall context: it was very good in the south and not quite so good in the north.  The volume of output increased by 2 per cent and prices to the producer were 3 per cent higher.  Despite the difficulties on international markets and despite the quota regime, milk production remains an attractive enterprise and is well suited to conditions in this country.  The gross margins from dairying compare more than favourably with those available from other lines of farming, and the demand for quotas and the keenness among young farmers to enter dairying reinforce the point.</P>
    <P>The improving economic environment, and in particular falling production costs and interest rates, will assist the individual dairy farmer in the year ahead. It is obvious that the industry has come to terms with the operation of the quota system and that most of the teething problems have been resolved.  The direction for the individual producer must be to produce the quota in the most efficient and cost effective way possible.  We have inherent natural advantages in regard to milk production and we must capitalise on these.  It is often ignored that we have the natural advantage of grass for most of the year.</P>
    <P>The outcome of this year's price negotiations on milk was a matter of some controversy at the time.  Now that the dust has settled and the critics have had time to reflect, I think they realise that the best deal possible was secured and that the correct decision was taken. When I travel round the country meeting <Col N="714" /> farming groups and individual farmers, I am gratified at the understanding of people with regard to the situation in Brussels.  An intelligent view is taken of the matter and some of the people who make noises are not reading the situation correctly.  There is an appreciation that what is happening in Brussels is difficult, both from the point of view of the budget and surpluses.  It is realised we cannot continue to produce products <i>ad nauseam</i> when we cannot get rid of them.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the outcome of the talks represented a significant improvement on the initial proposals.  Further delay would have meant that the peak milk output would not have benefited from the price increase and this would have cost the industry more than £1 million per week.  Apart from that, I do not think further discussions or delay would have improved the proposals; in fact, the reverse would probably have happened. We know only too well from past experience in Community affairs that postponing the inevitable usually means that more drastic action has to be taken in the end.  If we had a super-levy system introduced some six or seven years ago, probably we would not have such a drastic quota system nowadays.  However, the whole business was allowed to get out of hand and, consequently, the cure had to be more severe.</P>
    <P>Comparisons have been made between this year's proposals and proposals put forward by the Commission in earlier years.  Such comparisons are meaningless as the circumstances have changed so considerably.  We have to deal with the situation as it is now in 1986, not as we would wish it to be or as it was some years ago.  For quite some time the milk sector has been bedevilled by chronic surpluses and very poor international markets. New technology has facilitated ever-increasing levels of output both at farm and at processing level.  Countries which were traditionally importers of dairy products are now self-sufficient, if not net exporters.  Many of the regular markets for bulk dairy products have financial problems because of the drop in oil prices.  Consumer demands have <Col N="715" /> shifted away from traditional dairy products, and the modern consumer is more critical, more fickle and less loyal.  It is clear that some re-orientation in the Community's milk policy is needed.</P>
    <P>At the behest of Bord Bainne I visited last week one of our best customers for milk powder, namely, Mexico.  After the EC it is our best customer for milk.  We export approximately £38 million-£40 million worth of skimmed milk powder to that country each year.  The intensity of the competition is a little frightening. On that trip I discovered that other countries are selling heavily into the Mexican market and we are finding it very difficult to hold our proportion of that market.  I must compliment Bord Bainne on the strenuous efforts they are making which have been successful so far.</P>
    <P>We lost that market one year early in the eighties, and we had a reduced proportion another year, but I am glad to say we are back to our maximum level.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to find that there were five other countries heavily involved in that market.  The United States, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, all have a large segment of that market. When we joined the Community the United Kingdom had a deficit where milk production was concerned but now we are in competition with the United Kingdom on these export markets.  Imagine finding them being strongly represented in Mexico.  Recently the French entered that market.  The competition is red hot and we have been knocked out of a number of markets in Latin America in particular because of the intensive competition. This is all due to the over-production of milk.</P>
    <P>It is far preferable to have a milk policy which is effective and relevant to current market conditions rather than one hampered by large surpluses.  When we joined the Community our aspiration was the possibility of access to large consumer markets; these consumer markets are still there.  One of the compelling arguments for restoring balance in the milk sector is to allow commercial markets to function normally and effectively.  This is the best <Col N="716" /> basis for protecting the future of our dairy industry.  Apart from the proposed cessation scheme, other action is needed to restore balance.  In particular, measures will have to be taken to reduce the large stocks of intervention butter which have impeded any possibility of recovery in the commercial butter market.  The Commission have indicated that they will reduce stocks over a three year period and I will be insisting that this programme is adhered to.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to sheep meat, the importation of top class rams and the necessity to produce sheepmeat suitable for the French market.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say something about the pig industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The pig industry is going through a particularly difficult period at the moment, but these problems are not confined to this country.  All over Europe severe problems are being experienced by people in this industry.  My Danish colleagues told me as late as two weeks ago that their producers are experiencing great difficulty on the export markets. There are several reasons for these problems. The first is the considerable over-supply of pigmeat on world markets and an additional difficulty for European producers is the weakness of the American dollar which makes American and Canadian exports of pigmeat more competitive than they were up to now.  We are not the only country suffering.  The other traditional pigmeat exporting countries in Europe are also having severe difficulties.</P>
      <P>The biggest difficulty in this country lies with the structure of our pig industry. The quality of our pigs is as good as anywhere in the world.  We have some of the best pig breeders in the world but the factories, the processors, the structures are not good enough and if we do not recognise that fact we cannot improve the industry.  In the last two days I had talks with three major industries in the pig industry and each is anxious to avail of the new grants which we got in Europe within the last month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="717" /> Up to now people in the disadvantaged areas could get a FEOGA grant of 50 per cent for setting up a bacon factory, and theoretically a 25 per cent grant from the IDA.  In the areas which were not disadvantaged, that is in the east of the country, a person could only get a 25 per cent grant from FEOGA and possibly as much as a 25 per cent grant from the IDA.  Now a person can get a 50 per cent grant from FEOGA in any part of the country and a 25 per cent grant from the IDA.  That will give a tremendous impetus to the pig industry.</P>
    <P>The three groups I met are interested in updating their factories.  What we need is a restructuring, a rationalisation and modernisation of the pigmeat industry. While this industry is experiencing difficulty at the moment, it is nice to see that people have the confidence to invest considerable sums in it.  As I said, it was very reassuring to have three major groups coming to me in the last two days, and I know a fourth is also anxious to invest a considerable amount of money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister help to bring about the rationalisation of the industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The new grants system which we have been promised from Europe is a fantastic step forward and the IDA are very anxious to assist.  While the industry is facing temporary difficulties, I see much better times ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regard cereals we had a difficulty because of the Community's price cutting policy.  I appreciate that people in this industry had difficulties but again it is a case of vast over-supply &mdash; 15 million tonnes in intervention.  I would not like to under-estimate the extent of the problem, but we provided Euro loans and I hope they will be availed of in a matter of days.  There is £100 million for people in the winter beet production, cereal growers, and a smaller portion for small milk producers, and £35 million for people who get into new enterprises which produce commodities that are not in surplus in the Community at present. <Col N="718" /> That money will be of considerable benefit.</P>
    <P>If I think the fodder situation will be critical in the coming winter, I will take steps to alleviate the hardship which may ensue.  I have made contingency plans and luckily the weather over the last few days has eased the situation considerably. Nevertheless, there may be a need for a scheme to provide assistance and I will monitor the situation as the summer progresses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> In the time at my disposal it would be impossible to cover all the different agricultural sectors. Therefore, I will confine my remarks to certain areas and my colleagues will cover specific areas.</P>
      <P>This is one of the most important Estimates to come before the Dáil this year. As a farmer, a public representative and spokesman on Agriculture for the main Opposition party, I will make my comments as constructive as possible.  We are dealing with the country's single most important industry.  If agriculture fails all else fails.  There are very few people in the country who would disagree with such a statement but unfortunately this Government must be counted among the few.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to say that their treatment of agriculture shows every sign that they do not regard agriculture as the mainstay of the economy.  Since they took office cut-backs in the provision for agriculture have been a regular feature.  I wish to take issue with the Minister on a number of areas which I will go into later where cut-backs have taken place and where he has given as an excuse for withdrawing schemes that they had outlived their usefulness. I would like to point out a few. I cannot see how the AI subsidy scheme could have outlived its usefulness.  As a result of the withdrawal of the lime subsidy scheme there was widespread unemployment affecting major lime quarries, and the use of lime on the farm has reduced substantially.  The calved heifer scheme was very important in increasing our beef cow numbers.  I cannot see how that scheme has outlived its usefulness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="719" /> The farm modernisation scheme was suspended by the Government in February 1983 a few months after they took office.  Surely that scheme has not outlived its usefulness.  It is not right for the Minister to come in here this evening and say that schemes which have been withdrawn because of the cut-backs in agriculture by this Government have outlived their usefulness.  The Minister is deluding himself but he is not deluding this party, the country, the farmers or the farming organisations.</P>
    <P>Nowhere has there been any sign of a determination to build the industry up, to give it confidence and, above all, to show it leadership.  In the past week in this House it was said truly that the Government have retreated from agriculture. Nowhere was there greater proof of that Government's lack of care for and interest in agriculture than in the events which led up to last week's debate following the motion put down by this party on the crisis in agriculture.  In the course of that debate it became clear, if ever it was clear over the past three and a half years, that the Government had put agriculture in a very secondary place indeed.  The statement we have just heard from the Minister shows without doubt that the shadow of an uncaring and uncommitted Government lies over the country's most important basic industry.  I would say that the very notice of the Fianna Fáil motion debated last week galvanised the Minister into some action.  For weeks it had been clear to anybody with any interest in agriculture that the crisis was growing in intensity.  Grass growth was up to six weeks behind time.  Fodder supplies were disastrously poor.  Farmers were sinking further and further into debt.  The situation over the past year is well known to the Dáil.  I do not wish to spend my time describing again how bad it was and how bad it still remains despite the improvement in the weather over the past few days.  However, it took weeks to awaken the Minister to this and only when the Fianna Fáil alarm bells rang did he open his eyes and see the real position, then it was a mad rush into action.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> The Minister made a public announcement that he had that week visited some of the worst hit areas.  However, the statement did not indicate when the Minister began his visits, how long they lasted or what areas he visited.  We were told that he had increased the grants for silage and that there would be immediate discussions with ACOT and ICOS to arrange a co-ordinated approach to maximise fodder supplies for next winter.  I agree fully with that and with the belated increase in silage grants which miserable though it is, will in some way be of help.</P>
    <P>However, I want to stress the apparent lack of interest and concern on the Minister's part over the past many weeks &mdash; indeed, many months &mdash; when it was very clear to everybody that the farming sector was in the middle of an emergency, yet we had total lack of action and commitment by the Minister and by the Government. At that time the Minister should have been with the EC Commission requesting assistance and financial help to overcome this disaster.  He failed miserably in this respect.  An example from him was how the German Government helped their farmers in their emergency. I suppose at the same time that the Minister, and no doubt the Government, have other matters in mind.  Must we wait until after 27 June before the Government and their busy Ministers will find time to pay attention to the economic situation in this country including the crisis in agriculture?  When we debated the agriculture crisis last week we heard from the Minister and from one of his Ministers of State, Deputy Connaughton, a great amount of information that did everything but deal with the crisis. We were told what the crisis was about, what they had done in 1984 and 1985.  I pointed out that those days were gone and that the crisis was immediate and we wanted immediate action.  All we got from the Minister and the Minister of State at that time was waffling.  Meanwhile farmers' organisations are asking for serious Government action to give back confidence and leadership to the industry.</P>
    <P>Farmers have now realised very clearly <Col N="721" /> that the only body in the country who can be relied upon to defend their interests are the Fianna Fáil Party.  This has not happened just today or yesterday. Our record in agriculture over the years is a clear example of this party's total commitment to progress and to ensuring that the prosperity of agriculture will continue. Our record is there for everybody to see.  For three and a half years we have had a Government who turned their back on agriculture.  We were assured last week by one of the Ministers of State for Agriculture that the Government had not turned their back on agriculture.  For the sake of the industry I wish that this was the case.</P>
    <P>Over many years, since successive Governments tried to build up manufacturing and service industries, from time to time there have been unfortunate and serious failures.  The result has been unemployment and wasted resources and the cost of trying to repair the damage has been very high.  The situation in regard to agriculture is more serious than it has ever been.  I do not wish to go over again and again the ground which other Fianna Fáil Members and I covered in last week's debate, but it must be said that this important Estimate is being debated at the end of a year of disastrous weather conditions for farmers which began in mid-summer 1985 and continued up to the beginning of this month.  The improved weather of recent days has given hope but the Minister should not run away with the idea that a few days of sunshine will remove his obligations to farmers.  I join with the Minister in advising farmers to put every effort into making sure that they do everything they possibly can to build up stocks of fodder for the coming year, because, clearly, there is everything to be said in favour of more silage.  I hope that we will be given suitable weather conditions to do this.</P>
    <P>After the disastrous year, the Minister has a more than ordinary obligation to exert himself in the cause of agriculture. All over the country farmers are burdened by excessive debt and are in need <Col N="722" /> of moral encouragement and material help.  They are wondering what the Government's attitude is towards agriculture. It is not only the unfortunate small farmers of the west, the north-west and the Shannon basin but farmers all over the country, especially those on moderately size holdings, who are very worried and concerned about their future and that of their families and farms.  They look to the Minister for hope, leadership and confidence.  I sincerely hope that they will not look in vain.  They are not only concerned about their survival for the year ahead but about whether they will be able to continue in farming.  They wonder what the Government will do and suspect that it will be little or nothing.  I have no doubt that the great majority of these farmers are looking forward, as the great majority of the rest of the people are, to a change of Government.  The sooner the better so far as agriculture is concerned.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot recently about the protection of the family farm in Europe in regard to the Common Agricultural Policy.  We all attach great importance to that but we must also look at the protection of the farming family at home and at what the Government are doing for their protection within the Common Agricultural Policy.  The Minister recently made a statement to the effect that farmers need not fear the passing of the divorce Bill because it would not create any problems in the area of succession. Unfortunately, Minister Deasy's grasp of this vital area is as superficial as his grasp of his agricultural brief.  I do not want to go into the merits or demerits contained in the proposed constitutional amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Minister spoke about money and schemes but it is no thanks to the Minister of State that these schemes were introduced.  The only thing he and his Minister did for agriculture was to withdraw a number of schemes.  I would like to see an increase in value in the special schemes for lime, fertiliser and AI and I would like to see the headage payments increased in the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also suggest that we introduce a Euro road scheme, big enough to meet <Col N="725" /> the crisis we are facing, at a low rate of interest.  The present scheme is too small, additions to the interest charges are too high and it is limited in its scope.  All of this requires a serious approach to the EC.  The Commission should be left in no doubt about the situation in Irish agriculture. The recent extension of the disadvantaged areas scheme in Germany is a blatant example of the misuse of Community rules.  I know the Minister does not want to listen to it, but he will listen to it.  The rich German Exchequer pays 75 per cent of the costs of the headage payment which German farmers will now get.  This is a national aid and nothing else, and Ireland and other poorer states in the EC must resist this.</P>
    <P>Ireland must demand full Community finances for all the measures to improve agricultural structures.  Action on these lines by the Government should help to convince the banks and the financial institutions that they should be realistic in their attitude to farm indebtedness.  They should know the effect conditions in agriculture are having on the value of land. I would like to hear the Minister's reply to those proposals.  I assure this House that a Fianna Fáil Government would move immediately to take action along those lines.  Such action would help to alleviate the immediate crisis.  There is more to it than that.  We need to look closely at the whole attitude of the EC and the Council of Ministers towards this country particularly for the development of our economy within the European system.  A few months ago an Irish Minister voted for a package which the German Government voted against. That agreement has already been debated in the Dáil and I do not wish to go into the sad details.</P>
    <P>I would point, however, to the extraordinary cave-in in regard to Ireland's milk quota.  There is no point in the Minister saying we should do our share like all other countries.  That is so but only if we were responsible for creating the problems. We should only do our share to the extent to which we caused the problems and the surpluses in Europe are not <Col N="726" /> caused by Ireland's 4½ per cent or 5 per cent of milk production.  That is a point which the Minister is missing and not putting forward to his colleagues in Europe.  That the Council of Ministers and the Commission, with the agreement of the Irish Government, should have imposed this penalty on Ireland is totally unacceptable considering the agreement by the Council and the Commission in 1984 that there would be no further reduction in Ireland's milk quota.  Again the Minister failed to comment on that earlier today.</P>
    <P>Already in December 1985 when the Dáil was debating the agreement of the Heads of State which led to the Single European Act which it is hoped will lead more quickly to a complete internal market in the Community, the Leader of my party spoke about the need for Ireland to draw up a balance sheet of the advantages and disadvantages Ireland has gained since we joined the EC.  Given what has happened to our milk quota there is a need for such a balance sheet which would show our European partners that the whole Irish economy, including agriculture, needs greater assistance than it is now getting.</P>
    <P>There is no question whatsoever of a change in our attitude to membership of the EC.  But, given the way the Common Agricultural Policy is now developing with serious losses since 1973 in our manufacturing industries, with 250,000 unemployed, there is need for a reappraisal of whether or not this country is being fairly delt with under the Treaty of Rome which provides for the development of the economies of the member states.  This point has also been missed by the Minister and this Government.  That is not to say we do not realise that this development also depends on our own internal efforts.  The country need be in no doubt as to Fianna Fáil's attitude to agriculture. We look on the development of the industry as a major national interest basic to our whole economy and our whole social structure.  In Government, we will rebuild the industry both on the farm and beyond the farm gate.</P>
    <P>There is great scope for increasing <Col N="727" /> added-value, bearing always in mind the importance of processing and providing what the market wants.  At farm level we already have a most valuable blueprint, a four year plan for agriculture initiated by Deputy Lenihan when he was Minister. Unfortunately when this Government came into office, the dominant theme was not how the plan should be put into action but how to keep it out of sight and out of mind because it is an embarrassment to the Government with their cut-back policies on agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture sent a letter on 16 March 1983 to the working group, which letter is published at the back of the report of the group.  Time, unfortunately, does not allow me to quote all the letter, but I shall read parts of it:</P>
    <P>I think it appropriate at this time to draw the attention of the Working Group, which is engaged on the preparation of the Four Year Plan for Agriculture, to the financial situation facing the Government.</P>
    <P>He goes on further:</P>
    <P>I understand that the work of this Group has progressed to the stage where it might expect to complete its report in the near future.  It is important, therefore, that the Group should be fully cognisant of the current budgetary situation and the serious difficulties in the way of providing substantial additional Exchequer funds for any purpose.</P>
    <P>I should be glad, therefore, if you would inform the members of the Working Group of the position so that they may have the opportunity to take full account of it in framing their final recommendations, and in considering how best the implementation of any such recommendations involving new expenditure could be financed...</P>
    <P>The Government, therefore threw out this plan.  I give assurance to the House this evening that my party, on return to Government, will act on the plan.  It will need some revision because of changes in <Col N="728" /> European agricultural policy since 1982, but basically the plan is sound.  Fianna Fáil will put it into action, making sure that the budgetary provisions are adequate and used in a way that will ensure that the expenditure brings the most useful results possible for the moneys spent.  There will be consultation with farmers' representatives in An Foras Talúntais and ACOT, who will be fully involved.  As part of the strategy we in Fianna Fáil will charge An Foras Talúntais and ACOT to provide as accurate an analysis as can be reasonably turned out with regard to the situation of farmers in different parts of the country. This analysis will take account of farm size, land quality, the main enterprises, the status of the owner, of the family and so forth, and in what way development aid could best be used to improve efficiency in output.  Such information would be of great help in putting the national development plan into action.</P>
    <P>As regards processing and marketing, there is need for concerted action.  We must develop a food processing industry so as to get better returns both from home and export markets.  There is great scope for cutting down on the hundreds of millions of pounds now being spent on the importation of processed foods into this country.  Fianna Fáil will give the central role to the Department of Agriculture and Food, bringing under this new Department the present Department of Agriculture and adding responsibility at Cabinet level for the development of the food industry.  This effort will also extend to developing the horticultural industry. Earlier this year we published a very striking study of the scope available for reducing fruit and vegetable imports and increasing the output for horticulture.  In all these efforts there may well be need to encourage more involvement of foreign capital, particularly where this capital is linked to existing market outlets.  We are looking at those areas at present.</P>
    <P>As well as adding value to the economy of the agricultural industry by developing and expanding agricultural output as it is usually understood, there is also scope for <Col N="729" /> developing farm enterprises &mdash; indeed, alternative farm enterprises.  The Minister, in replying to some recent parliamentary questions on this subject, did not come to grips with the matter.  Some good work has been done in this area and there is scope for more.  The value of such enterprises is quite clear.  They can supplement incomes, especially on small holdings which leave some time available for work outside normal farming activity, or they can be part and parcel of that activity, depending on the circumstances. The most obvious of these enterprises is farm house tourism.  Farm cheese making is another and in this area we have had some small but remarkable successes. Other alternatives may need more expertise and capital on a larger farm area &mdash; for example, deer farming.  Given the right person in the right situation, there are good possibilities here.</P>
    <P>In the area of alternative enterprises there is need for more encouragement at Government level and throughout the State service.  Development of any enterprise will require ability and determination on the part of the individual who takes the job, but some lead from the Government is needed.  In passing, I should like to comment on the proposals put forward by Minister Hegarty with regard to his efforts to promote the growing of flax in his area.  I commend him for this and I ask that the Department and the public would give him a little more support than he is getting at present in the areas of alternative enterprise.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken about the farm income situation and it is a sad story. I have described the alternative strategy which is demanded if this sad story is to be reversed.  The rest of my comments must be looked on as background, particularly my serious charges against the Government for their neglect of agriculture and I have said what Fianna Fáil will do towards developing the industry.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention briefly the disease eradication programme.  Some months ago I joined in welcoming the advances made with regard to brucellosis.  Bovine tuberculosis is another sad chapter.  Why, in the name of common sense, have the <Col N="730" /> Government dealt as they have with this disease?  Capable and decent officials from the Department of Agriculture have come before a committee of this House and said that as long as there are cut-backs in funding for disease eradication programmes from year to year, little progress with eradication can be made. There is no point in the Minister saying today that he will get the £4 million or £5 million extra to continue with at least one round of testing this year.  This is the fourth time that he has come into the House saying that and still the money is not forthcoming.  I would perhaps understand the Government's attitude were we living in some poor country of the Third World where the little government money which is available can be used to save the lives of people, but here we are dealing with bovine tuberculosis as if it were a pressing creditor who must be thrown some money now and then if only to keep him from pressing for more and more.</P>
    <P>Disease is costing the taxpayer, the farmer and the country much money and it must be said that this cost must stop.  I gave the Minister the full support of this party in doubling the contributions of the farmers and in continuing that policy.  He must realise that the farmers are now contributing to the tune of £14 million for disease eradication and it is not good enough for his Department and the Department of Finance to cut back in this very vital area.  Furthermore, unless sufficient funds are made available this year for at least one full round of testing in each county, the moneys spent last year might as well not have been spent. Great work was done last year, but it is only by consistent effort, by getting on top of the job and having full co-operation from everybody that we can finally cure this festering sore which has been with us for so many years.  I appeal to the Minister to stop dithering and get on with the job.  If he gets the finances, I can assure him &mdash; as he said himself &mdash; that within two years we can get this problem down to manageable levels.</P>
    <P>An official of another Department told a Dáil committee meeting recently that <Col N="731" /> there could be very great savings in a particular area which involved fraudulent claims if only the Government provided the money for the staff needed.  The same applies in this case.  If the Government provided the money to rid the country of bovine TB, it would be got rid of.  I want sufficient money to be provided.  How many minutes have I left?</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I wish to make a few comments on the Minister's speech.  The Minister never loses an opportunity to gloss over his cave-in in 1984 in regard to the milk quota and the guarantee given at that time.  The Minister came home and boasted in subsequent years that no further cuts in the Irish milk quota would be made by the Commission.  The Commission and the Council of Ministers won the day.  Our Minister for Agriculture has caved in again on this vital commitment he gave to the milk industry at that time.</P>
      <P>When speaking about vacuum packed beef the Minister pointed out that an increase in the volume of exports in this form is very welcome.  The sole purpose of our proposal with regard to the setting up of a Department of Agriculture and Food was that we should export, as far as we possibly can, our agricultural products in a processed form.  The Minister spoke about beef and lamb, about the need to improve the quality of animals and of products.  I agree totally with this commitment.  This is part and parcel of Fianna Fáil policy.  I want to see some evidence from the Minister of his approach and his seriousness in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order for the milk industry to get away from intervention production we must broaden the product range.  I agree this is important.  Here again the Minister and the Government have cut back their <Col N="732" /> contribution to An Foras Talúntais who should be the body to research and develop new products.  The very base of this industry is being cut away.  That is a disaster in so far as the Government are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that Deputy Hegarty, Minister of State, was being given responsibility for food processing. We all know that was an attempt to react to our proposal to set up a Department of Agriculture and Food.  It is important, therefore, that one Minister should look after food production, food processing and marketing, right to the consumer table.  It is also important that we develop alternative farm enterprises.  We must look for alternative areas of income for increasing farmer income.</P>
    <P>This Estimate is not acceptable to me or to the Fianna Fáil Party.  As far as I am concerned the Dáil is being asked to approve what is in effect an admission of failure by the Government to support agriculture and all that is worthwhile.  I propose that the Dáil reject this Estimate.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that I will be helped along the line.  By virtue of the fact that the Minister covered a great deal of ground I do not intend to go over the topics that he brought to our attention this evening, there are, however, a number of items to which I would like to draw attention which are very important in the context of the overall agriculture industry and about which there is a considerable amount of debate at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, new ground was broken <Col N="733" /> during the year when I introduced the new farm improvement programme. After an awful lot of organisation and an awful lot of negotiation this scheme finally saw the light of day a few months ago.  This was to replace the old farm modernisation scheme which was there since 1972 or 1973.  By virtue of the fact that we had 12 or 14 years experience of a particular on-farm investment programme, we had a fairly detailed knowledge of how we should best tailor it to suit the needs of present day Irish agriculture.  With the hiccups that one will normally find with a national scheme, its introduction seems to be getting a very good reception.</P>
    <P>Briefly, I want to inform the House on what is involved without getting too technical.  As we are aware, the basis of the old farm modernisation scheme was that one had to show, through a farming programme, that one was able to attain a certain level of income in a specified pre-determined length of time. Obviously in its day it was all right.  We believe that the new system, where an increase of only 5 per cent over the duration of the plan will be sufficient for eligibility, will mean that far more farmers will be involved and at a higher level of grant aid.</P>
    <P>One of the bugbears of the old scheme was the fact that persons over 55 years of age were debarred from entry.  This created a huge problem in many parts of Ireland and particularly in the north-west where the age profile of farmers might tend to be that little bit older.  As the House is well aware, many people will reckon that they are only getting good at 55.  From my point of view, it appears that this was a very good addition to the scheme.  I understand there is a fair level of interest by persons in that category. This will be a hallmark of all schemes from Brussels in the future.  For any on-farm investment aid it will be necessary to keep some type of accounts.  The accounts we talk about are not the normal accounts.  They are records more than accounts.  I hope every farmer, for his own good, keeps records.  In the last <Col N="734" /> scheme some farmers did not keep farm accounts and this created some problems. I am talking about records as against full scale accounts.  One of the things I wanted to be sure of when we were negotiating this scheme was that we would put it in such a way that we would not be adding extra costs to a farmer who might have to employ an accountant.  I have asked the FDS offices around the country to assist farmers in preparing those records.  I have no doubt that no cost will attach to that scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme has a number of new attractive grants.  In line with our policy of keeping abreast with the more up-to-date technology in agriculture we have introduced grants for paddock fencing, farm roadways, the installation of water on farms and all those type of things that were not there in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Our decision in the last week or two to increase grant aid for silage bases on which the silage is made is a very important factor and one on which I would like to dwell for a few moments.  Irrespective of what incentives were made available over the last ten years to try to get farmers into silage it appears that once we get two or three weeks of fine weather we are back to hay again.  On this occasion I hope there will be a rapid uptake of the extra 10 per cent.  This will now mean that farmers everywhere who are eligible for the grant <Col N="735" /> will get a total of 45 per cent at up-to-date standard costings.  That is an excellent grant and I would exhort every farmer who is not in silage to decide to go for this now.</P>
      <P>We have provided grants for fodder harvesters in the west.  I would have to say that, as far as incentives go, the Government cannot be faulted for doing all that is humanly possible, to use that important but well-worn catch phrase, to get people to make silage.  There are one or two problems with the scheme which I would like to mention, one of which is the milk quota where farmers are producing above their permanent quota.  This is not a problem of our doing.  The EC Commission imposed it on us and any farmer who was above his quota could not qualify for grants under the farm improvement programme.  That is unfair, and we have said that in no uncertain terms in our negotiations with the Commission.  We believe it should be done on the basis that the country at large should be recognised as a unit.  Provided the country at large is not above the quota there is no reason to penalise individual farmers.  At the end of the day, I am very hopeful we will be able to get over this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted at having this opportunity to mention in the House that this is the first time, a real first in agriculture, we have decided to bring forward the new farm installation grant for young farmers entering agriculture.  This has been talked about for years and years.  Everybody had their own views but I am delighted to say that we are the first Government to introduce this aid and benefit.  What it amounts to is that under certain circumstances a person under 35 years of age working on a farm which has a one labour unit requirement and who is sufficiently trained in agriculture will now be able to receive a grant of £5,600 on he or she becoming the registered owner of the farm.  Might I bring to the notice of the House that over the past three or four years the Government brought in the stamp duty exemption.  I have been closely associated with this for many <Col N="736" /> years.  The idea is that we expedite the transfer of land from a father or mother to a son or daughter.  I am delighted to say that well over 5,000 persons seem to have qualified.</P>
    <P>It has a second beneficial effect in that because it is tied to a certain agricultural qualification, by virtue of the 100 hours EC course, we are killing two birds with the one shot.  This is one of the reasons &mdash; whether it is a good or bad reason is open to discussion &mdash; why I would have to say the ACOT courses around the country have been very well attended. As someone who has responsibility for lands in the Department I believe this was the first step in getting greater mobility in land inheritance.  I have no doubt that administratively it is very simple.  There are no hidden costs for which civil servants will have to be running around the country to check.  This is one of the things on which I have looked back over the past three years with great delight.  It is not confined to big or small farmers provided they are under the age limit and have the suitable agricultural qualifications. The Government pay the stamp duty on the transfer of the land.  We are going to go a step further this year and introduce the new installation premium. The self same farmer under certain conditons will receive an extra £5,600.</P>
    <P>I want to make very clear this evening that to show our commitment to young people entering farming we have done something the rural oganisations have been looking for for years.  We have brought in an additional 25 per cent grant aid for on-farm investments for certain qualified persons, such as I outlined a few moments ago, above and beyond the grant aid already there.  Looking back on the stamp duty exemption, the new installation premium and the extra 25 per cent for young people entering agriculture, everyone, even our most stringent critics, will have to accept that we have done our bit to get young people interested in farming and make their entry into farming that little bit easier.  These are trying times for farmers at all levels. I make no secret of that.  But at the same time, from the Government's point of <Col N="737" /> view, it can be shown very clearly that we are committed to ensuring we get a nice input of young blood, full of vigour, into this great industry.  We are on the right lines.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other aspects I would like to refer to.  One of the things which is often thrown at the Government, for some reason best known to the Opposition, is that there is a retreat from agriculture.  I cannot accept that.  I outlined in great detail during a debate on a motion last week the type of finances which are available through the various schemes.  While it is not appropriate on an occasion such as this to itemise them again, it is sufficient for me to state that in a full year we pay out £122 million in one form or another to farmers under headage schemes etc.  Of that £122 million, £98 million, or 80 per cent, will go to the disadvantaged areas from Galway to Donegal.  Those figures speak for themselves.  Deputy Noonan referred to the lack of a lime subsidy which costs £2 million in the run of a year.  Since the last Agriculture Estimate 12 months ago we have added 1,250,000 acres to the severely handicapped areas.  I do not want to get everybody tied up in this as one would want to be a computer to know the difference between disadvantaged areas and severely disadvantaged areas. There will be £20 million more paid out to western farmers this year than last year.  I want that to be noted.  It is an achievement in itself.</P>
    <P>There are a few other peripheral matters I would like to refer to which are important in their own way.  In a previous debate in this House the problems of sheep farmers on hill areas all over the country were raised.  Two years ago I saw fit to introduce a pilot scheme on the hills of Connemara whereby a helicopter would fertilise areas totally inaccessible to trucks and machinery by dropping brown rock phosphate on the hills. Having examined the scheme in great detail I am delighted to be able to tell the House that, under the western package, grants will be made available for the fencing and fertilisation of such hills around <Col N="738" /> the country.  I believe there is a tremendous future in hill sheep farming, something that did not arise until the last five or six years when we gained access to the Italian market.  This scheme affords a great opportunity to bring great fertility to the poorest areas of the country.  In future years I think one will see many helicopters being used spreading fertiliser on the top of hills, killing bracken and that type of thing.  That will be another good omen that our hill sheep farming will continue to yield good results on difficult land.</P>
    <P>Last Monday I headed a delegation for the CBF to The Royal Show in Edinburgh. The reason for our visit was to re-establish contact with a traditional market for heifers from the west of this country to Scotland, which market had dwindled away over the past ten years. We have what are described as blue-grey heifers, with a lot of Aberdeen Angus blood in their veins, which found great favour with the hill farmers of Scotland. Of course we have also the Friesian/ Hereford cross-heifers here that will be most important to the breeding herds of Scotland.  For a variety of reasons that market had dwindled away altogether. We are now what is termed OBF &mdash; official brucellosis free &mdash; the same as the rest of the British Isles.  This means there is no need for leucosis or pregnancy testing. Of course with the advent of the rollon, roll-off system of transportation we want to re-establish the links with this small but vital market in Scotland.  From what I could gather from the many old Scottish importers of Irish cattle and, indeed, the many new customers I met in Edinburgh last week, we can look forward to important trade with them.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the Germans and their ability to get a fairly large chunk of German land classified as severely handicapped.  I want to put on the record of the House that our Minister saw fit to support that.  I think he was right.  With the advent of the EC funding of socio-structures one would hope that the Commission would put their money <Col N="739" /> where their mouths are.  Under the sociostructural policy arrangements for disadvantaged areas one would hope they will be in a position to pay a much higher level of grant aid than has been the case heretofore.  Normally it carries a 25 per cent recoupment rate which is what Deputy Noonan was speaking about. Deputy Noonan mentioned nations like Germany being able to pay 75 per cent and get recoupment of 25 per cent.  We have done better; we have a 50 per cent recoupment rate but, because of the problems we encounter <i>vis-á-vis</i> Greece, Portugal and other countries we want that rate to be at least 75 per cent.  I want to put on the record that this Government have sought persistently a 75 per cent recoupment and we shall continue our efforts in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate. In fact, I am glad that you are ActingChairman, Deputy Doyle, because, as the doyen of city Deputies, I should like to be able to point out to you that we are not talking in particular about farming &mdash; blue-grey heifers, or Aberdeen Angus, not even roll-ones or roll-offs; indeed I thought that contraption had disappeared even in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>I should like to educate the Minister regarding his Department's retreat from agriculture.  I have here a summary of the Estimates for the past few years.  Under the heading of Agriculture for 1984 the Estimate amounted to £256 million, for 1985, £254 million and this year £223 million.  Despite the fact that there has been that retreat in the level of the Estimate for Agriculture, I would hope the Department would get around to spending that amount of money this year and not have the Scrooge-like attitude of last year when, despite the farming community having been put to the pin of their collars to retain even their sanity the Department of Agriculture did not even spend their allocation and there remained at the end of the year in unexpended balances £27 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that this year the Department <Col N="740" /> and their officials will at least spend the allocation, small as it is.  Of a total expenditure on all the Estimates in the region of £7,000 million Agriculture gets £223 million, representing less than 5 per cent. For an economy that is agriculture-based that is not a great deal of money.  We must remember that our economy is agriculture-based. It saddens me that various Government Ministers can get money for various projects, but, when it comes to agriculture, for some reason or other in recent years, it has not been possible to do so.  It has been possible to get money to bale out Bewleys they being regarded as constituting an important part of Dublin life.  In that respect all credit due to Dublin Deputies; they did a good job.  I am glad to note that £10 million is to be provided for O'Connell Street because we have a beautiful capital city, one of the finest in the world.  I am glad it will be seen to best advantage.</P>
    <P>As far as agriculture is concerned we must depart from the clichés, the old bottom line of saying it is the backbone of the economy, the top six inches of soil are our most important asset, when there is no tangible evidence that we are treating agriculture in the way it should be treated.  Up to a decade ago major emphasis was placed on improving production techniques.  Again all credit is due to the farmers who, when asked to produce a particular product, commodity or livestock, went ahead and did just that. They took the experts' advice, the advice of departmental agencies, the agricultural advisory and research bodies.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, in the past decade, we have failed to continue the logical progression, omitting to support the industry beyond the production stage.  I am referring to the processing and marketing areas.  We have heard that there is to be a reintroduction of FEOGA grants for food processing.  But by and large we confine our agricultural production to commodity type products and areas.  The reason for that is that there is not the type of support or funding necessary or indeed, the political will required to process in the most sophisticated way the <Col N="741" /> products which our farmers have gone to the trouble of producing on the advice they were given.</P>
    <P>In regard to advances in food product areas, it is a sad fact that in recent years the development of new products has been associated with foreign companies, through royalties or otherwise. They have not been developed in Ireland by our own food processors and technolgists. I want additional funding given to An Foras Talúntais and I want to see them responding by being more practical in the type of research and development they carry out in order to ensure that the farmers and the economy get the maximum payment for their products.  It is sad that there is a cut this year in the allocation on An Foras Talúntais.  They cannot go on from day to day not knowing what amount they will be allocated for a particular project.  Most of those projects take a year or two.  I call on the Government to give adequate funding and direction to An Foras Talúntus and to insist on relevant research and development work being carried out in the area of food processing.</P>
    <P>Our attitude to marketing is that it will take care of itself and that somehow somewhere we will find somebody to take our products.  That is not the reality.  We are left trying to hawk food products of one kind or another around the world. Usually they are sold in a rancid or half stale condition because the cost of storage is too great.  We need to fund realistically market and consumer research to find out what is wanted and, secondly, the marketing and promotion of products.  It is not good enough that CBF have such a negligible amount of money to promote the meat industry which has exports in excess of £1,000 million.  If we are to compete in the world marketplace and get the best possible prices for the producers, we must reconsider that area.  I am not satisfied that in the area of production, processing and marketing there is realistic investment sufficient to get the maximum added value.</P>
    <P>Strolling through the food markets and <Col N="742" /> supermarkets we see that foreign companies identify market areas and then sell their products.  For instance, the French did some research and found an opening in the market for apples.  In any of the supermarkets one will find potatoes from Cyprus and the Netherlands almost exclusively available, to the detriment of the Irish producer.  The Department of Agriculture and the Ministers must be judged in the light of the fact that Ireland has a food import bill in excess of £1,000 million.  By any standard this is a scandal. We heard three years ago that a Cabinet sub-committee would be set up to deal with this matter and introduce regulations at an early date.  More recently we have heard that this is to be a permanent committee sitting <i>ad nauseam</i> wondering about this worsening problem.  If a person put the cost of food imports in £10 notes on a conveyor belt it would take him to the moon and back.  That is the kind of distance we have to travel as a food producing and exporting country if we are to tackle this problem.  Irish farmers will produce the type, quantity and quality of product required if the processors and the marketing people will do the rest of the job.  They need political direction and funding in order to do that.</P>
    <P>The past year was particularly difficult for the primary producer.  It was galling that the Government and the Department of Agriculture, rather than taking a sympathetic view and introducing short-term measures, were busy tinkering around and coming up with various schemes to extract additional money from the farmers by tightening the screw a little more and introducing a land tax which would yield £70 million, whether farmers made an income or not.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that the farm advisory services are required more urgently here than in any other member state, it was decided that it would be a good year to introduce charges for these services. Despite the explicit commitment in the national plan, <i>Building on Reality,</i> to carry out a blitz on disease eradication there was a cut-back of £4.5 million, so that only certain areas could be tested. At a time when a sum in excess of £1,000 <Col N="743" /> million had been expended on disease eradication, the Minister who allowed that to happen has much to answer for.  I call on the Minister for Agriculture to adhere to the commitment in the national plan, if there is a shred of credibility left in it, and to fund adequately a full disease eradication programme.  We should not be the laughing stock of the world, having spent several generations trying to eradicate tuberculosis in particular.  About 25 years ago we went through the charade of having the country declare officially free of tuberculosis but we are now in an even worse position.</P>
    <P>Because there is so little sympathy for anybody trying to make a case for farming, it has to be repeatedly emphasised that agriculture is not synonymous with farming itself.  It employs 500,000 people and exports are valued at £2,500 million. If agriculture is not in a healthy state there is no hope for the overall health of the economy.  I again emphasise to the Minister of State that the farming community and the agricultural sector want to have the allocation of money, small as it is, spent in this year.  It is worth recalling that at the end of last year, following a disastrous harvest, the farming community in a very generous gesture offered £7 million as a contribution towards an increased rate of headage payments to which they were entitled.  It would have cost the Irish taxpayer an additional £7 million to put £28 million in circulation in the worst hit parts of the country.</P>

      <P>That money would have gone to the disadvantaged and severely handicapped areas.  It is regrettable that that was not done.  I was glad to hear the Minister of State repeat that the Government are pursuing a policy of giving a greater percentage allocation, a 75:25 ratio, in regard to funds from Europe. As a small economy we are not able to match pound for pound to the same extent as the other member states, but <Col N="744" /> under no circumstances will the Department of Finance allow the maximum revenue to come from Brussels if they are asked to pay pound for pound. We are all aware of that Department's attitude of agriculture.  If the Department were unable to come up with the money last year I cannot see them getting around to it in future years.</P>
      <P>With regard to interest rates, it is interesting to note that we have to compete with farmers who enjoy low interest rates in other member states.  It is unfortunate that our farmers have had to pay in the region of three times the real interest rate on borrowing that farmers in Germany pay.  The Euro currency loan of £135 million was welcome but the farming community are in debt to the commercial banks, the merchant banks and the ACC to the tune of £2,000 million.  I estimate that farmers owe at least another £500 million to co-ops and various merchants. The loan of £135 million will make little impact on a total indebtedness of £2,500 million.  Urban dwellers, those in the PAYE sector and non-agricultural people who think that the farming community are extremely well-off should remember that for the 100,000 full time farmers an indebtedness of £2,500 million is an enormous sum to have to repay, particularly at the high rates of interest we have in Ireland.  I cannot see why the Government are insisting on a 2 per cent exchange rate and a further 1 per cent and that the banks are insisting on between 2 per cent and 2½ per cent bringing the real cost of the Euro currency to 9½ per cent. We must remember that farmers in Germany pay 4 per cent.</P>
      <P>I have tried to outline the difficulties those involved in Irish agriculture are facing.  I suggest that the Minister, his Ministers of State, and officials in the Department look more benignly on the industry, that they loosen the screw a little and at least spend the money allocated. They should try to ensure that from 1986 onwards Irish agriculture will get out of the low gear it is in and go into overdrive.</P>

      <P>In welcoming the Estimate introduced by the Minister for Agriculture it is no harm to reflect briefly on where we in Ireland fit into the European agricultural scene, given that the Common Agricultural Policy lists among its five major aims the ensuring of a fair standard of living for farmers.  It is supremely important to remember that and I should like to devote my time to that aspect.  In that context it is well to remember that the Irish Republic is comprised of 17 million acres of which 12 million acres are utilised for agricultural purposes.  Of that 12 million acres, 11 million are used for pastures and approximately one million for tillage of which 70 per cent is utilised for cereal production.</P>
      <P>Of the 264,000 agricultural holdings classified by size 176,000,67 per cent, are less than 50 acres.  The EC document, the Agricultural Policy of the European Community, issued in October 1982, states that the average farm size in Ireland is 22.52 hectares &mdash; one multiplies that by 2.5 to get acres &mdash; and the corresponding figure for the UK is 68.70 hectares, or roughly 3:1.</P>
      <P>An analysis of the holdings in my own county, Limerick, and neighbouring counties, shows that in Limerick there are 10,935 holdings with 6,195, or 56 per cent, under 50 acres.  In Clare there are 11,866 holdings with 7,205, or 61 per cent, under 50 acres.  In Kerry there are 16,802 holdings with 10,856, or 65 per cent, under 50 acres while in Tipperary North Riding there are 6,480 holdings with 3,217, or 50 per cent, under 50 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party have always been conscious of the contribution small farmers make to the Irish economy.  In the Commission's price proposals and review of the CAP, one of the objectives outlined was to deal more effectively and systematically with the income problems of small farmers.  It is worth noting that approximately 180,000 &mdash; 16 per cent of the workforce &mdash; are employed directly in agriculture compared to 2.7 per cent in the UK and 12 per cent in Italy.  The <Col N="746" /> estimated value of gross agricultural output in 1985 was £2.7 billion.  It is interesting to compare the number employed in the 26 commercial semi-State organisations which come under the aegis of my committee, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  They employ approximately 80,000 people or equivalent to 44 per cent of those employed in agriculture.  Approximately 20 per cent of farmers are 65 years of age or over and we should not overlook the significant employment that is directly available in agriculture.</P>
    <P>In regard to employment I should like to quote from the Final Commission's Proposals on the Prices for Agricultural Products and on Related Measures, dated 13 February 1986 which states:</P>
    <P>The situation on the employment market is still the most serious economic and social problem in the Community.  It gives particular concern at a time when growing numbers of young people of working age are unemployed and when government efforts to bring public finances into order, especially in some Member States, leave little room for more vigorous action to stimulate investment and create new employment.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, we produce only 2.2 per cent of total EC production.  I am speaking about when there were only ten members.  Naturally, because of our dependence on pastures, grassland which is one of our greatest natural resources, our agricultural production reflects the output of this asset in beef and milk, and the significant difference between us and other EC states is that we must export more than 80 per cent of our beef production and more than 75 per cent of our cheese and butter production.  Therefore, EC policies that affect Community prices have a real impact on the incomes of many small farmers who are involved in dairying and beef production in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It must be understood that farmers' incomes are determined by cost of production and the price they receive. Through the CAP, the EC determine common prices, although costs of production <Col N="747" /> vary in each member state.  This point is made in <i>The Irish Times</i> today by Michael Dillon, their agricultural correspondent:</P>
    <P>For instance, Irish farmers grudgingly get a 3 per cent VAT refund to compensate for the VAT that they pay on some farm inputs, but German farmers get a 13 per cent refund to compensate them for a revaluation of the green mark.  Irish farmers also get the lowest possible grants for farm improvements, and the lowest headage payments in the disadvantaged areas, because our Government cannot match the top rates.</P>
    <P>We must be conscious always that farm incomes not only affect the farmers themselves but the towns and the cities where they make their purchases.  It has been accepted that, when the farming community are doing well, their local towns and cities benefit.  The comparative position in regard to farming for each EC member state makes interesting reading.</P>
    <P>I will refer to a report in the 6 June issue of <i>The Irish Times,</i> again by Michael Dillion.  If it is true it is a national outrage. The article refers to headage payments in disadvantaged areas and I hope the Minister will refer to the allegations when he is replying:</P>
    <P>A group of farmers in Sligo is planning to mount a challenge to the restrictions placed on headage payments in disadvantaged areas by the Government here.  These headage payments on cattle and sheep which are part funded by the EC, are intended to keep the population up on farms in difficult areas, and in this country they are kept to the minimum allowed and are not available to farmers who either through their own efforts, or because their spouses are working, have an off farm income of more than £6,400 a year.  This clause cuts out 500 herd owners from a total of 5,000 in Sligo, with up to 1,500 barred in Donegal, and between 3,500 and 5,000 farmers on a national basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" /> The odd thing is that because of a separate order made by the Department of Agriculture, members of the Oireachtas, TDs and Senators, are not barred, and in fact it is claimed that two British MPs are actually drawing headage payments, and of course large scale farmers are also eligible, while small farmers with labouring jobs, or with working wives of husbands are cut off from this source of supplementary income.</P>
    <P>This clause is particularly ironic at the present time when the German Government has just increased by 50 per cent the area of their country classed as less favoured, or disadvantaged, in order to be able to make direct payments to all farmers on good land as a compensation for the cuts in farm price supports, their cut off point for eligibility is very high, and does not differentiate between farm income and money earned off the farm. In Britain there is no means test whatever.</P>
    <P>As I have said, if that is true it is a national outrage.  It is estimated that there are 10,000 working people engaged in agricultural development and it is totally discriminatory to withhold EC aid from them aimed at improving the general level of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>I was astonished to learn from the article I have just cited that TDs and Senators engaged in agriculture qualify for headage grant payments in the severely handicapped areas while they are denied to other farmers who have to take up employment in factories and elsewhere but whose income exceeds £6,400.  I am not opposed to paying people grants for which they are qualified, but it is absolutely farcical to pay these grants to selected groups and to deny them to a broad group of trade union workers whose earnings are only a fraction of the other groups.  Those people pay their PAYE and PRSI as well as tax and insurance on their cars which they use to take them to and from work, and of course they pay a considerable tax on petrol.</P>
    <P>I am putting it to the Minister that he should end this farce.  I accept that there is a need for a cut-off point because otherwise you could have some vet, for <Col N="749" /> instance, with an annual income of £40,000, qualifying for these grants. However, the present position is anomalous. For example, farmer A with an annual income of £8,000 solely from his farm qualifies for these payments, but his neighbour, farmer B, with an annual income of £1,000 from his farm and £6,000 from a job &mdash; perhaps it is his wife who works &mdash; is denied these payments. Accordingly, the part time farmerworker can lose £700 in grants by earning an extra £100 a week.  It is obvious there should be a differentiation between a person on PAYE and one paying schedule D income tax, somebody engaged in a trade or profession, but the Minister should look at this whole question again because it seems people are penalised if they are marginally on a PAYE income.</P>
    <P>I understand that these headage payments are made under EC directive, not regulations, and each member state has a considerable degree of latitude in how the directive is implemented.  I think the Irish criteria for qualification are too tight.  They provide that a farmer must spend more than half his time on the farm; he must obtain more than half of his income from the farm; the off-farm income of both the farmer and his spouse must not exceed £6,400 per annum, or £123 per week.  The average disposable income per week in Ireland is approximately £100 per acre.</P>
    <P>Farming is now a highly capital intensive industry and the Labour Party, the oldest in the country, since their foundation have maintained that small farmers were the backbone of the Irish economy. My party have always wanted to see as many persons working on the land as possible earning a decent living for their families.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has said, great improvements have been made in the past year in disease eradication but unfortunately there has been a cut-back in money and this year a complete round of testing will not be carried out.  We must have targets in this programme, as was pointed out in the NESC report, No. 79. We must make every effort as a Government <Col N="750" /> and as a people to ensure that we will have the highest standards in cattle health.  While the Minister will say that all support possible has been and will be given to the farming community, it is ridiculous in this day to embark on such a scheme without the aid of up-to-date facilities such as those existing in the North of Ireland and Britain.  There must be a special computer section with qualified people in the Department of Agriculture to keep data on cattle health and try to keep control over a situation that would be ridiculous if it were allowed to obtain in private industry.  I am talking about the movement two or three times per year of six million cattle throughout the State.  If any modern private enterprise tried to cope with that task without the aid of a computer section, they would be laughed off the face of the earth.  The Minister and the Department should give serious consideration to having a computer section to help in that matter.</P>
    <P>The same NESC report recognised the need for investment in drainage, especially in the western areas.  I regret the Opposition spokesman on Agriculture did not see fit to refer to that matter.  It is a problem that requires urgent attention. In my area in Limerick I am aware of the need to drain the Mulcair river. We have made an excellent case to the Minister and to the Government as to why that river should be drained.  It would give the best return for money invested. It would increase agricultural output by an estimated £27 million per year, and that is a conservative estimate.  It would also create employment with jobs ranging between 300 and 600 on the Mulcair river, with a downstream spin-off effect, on IDA calculations, of between 600 and 800 new jobs.</P>
    <P>I saw the dreadful floodings that have taken place and two years ago Senator Hourigan and I visited the areas concerned. At that time human beings were nearly drowned.  I understand the Taoiseach gave a commitment to the Mulcair Drainage Society that the river would be drained as soon as possible.  I call on him and the Minister for Agriculture to honour that commitment given to the <Col N="751" /> farmers of east Limerick.  The whole project might usefully be brought under the National Development Corporation. What is proposed would cost the State nothing, but employment could be created for tens of thousands of people. Grants are available from the EC and I do not understand why this work is not being carried out.  I understand the economists in the Office of Public Works have said that the project would be self-financing. I am asking that the reports on the matter be published as soon as possible and that drainage work be moved from the Office of Public Works to the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>At the moment there are double standards obtaining in relation to animal hygiene.  There are unlicensed slaughterhouses in Limerick and elsewhere that are defying all the efforts of the statutory bodies to eliminate cattle diseases.  I propose that fines of £50,000 be imposed on these unlicensed illegal slaughterhouses to stop those double standards.  Recently in Limerick a consignment of diseased meat was sent to Sarsfield barracks which could have poisoned half of the people there.  We must ensure that we have the highest standards in animal hygiene if we are to continue to be regarded as one of the principal agricultural nations in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>We are debating this Estimate at a time when the main preoccupation of the farming community is to survive.  Substantial positive measures will have to be taken to restore the confidence of farmers and the only way that can be done is to provide the necessary aid and assistance.  People in the industry have suffered much during the past 12 months and they need help to get back on their feet again.  It is vital that we convince farmers that they have the support and commitment of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the previous speaker pointed out, small farmers have always suffered but in the past year intensive farmers were the people who suffered most.  They found it difficult to feed their animals during the <Col N="752" /> very bad winter.  In my area I was a member of a committee formed to deal with the fodder problem.  The co-operatives made a positive contribution to the farming community by providing financial and other assistance and they also gave long term credit to the farmers.  This stretched the co-ops to the limit because farmers were forced to borrow the maximum amount available.  Most of those farmers are now in an even worse state.</P>
    <P>I mention one area where help could be given and that is with regard to fertilisers. During the next few months farmers must grow more winter feed and in this connection fertilisers are esential, particularly nitrogenous fertiliser.  Farmers and merchants have stood by NET even at a time when their products were not favourably priced <i>vis-à-vis</i> imported products and now NET should reduce their price to help the farming sector.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the severely disadvantaged areas and I mentioned the matter a few days ago in this House.  One of the best things he could do would be to examine the possibility of declaring the whole country a severely handicapped area so that every farmer would qualify for the cattle headage grant.  We have made this point very often.  This would probably cost about £6 million but the Government could recoup 50 per cent of it.</P>
    <P>At present the officials spend more time investigating claims, part-time workers, people whose wives may be working but we have a special crib in my constituency. Even over the past week there has been a drop in milk production in my area.  As a dairying area we have had the most serious decline in milk production and we will find it very hard to make up this loss between now and the end of the year.  I hope the Minister will apply for another extension without delay and do as the Germans did.  This would show that he is concerned about these areas which have been victimised.  The two countries I represent came out very badly from this deal, despite the pleas we made to the Minister to do something for us.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he visited many areas, and I am very glad he did so <Col N="753" /> because it is very important for him to see what is happening around the country. But my fear is that people will show him the best parts and he will not see the worst areas.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that in 1986 when we should be looking at improvements in farm incomes, in productivity and efficiency, our farm income is below the 1980 level, and there is a great deal of inefficiency in many areas. Our farmers have lower incomes than other EC farmers and we do not seem to be able to command the same price for our produce as our EC neighbours.</P>
      <P>An area which is causing me grave concern is the farm improvement programme.  This is not a development programme but it is taking over from the farm modernisation scheme.  Under the farm modernisation scheme many farmers had plans carrying them up to the nineties.  It is my belief that these two schemes should have been joined together; the farm modernisation scheme could have been phased out and the farm improvement scheme would then have taken over.  I met a farmer a few days ago who has a farm programme up to 1992. Such farmers cannot get involved in the farm improvement programme until the programme drawn up by the ACOT officer has been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw a report from the ACOT office in Monaghan that they had received 120 applications under the scheme but I believe half of those applications will be rejected on a technicality.  It was very unfair to include the reference income. There was a reference income for the western countries, a separate one for <Col N="754" /> Louth, Leinster and Munster and a separate one for Dublin.  This was a serious anomaly because it was unfair to the farmers in the west.  There was also the reference system which related to the amount of work done and that, in turn, affected the percentage of the grant a farmer could receive.  This too militated against farmers in the west and the small farmers in Cavan and Monaghan.  I believe this scheme was probably imposed on the Minister by his officials, but they did a bad day's work in drawing it up.  I will hold this personal opinion until I see evidence that this is anything other than an anomalmous scheme which does nothing for the developing of farming.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to silage grants and we all agree that this is important, but many part time farmers do not qualify for any grant aid and it is important that they get concrete slabs for silage to ensure that they will have a winter supply of feed.  I asked the Minister if he would provide grants for silage making slabs and silage making equipment.  In view of the need for farmers to conserve winter feed I asked the Minister if he would make aid available to construct concrete slabs for farmers who do not qualify under the farm improvement scheme.  The Minister replied that, in view of the limited financial resources available, it was not possible to provide funds from the national Exchequer to make grant aid available for silage slabs to farmers who are not entitled to participate in the FIP or the PWD.  There again we threw a group of small farmers who did not qualify for grants on the scrapheap.  This is very serious and must be remedied without delay.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the problem in pig processing.  He said the industry must gear itself better to meet the challenges of increased competition not only on export markets but also on the home market.  He went on to say that to meet these challenges the industry must move with a greater sense of urgency to tackle the problems.  He then mentioned the overcapacity of slaughtering.  I agree that slaughterings have to be examined, but he must ensure that traditional areas for <Col N="755" /> pig processing and pig slaughterings are not left out when this reorganisation takes place.  This is very important in an area which provides good employment and where pig production is so important to the economy of the area.  In my area 100 jobs in this industry were lost, but the Minister seems hopeful that some of the measures introduced will help to get companies back into production.</P>
    <P>One thing that must concern us is the important of pigmeat here when there is freedom now for the Danes and so on to bring in their produce.  It is more important than ever that we ensure that we continue with our export market when from 1984 to 1985 our exports dropped by 3 per cent.  That gives a clear indication that it is not we who are loading the market abroad.  Other countries are doing that and we are falling behind instead of moving forward in exports.  In view of the threat from imports and the importance of the industry not alone to the producers and processors in the jobs it is providing but for the grain growers, the millers and the many people who benefit from pig production, in the short term the Minister should take all the action possible to ensure that the industry will ride the storm and get back into a good position.  It is regrettable, as the Minister said in his speech, that they have very good housing for breeding and production, splendid breeding stock well built up, very competent operators and at the end of the scale in processing some of the structures, equipment and standards are of doubtful origin.  It is a pity that the people in that area did not make the same efforts as the producers did to ensure that the product would be right when leaving this country.</P>
    <P>We face a serious situation at present regarding profitability in the very many areas where we have overproduction and the problem of sales.  ACOT's corporate plan is a document well written on good quality paper and it contains many commendable suggestions, but the first thing lacking is the money to implement it.  I am looking at some of their projects and <Col N="756" /> their plans for 1990 to reduce importation, to plant additional acreage to grow 400 acres of onions &mdash; which we should grow every year anyway &mdash; 300 acres of carrots, 300 acres of winter cauliflower and 2,000 acres of apples.  With other members of this party I visited orchards and vegetable production in a number of centres in the last 12 months.  We saw splendid orchards in Kilkenny grown by a Dundalk company.  One wonders about An Foras Talúntais not having research and development in apple production when we are talking of growing thousands of acres of apples.  Are we doing enough in research and development?  It is fine for people to come up with plans, projections and so on; but our problem is that we had too many damn plans and not enough action to support those plans.  That corporate plan is ideal but are the finance and will there to implement it?</P>
    <P>The enterprise scheme is mentioned in that plan.  Our spokesman, Deputy Noonan, referred to it when he talked about farmhouse enterprises, cheesemaking, etc.  I hope that the Minister will press ACOT to develop small scale, commercial, on-farm, food enterprises aimed at achieving greater value from existing production and small agri business as an alternative farm enterprise. Not alone in those small enterprises but in tourist related activity we will have to spread our wings to ensure that we will provide more jobs.</P>

      <P>In my lifetime I do not remember a Minister being appointed to office at a more unfortunate time than when the present Minister came in. Through all the years we had the hope of participation in the EC, our transitional period, periods of high price increases and periods when at EC level we had room for further expansion and spending on agriculture within the limit of EC resources.  When the Minister came into office it just happened for one reason or <Col N="757" /> another that a combination of circumstances had just arisen to make the prospect for further expanding our agricultural industry more difficult.  Combined they put tremendous pressure on the incomes of the agricultural industry. For that reason I have a great deal of sympathy for the Minister.  Anybody realising what the situation is in Europe and in the world market and having a sense of responsibility would have been terribly reluctant to take the job he has. I commend him for his courage in battling through it, facing, as he had to, the pressure of agricultural interests in Ireland and meeting with almost insurmountable obstacles in Brussels.  I do not envy him the task he has had in the last four years and I hope that in the last year or 18 months of his period of office things will ease to some extent and that he will have an easier time and a more hopeful outlook than we have had for the last four years.</P>

      <P>We talk about agriculture here as if we could tackle the agricultural industry, draw up a development plan and work to that plan taking the European situation into consideration and forgetting that the whole economic climate in which we make our plans for agriculture is extremely important. Regardless of what we do for the agricultural industry &mdash; and we do sit down, make our projections and apply our best brains to it &mdash; if sound and wise economic policies are not followed at national level than all the good planning and all the efforts made in the agricultural industry will come to nothing.  Over the years of management of our national economy problems developed which created rates of inflation that pushed up farmers' costs, and Government spending and other matters pushed up the cost of capital. Those two things particularly have made it virtually impossible for any farmer to sit down and draw up a plan and go to a bank or a financial institution to find <Col N="758" /> money to put into the development of his farm.  It has made absolutely no sense in recent years for any farmer to invest money in agriculture, particularly in areas such as I come from, for land reclamation or for the purchase of livestock. The interest rates on the money involved will bury that farmer before ever he gets an opportunity to get a return on the money.</P>
      <P>We cannot think about agriculture without recognising the realities of the EC.  I have heard much soft talk about the agricultural industry through the years, about keeping small farmers on the land, the rights of the farm family and so on. At the same time the population of the west, where small farmers lived in small numbers, was ever dwindling.  People were moving into the cities, the very places we said we did not want them to go to.  We make our plausible statements about retaining them on the land, but those statements meant nothing when we did not put into practice the economic policies that could at least have kept more of them there.</P>
      <P>The same position prevails in Europe. When the Treaty of Rome laid down that farmers are entitled to a reasonable standard of living, there were 20 million farmers in Europe from the nine countries. What use was that statement to the 11 million farmers who have left the land of Europe since and whose farms have either been left derelict or fallen into the hands of other farmers?  The reduction in numbers goes on and I blame the EC for its failure to prepare a long term plan for agriculture.  At price fixing time the Council of Ministers come together, the Parliament does its usual dance and a compromise is worked out which is designed to placate individual countries on the day.  There is no indication of where the agricultural industry in Europe is going in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not faced up to the fact that the capacity of Europe's soil to produce food is limited and that there is no possibility of a living for the 12 million farmers in the EC at present.  In the United States of America 2.5 million farmers are producing <Col N="759" /> so much food that there are massive surpluses in many areas.  Last year there was a productivity increase of about 10 per cent, in spite of all we heard about farms being sold in the United States. Some people estimate that by the end of the century 200,000 farmers in the United States will produce 80 per cent of the food required.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore those developments or the fact that markets throughout the world are shrinking.  We cannot talk about producing milk as if there were markets for it.  China now has a surplus of wheat and has been selling maize for the last two years.  Saudi Arabia has succeeded in producing enough wheat for its own population.  Biotechnology has not been successful.  The capacity of a small number of people to produce all the food we need in the foreseeable future is unlimited. To tell farmers in Europe that they are entitled to be on the land as their forefathers were, and all that nonsense, is not facing up to reality.  This did not happen in the case of steel workers, textile and shipyard workers or those in factories making motor cars and in the long run it will not happen for the vast majority of the small holdings occupied by farmers throughout the EC.  There will have to be a movement of those farmers from the land.  What will we do with such people?  That also arose in relation to the small shopkeepers, cobblers, carpenters and all the other people who made a living by using their hands and had small businesses.</P>
    <P>What will happen in the next ten years? If we are to plan effectively to give acceptable incomes to those on the land, we will have to face up to the fact that numbers will have to be reduced.  We will also have to face up to the fact that we need alternative crops; it is simple enough to say that but it may not be easy to identify what we will do.  In the west it has become increasingly obvious that it is extremely difficult to get a living from a small or medium size farm and many of the farmers in that area can only survive by being subsidised.</P>
    <P>Speakers have suggested that the <Col N="760" /> Government have suddenly withdrawn all aid from agriculture and that farming has been left to forage for itself.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The money given to agriculture by FEOGA and voted to it by this House comes to over £1,000 million, which almost equals the total net agricultural income for last year.  Many farms are not well equipped and a majority have incomes which are unacceptably low.  However, it would be wrong to suggest that the problem can be resolved by taking more money from someone else to increase Government expenditure on agriculture.  Perhaps some money could be redirected, but this whole matter should be looked into.</P>
    <P>As far as planning at European level is concerned, when you recognise the fact that two-thirds of the budget is spent on agriculture, mostly on storing surpluses, it is obvious that it would be far more sensible to rethink our whole position. With all due respects to the Minister, we are not selling milk to Mexico or beef in the Middle East.  There are no markets in which you can sell these products and we are dumping them with massive EC subsidies, £30 per cwt. on every animal sold to Libya.  That is not marketing; it is dumping in areas where the market is likely to close down because of falling oil prices and unstable political regimes.  We are very foolish to rely on these countries, where people cannot afford to buy high quality food at the sort of price which it cost to produce here.  Why should we have to dump our beef in Libya?  We have good grassland and a good climate and farmers can work efficiently under these conditions.  Cattle breeding stations have been working reasonably well for a number of years and we should be able to get our beef into the supermarket chains in Germany, France and Britain. We should be able to sell in the EC where there is and will be a market instead of putting into intervention and then dumping our products in markets which do not pay a realistic price for them.</P>
    <P>We must get rid of our surpluses of milk and cereals and we should not allow beef surpluses to develop.  A restriction on dairying now exists and cereal growing <Col N="761" /> is less profitable because of narrow margins. There may be a tendancy towards increased beef production in future years but we should bring the market into balance and seek good prices on the home market.  I am only referring to efficient farmers, because others, no matter what prices they got, could not make their operations economic.  These people will not survive and we must face up to that. We could save two-thirds of the European budget and if that money was directed towards a regional fund much more money would be available instead of the bulk of the money going, as it does at present, to large British farmers who produce vast quantities of milk and to Dutch farmers also.  Under the present system the money goes to the biggest and the richest.  This is the direction in which we should be looking and we could save most of the money which is spent at present on surpluses.  We should be able to compete with producers in the USA. Argentina and Brazil will develop their agriculture and that will also damage the export of European surpluses.</P>
    <P>There has been very bad weather this year, which has meant great difficulties for farmers.  On the other hand, I have seen many bad years.  Since 1947 I remember most of them and in most of the years since I was actively engaged in agriculture and on only two occasions did a Minister for Agriculture, in the face of a bad harvest, put forward an emergency plan and actually spend a significant amount of money helping to relieve the hardship that was so created.  The first was Mark Clinton in 1974 with his feed voucher scheme and the second was the Minister, Deputy Deasy, in the past year. While I did not agree with the way the package was put together, the money that was spent was what had been asked for.</P>
    <P>Last August there were discussions with the Creamery Milk Suppliers, the IFA and backbench members of my own party.  These groups put before us what they thought were their requirements and the Minister produced and spent as much money as they asked him to spend.  He gave practically everything the farming organisations asked for.  He did well to <Col N="762" /> squeeze that much out of a Cabinet committed to good housekeeping.  He did extremely well and gave immense relief to farmers, particularly in my part of the country.  Many people joked and said they met old people on the road who had received cheques on a number of occasions and were totally confused because they did not know where all the money they were getting was coming from.  There were advance payments on ewe premiums, silage grants, grants for flooded ground, and feed vouchers. There was such a combination of measures that quite a number of people were surprised and confused.  Nevertheless, that sort of emergency action will not resolve the problem when difficulty arises.</P>
    <P>We did not hear too many suggestions as to how the problems would or should be resolved.  Deputy Noonan said that Deputy Haughey, his Leader, put forward a proposal that we should draw up a balance sheet of the advantages and disadvantages we have enjoyed or suffered through our membership of the EC. Deputy Haughey did not say he would seek to renegotiate our membership.  The leader of a major political party who were in Government twice who cannot see at a glance what that balance sheet is like, is never likely to understand where we stand within the Community and how our economy has benefited from it.</P>
    <P>The first thing we should remember is that nobody asked us into the EC.  We applied for membership.  The policies were tailor-made at the time to suit our requirements and we got immense benefit.  I do not know what our disadvantages were because when I ask this question I am generally told the disadvantages are that we gave to other countries in Europe the right to come into our own markets.  That is absolute nonsense because we could not protect our own markets and at the same time attract multinational trading companies to come in and set up manufacturing here.  On the other hand, we all remember that long before we joined the EC we had a free trade agreement with Britain without the benefit of a regional, social, common <Col N="763" /> agricultural policy or anything else and at that time they were probably the most powerful industrial country in Western Europe.  This was because we recognised that we had to grow up in the world and if we were to have the same standard of living as everybody else we would have to compete with everybody else.  Today, the country that pays the bill as far as we are concerned, the Federal Republic of Germany, does not have a favourable balance of trade with us; the trade balance is the other way to a considerable extent.  Only Britain, of all the members of the EC, has a favourable balance of trade with us and we had a free trade agreement with Britain long before we became a member of the EC.  Nobody should be under any illusion that there is anything we can do in the final analysis to force a Community of 350 million people to put into effect policies which are designed to suit our needs.</P>
    <P>Finally, the protection of the Common Agricultural Policy, seemed to be the great obligation on members of the EC and all Government Ministers.  We need the Common Agricultural Policy.  We need common policies in more areas than agriculture.  We should recognise that agriculture, forestry and fisheries between them last year produced only 10 per cent of GDP.  So it is not a very efficient industry and we could have made much more of it in recent years.  We want a common agricultural policy.  But the Common Agricultural Policy we had in Europe when we had deficiencies in almost all our produce is not the policy that will accommodate our needs today.  I do not believe the Common Agricultural Policy was as well designed for our needs as it was thought to be because rich farmers got far too much out of it to the detriment of the farmers in poorer areas.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the full headage grant paid.  I would not put forward the reasons put forward by Deputy Prendergast and others.  From a national, economic point of view we should avail of all the money that is there.  I invite the Minister to take a good careful look at agricultural spending to find out what <Col N="764" /> levies we can collect to provide the balancing money so that we can take in every shilling that is available to us particularly through the structural side and the severely handicapped areas scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in alerting the House to the fact that, regardless of what the Minister has said, I could find no ray of hope in the very lengthy script he produced.  The Minister did make a few useful comments which I was pleased to hear.  However, we had hoped there would be some kind of a blueprint or a plan which would help to pull the agricultural industry from the deep recession in which it is at present. Politicians are fairly good with words. But if one tried to extract from the Minister's speech what he will do for agriculture in 1986, one could write on the back of a cigarette box the number of positive proposals contained in it.</P>
      <P>There is little point in trying to analyse what went wrong in the past unless one balances this by considering what will happen in the future.  There is in agriculture a crisis with a capital C. Unless something is done as a matter of urgency not only will farmers and farm families go to the wall, but serious damage will be done to the economy, resulting in massive job losses in all of the service and processing areas connected with agriculture.</P>
      <P>It would be a great shame if it took the destruction of the agricultural industry to bring home to the people how dependent we are on this base industry.  I say with the utmost sincerity that the extent of the problem is not fully understood by the Government and those outside agriculture. Perhaps it is because farmers have got the undeserved reputation of complaining when there is no reason for such complaints.  That is a myth which people very glibly circulate, saying that farmers are always complaining, anyway.  Perhaps we have reached the stage where it is a case of now crying &ldquo;Wolf&rdquo;.  If the problem is to be tackled and resolved, there must first be genuine recognition that a problem exists and identification of its extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> The crisis has existed for some time and the plight of the farmers has been brought to the Minister's notice by Members of this House and by representatives of farm organisations, but so far he and the Government have failed to acknowledge the problem.  Even in his speech today, the Minister appears to be on the defensive and I do not know why he should be.  It is his job to deal with the problems facing the agricultural industry and to find the solution to them.  He has not other function than to try to bring about the maximum level of development within the Department over which he has control and in which he has jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>In fairness, I admit that a Minister for Agriculture in the present international situation has a tough job; there is absolutely no doubt about that.  It is a tough job negotiating for farmers in Europe. However, it is his duty to ensure that, in negotiating on behalf of the farmers of his country, he gets the maximum possible deal for them and for the agricultural industry.  It is also his duty and responsibility to ensure that, whatever happens and no matter what price he has to pay in terms of unpopularity by taking tough decisions in Europe, the bottom line must be the protection of the maximum number of Irish farm families.</P>
    <P>Two major considerations must dominate the debate on this Estimate.  The first is the individual position of farmers and farm families and what the Government will do to protect their incomes. The Minister said he has travelled around the country and that he was very pleased at the number of farmers he met on his travels who were satisfied with the outcome of his negotiations.  I do not know what part of the country he travelled around, but he is certainly not meeting the farmers with the problems my colleagues and I are meeting day after day. The reality is &mdash; although it is the Minister's job to try to defend his own position &mdash; that the vast majority of farm families are either struggling to make ends meet, depending on the enterprise they are in, or are now in a loss-making situation.</P>
    <P>That is the challenge facing the Minister <Col N="766" /> for Agriculture in this Estimate.  The farmers are awaiting a response from the Minister to the challenge in this first Estimate of 1986.  They want to see what will be done for the industry to help it to survive in the months ahead.  I do not say this by way of political ridicule or criticism, but I am extremely disappointed that the Minister's Estimate did not put forward one positive proposal to help those farm families to survive during the remainder of this year and into the future.</P>
    <P>The second consideration relates to the importance of agriculture as a national industry and how it fits into the overall scheme for national development, if we have such a scheme at present.  There is no point in the Minister paying lip service to the importance of agriculture to the country and the employment which it generates, if he allows a situation to develop in which those engaged in the base industry, the farmers, are being forced by diminishing profits to seriously reconsider their position.  Many enterprises make a zero profit and in some instances they are making a loss.  With the possible exception of the dairying sector, almost every other sector, be it beef, cereals, or whatever, is making a very low margin of profit, or, depending on the level of borrowing, making a loss.</P>
    <P>When we know that industry is basic to the future development of the country and that so many thousands of jobs are dependent on a successful and expanding agricultural industry, how can the Minister come here without a blueprint or plan deliberately geared towards salvaging that industry?  Are we to allow this industry to collapse in 1986?  We are knocking on the door of destruction.  Are we to allow the industry to disintegrate totally and along with it the thousands of jobs associated with the servicing of this industry in which so many people find valuable employment?  This Estimate is of importance to more people than farmers. It is important to the economy and to the people engaged in servicing that vast area of agricultural enterprises.</P>
    <P>There is no point in talking about what happened in the past, but we all regret <Col N="767" /> that the agricultural industry has been brought to its present low level.  We have an obligation to the people who, as a result of the depression in agriculture over the past two or three years, find themselves in serious financial difficulties. The Government must do something positive to come to their rescue.  Despite the efforts made in the past in restructuring loans, for which I thank the Minister &mdash; always liking to give credit where credit is due &mdash; many sound, genuine, hard-working farmers who borrowed in good times to invest in the development of the industry, now find themselves unable to service their borrowing and their debts.</P>
    <P>This nation owes something to those people who were prepared to put borrowed money into this development and take a chance in the national interest. They are in an impossible situation now and, in an agricultural country, the Government must find a solution to their problems.  There is no use in explaining why this cannot be done.  We are either serious about agriculture, or we are not. We will either let those farmers go to the wall, or we will try to salvage their position and that of their families.  I am disappointed that there is absolutely nothing in this Estimate which provides any ray of hope.  There is absolutely no reference to the plight of the farmers who borrowed to develop the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>By way of a defence of the situation in which agriculture finds itself the Minister put forward the case that the whole problems was over-production, world production and European production.  I acknowledge that there is over-production in a number of agricultural commodities, but I do not accept that the over-production in Ireland, as a member of the EC, is as bad as it is made out to be.  One must bear in mind that in 1985 224,000 tonnes of dairy products were imported into the European Community. Why did we join the European Community? We joined because it provided a market and because it provided an opportunity for expansion.  We thought, and <Col N="768" /> were led to believe, that the interest of agricultural producers within the Community would be protected and would get preferential treatment.  Yet we have the evidence of 224,000 tonnes of dairy products being imported into the European Community.  Apart from that, 80,000 tonnes of dairy products are being exported from New Zealand into Britain. We in Ireland have to pay that price.</P>
    <P>Dairying is the backbone of the entire livestock industry.  We have not got the consideration which we deserve within the European Community as a small developing agricultural nation.  The whole concept of the Treaty of Rome is being undermined because of the way that small developing nations like Ireland are being treated.  When we joined the European Community we were told that special consideration would be given to the problems and difficulties of developing nations.  We now know that many of our European partners had their agricultural industry developed to a far greater extent than it is developed in Ireland at present.  As a small nation we now find that we have to carry the same restrictions as those well developed, large agricultural economies who were there long before we joined the Community.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the development of the livestock industry.  Once we have a situation where the dairy herd and the breeding herd are declining, then we are on the road to totally undermining the entire livestock industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly necessary for me to bring to the notice of the House the importance of the livestock industry. Apart from its importance and its relevance to farms and farm families, it is important in terms of job creation and exports.  This is something which does not need to be developed here, because, everybody knows its value.  When we talk about national development we like to pay lip service to the importance of the livestock industry in the economy.  We do it glibly and almost automatically.  I say <Col N="769" /> to the Minister that the beef industry is on its knees at present.  There are many beef farmers who borrowed to develop their beef enterprises and who cannot now service the loans they borrowed. More important still, the level of profitability in beef is either at zero or is in a loss making situation if, for example, the farmer in question has very high borrowings.</P>
      <P>I had the pleasure last week of attending with the Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, the opening of a very modern meat plant in Rathdowney.  It was extremely satisfying for me as a Deputy for that area to see the large number of people employed in that extremely valuable processing industry.  As I walked through the boning halls of that industry one thought dominated my entire consideration. That was that the producers, the people who are supplying the raw material to keep that industry in operation, were in a loss making situation.  I ask the Minister what is he going to do for the beef industry?  There is nothing in his speech or in the Estimate which he put before the House tonight which will in any way come to the rescue of the beef producer, who is basic to the development of our national economy.  There is no use in giving lip service to it.  We need to have positive proposals in relation to the development of that aspect of the economy.  I am extremely disappointed that there is nothing in the Estimate to deal with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>In one minute I would briefly like to bring to the Minister's notice the serious situation existing for cereal producers.  The Minister will offer the defence that there is overproduction of cereals in Europe.  There is a surplus of 15 million tonnes in the European Community.  On the other side of that coin there are 13.5 million tonnes imported into the Community.  When will the Community look after its own members?  When will it give priority to <Col N="770" /> the people who subscribe to the Treaty of Rome and who want to see a Common Agricultural Policy maintained in this country?  I suggest to the Minister that there is not a surplus of grain production in Europe; or, if there is a surplus there, it is because of the large volume of imports from outside countries.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his colleagues have a responsibility to protect the interests of the farmers of Europe.  But the Minister has a particular responsibility to look after the interests of this small, developing agricultural nation.  That is one of the challenges which faces him in 1986. Whatever he is not prepared to offer in the Estimate before us, he has a duty to ensure that the plight of Irish farmers be brought sufficiently strongly to the notice of his colleagues in Europe.  If he leaves it to the end of this year I can foretell that there will be many hundreds of farmers who will not be in existence in 1987 because they will not have the finances to keep their small farms in operation.</P>

      <P>He does not want to listen to the truth because it is too bitter for him.  That is what is wrong.  What about exports of carcase lambs in 1985? They amounted to 23,200 tonnes, an increase of 36 per cent.  When was that achieved by a Fianna Fáil Government? What about exports to the French market?  They amounted to 20,000 tonnes or 86 per cent of total exports of lamb. Exports to Belgium accounted for a further 11 per cent or 2,500 tonnes.  There is <Col N="773" /> great potential for expanding our mutton and lamb industry.  For the past ten to 15 years we have only skimmed the surface as far as that section of the agricultural industry is concerned.  Thanks to the virile policy of the Minister for Agriculture and the Government we can look forward with confidence to a great increase in our sheep and lamb exports.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind Deputies that we are told that by the end of the eighties, which is a mere four years away, the structural surpluses in beef in the EC will have been eliminated and a return to self sufficiency can be contemplated for the first time since 1979.  The Minister for Agriculture had a hard battle to bring home an agreement to the agricultural community which is second to none.</P>
      <P>I would also like to remind my friends on the other side of the House that what I have stated about the elimination of the structural surfaces in beef in the EC would suggest that the EC Commission could be more rational in their future long term policy on the EC beef industry. Despite this eventual return to self sufficiency seasonal surpluses can and will still occur, mainly in the autumn months. Therefore, it is necessary for our farmers to rotate the supply of beef to the market to ensure that seasonal surpluses do not occur.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can boast that our beef is of the best quality in the world. Our exporters should make an all out effort to explore new outlets on the Continent and further afield.  With the advent of Spain into the EC I see no reason why our beef exporters cannot capitalise on the valuable and lucrative beef market which exists in Spain and the Canary Islands.  For the past number of years Spain has been obtaining most of its beef imports from Argentia and other South American countries.  Now that Spain has joined the EC it is most important that we make a breakthrough into that market.  I <Col N="774" /> ask our Minister for Agriculture to make every possible effort to ensure that we make that breakthrough.</P>
      <P>If we market our products in a right and proper fashion, I have no doubt that the amount of beef which will need to go into intervention during the autumn months will be nil because the quality of Irish beef, as I said earlier, is of premier grade.  Therefore, in a country such as the Federal Republic of Germany which has a population of almost 120 million people with over six million people living in West Berlin alone, there must and should be a vast outlet for our beef and meat exports.  I visited West German supermarkets recently and I saw beef and meat products from all other exporting countries very visibly on sale.  It was only on very rare occasions I saw a prime cut of Irish beef for sale in those supermarkets. We must seek a solution to this.  I am firmly of the opinion that we could be exporting thousands of extra tonnes of meat products to the Federal Republic of Germany and other European countries.</P>
      <P>I would also like to draw the attention of the Minister to the huge amount of vegetables which are being imported.  We must diversify our agricultural activities. With our climate, we are the most suitable country in Europe for growing vegetables. I cannot see why our farmers are not capitalising more on the growing of vegetables.  It is costing us millions of pounds to import vegetables each year. Tonight, it was brought to my notice&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that at least 2,500 tonnes of Cyprus potatoes are being unloaded in Derry at present.  Many of those potatoes will find their way across the Border if we do not take stringent measures to keep them out.  I can tell the House that there is a ship of 1,400 tonnes at present on the high seas bound for Dundalk and another of 2,200 tonnes bound for Dublin carrying over 6,000 tonnes of new potatoes.  I should warn the Minister that, before the week expires, our potato growers will be putting their product on the home market.  It is <Col N="775" /> vital that we stop the importation of new potatoes to give our own growers an opportunity to get a decent price for theirs.</P>
      <P>If we are to have a viable agricultural industry we must protect the interests of our farming community, and ensure that they get fair play.  They are confronted with a time problem as far as the production of new potatoes is concerned because our climatic conditions do not permit their production as early as in Mediterranean countries.  However, their quality is second to none when they do appear on our market.</P>
      <P>I dislike the moves afoot in the EC to squeeze out the small farmer.  The large co-operatives are becoming bigger daily which means that farmers in general are losing contact with their co-operatives. They now constitute a number, somewhere between one and 6,000 in a computer. That is not the Ireland Sir Horace Curzon Plunkett envisaged.  I know it is the age of the large combine, the multinationals and the multiplier, but it is very unfair that the Irish small farmer should be squeezed out of existence.</P>
      <P>The Minister might extend the disadvantaged areas scheme, which has constituted a vital cog in the wheel of agricultural development.  I know some of our small farmers along the western seaboard from Cork to Donegal are very critical of the fact that many areas along that coast have not been included in it's provisions, areas which are poorer by far than many others that have been included.  In the renegotiation discussions in Brussels the Minister should make every possible effort to have as much of our land included in that scheme as possible.  When one remembers that the Germans were successful in having huge portions of their land included, surely we can make an even better case for ourselves for an extension of that scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More aid should also be given for improving our mountain pastures and the division of mountain commonages. Those pastures have been starved of manure and lime.  The Minister would do <Col N="776" /> well to initiate a scheme to improve the fertility of those mountain pastures which would be enhanced enormously if the soil were improved.  The cost of fertilisers constitutes a prohibitive factor for the poorer farmers.  The Minister should examine closely the possibility of controlling the prices of fertilisers because, since such controls were removed, they have escalated.  There is need for strict supervision in that respect.</P>
    <P>It is important also that our farmers diversify their methods of farming.  For example, we see imported cheese in every supermarket in the country &mdash; cheese with onion, ham, chives, peppers, crab, lobster, salmon, all the produce of the Federal Republic of Germany and of Denmark.  Why cannot we capitalise on that lucrative market?  We lag behind terribly as far as cheese production is concerned. When we assumed office, with inflation running at approximately 24 per cent, our farmers encountered major problems.  What good was the £100 they got then?  It was worth only £76 taking inflation into account.  Today the £100 they receive will be worth the full £100 without any reduction for inflation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No farmers have suffered more in the past 12 months than those in my constituency, which fact was highlighted throughout the spring by the number of cattle that died.  It was unfortunate that moneys remained unspent from last year's Estimate while at the same time, huge numbers of cattle died in County Sligo and, in particular, County Leitrim.  I attended a meeting convened by the Irish Farmers' Association in Drumshanbo on Monday evening, 9 June last, when farmers generally expressed their concern.  I suppose that Monday evening was one of the last of the bad weather we have experienced this year.  Thankfully the weather has improved since, giving the farmers in that part of the country a chance at long last to put their cattle out on grass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the Minister introduced the feed voucher scheme, an excellent scheme but whose provisions did not go far enough.  A farmer who had 75 per <Col N="777" /> cent of his feed did not quality for the voucher scheme.  Unfortunately, last year many farmers had 75 per cent of their feed but the quality was not taken into account.  How could silage made in September and October be as good as that made in June or July?  I spoke to the Minister on numerous occasions about the feed voucher scheme.  It was an excellent scheme for people who qualified since it helped them to buy meal for their cattle which got them through the winter months and into the late spring.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision announced by the Minister of State to extend the scheme to all mountain areas.  There will be a grant for helicopters to spread fertilisers on the mountains.  The grant for fencing has been available for some time and I welcome the increase.  I hope that every farmer can qualify for this scheme without too much form-filling.  It can do nothing but good for disadvantaged areas, whether in the mountains of West Cork or the Ox Mountains of County Sligo.  These hard-pressed farmers lost a considerable number of their sheep owing to the bad weather.</P>
    <P>Deputy Prendergast mentioned the drainage of the Mulcair River.  Almost four years ago the then Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Mac Sharry, began the Bonet scheme in County Leitrim.  That scheme of arterial drainage was to last five years and then the drainage of the Arrow and the Owenmore rivers would be undertaken.  The farmers in these areas are very concerned because they have been devastated by flooding.  I know the Minister visited that part of County Sligo last year since I met him there.  Because of the scaledown in the amount of money available to complete the Bonet drainage scheme, I believe it will be years before work commences on the Arrow and the Owenmore. I appeal to the Minister to make the necessary finance available to complete the drainage of the Bonet, get on with the drainage of the Arrow and the Owenmore and give the farmers a chance to farm their land to the full potential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that many farmers, especially part-time farmers, will qualify for the farm improvement programmes.  Under the old farm modernisation scheme any body qualified, regardless of income.  We all know that the income limit for a farmer in a disadvantaged area to qualify for headage payments is too low.  One of the points put to us at the meeting in Drumshanbo was that a part-time farmer should be able to earn a realistic industrial wage and still qualify for a grant in a disadvantaged area.  I ask the Minister to raise the income limit to at least £9,000 and enable these part-time farmers to qualify.</P>
      <P>I would also urge the Minister to double the headage grant this year to farmers in disadvantaged areas.  I know from the NCF co-op that they have tripled the amount of feedstuffs sold to farmers this year.  The Minister should make sure that these farmers will be able to pay back the money they owe to the co-ops.  Millions are owed by farmers. The co-ops did not refuse the farmers who came to them for feedstuffs to keep their cattle alive, even though they knew a number of them were unable to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope agriculture will continue to be our principal industry for many years to come.  It is vital to do everything possible to preserve the way of life of our farmers. The few proposals I put to the Minister are designed to have this effect, especially in the disadvantaged areas.  Along the western seaboard we have the highest rainfall in any part of Europe.  That was proved this spring.  The job of a Minister for Agriculture is not easy when facing the tycoons in Europe but we should be getting everything possible for Irish farmers, especially when grants are funded pound for pound by Europe.  We must avail of everything that is going in order <Col N="779" /> to build up our greatest natural resources.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider my point about the many part time farmers who will be making applications under the farm improvement schemes.  They are people who go to work from 8 o'clock in the morning until 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening.  They rise early in the morning and do half a day's work before going to their jobs.  They also work very late into the evening.  Public representatives must continuously make representations on behalf of part time farmers who, unfortunately, do not qualify for assistance under any of the schemes.  Any Minister would be doing a good day's work if he permitted those farmers to obtain grants under the agricultural scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate provides us with an opportunity to examine the performance of the agricultural industry in the last 12 months and consider its prospects for the future.  Tonight's debate is being conducted against the background of one of the worst crises ever faced by the industry.  It is certainly the worst crisis since we joined the EC.  We have had a combination of factors, the weather, the unsatisfactory treatment meted out to the farmers in the Community negotiation halls, the difficulties created by imports from outside the Community that are flooding our markets and the difficulty with our production costs, that spell a gloomy prospect for our farmers in the short term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our principal lines of production &mdash; dairying, beef production, cereal growing, pig production and horticulture &mdash; have been bogged down by excessive production costs in recent years.  Some of them have been affected by a fall off in demand while others have suffered because of Community restrictions, particularly in dairying.  On the domestic scene exorbitant interest rates have bedevilled the industry for many years.  Following the last EMS realignment we looked forward to interest rates dropping to single figures and stabilising there.  We were told that following the drop in energy prices interest rates would fall and <Col N="780" /> farmers would benefit.  Sadly, that has not happened.  Many farmers are in financial difficulties and there is little hope for them in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Many farmers borrowed some years ago when everything in the garden was rosy and prospects were good.  At that time the price for agricultural land was very high and farmers entered into development programmes with the prospect of good days ahead and satisfactory prices. They did not foresee having any difficulty repaying their loans but the good days have come to an end.  Even our best farmers are troubled by financial problems and they will find it hard to get themselves out of them.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the super-levy was disastrous for Ireland.  The planned expansion in the dairy sector has come to a halt.  We were allowed a slight increase in output but the confidence of the dairy farmers was rocked.  Those farmers, because of the nature of the enterprises, must plan long term but they cannot do so.  Processing plants are under utilised because the growth of the dairying industry has been stymied.  Those groups invested heavily in expansions programmes but are in great difficulty now.</P>
    <P>The restriction on the number of calves born here will affect the throughput to meat plants and the export of cattle on the hoof.  The Minister is trying to encourage farmers to get involved in suckler cow enterprises as an alternative to dairying but I do not see anything on the horizon that will give the economic return to encourage farmers to get involved in suckler calf rearing.  The agricultural industry would benefit if suckler calf rearing was an alternative to dairying but I do not see that happening.  The margin of profit needed has not been there in the past and I do not think it will be there in the future.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems that bedevil farming today stem from the decision of the Community to permit factory type farming in other member states such as the Netherlands.  Huge dairy enterprises prospered on cheap cereal substitutes imported from outside the Community. We have been badly affected by that.  We <Col N="781" /> have had to deal with the decision to permit New Zealand dairy products into the Community.  Britain negotiated a special derogation for New Zealand when they joined.  It is extraordinary that our dairy farmers must allow their enterprises stagnate to facilitate dairy farmers in New Zealand and the huge factory type farms on the Continent that import cheap cereal substitutes.  There is something wrong with an economic structure that tolerates that.</P>
    <P>All enterprises in the agricultural industry must be able to plan for the future with confidence but the profit margin in the beef sector in recent years to allow people expand and meet repayments on the capital investment involved has not been there.  The future for those involved in beef production is not good. It is easy to pretend that there are easy solutions but I do not think they exist. Proper research and development programmes are not being carried out and there is no financial commitment to research and development.  There has been a serious cutback in the ESRI budget which inevitably will reflect itself in reduced research in agriculture.</P>
    <P>The importance of having a forward looking breeding programme has not been appreciated, and the decision to terminate the AI subsidy was bad.  The Minister should seriously consider reintroducing it.  Figures indicate that there has been a change around in breeding programmes by many farmers.  AI centres had the know-how and the range of breeding stock at their disposal to improve our future herds and they had the wherewithal to replenish breeding stock when required.  They should be in the vanguard of a proper breeding programme for our dairying and beef herds.  The Government should introduce a type of subsidy that would be an incentive to our farmers to introduce more continental breeds.  That should have been done earlier, but the incentive was not provided and I earnestly ask the Minister to see what potential there is there to help our future beef industry.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies referred to the pig industry and to the need to rationalise <Col N="782" /> the production, slaughter and processing of pigs.  There is no doubt that rationalisation is necessary in this sector.  The performance of those involved in the industry has been commendable from the point of view of production but that has not been matched by a similar performpoint of view of production but that has not been matched by a similar performance in slaughtering, processing and marketing. The capital investment needed is beyond those involved in processing and there is a very strong case to be made for the Minister to consider a programme of aid to help people to rationalise before the industry is allowed to die.  Pork products can be freely brought into our markets because people in mainland Europe have the wherewithal and the know-how to produce, slaughter and process their pigmeat.  Here we cannot produce what the consumer needs and will find ourselves flooded out of the market if we do not get our act together.</P>
    <P>Of all sectors in agriculture, pig production is the most labour intensive and it creates more downstream jobs than anything I can think of.  Consequently, it would be a great pity if measures are not taken in time to get the industry properly geared for the future.  At the moment the slaughtering facilities we have do not allow us to export our pigment to the US, for instance.  That market is not as attractive today as it was but there is still some potential there.  We must look at all these matters seriously if we are to develop our economy as a whole and our pig industry, which would provided jobs for the many thousands who are coming through our education system.</P>
    <P>I am seriously concerned about our glasshouse industry and the crisis it has been in for so long.  We have had the ridiculous situation of hundreds of acres of glasshouses lying derelict or under utilised while we have imported tomatoes being freely marketed here in supermarkets and other retail outlets.  It is madness to have those imports while we have so much potential in areas like North County Dublin, Wexford, and Waterford where glasshouses are lying derelict or under utilised.  There is something radically wrong when that is so.</P>
    <P>Our marketing technique in this sector <Col N="783" /> has been bad for too long.  The producer group grant scheme has not been sufficently attractive to encourage more people to become engaged in the industry.  Surely it is not beyond the wit of the Government to examine this and renegotiate the grant scheme in the EC. We have a small but viable industry which could be expanded and developed if the incentives were provided.  If this does not happen soon the industry will be dead.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the Government introduced a special grant scheme to encourage people to use solid fuel boilers, but the money required was beyond many of the people who would be interested. They just continued glasshouse production in the warm months and forgot all about it in the off season when the demand is greatest.  It is questionable whether the Government at that time would have been wiser to subsidise fuel oil to keep people in business until better days came.  Now that the price of oil has stabilised we may think that the investment in solid fuel boilers was unwise. However, in the long term it may have been a wise thing to do.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with difficulties in regard to land structure, the many small uneconomic holdings in Ireland and the question of inheritance and retirement.  There is no doubt that Irish agriculture has remained in a state of underdevelopment because of land structure problems.  Various attempts were made to encourage land leasing and elderly farmers to pass land to their heirs. There is a problem in regard to land mobility but we have not got an answer to that dilemma.  We have not got our under used land moving to young people at a rate that would be good for the industry.  Small holdings are uneconomical and we have too many part time farmers, which is not the most efficient way to utilise our land.  We would be better with more medium sized viable farms and with greater numbers employed on them. Unfortunately the kind of policies pursued in that area will not lead us to that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are debating this Estimate at a very serious time for Irish agriculture, probably one of the most serious periods in the history of our country from the agricultural and economic points of view.  We are also debating it in the wake of the inclement weather we experienced last winter.  We cannot escape the fact that this Government have failed miserably to come forward with any positive measures to alleviate the problems of Irish farmers or to make an impression in Europe to help in our negotiations on behalf of Irish farmers. By their inaction the Government have been responsible for an erosion of confidence in the agricultural industry.  As a country we depend on our primary industry, namely, agriculture, and this must be acknowledged by the Government and by everyone in the country.  If we have not economic growth based on a solid foundation in agriculture, we cannot hope to alleviate the economic difficulties facing us.</P>
      <P>We must examine what is happening in our country.  In the past three or four years there has been a marked exodus from agriculture.  Because of the economic situation many farmers have no option but to dispose of their assets and deal with the financial institutions and having disposed of their assets, many farmers have nothing other than their house and an acre or two of land.  Thus, they are totally dependent on the social welfare system.  Deputy Connaughton, the Minister of State, knows that in the constituency we represent there are many farms for sale.  This is because the younger generation have no confidence in the future of agriculture.  They consider their future is in some other industry, either here or overseas.  As a result, good, solid agricultural land that has given a livelihood to many families and has made such a contribution to the local and to the national economy is being sold, causing a further erosion of the confidence that is so badly needed at this time.  There is an exodus of farmers from the land across Europe and it is essential that the future of agriculture in the EC context be looked at critically at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> This Government were presented with a number of opportunities in the past two years to renegotiate our position in the EC.  They had an opportunity to emphasise to the Council of Ministers and to the Commission the seriousness of the situation here.  We are an island nation and are remote from European and world markets.  We have distinctly different types of soil in our country, we have different climatic conditions in the western part of the country as distinct from the southern and eastern parts and the topography throughout the country varies enormously.  Above all, our farmers have not achieved maximum productivity. All of these factors could have enabled our Government to renegotiate our position in Europe.  They could have made the case that Ireland should be treated as a distinctly unique country.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil were in Government and when they were conducting negotiations in Europe, they made it clear we were a unique nation and that we needed specialist assistance from Europe.  We succeeded in getting the whole country treated as a disadvantaged region and certain grants were made available to us.  However, this Government have only succeeded in getting short-term schemes and they have allowed other schemes to lapse while they were trading for other benefits.  There has been no real effort to stimulate agricultural productivity.  Farmers' incomes have not increased and confidence in the agricultural community has been eroded.  Above all, they have not made the case in Europe that Irish agriculture is suffering severely and deserves the support of the Community more than ever before.</P>
    <P>When we consider the exodus of people from the farming lands of Europe, we must question the commitment of our European counterparts to the Common Agricultural Policy and to the Treaty of Rome on which that policy is based.  The EC was set up to ensure equality of opportunity, equal rights to markets, sufficient productivity and sufficient support mechanisms throughout the Community so that all would have an equal income.</P>
    <P>In the recent past West Germany have <Col N="786" /> been able to negotiate their position and much of the fine land of that country is now included in the scheme for severely disadvantaged areas.  Let us contrast that with the situation here, where not all of the west of Ireland is classified as severely disadvantaged, or where not all of any particular area is so classified.  Germany makes a major contribution to the EC but according to the Treaty of Rome they have a duty to make that contribution. As an independent State we must have a distinct voice in the negotiations to ensure that other countries realise what is happening here.  We must be given an opportunity to bring our productivity levels to those of our counterparts in Europe.  We cannot have factory farms as in the case of Denmark, Holland and other countries.  We cannot have cheap imports, we are not close to the markets and we do not have the benefit of cheap food products for our livestock and our dairying industry.  Other countries have the benefit of all of those aids.  We are not in that privileged situation and this must be brought home repeatedly to our European counterparts.  We must repeat that fact at all meetings until the other countries appreciate the distinct disadvantages we have and the serious situation facing us.  There must be a commitment in Europe to help us.</P>
    <P>In the past few years Britain have been able to renegotiate their position and they have obtained major refunds from the Community.  Surely that is not why they entered the EC?  They were slow about joining but they knew what they were doing.  They knew the conditions of the game, they knew the economic environment in which they would operate.  Yet, they had the clout and they were able to get massive refunds.  On the other hand, Ireland is getting only a small contribution. Perhaps we are getting a major contribution <i>per capita</i> but, in comparison with the disadvantages we have and the difficulties facing us, the contribution from Europe in the past few years has diminished considerably.</P>
    <P>Recently Spain and Portugal joined the Community.  Then was a good opportunity <Col N="787" /> for our Government to point out to the member states the many disadvantages under which we operate.  The Government could have questioned the entry of the Iberian Peninsula until such time as we got our own house in order, and until the assistance and guarantees to this country were spelled out so that we could avail of them.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, the will or the commitment is not in Europe to alleviate our difficulties.  It appears that we are not in a position to make an impact in the Community.  This stems back to 1983, when this Government came into office.  During their first year they suspended the farm modernisation scheme.  That created a serious situation for this country.  It eroded the confidence of farmers, it diminished the incentive to expand and develop and it created an attitude in Europe where it seemed that this country did not need European assistance nor was it prepared to avail of the European assistance which was readily available.  That was the turning point in agricultural development in this country in the last decade.  We eroded our negotiating position.  We eroded our right to make a case.  We were not even prepared to accept what was already there, apart from making a further case to ensure that more money would be made available under the farm modernisation scheme.  Not alone did we lose money under the suspension of that scheme, but a number of Irish farmers who had projects in hand, who had borrowed money, who had started to prepare a plan in the knowledge that there would be a guaranteed grant available at the end of the day, found themselves in serious financial difficulties.  We then had the recession, inclement weather, and instability in the market place; and all this taken together has created chaos for our farmers.</P>
    <P>With a plethora of propaganda, with trumpet-blasting announcements, this Government announced schemes which would be introduced and when they would be introduced; but when we got them two or three years later they were <Col N="788" /> not what we expected and in many cases we never even saw them.  The AI scheme, the lime scheme and many other schemes, which were very important for farming, were costing the country very little, a total of £7 million or £8 million &mdash; a net contribution of £3.6 million or £4 million from the Exchequer and a similar contribution from Europe.  These schemes were making a fantastic contribution to agricultural productivity, they ensured that the land was right and that we had top quality livestock.  But all these schemes were terminated.  That totally destroyed our negotiating credibility and changed the attitude of our European counterparts in the Council of Ministers and in the Commission to the serious position in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that Irish farmers are totally frustrated and have lost confidence in this Government?  They are only waiting for the day when there will be a Government which will give them a good ear, a positive response, will represent them in Europe in a dignified manner and ensure that we will get what is available in Europe to help develop farming and will, therefore, be to the betterment of the country in general.</P>
    <P>Farmers owe £150 million to the financial institutions.  That is the sum the two biggest financial institutions wrote off in bad debts last year.  Today our farmers still owe all the institutions £150 million. On top of that they owe £70 million to the co-operatives.  The arrears owed to the Land Commission are the highest on record.  When we take all these things into account we see how serious the position is.  As of 30 April a total of £2,923,000 was owed by 33,739 farmers &mdash; in round figures, 34,000 farmers owed £3 million &mdash; to the Land Commission. Farmers all over the country, in the west in Meath, in Wexford and in Cork, borrowed to buy land from the Land Commission at £3,000 or £3,500 an acre in full confidence that they would be able to meet their commitments, but because of an erosion of confidence and a depletion in the market place, they now find they cannot meet their commitments. These farmers have been dealing with the <Col N="789" /> Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton. I know little or nothing can be or has been done for these people, but this should not be allowed to happen.  Farmers who owe £13,000 or £14,000 are being told that if they pay £6,000 or £7,000 the financial institutions will reconsider their position as far as the remainder of the money is concerned.</P>
    <P>A man in my constituency has assets of £180,000, £60,000 liabilities and owes £13,000 arrears to the Land Commission. The Minister has responsibility for the Land Commission and there is no reason why they cannot restructure those borrowings over the working life of this farmer, until he reaches 65 or 66 years of age.  There is no reason for not restructuring the borrowings of the majority of farmers and giving them a breathing space.  Again, I appeal to the Minister to do something about this.  I have been involved with financial institutions for a number of years and know there are no good reasons for not restructuring the borrowings of farmers who have first class assets.</P>
    <P>I know a man with a quota of 34,000 gallons, assets of £180,000 and liabilities of £60,000.  He is only 38 years of age. There is no reason for not restructuring his borrowings over the next 30 years.  He would be well able to repay £6,000 per annum on one loan to one institution. The ACC is a semi-State body under the total direction of this Government, and is popularly known as the farmers' bank. But this organisation has failed farmers over the years because it is too strict and inflexible.  It will write-off farmers and put them on the black list; that is condemning farmers to total disaster, to an exodus from agriculture.  There is no reason why the Minister cannot direct this organisation to restructure loans of farmers in financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has responsibility for the recent farm programme and installation grants but the majority of farmers in the west do not qualify for these grants.  In the west winter lasts six weeks longer than in the rest of the country. Therefore the number of standard man days under this grant scheme should <Col N="790" /> be different in the west than in the rest of the country.  For example, a man with 20 cows and a milking machine will not qualify for these grants but a man hand milking the same 20 cows will qualify.  Is that not totally illogical?  That is very unsuitable for farmers in the west because many of them have 20 cows or fewer.  I am asking the Minister of State to have another look at these schemes and to readjust them.  We all know that when schemes come into operation loopholes appear, but we must be flexible and change the inflexible attitude in the Department.  Many young farmers in dairying find themselves in a very serious situation because of the quotas which were not delivered by the Minister in the recent negotiations.</P>
    <P>I am worried that there was a reduction this year of 2 per cent in the budget available to An Foras Talúntais, which in real terms is a reduction of 7 per cent.  I tell the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, that we do not want to see the sheep project, the mixed farming project under the Agricultural Institute at Blindwell or the activities in Belclare either closed down or eroded next year or the year after as happened at Maam Cross a couple of years ago.  The Agricultural Institute have done tremendous work for this country and have not been given that opportunity under this Government.  Under the farm taxation scheme they should have used the institute's expertise.  I am asking the Minister, the Minister of State and the Government tonight to stop cutting back on agricultural development, to ensure proper investments and proper incentives for AFT and ACOT, the agencies that are there to service agriculture, and that, above all, there are incentives and support mechanism for the farmers to sustain them on the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be bitty and unco-ordinated because of pressure of time.  I was away from the House. I have some remarks to make.  I have <Col N="791" /> read not all of the Minister's speech but as much of it as I could get through and I find no great <i>sursum corda</i> in it or any great message of hope so necessary for the agricultural industry at present.  The Minister states that there was a 10 per cent drop in incomes in 1985.  It is well for the House to be aware of one of the dangers of statistics in this regard.  The 10 per cent is a lumped figure.  I am not challenging it; I am saying simply that the principles upon which it is based very often do not apply to individual cases.  As it is an average, you can take it that many people, very often those who can least afford it, have been affected to a far greater extent than the 10 per cent drop the Minister mentions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had occasion to speak for four minutes here in the House on a motion put down by our spokesman, Deputy Noonan of Limerick, with regard to the bad weather and how it affected my area.  The briefing which the public representatives got from ACOT in my county was thorough and of the highest quality.  We know that the bad weather in that area had disastrous effects and that small farmers who have been encouraged to increase production have mortgaged their creamery cheques to the end of 1987.  The co-operatives who enabled them to do that deserve the praise of this House.  They adopted an attitude which was not as harsh as that of the financial institutions, particularly the banks, and consequently kept people from total disaster when they needed that relief very much.  I would like to put that on the record of the House.  However, how are those people going to live when they will not have the substances of their cheques coming to them right through the remainder of 1986 and 1987?  I agree with the Minister that we do not know what the weather will bring in 1986, but people should realise, particularly those who are <i>au fait</i> with what happens in farming, that a farmer can be up and doing, energetic, working seven days a week, doing everything right in accordance with proper principles and in the end he can suffer defeat.  That cannot happen in any other <Col N="792" /> business and it is well that this House should advert to that fact.  If the rules are followed, if proper procedures are adopted in most other businesses, at least the business can be saved; but a farmer can do all the things properly, apply the most modern scientific principles in his business and still go down because he is totally dependent on the weather.</P>
    <P>We should think back to 1972 when we campaigned to join the EC and our thesis was that the CAP would sustain our economy and that there would be damage in other areas.  I remember quoting Parnell to farmers in late 1972 or early 1973, telling them to keep a firm grip on their homesteads because they were increasing in value as time went on.  That was true only in the context of the maintenance of the CAP and I am afraid serious damage has been done to it.  We are blaming the Minister and he will have to accept part of the blame anyway for that because we are only at the beginning of the attack on the CAP.  The UK is going to take over now in the Council of Ministers and we have never seen an attack like the one that is coming up now.  We should be prepared to face it bluntly with whatever weapons.  We are weak numerically but we have certain structures in the Treaty of Rome that will help us and we should use them to the full even if we are accused of being impossible.  Do not forget that the present British Prime Minister was regarded as outside the pale of all reason when she fought about the contributions to the EC but, damn it, whatever you say about her, she stuck with it and succeeded in the end.  We will have to do that regarding the CAP, particularly in the phase that is starting now.  We have lost a battle or two; we must not lose the war, and this House should be alerted to that.  We gambled in 1972 on the basis of the CAP.</P>
    <P>We had a car assembly industry at the time.  We knew that that would be phased out and we were told that we would have cheaper cars.  That would make a cat laugh in the context of the price of cars here today.  We had a boot and shoe industry and a textile industry, all those areas have been hammered and lost. West Germany is very good at producing <Col N="793" /> cars and she has 320 million people now among whom to compete for the sale of her cars.  Italy is very good at making shoes and has 320 million people to whom to sell her shoes.  We are very good in agriculture and particularly in some areas of it.  Despite consumer preference on that as the Minister mentioned, we are very good there and we should concerntrate on our strength in that area even specialising in organic farming or whatever. We have the circumstances in which we can specialise.  The Commission are becoming very arrogant at times and they have their role in the Treaty of Rome, but in more areas than agriculture they are developing certain fascist tendencies that both the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers will have to watch very carefully in future.  We could win in the EC only if the CAP was maintained in its pristine figure from which we gained advantage early on.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, a genial, civilised man, speaking in my constituency about West Germany paying many of the bills and not being satisfied.  I have pointed out already why they should be satisfied with economic conditions in the EC.  They have a powerfully big market for their industrial products.  When we were last discussing agriculture, that very week <i>The Economist</i> was quoting the cost of the butter mountain, part of which we were selling off to the USSR then, as a couple of hundred million dollars.  That 80,000 tonnes were coming from where? &mdash; West Germany.  Eleven thousand tonnes were coming from the UK and only 9,000 were coming from this country.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we are good at producing beef, lamb, milk and butter and we do not need soya or manioc or other factory type feeds for our cattle.  Along that line we should try to convey to the Council of Ministers, the commission and the Parliament that, if the main purpose of the EC was to bring up marginal areas to the same economic strength as the central areas, then we see that as a way of doing it.</P>
    <P>We lost out on the assembly of cars, <Col N="794" /> although admittedly it was an artificial industry and people wanted to get rid of it in the belief that they would get cheaper cars, but that did not happen because of Government action.  We have lost employment in firms which produced industrial goods, cars, shoes and clothes and, therefore, we should be allowed to specialise in an area in which we are successful.</P>
    <P>In today's newspapers I saw a report of huge bank profits, although they pay peanuts to anybody who is lucky enough to have money on deposit.  They charge very high rates to the unfortunate farmers who look for money at present.  Bank rates are coming down but not quickly enough for borrowers.  I often recall what the late Frank Aiken suggested in the thirties&mdash;of course he was called a Communist &mdash; the suggestion of forcing institutions to provide money for productive purposes at low rates of interest.  Admittedly, you might run into trouble in regard to a free market economy and so on, but desperate situations require desperate remedies.  I would not be beyond supporting a policy of that kind.</P>
    <P>If countries were allowed to specialise in areas they are good at, there is a possibility of developing such a policy.  The Commissioners are behaving very arrogantly in many ways and even <i>ultra vires</i> of the Treaty of Rome because they are supposed to be a kind of brains trust, an arsenal of ideas.  The Parliament has power to dismiss them, although I know it would be reluctant to exercise such a power in the normal course of events.</P>
    <P>The officials in the Department of Agriculture should go to West Germany now and look at the areas taken in by that country as a result of prices which were fixed in 1986.  They should look at the land in Bavaria and report back.  They already have elaborated a definition, for the purposes of taxation, of a certain type of acre.  I forget the technical name for it but it is judged as a percentage of what the best acre in the country will produce. There should be freedom of movement and inspection.  It is only the Russians and Americans who squabble about <Col N="795" /> inspecting nuclear sites, we should be able to look at the areas in West Germany which have now been declared severely disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>Today I received a small booklet in relation to the Land Commission.  It was disastrous for my area to do away with the commission and a recipe for denudation in certain areas of my constituency and of the west in general.  The Land Commission should be retained with powers to possess land and to distribute it in accordance with the cold judgments which they used for 100 years.  I know that it is difficult for the Minister to cope with across the board opposition from the UK and West Germany.  When Schmidt was Chancellor we had better friends in West Germany than now, although he should have been more interested in the industrial worker and Chancellor Kohl should be interested in the farming community. The Minister should not lose heart because of constant opposition. Psychologically it must be difficult to keep fighting from a small base against the big battalions.  However, it will have to be done now in the same way as the British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, fought about contributions.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a change in consumer preference but there is a lot of codswallop talked about that.  The consumption of butter could be maintained despite all the jargon about its being bad for people.  It is only bad for people who do not take exercise and who have a certain lifestyle.  An energetic lifestyle will work off any hazards which may exist although these hazards have not been proven as well as the manufacturers of alternative products claim.  I referred to this several times already, a different lifestyle will solve that problem and I do not think that any expert on health would disagree with that thesis.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he is intent on encouraging processing.  I am always very pleased to see a whole range of special cheeses from different parts of the country in delicatessens.  The St. Killian cheese comes from Wexford.  There is a Burren cheese and one from Cork.  De <Col N="796" /> Gaulle said something about a country with 157 cheeses, I cannot go through that lot.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>He mentioned 365 cheeses, one for every day of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the figure is under 200.  Anyway, he said it was difficult to run a country which produced so many cheeses.  I should like to be part of a Government ruling a country with 100 or 50 cheeses, which is not the case at present.  The Regata cheese was an excellent example of co-operation between University College, Cork and Mitchelstown. It was doing very well for a while but sales have now declined.  I saw it in the market in Greece and the Greeks liked it.  Southern Italians were also eating it.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to disease eradication. I put down a question recently regarding statistics on bovine TB and I was horrified at the reply.  In regard to brucellosis, my county was far worse than County Monaghan. The farmers are appalled at what happened in regard to the eradication of bovine TB.  If the Minister thinks that by withdrawing funds he will improve the position and can prove that, well and good, but I cannot see how that will work. Stern, tough financed action can be brought to bear on this very serious problem.  It is a mess and the Public Expenditure Committee are looking at this matter, which gets more and more confusing as time goes by.</P>
      <P>At one stage our lamb was received very well on the Paris market and was cherished as being succulent and something special.  However, it has now gone down in the reckoning of the French market.  I would be ruthless as far as exports to a market as prestigious as Paris is concerned.  There is an obligation on a Government Department, Córas Tráchtála, or Córas Beostoic to do something about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the thesis which I outlined, we should be allowed to get ahead with what we do best and others should be allowed to get ahead with what they do best.  It should not be too difficult <Col N="797" /> to co-ordinate.  We had factory farms. There was big money available for cereals and there was big production in the East Anglia and north and north-west of Paris. When things level off and that kind of thing goes out, I might even see hope in restriction of production if the people involved in the factory farms got out and left more of a market for the Irish dairy industry in the future.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I had not more time to prepare this.  I just want to repeat the two basics I mentioned.  First, a determined effort should be made to deal with the high interest rates small farmers have to cope with at the moment, having already mortgaged their future income for over a year in some instances.  Second, if Germany can extend the severely disadvantaged areas we should face up to it and do it, and to hell with the consequences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister appreciated what my colleague, Deputy Wilson, said.  He clearly enunciated the problems of agriculture.  I hope he will do something to remedy those problems which are devastating the agricultural scene in out island.  It is sad that, at a time when other people are looking for increases in their income, farmers lost an average of 15 to 16 per cent in theirs.  If that happened in any other sector of our society there would be a massive public outcry.  This Government seem to have forgotten that we are primarily an agricultural nation and that, when agriculture goes badly, the whole economy is adversely affected.  I am not just talking about the income which would accrue to farmers but about the spin-off effects which transcend the whole economic structure of the country; many people who are not intrinsically involved in agriculture itself do extremely well financially if agriculture is going well.  The Minister has pleaded how well he has contested our case with his European fellow Ministers, but it is a fact of life which is acknowledged by most experts on the agricultural scene that the Government are presiding over the apparent dismantling of the Common Agricultural Policy <Col N="798" /> and this will be grossly detrimental to the eventual recovery of agriculture here.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Government have not fought their way properly in Europe. He must stand up to his fellow Ministers, and be intransigent rather than defensive. If the Minister had fought in this way we would have done much better.  The Common Agricultural Policy is being dismantled and if this happens it will wreck our agricultural prospects.  I believe also that the banking institutes have been grossly irresponsible in their dealings with farmers.  Not too long ago farmers armed with licences, from the same banks in many cases, were out bidding against each other and driving the price of agricultural land over the roof with the advisers advising the farmers how valuable the land would ultimately be, that £4,000 an acre was not unrealistic and would produce a profit in due course.  Many farmers went ahead and purchased land at prices which were grossly high by present day standards.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the same banks are now instituting proceedings against thousands of farmers.  In my part of the country many farmers are receiving psychiatric treatment because of the effects of Government policy which has reduced their incomes so severely and because the banks are chasing them as if they were criminals.  That is a sad day for the country.  There is a lot of poverty as a result of the huge level of unemployment. What many people do not realise is that we have a new poor amongst whom are many farmers, some of whom bought land at hugely inflated prices and are having to pay back an inordinate amount of interest.  They are not able to cope with this because their income has been reduced so much in the last few years. The Government should exercise pressure on the banks to lay off these people and stop crucifying them and give them a chance.  With a better Government, which, hopefully, we will have in the not too distant future, those farmers will once again be able to pay their way and will not be reduced to the state of penury they are in now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="799" /> Deputy Wilson mentioned the disadvantaged areas.  We all welcomed the change from the old system of defining disadvantaged areas so that now townlands are taken into account.  But I would point out that many townlands are excluded.  The Minister may regard south Tipperary as one of the wealthiest agricultural counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>While he lives down the road in a not too poor county, with reasonably good land, there are areas in south Tipperary where the land is very mountainy and boggy.  One can have adjoining townlands one of which is regarded as disadvantaged and the other, should be so regarded, ignored.  On his next visit to south Tipperary, I hope the Minister will do a mountain and bog tour and I could show him the discrepancies and anomalies that arise.  He might then take me on a tour of Waterford to show me the magnificent job that he was able to do in his own county and constituency with regard to deciding on the disadvantaged areas.  I admire the degree of expertise used in Waterford.  I have no doubt that the Minister will get great political credit for it which I am sure he hopes will be turned to polling advantage in due course.  I would like him to share these benefits with his less fortunate colleagues in adjoining counties who must suffer as a result of some of the decisions.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission have now been reduced to such an ineffective status that they no longer operate as we knew them to.  As a consequence, many thousands of acres of land are now going into the hands of people who are other than farmers and who will not use the land for agricultural purposes, or for purposes allied to and associated with that industry.  This is rather sad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the quota system, particularly in relation to milk, it is regrettable that, although the Minister promised us in 1984 that there would be no further reductions in the quota system, <Col N="800" /> this promise has not been adhered to. This is another major reflection on the Government.  I hope that the Minister will fight that issue more strenuously on his future European excursions.  The reduction in the milk quotas has had a particularly adverse effect on many young developing farmers who had planned to avail of the opportunity to increase their productivity but who have been seriously disadvantaged financially by the reduction in the quota.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if the Minister was taking credit for the fine weather.  I was wondering if he was a better negotiator with the Almighty than he has been with his fellow colleagues in Europe.  Thank God the weather is good.  That will benefit agriculture, as the Minister said.  He suggested that would be better than any aid support system.  However, we need a considerable amount of support as well, much more than we have been getting.  If the Minister is claiming credit for the fine weather, I hope that he will keep on his knees for a few months longer to ensure that we will have a better summer than last year's.</P>
    <P>I hope he takes cognisance of the various points raised by Members on this side of the House, made in good faith in the interests of agriculture, not just for the sake of expressing political bias or gaining political advantage, These were made in a helpful fashion, to give some added inspiration, hoping that the Minister will recognise that when he makes these major steps to recover the agricultural economy, if he does it in the proper way, he will have the full support of Members on this side of the House.  We all wish the agricultural economy to be restored to what it was in the past.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> What policy has the Minister within his Department and what plans has he to <Col N="801" /> improve the quality of the animals and ultimately the products which will be exported and to which he referred in his speech, particularly in regard to lamb? Would it be possible, even at this late stage, for him to reintroduce the AI subsidy so that farmers can have access to proven sires?  These are now totally out of reach of small farmers because of the costs involved.  With regard to the breeding Act brought in a couple of years ago by the Minister, Deputy Hegarty, concerning a special category of bulls, I hope the use of these bulls will be allowed for a couple of years.  This is a welcome step in the right direction.  We are now to a large extent breeding from dairy herds and the conformation is not as it should be.  This is not commanding the same price or support as it should on the markets. A re-introduction of the AI subsidy would be a way to obtain better results.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hegarty is Minister of State with responsibility for food processing, but this is an attempt to counter our proposals.  I hope the committee involved will get away from the intervention mentality and broaden our range of product. In order to do this, the grants which were cut with regard to An Foras Talúntais and ACOT, but particularly the former, must be reintroduced.  This would enable these bodies to carry out research and development into a new range of products. We are inclined to produce products which we think the consumer requires rather than giving the consumer what she wants.  We have neglected that area.  We should broaden our total range of products. I hope we will have an opportunity to get into other markets outside the EC, into third countries and world markets generally.  The markets are there and we have the products.  We are falling down on marketing and presenting our products with a clean image of this country, a country that is not polluted.  I hope the committee now being presided over by the Minister, Deputy Hegarty, will follow that up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I wish to speak about alternative farm enterprises.  We are penalised for over-production in Europe for which we are not responsible.  We should look at <Col N="802" /> areas of alternative enterprises.  I spoke earlier about farmhouse tourism and deer farming.</P>

      <P>The position in regard to the quality and the sales of lamb is very complicated.  Deputy Wilson said that our lamb is succulent and in great demand on the French market.  The French market is almost our total export market. Unfortunately, it is not true to say that our lamb is in tremendous demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of reasons, the primary one being that our lamb, by and large, is too fat for the continental consumer.  We encounter this difficulty with regard to lamb and beef all over the Continent.  The quality of our lamb and beef is excellent.  Continentals just will not accept fatty meat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>They are right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of us tend to like a bit of fat or grizzle with lean meat.  It tends to give it a taste.  We produce lamb <Col N="803" /> on a 50-50 basis, 50 per cent for home consumption and 50 per cent for export. The farmer producing lamb is always toying with the idea of whether he should produce a heavy lamb for the home market or a lean lamb for the Paris market.  Unfortunately, while they should be reared on a 50-50 basis with those markets in mind, I have come across quite a number of farmers who prepared nice, lean lamb for the Paris market only to find that, when it was ready for that market, the market was closed.  The French have a bad manner of closing the market when they feel like it, when there is plenty of French lamb coming on stream.  It is a difficult position. The two positions should be weighed up.</P>
      <P>I am dissatisfied with the quantity of over-fat lamb which is produced here. We have been asking the farming organisations for some time past to partake in a voluntary classification scheme whereby good lean lamb would get a premium rate.  They will not agree because it involves a contribution of 5p to 10p per lamb. That is unfortunate because we need that classification system if we are to get the best prices on the French market.  I hope, even at this late stage, that we can reach agreement with the farming organisations. I appeal to them to partake in the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of course we would. I have been telling them it is for their own good.  The other problem in the French market is the massive amount of lamb going into that market from Britain.  It is unprecedented.  The British have their act together as regards sheep in a very big and positive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their lambing rate is excellent.  They <Col N="804" /> have a rate of almost 1.7 or 1.8 lambs per ewe.  Our rate is about 1.1.  They have massive flocks of sheep of brilliant quality.</P>

My second priority would be to bring back a lime subsidy.  The AI subsidy is a bit down the road.  I am just giving those priorities off the top of my head.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked about the pig industry and the suggestion that there would be five or six slaughtering centres over the whole country.  How will the locations be chosen?  How far ahead of us is this, or is it imminent?  I asked about the grading system also.  We have a system of grade A specials, grade As and grade Bs at present.  How do they fit into the new prospective European grading system which, I presume, is what we are talking about.  If the Minister has information on how our quality compares with European quality in regard to pork and bacon I would like to hear it.</P>
      <P>I was brought up in the belief that everything which came out of Denmark was especially good.  That was at the time the Danish economy was mainly agricultural. It is now mainly industrial.  From my own experience of living in London, where there was a good deal of Danish bacon on the market, it was not all that good.  Their superiority was not evident to me.  I do not know about pork, but I am sure the Minister and his Department have information with regard to quality in that area.  We have reasonably good quality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  I have said this previously, and I will say it again: the quality of Irish bacon is the best in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that about our land, our land is too flat.  Pig breeders in this country are unequalled in their skill. That is accepted in the trade.  We have the best pig producers in the world, brilliant. Where we fall flat on our faces is in the quality of our processing plants.  Many of them are a disgrace.  I do not believe there is one pigmeat plant in the whole of Ireland which is licensed to export <Col N="806" /> to the United States.  That is a terrible indictment of our business acumen.</P>
      <P>Having said that, a number of very prominent business interests have shown a major interest in recent times in setting up of top class plants.  As late as yesterday and today I had three major concerns in this country coming in to meet me to discuss their plans for the future in this regard.  While the bacon and pigmeat industry is in the doldrums at present I can see an immediate improvement or at least an indication of an improvement.  A concession which we received in Europe three weeks ago is of considerable importance in this regard.  Up to now in the eastern half of Ireland the FEOGA grant was only 25 per cent.  One would get as much as an additional 25 per cent from the IDA.  We got a commitment from the Agricultural Commissioner that he will now give a FEOGA grant of 50 per cent in all parts of Ireland.  I will be asking the IDA to give the maximum 25 per cent grant on top of the 50 per cent. This will make a total of 75 per cent.  That is why these people are coming in and showing huge interest.  It is a massive grant, everyone will agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The IDA will give generous grants to people who want to process, as long as they participate in the new and better quality slaughtering facilities.  The Deputy asked about impending legislation for pork butchers, many of whom are carrying out operations in totally unsanitary conditions.  I circulated the headings of a Bill recently to include pork butchers in the same type of system as we have for bacon curers &mdash; in other words, everybody killing pigs and processing pigs in this country will have the same rules.  The bacon curers have been asking for this for the last three or four years.  It is very complicated legislation.  Much of it has to be repealed and much of it goes back to the middle of the last century and even further.  We have it all in place and I expect that in the next session of the Dáil this legislation <Col N="807" /> will go through and bring everybody who is killing pigs under the same terms of reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the people who contributed to the debate.  There were some excellent contributions, some critical, and some constructive.  A debate such as this is very helpful.  I want, as briefly as possible, to pick off some of the points which were brought up.</P>
      <P>First of all, Deputy Prendergast made a point about off-farm incomes and he asserted &mdash; I was not here when he spoke but I got a note &mdash; that TDs and Senators were getting headage payments because their allowances were not taken into consideration when off-farm income was being assessed.  I would like to make it quite clear that I only became aware of this fact some months ago.  Apparently, it was brought in in the late seventies. Immediately I became aware of it I gave a direction in my Department that the payments to TDs and Senators were to be stopped.  They have been stopped.  I saw misrepresentation in the media recently.  Perhaps the media are not aware that those payments have been stopped.  I could not justify them.  I do not think anyone could.  I have seen reports of meetings held in certain parts of the country where people have been complaining about them.  Those payments are no longer being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much reference was made to disadvantaged areas and the extension Germany got recently.  People should bear in mind that that was the first review of its disadvantaged areas.  Last year, we completed our fourth review.  Germany is not a country of excellent land.  Some of it is good, but some of it is also mountain, forest and peatland.  Fifty per cent of the Federal Republic of Germany is classified as disadvantaged.  Sixty-eight per cent of Ireland is classified as disadvantaged.  We are not doing too badly.  The recent <Col N="808" /> review, the fourth, increased the amount tremendously.  It was the greatest addition of all by far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that adding the severely to the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, to the less severe, but most of ours is severely.  It is grand to say that I should go out and get the whole of Ireland classified as disadvantaged, but there are criteria we have got to fulfil before we can be classified as disadvantaged. We got a lot in the last time which was borderline.  I do not mind saying that. Anything which I thought could be pushed in, I pushed it in.  Therefore, it is not quite as straightforward as one might think.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartin made a very sensible and down to earth contribution.  Basically, what he said is this.  Europe does not owe us a living.  We have got to go out and earn it.  We get the type of attitude in this country that they owe us a living. We have got to work for it.  What we have got in Europe is the greatest opportunity that any agricultural country in the world could wish for.  That is what we have.  We have a market of 320 million people to which we have free access.  There are no tariffs, prohibitions or barriers, and we should be able to exploit that market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy McCartin so rightly pointed out, we should be able to sell everything we produce in that market.  We are living dangerously.  I keep saying&mdash;and I think the message is getting home &mdash; that we are too dependent on third country markets which are extremely volatile.  We are much too dependent on intervention, producing commodities which cannot be sold within Europe and which have to be almost given away at the end of the day. We are in an extremely vulnerable position and we have nobody to blame but ourselves.  We have been members of the EC over 13 years, and we knew almost ten years previously that we were joining. Therefore, we can hardly complain after over 20 years that we were not prepared. We had that length of time to gear ourselves to that market.  The Danes joined with us in 1973.  They do not have a <Col N="809" /> problem with intervention with regard to beef, butter or any other commodity. They make things which they can sell.  The Danish Minister said to me last year that his farmers were demanding that they be allowed to import milk because they did not have sufficient to manufacture cheese to fill the markets they had all over the world.  I must say I was somewhat shamefaced at being told that.  Here we still convert 80 per cent of our milk into butter and we can hardly give it away.</P>
    <P>Let us face up to the facts of life.  We are not making the best of our opportunities. We should be able to sell everything we produce within that market.  If any of those countries run into financial difficulty &mdash; and it is very much on the cards, let us admit it&mdash;why should we go behind the bush?  The price of oil has been halved, their incomes have dropped dramatically, and if they cannot afford to buy our produce we shall be in further trouble.  We have got to get out and sell.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson made a point: that we are very good at producing agricultural commodities.  There is a degree of truth in that, but it is not the full story.  Our land is easily capable of sustaining twice as many cattle as we have at present, and we have had since we entered the EEC approximately the same amount.  We have not increased our cattle numbers despite all the incentive schemes.  We have about the same number as we had in 1973 or 1974.  That is an area in which we could effect improvement.</P>
    <P>We spoke about lamb.  The quality is not as good as it should be.  I spoke about milk.  We produce 5½ per cent of total EC production, but we are not converting it into the right products.  We are good at producing a certain commodity, but one thing we are definitely not good at &mdash; and I meet this everywhere I travel, in Europe or wherever &mdash; we are poor at promoting ourselves and we are exceptionally poor at marketing, with exceptions.  We have the best quality produce one could ask for and we cannot sell it.  We have to dump it into stores.  It is sold off to Russia, Cuba and other countries perhaps two or three years later.  If we fall down badly anywhere it is in our ability to sell.  What <Col N="810" /> we need are more salesmen to go out and do the job.  Over the past three and a half years I have seen some of our meat processors progress from subsistence level to making profit.  They are now making a lot of money because they are producing the right type of meat and are going out and selling it themselves.  One will see them in places like Teheran. Baghdad or Cairo.  They are not sending boys out to do the selling for them, they are going out themselves.  They deserve tremendous credit.  If everybody in agriculture in this country had that type of attitude we would not have a problem.  If we need anything it is marketing ability.</P>
    <P>There are two other points I might make.  Some Deputies made a point that our farm incomes last year were very low. I am not apologising for farm incomes last year.  Any fair-minded person &mdash; I say this when I travel around the country and meet farmers &mdash; realises that we have had 21 months of brutal weather, since September 1984.  They appreciate that the Government cannot do the impossible. Farmers have had a terrible time. We all understand and realise that.  They realise it.  I have never seen people so depressed.  I have never seen such despair.  It is difficult for everybody, but they realise that there is not a whole lot one can do about it.  But despite all that, farm incomes in 1985, while considerably lower than those of 1984 &mdash; but remember that 1984 was an exceptional year &mdash; in real terms were better than any other year in the eighties with the exception of 1984.  That is a startling statistic.  People are inclined not to believe it, but the figures are there to prove it: 1985 was better, despite the weather being so awful, and the farm income situation was better than any other year in the eighties with the exception of 1984.</P>
    <P>People complain about New Zealand butter coming into the Community.  Likewise they complain about the importation of cereal substitutes.  Nobody would be happier than I to see all of these imports stopped, but I would like Members of this House to realise that we are part of the biggest trading bloc in the world. When one goes to tell the Germans or <Col N="811" /> the British that imports of butter from New Zealand should be stopped immediately, they will reply: &ldquo;This Community is financed on the money we make from trading.  We sell our cars, washing machines and consumer goods all over the world.  Trade is a two-way system.  We export; therefore, we have to import&rdquo;. Some countries have nothing but agricultural commodities with which to trade. Therefore, it is not as simplistic as saying that one puts up the doors and stops things from coming in; one has got to trade and we benefit from that trade.</P>
    <P>Last year the net benefit from the EC in our agricultural sector was £900 million. What would we do without it?  We would be a damn sight worse off if we did not have it.  I know that traditional industries went to the wall.  We knew that before we joined the Community; but we have reaped huge benefits and we should be reaping even greater benefits.  We are in a trading bloc.  Those commodities were coming into the Community before we joined.  When we signed the Treaty of Accession in 1973 we agreed to allow New Zealand butter to be imported. Before we joined the Community cereal substitutes were being imported, and had been imported since the early sixties. They are being imported under the GATT, which is a legally binding obligation between the two communities involved; one cannot break it unilaterally.  For God's sake, let us be realistic.  It is pie in the sky to say we will stop this and we will stop that.  We must think of the net benefit we are getting.  We must realise that there are legal obligations in these trading arrangements.  Therefore, this talk of balance sheets and renegotiation is great stuff for the gallery but not terribly realistic.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson made a point that the British will assume the Presidency of the EC on 1 July and that they will endeavour to dismantle the CAP.  Being President of the EC merely means that one chairs the meetings.  The Presidency does not take the decisions.  It is the same ball game whether the British have the Presidency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy John P. Wilson has given permission to raise on the Adjournment the structural collapse of Cavan courthouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment of the House.  I would first like to set the scene with regard to Cavan courthouse in order to indicate to the Dáil what is involved in this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cavan courthouse dates from 1828.  It was designed by the architect John Boden in a street which one could call a street of character.  Boden also designed the Protestant parish church directly opposite. The Chair knows the street very well <Col N="813" /> as being an elegant one.  We also have in that street a tastefully restored home for Bord Fáilte.  It has a certain style about it and consequently it is important that the courthouse should be restored to its original state.  There is in the same street a neo-Renaissance style cathedral which has been widely criticised.  For all those reasons, including the 19th century houses of similar character, there is an obligation on people who have responsibility in this regard to see to it that the courthouse is restored.</P>
    <P>We happen to have in the county the foremost expert on the restoration of houses and in publishing accounts of both public and private buildings in this and other countries.  He is a recognised authority and has a certain amount of missionary zeal with regard to this subject.  I refer to Mr. Patrick Shaffrey and his wife, who is also an architect.  They have published widely on these types of buildings and their restoration.</P>
    <P>Quite recently the markethouse in Monaghan was restored and Patrick Shaffrey was the architect.  The markethouse in Bailieborough was also beautifully restored.  The old plaster was cut away, the beautiful clean stone was exposed, the building was pinned up and so on.  This is a trend into which the restoration of Cavan courthouse would fit very neatly.</P>
    <P>This courthouse, built in the late 1820s, has been giving cause for concern for some time and the county registrar for Cavan has been warning about it.  His offices are there and it housed the District Court and the Circuit Court.  The court clerk also had offices there, as had the county manager and county council officials.  It was a multi-purpose building but there is no court there now.  The warnings of the county registrar were not heeded and we were exceptionally lucky that there was not a serious tragedy in the place.  The Circuit Court is now being held in Bailieborough and the District Court is moving from one place to another.  It was in the Protestant hall for a while and is now housed in the town <Col N="814" /> hall, which was tastefully restored recently.</P>
    <P>The dangers that were being highlighted by the county registrar impacted also on the County Cavan solicitors' association.  The President, Mr. Peter Fitzpatrick, and the secretary Mr. Cusack, and their solicitor, Mr. John V. Kelly, took action in the High Court because they felt so strongly about it. They were trying to compel the Minister for Justice to put the courthouse into a proper state of repair.  That was a couple of years ago.  In December 1984 the High Court made a conditional order of <i>mandamus</i> against the Minister for Justice requiring him to do just that.  Mr. Justice McWilliam was the judge involved and he retired in 1985.  The Chief State Solicitor's office made all kinds of wet excuses and dry excuses about getting on with what the court decided should be done.</P>
    <P>Finally the Department came up with plans and they were costed by the quantity surveyor.  The costs were frighteningly high as far as the county council were concerned.  They were right to be frightened if it was intended that the county council should pay fully for the cost of restoration.  I maintain that they should not and I will make that point later on.  The county council saw themselves in the position of not being funded properly to provide the services which by statute they are bound to provide.  Consequently they felt frustrated and angry to a certain extent and they were worried about the whole prospect.</P>
    <P>About January this year the High Court made the order absolute.  This order directed the Minister for Justice with the Minister for Finance to put the court accommodation into a proper state of repair.  We must not forget that their specific interests were the courts, Circuit and District.  There was also the question of accommodation for the county registrar, the district clerk, the county manager and council officials.  It was a multifaceted problem.  The High Court made absolute the order of <i>mandamus</i> demanding that the Ministers for Justice and Finance should put the courthouse into a proper state of repair.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="815" /> Mr. Justice McWilliam dealt with the case originally and when he died and the case went back to the court, it was dealt with by Mr. Justice Lynch.</P>

      <P>I did not mean to imply that because I know that he is alive.  He has retired, and I am glad he is alive; he is a neighbour's child.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that the attitude of the Chief State Solicitor's Office with the wet and dry excuses continued.  There was dilatoriness, delay, shuffling, backpedalling and no honest facing up to what the High Court had demanded should be done.  Mr. Justice Lynch obviously saw this and he asked to see the order the Minister for Justice gave to the OPW to proceed.  He also indicated that the association representing the solicitors should get a copy of that order.</P>
      <P>Up to today nothing has been done and that underlines my point that there is a lot of backsliding and failure to face up to the order of the court.  On 12 February last I put down a question to the Minister for Justice about the courthouse and it was reported at column 2438, volume 363, of the Official Report.  The following is the quotation from the Official Report:</P>
      <P>Mr. Wilson asked the Minister for Justice the present position with regard to the provision of courthouse accommodation in Cavan Town.</P>
      <P>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East): Consequent to the making absolute by the High Court of a conditional Order of Mandamus and under the authority of section 6 (1) (a) of the Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935, I recently directed the Commissioners for Public Works to execute such repairs and to do such other works as may be necessary or proper to put the court accommodation at Farnham Street, Cavan into proper repair or condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> Lawyers tell us that clear words do not need interpretation and those words could not be clearer, but up to this moment nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>I understand that the matter will be before the court again on 28 July but in the time between the two court appearances something pretty disastrous has happened.  The warnings of the county registrar went unheeded, the order of the High Court went unheeded and the next thing we heard about was a collapse in the court.  The issue of <i>The Anglo Celt</i> of 12 June carried a report of the incident and a big picture which this eager and anxious House wants to see.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not be able to exhibit the newspaper but I can refer to it <i>en passant</i>.  The newspaper carries a picture of the collapse in the chamber. The staff in the office of the county registrar, and the county registrar, county council officials, and the district court clerk and his staff were put at risk.  Fortunately the young man who had been sorting out ballot boxes for the forthcoming referendum in that area had gone to lunch.  I would not like to have been responsible for the delay that caused that collapse and it is not an exaggeration to say that people could have been killed. Had that happened people would have been very quick to look for those responsible and put the finger on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Danny Brady, Chairman of Cavan County Council, indicated to me today that a very short time before the collapse he had received Sir Peter Lawer, the Australian Ambassador, whom the Chair knows, in that place.  I do not wish to drum up sensationalism and I am giving cold facts.  Somebody could have been killed by what happened and that is not good enough.  On the question of funding I am aware that buildings in this country, like the courthouse in Cavan, which has a nice Doric facade, have been renovated with the aid of European funds.  The Cavan building is set well back from the street and is particularly suitable to its <Col N="817" /> surroundings.  I would regret if a decision were reached to abandon it altogether, as was suggested by some people.  In my opinion that building should and could attract some Euro funding.  It is in the nature of a national monument, a building of distinction that dates from 160 years back.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice, or the Department of Finance who are responsible for the OPW, whichever agency feel responsible, should research the possibility of getting Euro funding for the restoration of Cavan courthouse.  There is a Bill dealing with national monuments before this House or the Seanad and I am aware that there is a growing interest in that whole area.  Cavan courthouse would be a worthy building in that respect. Similar buildings have been renovated with the aid of European funds. As Minister for Education I was at the opening of what was formerly a Franciscan monastery as a craft centre in France.  It was because that building was part of the heritage of France and, consequently, the heritage of Europe, that Euro money was made available for that project.</P>
    <P>The county need help and the possibility of getting it from Europe should be explored.  Support is also needed from central Government.  In the circumstances that local authorities find themselves in, Cavan County Council's own funding should not have to be the major share of a restoration project.  I understand that a plan is ready and has been costed.  All that is needed is the fiat of the Minister and the financial support of the Government.  I should like to thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter and I hope there will be a positive reaction from the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wilson has outlined the position in regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935, local authorities are charged with the <Col N="818" /> responsibility to provide and maintain in their functional area such court accommodation as the Minister for Justice may direct.  In the event of the council failing to fulfil its obligation the Minister for Justice is empowered to direct the Commissioners of Public Works to put such courthouse accommodation into proper repair and condition.  Whenever the commissioners have done such works they are entitled to recover the costs and expenses incurred as a civil debt in any court of competent jurisdiction or by deduction by the Minister for Finance from any grant or moneys under his control payable to such council.</P>
    <P>The involvement of the Commissioners of Public Works in this matter commenced in December 1985 when they were made aware that on 2 December 1985 an order of <i>mandamus</i> had been granted by the High Court against the Minister for Justice directing that the court accommodation at Farnham Street, Cavan, should be put into proper repair and condition.  This order made absolute a conditional order made on 20 December 1983.</P>
    <P>Following consultation with the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Justice on 31 January 1986 formally directed the Commissioners of Public Works to execute such repairs and do such other work as may be necessary or proper to put the said accommodation into proper repair and condition.</P>
    <P>Cavan County Council had already prepared in 1983 a scheme of works at the courthouse which houses the court accommodation and the county offices. Tenders for the scheme which involved proposals for renovation and refurbishment of the building itself and the provision of an office block at the rere were received by the council in October 1985. The total cost of all the works; including fittings, furnishing and fees, was £2.7 million. This gave rise to problems of financing for the county council who had previously approved a lower estimate of £1 million.</P>
    <P>Following receipt of the instruction of the Minister for Justice, representatives of the commissioners with an officer of <Col N="819" /> the Department of Justice met members of Cavan County Council and the consultant architect.  Subsequently the proposed scheme of works was examined by the commissioners' architect who advised that the scheme provided a practical and economic solution to the accommodation problems of the court and the county council while at the same time preserving the main facade and walls with their classical features.  The cost was regarded as fair and reasonable.</P>
    <P>It was intimated that if the county council could secure favourable funding terms they would be in favour of proceeding with the scheme directly.  The commissioners' view was that in the event of the county council agreeing to proceed with the whole project they, the commissioners, would be agreeable to regard the county council as their agents for carrying out the works stipulated under the <i>mandamus</i> order.  The commissioners would assume a monitoring role in respect of those works.  The High Court would be advised accordingly.</P>
    <P>By letter dated 11 April 1986, Cavan County Council advised the commissioners that the council had agreed to proceed with the work on the basis of the plans prepared and the tenders received, and had authorised the raising of a supplementary loan which together with the original loan would make up the all-in cost of the scheme.  The council further advised that applications had been made <Col N="820" /> to the sponsoring Departments, that is, the Department of Justice and the Department of the Environment, to authorise the raising of the necessary funds.</P>
    <P>Subsequently these Departments sought the sanction of the Minister for Finance for the revised cost estimate of £2.7 million for the scheme.  Sanction was formally conveyed to them by letter of 11 June 1986.  The letter conveyed authority to enable the necessary arrangements to be made by Cavan County Council to borrow from the Local Loans Fund the proportion, 45 per cent of the cost relating to court accommodation and by way of direct loans the amount, 55 per cent &mdash; relating to the county offices.  It is not the policy of the Department of Finance to make money available from the Local Loans Fund for the purposes of county council accommodation.</P>
    <P>Once the financial arrangements have been made by the council the way should be clear for them to proceed with acceptance of a tender.  The matter is due for mention in the High Court on 28 July 1986 when a report on progress must be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied with the system currently in operation for the monitoring of drugs in this country.  The procedure for monitoring adverse effects of drugs is operated by the National Drugs Advisory Board on the basis of reports in standard form supplied by doctors, dentists and pharmacists.  Where necessary, these reports are followed up with the doctors concerned.  There are special monitoring arrangements in respect of congenital <Col N="635" /> abnormalities and their possible association with medicines.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the recent studies referred to by the Deputy, the results of which have been taken into account in deciding upon the precautions and warning statements for product leaflets which are required as a condition of the product licences issued by my Department. Because of these licensing arrangements, specific regulations are not necessary to require a listing of side effects on packets.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, these products are available only on prescription, which ensures that women have specific advice of a medical practitioner in addition to the printed information provided by the manufacturer in relation to risks and side effects.</P>
      <P>The more common side effects associated with the use of the contraceptive pill include headache, gastrointestinal upset, candidiasis, depression, thrombophlebitis, hypertension, breakthrough bleeding, weight changes, fluid retention, amenorrhoea, cleasma, breast changes.</P>
      <P>Side effects reported to the National Drugs Advisory Board in respect of the contraceptive pill during the years 1980 to 1985 inclusive totalled 110.  This information is included in the general reports of side effects associated with the use of drugs which are published by the National Drugs Advisory Board each year and circulated to all doctors, dentists and pharmacists.</P>

      <P>In the Eastern Health Board area there are 13 agencies providing services for <Col N="636" /> almost 4,000 people with mental handicap.</P>
      <P>Although there are a substantial number of places being provided both in the Eastern Health Board area and throughout the country I am aware that the services provided fall short of meeting all needs.  To identify this shortfall and to assist in finding a solution to the problem I have set up a small consultative group to examine the matter and to make recommendations to me.  The first meeting of the group took place on 11 June.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Eastern Health Board is currently examining requirements in its area in relation to mental handicap.  This examination is nearing completion and its findings will be considered as sympathetically as possible in the light of the resources available to me for the development of the mental handicap service.</P>
      <P>During 1984, despite the financial constraints, I approved of the opening of Cheeverstown House where there are ten residents and 124 people attending on a day basis.  More recently in January of this year I approved of the opening of St. Michael's House day care unit at Belcamp, County Dublin.  This unit, when fully operational will cater for 70 mentally handicapped adults.  Both of these services will alleviate the present need for day care services for the adult mentally handicapped in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
      <P>The person referred to in the Deputy's question is on the health board's waiting list for residential care and is at present attending an adult day care unit.

      <P>The Special Governmental Task Force on Drug Abuse recognised the importance of developing a drug prevention programme specifically targeted at our youth population.  The task force considered that such a programme would be most effective if implemented through the schools.</P>
      <P>In pursuance of the task force's recommendations in this area the Health Education Bureau and the Department of Education have co-operated closely in the production of materials for use in schools and in the organisation of appropriate workshops and seminars for teachers. Also, the bureau have been continuing their training programme for teachers in health education, including drug education, and about 1,600 teachers have been through this programme to date.  Both organisations are currently involved in producing additional materials for schools and have organised a further summer course for teachers on drug education for July of this year.</P>
      <P>Specifically in the context of youth clubs and related activities, the Health Education Bureau have recently produced a resource pack on substance abuse in conjunction with the National Youth Council of Ireland.  The bureau funded the production of 1,000 copies of this pack which have already been distributed, mostly through training courses for youth leaders, and are currently funding a reprint.  This drug education-training programme is available to all youth groups through the National Youth Council.  The bureau plans to fund a more extensive training programme for youth leaders during this year and are awaiting a detailed submission from the National Youth Council in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Deputy will agree that all of these activities, which are being closely co-ordinated by the Health Education Bureau and the Department of Education, constitute an effective and comprehensive drug abuse prevention programme.

    <P>1.  All paediatric dose forms of aspirin will be confined to pharmacies, available on prescription only,</P>
    <P>2.  All aspirin-containing preparations will carry an additional warning on the pack&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This product should not be given to children, particularly those under 12 years of age, without medical advice&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The board has circularised doctors and pharmacists about these arrangements and about the background to them.  My Department was consulted by the board and I am satisfied that the action taken is appropriate to the situation.</P>

      <P>The primary emphasis on economy in the use of medicines is exercised through the General Medical Services (Payments) Board.  Doctors are alerted to their prescribing patterns in comparison with their peers and in the event of apparent excess prescribing by a particular doctor the matter is queried by the board.  Support to doctors in analysing their prescribing patterns is also being provided through special projects being funded by the General Medical Services (Payments) Board and the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board with my support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Primary responsibility for economy in the use of medicines rests, of course, with the prescribing doctors.  It is their responsibility to prescribe, appropriate to a patient's need, and to encourage the <Col N="643" /> patient to comply with the directions on prescriptions.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a scheme for the return from the public of unwanted unused medicines is not considered necessary at present in view of the ongoing programmes of the Health Education Bureau in encouraging public caution in the use of all drugs as part of its approach to substance abuse prevention and education.</P>

      <P>The number of hours which a non-consultant hospital doctor is rostered to serve is determined by his employing authority.</P>
      <P>An agreement reached between the medical organisations and the employing authorities provided that a non-consultant hospital doctor should not normally be rostered to serve more than 70 hours in any one week.  All employing authorities were notified of this provision in a circular issued by my Department in 1976.  Following recent discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation, my Department issued updated conditions of service for non-consultant hospital doctors on 6 June 1986.  These updated conditions also contain the provision that a non-consultant hospital doctor should not normally be rostered to serve more than 70 hours per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that, while the number of hours for which a non-consultant hospital doctor can be rostered to serve may appear excessive a distinction must be made between the time spent <Col N="644" /> actually working and the time during which the doctor is merely on-call and not actually working.  It can be the case, however, that some non-consultant hospital doctors may be rostered to serve for excessively long periods of time.</P>
    <P>In the main this would arise where one in two rotas are in operation.  However the Deputy will be pleased to hear that agreement has recently been reached with the Irish Medical Organisation on measures to eliminate such rotas where this is deemed to be practicable.  I am making the necessary resources available to enable this to be done.</P>

However, anti-tobacco health legislation has been in force in this country since 1979 and the industry has ample time to make plans for diversification which in fact they are doing as the Deputy will be aware.</P>
      <P>However, it is also a fact, employment in that industry is under great pressure from new technology being introduced by manufacturers.

      <P>I might emphasise that the investigation was initiated by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and, although I made a grant towards its costs, the organisation and carrying out of the project was primarily one for the council.</P>
      <P>I might add that the problem of child sexual abuse in the Eastern Health Board area, particularly the services required to deal with it, is at present receiving the attention of a special working group that I established a few months ago.

The plans for the development of family planning services prepared by the boards are still under discussion between my Department and the boards concerned.</P>
      <P>I am also aware that plans are in preparation for a considerable development in training of general practitioners in family planning matters and this will further enhance the availability of services. I am advised that the Eastern Health Board propose to hold a special meeting to discuss family planning matters in general within their area.  I am disappointed that it has not proved possible for the board to adopt a definitive statement of policy by this time.  However, the board are involved in a number of pilot schemes for the provision of family planning services and are actively analysing the extent of the availability of services from general practitioners, pharmaceutical chemists and other sources within their area.</P>

This plan includes the provision of a psychiatric unit and day hospital at Portlaoise General Hospital.  I have already approved the planning of purpose-built mental health centres at Tullamore and Birr which are an important component of the plan.  In addition a detailed survey of in-patients in St. Fintan's was carried out last December and the number of patients with potential for rehabilitation to community residences has been established.

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 55 of 28 November 1985 in which I outlined the steps which had been taken to implement the recommendations of the Special Governmental Task Force on Drug Abuse at that time.  These are, in effect, the measures being applied by the Government to counter drug addiction. The following is an outline of the progress which has been made in this area since my reply of 28 November 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Law Enforcement side, my Department, in consultation with the Attorney General's Office, is examining the possibility of introducing new legislation which would provide for the seizure and confiscation of the assets of drug traffickers.  In the area of customs control the arrangements at local level have been reviewed and strengthened in order to focus more directly on the importation of illicit drugs.  An <i>ad-hoc</i> group of local managers has been set up to facilitate the exchange of information on drug-related matters.  The drugs unit attached to the <Col N="649" /> investigation branch has been strengthened and the provision of futher detection equipment is being actively pursued.</P>
    <P>On the education side, the Health Education Bureau have recently produced a resource pack on substance abuse in conjunction with the National Youth Council of Ireland.  The bureau funded the production of 1,000 copies of this pack which have already been distributed, mostly through training courses for youth leaders, and are currently funding a reprint.  This drug education-training programme is available to all youth groups through the National Youth Council.  The bureau plans to fund a more extensive training programme for youth leaders during this year and are awaiting a detailed submission from the National Youth Council in this regard.</P>
    <P>The bureau, in conjunction with the Department of Education, have organised a further summer course for teachers on drug education to be held in July of this year.  They have also continued their training programme for teachers in health education (including drug education). Approximately 1,600 teachers have been through this training programme to-date and much of the activity in this area is focused on &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; urban areas.</P>
    <P>In relation to rehabilitation facilities, I was very glad to be able to make additional funds available to Coolemine Therapeutic Community to enable it to expand its induction centre in Lord Edward Street.  This building has now been completely refurbished and this has facilitated an expansion in the range of activities provided there.  Coolemine House, which was officially opened in March of this year, now accommodates an induction programme, a day programme, a family association, parents resource groups and a prevention programme.  It also acts as the administration centre for the community.</P>
    <P>In the area of youth services development, the Government's National Youth Policy was published on 30 December 1985 under the title <i>In Partnership With</i><Col N="650" /><i>Youth</i> and future action on the prevention of drug abuse in this area will be taken in the context of that policy.</P>
    <P>The National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse has continued to meet on a regular basis and to monitor the implementation of the task force's recommendations.  The committee will be presenting their first annual report to me within the next few weeks.</P>

The Government has called on every appropriate occasion for the conclusion of a convention outlawing the <Col N="651" /> stockpiling, development, production and use of chemical weapons for all time. The urgency of the conclusion of such an instrument has grown considerably in recent years, on the one hand because of the further development of their chemical weapons capabilities by the superpowers, including the recent decision by the United States to resume the production of chemical weapons, and on the other hand by the renewed use of these weapons by Iraq in the Gulf War.</P>

      <P>Articles 35 and 36 of Protocol I (1977) to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts concern the methods and means of warfare. Article 35 of the protocol reads:</P>
      <P>In any armed conflict, the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited.</P>
      <P>It is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering.</P>
      <P>It is prohibited to employ methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, the use of chemical weapons in war would be contrary to the spirit of this Article.  However, there is already in existence, in the Geneva Protocol of 1925, a prohibition on the use of chemical <Col N="652" /> weapons in war, which is now a generally accepted principle in international law.</P>
    <P>Article 36 of the 1977 Protocol reads:</P>
    <P>In the study, development, acquisition or adoption of a new weapon, means or method of warfare, a High Contracting Party is under an obligation to determine whether its employment would, in some or all circumstances, be prohibited by this Protocol or by any other rule of international law applicable to the High Contracting Party.</P>
    <P>This article makes it clear that the states which are parties to the protocol have a responsibility, when considering the development, production and stockpiling of a new weapon, to determine whether its use would be contrary to the Protocol and to any other international obligations which that state might have undertaken.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works informed the corporation that in the event of the sale proceeding they would be looking to recoup the cost of rehousing the staff.  In view of the estimated costs involved however, the corporation indicated that it would be interested in acquiring No. 29 only, which the commissioners were prepared to agree to, subject to details of the future plans for the building being furnished.  These have now been provided.  They are satisfactory from the point of view of the commissioners and the disposal of the premises to the corporation will be arranged as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>A claimant who has drawn the maximum entitlement of unemployment benefit cannot requalify for benefit until she has a further 13 weeks of employment which is insurable at a contribution class which provides cover against unemployment. Weeks of insurable employment after 156 days of benefit have been drawn are counted for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The person concerned, who is a married woman, claimed unemployment benefit from 13 February 1984.  She was paid to 9 February 1985, at which time she had drawn her maximum entitlement of 312 days benefit.  As she had no insurable employment since drawing 156 days benefit, she did requalify for payment of benefit from 11 February 1985.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the equal treatment provisions implemented with effect from 15 May 1986 under the Social Welfare Act, 1986, the maximum duration of unemployment benefit payable to a married woman was increased from 312 to 390 days.  Under transitional arrangements, a claimant who had drawn 312 days of benefit in the three-month period from 14 February 1986 to 14 May 1986, and continued to prove unemployment, is entitled to payment of benefit from 15 May 1986 to the date on which she would normally have completed 390 days on her claim.  However, as the person concerned had drawn her 312 days entitlement prior to 14 February 1986, the transitional arrangements do not apply in her case. She continues to sign the unemployed register for credited contribution purposes.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare Act (No. 2), 1985, provided for the changes necessary to introduce equality of treatment in accordance with the EC Directive on the subject.</P>
      <P>The first phase of the equality measures was brought into force by order with effect from 15 May 1986 and involved: (a) the abolition of the reduced rates of benefit for certain married women who had previously received lower rates of payment but now receive the standard rates of benefit as beneficiaries generally, (b) the extension of duration of unemployment benefit payments to married women to 390 days; unemployment benefit was previously paid to married women for a duration of 312 days only as against 390 days generally.</P>
      <P>The person concerned does benefit from the implementation of the first phase of the equality provisions in that her personal flat rate was increased from £34.70 to £39.50 from 15 May 1986 and the duration for which she is entitled to payment was increased from 312 to 390 days.  However, she had drawn 156 days benefit on 16 May 1986 and, as in the case of all claimants who do not satisfy the special contribution condition of having 280 contributions paid in the seven year period prior to the claim, her personal flat rate was reduced to £32.75 a week.  According to the records of the Department she had only 48 contributions paid in the relevant period.  The reduction in the personal rate took effect from 17 May 1986.  Also with effect from that date she entered the second phase of pay-related benefit and her weekly entitlement to this benefit was reduced from 23p to 19p.</P>

      <P>A claimant who has drawn the maximum entitlement of unemployment benefit cannot requalify for benefit until she has a further 13 weeks of employment which is insurable at a contribution class which provides cover against unemployment. Weeks of insurable employment after 156 days of benefit have been drawn are counted for this purpose.  The person concerned, who is a married woman, had drawn her maximum entitlement of 312 days benefit on 5 March 1986.  According to the Department's records, she had no insurable employment since drawing 156 days of benefit and, therefore, she did not requalify for payment of benefit from 6 March 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, she does qualify for payment of benefit on her claim of 23 May 1986 in accordance with transitional arrangements made in conjunction with the implementation of the equality provisions from 15 May 1986 under the Social Welfare Act, 1986, which increased the maximum duration of unemployment benefit payable to married women from 312 to 390 days.  Under the transitional arrangements, a claimant who had drawn 312 days benefit in the three month period from 14 February 1986 to 14 May 1986 is entitled to payment of benefit from 15 May 1986 to the date on which <Col N="672" /> she would normally have completed 390 days on her claim, provided she continued to prove unemployment.  The person concerned ceased to sign the unemployed register on 11 March 1986 but made a further claim from 23 May 1986.  Under the transitional arrangements, she qualifies for payment of unemployment benefit from 23 May 1986 to 15 August 1986, provided she continues to prove unemployment, when she will have completed 390 days on her claim.  Also in accordance with the equality provisions her weekly flat rate benefit entitlement has been increased to £39.50. All arrears due from 23 May 1986 will be paid to her this week.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is dependent on a claimant being the holder of a qualification certificate and to obtain a qualification certificate a person must satisfy certain conditions including an assessment of means.  As the means of a claimant can change, the assessment of means is subject to periodic review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of unemployment assistance since 1983 and is being paid on the basis of a qualification certificate showing nil means.  Her current weekly rate of unemployment assistance is £34.95, that is the appropriate maximum long duration rate payable to a single claimant in an urban area.  Her case was referred to a social welfare officer recently in order to review her means.  When the social welfare officer called on her to investigate the case on 9 June 1986 she failed to furnish particulars of her means.  Normally in such circumstances a claimant would be disallowed on the grounds that the claimant, <Col N="673" /> by failing to furnish particulars of means, failed to show that the means did not exceed the relevant statutory limit. However, as the claimant in this case was still grieved following a recent bereavement in the family the officer informed her that he would call back at a later date to investigate the means.</P>
    <P>When the person concerned called to the local office on 11 June 1986 to sign the unemployed register she refused to accept her weekly payment of £34.95. However, when she returned on 18 June 1986 she did collect her current weekly payment together with the payment normally payable on 11 June 1986.</P>
    <P>When the social welfare officer completes his report following his next visit to the claimant the case will be submitted to a deciding officer for assessment means.  Her entitlement to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of that assessment.  In the meantime, weekly payments of £34.95 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>
