      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the total number of tenders considered for the cleaning contract which has been awarded for the new Garda headquarters at Mill Street, Galway; the price rating of the tender accepted and how that related to the price rating of each of the other two tenders; the name of the company which was awarded the contract; and if, in fact, the company awarded the contract submitted the highest tender.</P>

      <P>It would not be in accordance with normal Government contracts procedures to disclose details of tenders submitted in cases of this nature.  A contract for the cleaning of the Garda divisional headquarters at Mill Street, Galway, for a period of one year, was awarded by the Garda authorities to the company which submitted what was judged by them to be the most acceptable tender.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <P>The Minister is very informative.  I know the information I require would perhaps be better addressed to the Minister's predecessor, as I know the contract was awarded during his predecessor's time.  Let me ask if he will give the name of the company whose tender was accepted?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It struck me to wonder, <Col N="677" /> looking at the name of the firm quite some time ago in another connection, whether there was any connection between the firm and Deputy Noonan of Limerick West and/or Deputy Noonan of Limerick East, but I have not inquired into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question down in a formal way.  I am asking the Minister if it is not the practice normally to take the lowest tender, whether that practice was not followed in this instance and if not, then why?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will consider holding an inquiry into the circumstances of the death of Mr. Patrick Nugent at Bunratty Folk Park, on 11 February 1984; and if <Col N="679" /> he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that the inquest jury in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Clare requested that he should have the matter further investigated, in view of the fact that it is now two years since his death in strange circumstances; the reason no decision has been taken to date; if he will now undertake an investigation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, subject to no further interruptions from a former Minister for Finance who knows what contract procedures are about, to take Questions Nos. 2 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>This case has already been the subject of a Garda investigation, a criminal trial and a coroner's inquest, which is, in effect, a sworn public inquiry.  It is clear that the jury at the inquest were not satisfied that all of the relevant facts of the case had emerged and, on this basis, they added a rider to the verdict that a further investigation should be carried out by me.  I assume that this was done in the belief that I have investigative machinery within my Department to pursue the matter further.  In fact no such machinery is available to me, nor have I, as Minister for Justice, any legal powers to conduct such an investigation.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that they have already done everything they can to get to the bottom of the matter.  It is noteworthy that the jury expressed their appreciation of the fullness of the inquiries the Garda had made in the case.</P>
      <P>If the suggestion is that a tribunal of inquiry be set up to look at the matter, I believe that such a tribunal would be justifiable only if it appeared reasonable to expect that it would produce new evidence and not just a repetition of the evidence given at the inquest and at the trial.  In the absence of any such expectation, it is difficult to see how the setting up of such a tribunal would be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Garda disciplinary proceedings are at <Col N="680" /> present in progress, at the direction of the Garda authorities.  I have no function in such proceedings.  They are not an investigation into the death itself and will be primarily directed towards the question of whether there were breaches of regulations by individual gardaí.  Should any new relevant material emerge during the course of the disciplinary proceedings, I will be prepared to look at the matter again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that in the jury verdict before the rider was added the last lines were &ldquo;The jury add the attached rider to their findings because of suppression of evidence by witnesses to the event&rdquo;.  Is the Minister aware that this is clear evidence that at the inquest there was suppression of evidence, therefore the inquest could not be regarded as in any way an inquiry to arrive at the cause of death and the reasons for it, because of this suppression of evidence?  As a result of that I am sure the Minister is aware that the jury added this rider in which they said, &ldquo;However the jury are far from satisfied as to the circumstances under which Patrick Nugent sustained the injuries which caused his death&rdquo;, and for that reason asked the Minister for Justice to have the matter investigated further.  The jury, laymen, would not know what machinery is available to the Minister but being the Minister in charge they assumed he would have the appropriate procedures, a public inquiry, a formal inquiry or whatever. Does the Minister now think&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot allow such a long speech or any speech on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>With those facts at his disposal what further investigation does the Minister intend to carry out? Will he have a formal public inquiry, not necessarily a tribunal of inquiry, to arrive at the evidence which was suppressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts to which Deputy Mac Giolla refers are, of course, at my disposal.  They consist of his rehearsal of the fact, first of all, that the jury at the <Col N="681" /> inquest added a rider to their decision, and then the rider itself, I am aware that the jury expressed their belief that evidence was suppressed and then asked the Minister for Justice to have the matter investigated further.  As I have pointed out, the case has already been the subject of a Garda investigation, a criminal trial and a coroner's inquest.  As I have said, the coroner's inquest is in the nature of a sworn public inquiry.  If I believed or if there were any reason for believing that a further investigation would bring new evidence or new facts to light, then it would be worth considering.  Since, following those three investigations, of different kinds, it now appears we have got all the information that is likely to be got about the case, I cannot see now any reason for taking any further steps.  As I have said, no investigative machinery is available to me as Minister for Justice to do the kind of thing which the jury appeared to have in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that the jury also expressed the hope that expenses and compensation would be paid to the Nugent family as a result of this tragic case.  Has the Minister taken that into account, and what does he propose to do about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps then, the Minister can tell me what the present situation is regarding the internal Garda investigation, the disciplinary proceedings etc? What stage have they reached?  When are they likely to be completed?  Have charges been brought against some people involved in this incident?  Could he expedite the matter in order to be fair to everybody involved in this tragedy?</P>

I have given it as my view that as we have had a Garda investigation, a criminal trial and an inquest, I do not think any further investigation would be likely to bring forward new material <Col N="684" /> which could be the basis of further steps. I have also said that if from the Garda disciplinary proceedings currently going on, any new or relevant material emerges, I shall look again at the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question No. 3 and Priority Question No. 27 together.</P>
      <P>The terms on which ground rent leases are renewable are prescribed by law.  The relevant terms are set out in legislation enacted as recently as 1980, no doubt on the basis that those terms are fair to both landlord and tenant.  The ground rent purchase scheme is, of course, applicable to a renewed lease &mdash; or, in some cases, even without formal renewal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no information about any new problem arising in relation to expired <Col N="686" /> ground rent leases.  It is, of course, basic to the entire landlord and tenant code that, where a lease has expired, the terms of renewal are likely to differ very substantially from the terms of the expired lease, which may have been settled 100 years ago or more.  This is why successive Governments have encouraged people to buy out their ground rents well before their leases expire.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, in recent years that encouragement given by successive Governments has been countered &mdash; with what degree of success I cannot say &mdash; by campaigns discouraging people from buying out and I would urge those people to consider their position well in advance of the expiry dates of their ground rent leases.</P>

      <P>My Question No. 3 refers to a particular difficulty which householders have whose rateable valuation is greater than their annual ground rent.  This appears to be an anomaly in the 1980 Act.  It is a matter that I raised previously here when debating the question of ground rents.  I specifically asked if the Minister proposes to do anything to overcome that anomaly and if he could indicate whether he is going to do that or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstance in which rateable valuation is greater than annual ground rent is one of the tests which apply to determine whether or not a tenancy is a ground rent tenancy in one very usual type of case.  It does not have any general significance.  There are many cases where the rateable valuation is greater than the annual ground rent.  It is one of the factors taken into account in determining whether or not there is a ground rent tenancy.  Apart from that, it has no further significance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of at least one case where the right to purchase was denied because of the issue of rateable valuation being greater than the ground rent.  In the case in question the ground rent was reduced at some stage in order to come within those terms.  Would the Minister consider an alteration of the Act to enable people in those circumstances, who when they come to this point are asked for literally tens of thousands of pounds to renew ground rent leases, to be covered under the 1980 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said before, the circumstances as to whether or not the ground rent is less than the rateable valuation is not a material factor in deciding entitlement.  If the Deputy has a specific case in mind here, I would be happy to examine that case with him.  What may be the bigger problem in the case to which the Deputy is referring is that perhaps the person in question attempted to buy out the ground rent either at the very end of the lease or when the lease had already come to an end.  In those circumstances the purchase of the lease can be very expensive because if the lease has already terminated one is dealing with a situation in which the landlord could reasonably, on the updating of the ground rent, increase the amount of the rent fairly substantially.  In those circumstances the purchase of the ground rent could amount to a substantial proportion of the value of the property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the question that I asked the Minister &mdash; if he was aware of the exorbitant demands being made on householders whose ground rent leases had expired.  The Act does not allow them to buy out their leases if this was proposed within a certain period of the enactment of the legislation.  The period initially was 25 years but it is now 15 years.  Some ground tenants are caught in between.  In the case of an expired lease on a dwelling house valued at £40,000 the ground landlord wants £5,000, plus £500 expenses in respect of stamp duty.  The ground rent is £6 per annum.  The amount demanded now by <Col N="688" /> the ground landlord is one-eighth of the market value of the dwelling.  Does the Minister agree that he should take a new look at the Act in the near future with a view to improving the position in respect of such payments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should go back a little on the history of ground rents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should explain the position for Deputies.  The right to purchase was first given to ground rent tenants by the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rent) Act, 1967.  I am sure the House will be aware particularly of the provision for the settling of disputes between the purchaser and landlord.  An Act of 1978 introduced a special purchase scheme for ground rent tenants in respect of dwellinghouses.  That original scheme was due to be terminated on 31 July 1983. It was extended to 31 July 1984 and later to 31 July 1987.</P>
      <P>The present purchase provisions are catered for by section 7 of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1984, and are designed to enable the purchase price to be fixed at arbitration or by the courts on appeal, with due regard for the property rights of both the landlord and tenant.  The price depends on the circumstances. It would be at its minimum in the case of an ordinary dwellinghouse when the lease has 15 years or longer to run or when a yearly tenancy applies. The price is arrived at through a formula related to the yield on Government securities, and at present that is eight to nine times the amount of the annual rent. The price is at its maximum when the ground rent lease has expired.  In these circumstances the purchase price may be as high as one-eighth the market value of the property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I am trying to make is that the scheme has been in existence since 1967, the better part of 20 years, and I would have thought that it would have been prudent for people to have bought <Col N="689" /> out their leases before entering the last 15 years of the term.  I regret that numbers of people seem to have fallen for the campaign that discouraged people from doing this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa's question is directed not so much at the purchase price payable but at the qualification of a person to buy out at all under the Act.  Would the Minister agree that using the PLV as a test for any purpose of qualification is entirely unsatisfactory, particularly having regard to the fact that the PLV figures are completely out of date, unrevised and indeed in rural areas have been held to be unconstitutional in a different context as a basis for determining anything?  Might it not well be held to be unconstitutional in this urban context?  Surely there must be some tests available other than those antiquated valuation figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Legislature agreed up to a point with what Deputy Taylor has said.  The circumstances in which rateable valuation is greater than the annual amount of rent is one test that is applied to determine whether a tenancy is a ground rent tenancy.  That is not by any means the only test &mdash; it is one of a series. The Deputy's reference to the unconstitutionality of the use of PLV for certain purposes does not arise here.  The rateable valuation is intended to reflect the annual letting value of the property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that it was never the intention of the House that people should be charged sums of the order of £5,000 for a £6 a year ground rent?  Would he therefore have a look at the legislation in the experience of what has been happening and see if it could be altered to give some ease to people in such circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>When a lease has expired, if there is no question of purchasing the ground rent or the fee simple the other options open would be a renewal or an extension of the lease.  If there was a <Col N="690" /> discussion on an extension of the lease it would be perfectly open, constitutionally and in every other way, to the landlord to revise the basis of the rent.  In all of these cases the rents that would now be fixed would be considerably higher than rents that were fixed in some cases 100 years or more ago.  It is in such cases that difficulties arise for people who have allowed ground rents to lapse before taking any action on buying them.</P>

No decision has yet been taken on the question of redeveloping the remainder of the Fort area, including that portion damaged during the disturbances there on 1 September last.  In those circumstances, and as has already been pointed out by my predecessor, it is not a question of repairs and the question of the cost of repairs accordingly does not arise.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it would serve the public interest to comment publicly on the alarm arrangements in operation or the arrangements for back-up forces to be available in event of an emergency arising at the Fort.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made in the Estimates for the Prison Vote to cover expenditure on the work already in progress at the Fort &mdash; this is expected to come to about £250,000 exclusive of the pay of prison trades officers employed on the project.  In addition, provision has been included for work on the redevelopment of the remainder of the Fort in the event of its being decided to follow that course of action.</P>
    <P>Outline plans for this redevelopment, drawn up by the Office of Public Works, are at present being considered in my Department but since, as I have said, a decision has not yet been made, I cannot say if any capital expenditure will be incurred in this work this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the facility fully secure?  Would the Minister tell the House if he is totally confident that it is not possible to have a repeat of previous occurrences?  Finally, and most importantly, would he confirm that it is Government policy to maintain this facility as part of the permanent long term prison facilities of the State?  I am particularly interested in the latter question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied with the progress of the work but I can give no undertaking that there will be no further disturbances in that or in any other institution, <Col N="694" /> although I hope we can avoid disturbances of that kind in any one of our institutions.  As regards the last part of the question, as I said, outline plans for the redevelopment of the remainder of the Fort have been drawn up but no decision has yet been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that it is not yet decided by the Government if the Spike Island facility is to be a permanent part of the Irish prison system.  Do I take it that that decision has not yet been taken?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but if the Deputy would listen for the answer without jumping in so quickly, he might be more satisfied.  As I said, the work that is going on at the moment is designed to bring the capacity of the institution to 80.  I do not foresee in the foreseeable future &mdash; if I might use that tautology &mdash; a situation in which we can do without that capacity.  From that point of view the Deputy may take it that it is my intention, and the Government's intention, that that would continue to be a part of our prison capacity.  The decision that has not yet been made is whether we redevelop any of Fort Mitchel for prison accommodation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell the House if there is a proper alarm and back-up security system there now?  Is he satisfied that there is a proper alarm system?  This is one of the problems which arose before he became Minister for Justice, because it became evident that there was no such system there.  The Minister said it is not in the public interest to comment on this but we do not want to know the details.  All we want to know is that they exist.  Will the Minister give an assurance that a proper alarm and back-up security system is available and, roughly what is the time scale?  Will this <Col N="695" /> back-up be available reasonably quickly and how quickly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is yes and, for reasons which I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, I do not intend to go into time scales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Mr. Woods Mr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the residents of Spike Island and others had been assured that a back-up service would be available within five minutes? I do not want the Minister to disclose anything of a security nature but we want him to assure us that necessary and speedy action can be taken if the need arises.  Did the Minister say in his reply that the capital cost this year would be £250,000 plus the cost of repairing the damage done during the disturbance, or is it £250,000 including the cost of repairing and refurbishing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said I am satisfied that the alarm and back-up service is adequate to deal with any problem that might arise.  On the second part of the question, I repeat what I have already said: no decision has yet been taken on redeveloping the remainder of the Fort area, including that portion damaged during the disturbances there on 1 September last.  In those circumstances, and as has already been pointed out by my predecessor, it is not a question of repairs and therefore the question of the cost of the repairs does not arise.  It is estimated that expenditure on work already in progress at the Fort will be £250,000 this year, exclusive of the cost of paying for the prison trades officers employed on the project.</P>

    <P>7.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will make a statement concerning the allegation contained in a newspaper report in <i>The Irish Times,</i> 22 February 1986 that relatives of a hunger striker (details supplied) first learned of his hunger strike 35 days after it had <Col N="697" /> begun; and the normal procedure in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The general prison regulations specify that relatives should be informed when the condition of a prisoner on hunger strike &ldquo;has assumed an aspect of danger&rdquo;.  Because the circumstances of hunger strikes can vary substantially, there is not and cannot properly be a fixed procedure on the question of informing relatives at an earlier stage.  Much can depend on the attitude of the prisoner and the degree of contact, if any, he may have with particular relatives or relatives in general.</P>
      <P>In the case in question the relatives of the prisoner had become aware of the hunger strike well before his condition had become dangerous.  The prison authorities had not contacted the prisoner's relatives earlier to inform them of the hunger strike.  They were not asked to do so and they were well aware that it was at all times open to the prisoner himself to write to any of his relatives to the effect that he was on hunger strike but that he did not do so &mdash; despite that fact that, during the course of the hunger strike, he wrote to a number of people, one of them a Member of this House.</P>
      <P>If a prisoner chooses not to communicate with his relatives, that is a matter for him.  A review of a list of this prisoner's visitors while in Portlaoise showed that he had not apparently for some time, received visits from any of his relatives.</P>
      <P>In this context, I should mention specifically a sister of the prisoner who is referred to in the newspaper report to which the question relates and who, in another newspaper report, was reported as claiming that my Department had issued an incorrect Christian name to conceal the hunger strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should make it clear that the woman in question is not the next-of-kin specified by the prisoner to the authorities as the person to whom any important urgent communication should be sent and, in fact, there is no record of her ever having visited her brother while he was in Portlaoise. Her reported claim about my <Col N="698" /> Department issuing an incorrect name is untrue.  My Department gave the correct name and had no responsibility for the fact that one particular newspaper used and continued to use an incorrect name, one only; the others got it right.</P>
    <P>There has also been some criticism during the course of this hunger strike to the effect that my Department should have issued a public statement about it at an earlier stage.  I cannot accept that criticism as valid.  If a hunger strike takes place, that fact is not and cannot be kept secret &mdash; it is known about within days by scores of people.  But it is no part of the business of the prison authorities to encourage publicity about it, and in most cases, such publicity simply adds to the likelihood of the hunger strike continuing.</P>
    <P>The fact that a prisoner was on hunger strike was confirmed through a written Dáil question and answer on 30 January last.  The Deputy who put down the question was aware of the prisoner's name but, of course, was perfectly entitled not to put it on the records of the House. Some time afterwards when my Department were asked to confirm details of the hunger strike to a particular newspaper, this was done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The question asks the Minister only, in relation to the allegations made, what exactly is the position; apparently in accordance with the details supplied in the newspaper report the relatives of the hunger striker first learned 35 days after the hunger strike had begun. What is the normal procedure?  I gather what the Minister has said is that when danger to the health of the prisoner arises, that is the stage at which the relatives would be informed &mdash; that they might learn otherwise &mdash; but by that stage an obligation to inform the relatives would be recognised.  What stage would that be?  Obviously that is a very open question.  On humanitarian grounds would the Minister let us know when that stage might be, say, in terms of a 35 or 40 day period?  Would it be roughly after a week, or does it mean that one has to be almost <i>in extremis</i> before one's relatives <Col N="699" /> would be informed?  What is the normal practice in that respect?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out at the beginning of my reply, the general prison regulations specify that relatives should be informed, that is, without any specific request by the prisoner, when the condition of a prisoner on hunger strike &mdash; and again I quote &mdash;&ldquo;has assumed an aspect of danger&rdquo;.  That is a matter for judgment in each case.  As I have pointed out also, there is nothing to prevent a prisoner himself from informing relatives.  The person in question wrote a number of letters&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so much concerned with the prisoner himself as with the State's obligation.  That is what the question is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to be as informative as possible to the House, which is the reason for the rather lengthy reply.  I am endeavouring to answer the specific question Deputy Woods put to me.  In the case in point the hunger strike was known about outside of the prison within a relatively short time and before the case has assumed an aspect of danger in the view of the prison authorities on medical advice.  It was open to the prisoner himself to inform his relatives, or anybody else he wanted at any point during the hunger strike.  During the course of the hunger strike he wrote to a number of people, not including his relatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister confirm that there was no attempt at concealment of the hunger strike in the course of this case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that any hunger strike is a very serious matter in that it involves the health and possibly the life of the prisoner in question?  If that is the case would he not accept that, in this instance, <Col N="700" /> there was failure on the part of the Minister's Department to treat this matter with the degree of seriousness it warranted in so far as not only were the relatives not informed &mdash; though I accept much of what the Minister has said on that aspect &mdash; but that the hunger strike was permitted to go on to the 43rd day, to the best of my knowledge, on issues which could very easily have been sorted out by any departmental official treating the matter&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, a Cheann Comhairle, but I have to say that the point I am making is that I feel that the Department did not treat this matter seriously in so far as, on the one hand, they did not inform the relatives and on the other hand, they allowed a situation to develop to a very dangerous stage on two issues which could have been resolved in a simple way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I can, of course, agree with <Col N="701" /> Deputy Gregory that any hunger strike is serious.  I cannot at all agree with his allegation that my Department did not treat this matter seriously.  It was taken very seriously.  I do not intend to go into the rest of the issues Deputy Gregory raises except to say that there is food for thought in them, in the other direction also.

      <P>On a point of order, might I register a protest that Question Time in this House for backbenchers is becoming an irrelevance when we see that after one hour we have got through about seven questions.  Backbenchers submit questions, then must go through a draw arrangement and more often than not their questions are not drawn.  If we are to be realistic and have an orderly conduct of the affairs of the House it must be open to back benchers to have their questions taken.  Something will have to be done about this and I ask the Chair for his agreement on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Deputy does not intend to give the Chair a lecture and, indeed, if he did such a lecture would not be justified because the Chair daily appeals to Members and, in some cases Ministers, to make their questions, and answers, short and not to get into discussions or debates at Question Time, which are not in order.  I should like to suggest to Deputy Taylor, one of the Whips, that he bring this matter up at a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The weight of an expression of opinion by that committee would assist me in doing what I want to do, to make reasonable progress at Question Time.</P>

The Chair is chairman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and I appeal to him to have some type of order brought into this matter.

    <P>24.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is satisfied with the operation of the criminal legal aid scheme; the controls he exercises on the administration of the scheme; and whether he has any plans to improve the operation and efficiency of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am generally satisfied with the operation of the criminal legal aid scheme introduced under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1982, but my Department are examining the scheme to see what changes may be needed in the present arrangements for providing criminal legal aid, including changes that <Col N="705" /> might be needed to eliminate possible abuses.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme, the grant of legal aid is a matter for the courts and the Supreme Court has ruled that accused persons have a constitutional right to legal aid in certain circumstances.  My functions relate to the making of regulations prescribing the form of legal aid certificates, the rates or scales of payment of fees, costs and expenses for lawyers providing legal aid under the scheme, and the manner in which solicitors and counsel are to be assigned pursuant to such certificates.  Some 16 sets of regulations have been made, mostly concerned with fees and expenses, and copies are in the Library of the House.  Expenditure under the scheme is subject to the scrutiny of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>When the examination of the scheme which my Department are now carrying out has been completed, I propose, in consultation as necessary with other Ministers and the Government, to consider whether changes should be introduced.</P>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity to say that it has emerged that there are some errors in the figures given in reply to a Parliamentary Question of 4 February 1986 from Deputy Prendergast relating to the earnings of various barristers and solicitors under the scheme.  Data which would normally have been available from a computer had been accidentally deleted and a great deal of work had to be done manually in a very short time to compile data needed to answer the question.  As a result, some of the figures were not subjected to the normal checking and a number of discrepancies have come to notice since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, I regret that this occurred but I think it right to say that it occurred because of a laudable, though in the circumstances a misguided, attempt to ensure that the question would be answered on the particular day, no matter what the problems.  In fact, something of the order of 4,000 transactions had to be examined in the course of the assembly of the data and, because of an <Col N="706" /> unusual combination of circumstances, the difficulties that had arisen were not brought to the notice of anybody at senior level.  A full re-check is now necessary and that will take some time, probably a fortnight.  When this has been done I propose, in consultation with the Ceann Comhairle's office, to seek a suitable means, if necessary by inviting Deputy Prendergast to put down a further question, to provide a new set of figures for publication in the Official Report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that the position is worse than I thought.  The Minister has said that he is responsible for the manner in which the moneys are paid and the cases are assigned to solicitors and I want to know if he is now saying that the amounts awarded to a number of solicitors at £120,000, £96,000 and £77,000 are incorrect?  Will the Minister say whether they are likely to be higher or lower than was suggested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that the amounts awarded to the various people were wrong in the sense that they were improperly expended.  I am saying that the account given in the House, because of the accidental erasure of computer records and other matters I mentioned, was inaccurate.  There are some discrepancies in each direction and when we have done the final re-checking I intend to seek a suitable means of putting the corrected figures before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that it will not affect the broad scale of the allocations, that there will be adjustments to them? The Minister is nodding his head and I take it that means they do not.  I asked the Minister what controls he exercises on the administration of the scheme.  I asked this in particular, because I asked a question on 11 February regarding the number of cases dealt with by the solicitors who received these enormous amounts of money and the number of adjournments involved in those cases. The reply I received pointed out that it would take a disproportionate expenditure <Col N="707" /> of time and money to compile the information sought in regard to the number of cases dealt with by the five solicitors mentioned in the question during the tax year 5 April 1985 or the number of adjournments in those cases for which each solicitor was paid a fee.  If the Minister does not know how many cases he is dealing with when we talk about sums of the order of £120,000 and £96,000 or the number of adjournments in such cases, then I suggest that he knows nothing.  Does the Minister know anything about these cases?  Is any control being exercised?  It should be a fairly simple matter to say how many cases went to a solicitor who collected a sum of £120,000 and how many adjournments were involved.  Is there a total lack of control in that respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a fairly straightforward matter and I am quite satisfied that there are controls operating in respect of the scheme.  In the question to which the Deputy referred he was not simply asking for the number of cases but was also asking for the number of adjournments involved.  As was pointed out to him, that matter would require quite a degree of examination in order to establish full and correct information.  As I pointed out in my reply, I have some particular functions in relation to this scheme, not the least of which is prescribing the form of legal aid certificates, rates and scales of payment of fees, costs and expenses and the manner in which solicitors and counsel are to be assigned pursuant to the certificate.  There is a very tight control on the scheme and 16 sets of regulations apply.  However, my function in the matter does not extend to telling any of the lawyers who are designated under the scheme how they should conduct their business in any particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has now said that he would have no difficulty in telling me the number of cases involved but that there is a difficulty in relation to the adjournments.  I should like the Minister to tell me why he did not give me the <Col N="708" /> number of cases in his reply.  He said it would take too much time but at least it would have been half the information sought.  I know the adjournments are a different matter but I can only conclude that very little control is being exercised by the Minister in that area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the estimated total value of property stolen in Ireland in 1985; the value and percentage of this property which <Col N="709" /> was recovered; and the plans he has to curtail the unprecedented trade in stolen electrical equipment, jewellery and other goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisional estimate of the value of property stolen in 1985 is £31,165,310, of which property to the value of £2,664,983, or 8.6 per cent has been recovered.</P>
      <P>The total amount stolen last year is down by almost 10 per cent compared with 1984.  The figures for watches-jewellery are down by 14 per cent and for radios-TV recorders by 20 per cent.  It is hoped that the indelible marking of property by its owners, which is an integral part of the neighbourhood watch scheme, will become more widespread as the scheme is extended, thereby increasing the chances of recovering stolen property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister what measures he was taking to deal with this situation because we are still faced with a recovery figure of 8.6 per cent.  In relation to silver in particular, is the Minister aware that definite steps were taken previously whereby people who dealt in gold and silver had to be licensed and that up to very recently, police lists of stolen property were circulated to those who dealt in gold and silver.  Does the Minister agree that these precautions have now been dropped and that they should be reinstituted to exercise tight controls on the movement of property?  Would he also consider introducing a Bill to deal with the handling of stolen goods?</P>

      <P>I should like to make a further submission.  Does it not strike you as extraordinary that in the British House of Commons today the Prime Minister and other Ministers will be answering questions and making statements regarding happenings in this part of our country to a section of our citizens but that in this House your ruling is to the effect that it cannot be raised by me by way of Private Notice Question?</P>

      <P>I had to rule, Deputy Haughey, that the matter you sought to raise was not in order on a <Col N="784" /> Private Notice Question.  It is, of course, in order to raise it on ordinary notice.  I gave the matter very full consideration and I had no alternative but to rule it out of order.  Regarding the House of Commons, I am not familiar with their Standing Orders or rules of procedure and I am bound only by the Standing Orders which apply here.  I know that there are different procedures there such as Prime Minister's Question Time and it may very well be that the rules are quite different.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

I envy you your dispassionate view of very serious happenings and I also want to ask if you are satisfied in your official mind that the events that took place in Northern Ireland are not ongoing?

    <Title>Industrial Development Bill, 1985: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill, as outlined, is to give expression to the Government's White Paper on Industrial Policy.  I welcome the Bill in that context.  When I spoke last week I pointed out that the labour force, with reliable estimates, will increase from 1.31 million in 1984 to 1.6 million by the year 2000.  This reflects the magnitude of the potential unemployment problem.  The labour force is, therefore, expected to increase by almost 300,000 by the end of the century.  It must also be remembered that while employment growth increased by .8 of 1 per cent a year in the seventies, between 1981 and 1984 annual employment declined by 2.5 per cent a year.  It is against this background that I would like to deal with this Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 4 proposes that there would be a degree of flexibility in regard to classification of designated areas.  Traditionally, areas have been associated with specific types of industry either because of the availability, or access to, raw materials or markets or the availability of a traditionally skilled labour force.  All individual firms have life cycles of their own.  In a period of recession the span of time between growth and decline can be substantially shortened.  Rigidity in the classification of designated areas would ignore this problem.  There is a proposal in section 5 from the Plassey Technological Park for the introduction of a broad band local area network.  In jargon, it is referred to as LAN and as a computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing system.  At present this country, in the context of international telecommunications, can be compared to a boreen as we are so outmoded in our technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's White Paper on <Col N="792" /> industrial development has referred to the need for the type of facility I have just referred to.  A feasibility study was carried out by Wang (Ireland) Ltd. on the installation of such a facility on the NIHE campus in Limerick.  This would have the effect of linking up this country with all the advanced countries of the world.  I give, for example, the situation whereby a manufacturing company in Limerick wants to get market details from another company in another country. It can happen that the engineer in that country under this proposed system can, without moving from his desk, lock into this facility at the Plassey Technological Park and there lock into, for example, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to get the most up-to-date data on the requirements of the market or the technological situation and thus help his own company.</P>
    <P>The original proposal was that the IDA and the Shannon Development Company would provide the funding.  They have since decided that because this is practicable and feasible there should be a bigger input from the private sector and that the Government should put in the infrastructure. Bord Telecom were prepared to put in the backbone of that system &mdash; the ducting and cables etc.  &mdash; if the IDA and SFADCo were prepared to fund the operation.  The appropriate interests in the mid-west region and in the wider industrial context are very disappointed that this project has not advanced further than it has at present.  I am addressing my remarks particularly to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Noonan.  I must say that in the mid-west region we were delighted that he secured that important portfolio as I personally was not happy with the attitude of his predecessor, Deputy Bruton, towards the Shannon Development Company. There was a tacit acceptance of a pressure campaign to diminish or reduce the stature of the Shannon Development Company. There are vested interests&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would say to this Government or to any Government that any attempt to diminish SFADCo by reducing their role or mandate in any way will be resisted by every political organisation and representative in the mid-west region.  There is no doubt, as those of us who are close to the scene are aware, that there are concerted efforts by tourist interests and others &mdash; and I am saying Fine Gael Deputies from Cork who seem, at somebody's behest to be mounting a campaign against the Shannon Development Company.  This, to my mind, is scandalous because the Shannon Development Company are the only effective regional development authority who have received international acclaim and recognition in training people from the Third World on how to enter into areas of public administration, on how to run and develop regions in their own countries.  They have been acknowledged by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as a model of their kind.  Their <i>raison d'être</i> is to generate greater traffic through Shannon Airport.  In that sense, it was responsible for making Shannon Airport the lynch-pin of progress in the mid-west region over the last 40 years. All tribute is due to Dr. Brendan O'Regan and the late Deputy Seán Lemass for their vision in allowing that concept to be developed and to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company for bringing it to the successful level it has reached today, whether in the area of industrialisation, attracting huge and major industries into this region, the promotion of greater traffic through the region or the building of houses for executives and employees of the Shannon Industrial Estate and the airport.  Every venture undertaken was an outstanding success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> Bunratty Folk Park and Craggaunowen Castle have become models of their kind for students from all over the world.  They have now been copied by at least six or eight other countries.  We are looking to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, to redress the imbalance of neglect in respect of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company which was the hallmark of his predecessor's regime in that ministry, Deputy John Bruton.  I hope there will be manifest and obvious improvement in that area.</P>
    <P>While the rest of the region has done relatively well in the context of employment, Limerick city has done particularly badly.  In the wake of the debacle of Ferenka the then Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy O'Malley, was in those circumstances enabled to designate Limerick for 60 per cent grants.  Limerick benefited very considerably by major industries coming in at that time.  When Deputy O'Malley left office there was a definite feeling within the Industrial Development Authority that Limerick had done reasonably well and that things could now be slackened off.  As a public representative and a trade union official with very close contact with industrialists in the region, I am very sorry to note that under the IDA no real development of note has taken place in recent years.  While the original introduction of the IDA into the mid-west region by Deputy O'Malley was no doubt done with the best possible motives, in hindsight it was sadly a mistake.  The position should now revert to the original situation where the Shannon Free Airport Development Company should be given their original mandate with responsibility for the mid-west region and south Offaly to introduce all sizes of companies.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the position of the GAC bus factory in Shannon.  I had hoped on the Order of Business to ask this Minister if it is true that, at a meeting on 25 February between himself and representatives of the unions, the workforce and the company, he put forward a suggestion to a company executive that the company should advance £3.7 million in <Col N="795" /> order to keep afloat this year and that that money would be refunded to the company by the Government in 1987 out of next year's allocations and that proposal was rejected by the company?  The reason I ask that question is that I think it is very politically unwise for the Government to allow the factory to close. I think I am reflecting accurately what I know to be the feelings of the workers in that factory.  It should be given a reprieve until the Darlington trials and experimentations are completed.  If following that the company cannot survive by way of export orders and if all of its commitments and requirements to CIE have been fulfilled it would be very difficult to sustain an argument from the point of view of pumping taxpayers' money into an enterprise for which there was no need, except in the area of school buses.</P>
    <P>The problem with regard to school buses has ideological connotations.  I understand that the Fine Gael Party are committed to the privatisation of the school bus sector.  Some members of the Labour Party recently met a delegation of ICTU-CIE unions and they were very anxious that the school bus programme would not be handed over to cowboys &mdash; I use that word deliberately &mdash; who would not be concerned with anything other than profit.  If some of these people get the franchise to look after the school buses, they intend to import second-hand or third-hand buses from Britain in order to meet their obligation to the school bus programme.  I suggest that it is incumbent on CIE to find some device such as they already have to get around this situation &mdash; for example, by introducing a clubtype arrangement whereby CIE would have the entirely of the school bus programme.  It is very difficult to argue in strictly mathematical terms with the statement made recently by one Government Minister when he said that school buses are only used twice a day, five days a week for 30 weeks a year and when they are not running it is a waste of taxpayers' money.  I accept that in strict mathematical logic but I believe there is a very strong obligation on CIE in this regard if <Col N="796" /> they look continually to this House and to Deputies like myself in the Labour Party with a trade union background for support.  I support very strongly the strengthening of CIE's role in Irish public sector operations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome section 12 of the Bill which deals with the concept of delegation of grant-making powers.  I am aware that such a procedure is already in operation in the IDA.  This is a matter which the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, of which I am Chairman, have considered in relation to their examination of Údarás na Gaeltachta, but as the report is not yet finalised I will not comment in detail on their findings at this stage.  I accept the principle that the IDA without prejudice to their general responsibility under the Act may delegate their grant aiding powers to a board or committee constituted by the authority or to any of their members or to members of the staff duly authorised by the authority in that behalf.  Perhaps such provision could be extended to some commercial State-sponsored bodies.  We may have in the past overloaded the boards of these bodies because inadequate statutory provision did not allow them to delegate some aspects of their work.  In the absence of appropriate delegation policies I am reminded of that quotation from Virgil which says that the mountains are in labour and an absurd mouse is born.  While accepting the real need for delegation of responsibility, I would emphasise that the terms of reference regarding such delegated matters must be clearly specified.  In this context, I am reminded of the problems that arose in Irish Shipping Limited where basically, they had delegated responsibility for charter hire to a subsidiary company, but the board of Irish Shipping allegedly were unaware of the very significant hire contracts <Col N="797" /> which had been entered into on their behalf.  My view regarding delegation would be more precisely summarised by Mr. Peter Drocker where he said: &ldquo;give freedom but retain control&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>While accepting the criterion as outlined in paragraphs 5.2 and 5.3 of the White Paper I would refer to paragraph 5.1 of the White Paper on Industrial Policy and paragraph 21-4E of the Bill which stipulates that new industry grants would be only available where firms maintained increased employment.  I am particularly concerned about that and the Shannon branch of the ITGWU have passed several motions to the effect that the whole trade union movement should not be put into a situation where huge capital-intensive multinational companies would come in here and get their generous grants which for the most part are paid by workers' taxes, and then introduce very small workforces.  Some of these companies can get up to very peculiar games.  They tender for public contracts at outrageously high figures and when they are beaten they try to use the well known ploy of many questionable multinational companies, in seeking to use the trade union movement to portray them as an Irish company tendering for a public contract who are beaten although they employ Irish labour, when the taxpayer would be saved in one case relating to a Moneypoint contract in the region of £4 million.  Luckily in that case the workforce and the trade unions spotted what they were up to and did not support them.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 26 the concept of providing interest subsidies particularly in relation to restructuring of industry should have beneficial effects.  While accepting the need for grant aiding of fixed assets, nevertheless we have seen particularly many small industries fighting to survive and unable to restructure their finances.  The characteristics of many of these companies have been a high debt equity ratio and a shortage of working capital.  This shortage has been exacerbated by the requirements to meet interest charges.  Naturally working capital requirements demand adequate cash <Col N="798" /> flow forecasting.  In such circumstances interest subsidies, particularly for working capital can be an extremely helpful aiding mechanism.</P>
    <P>Section 31 deals with the power to purchase shares and such a provision provides for an extra dimension to the IDA's package of incentives.  In this context it will be expected that the IDA will provide for the reporting annually of the financial outcome of these investments, while noting that such dividends or payments would be payable directly to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Section 38 basically deals with the appointment and remuneration of members of the authority.  In considering the appointment of such directors and particularly directors of commercial State-sponsored bodies it may very well be considered that the level of reward paid to such directors is discriminatory. The very nominal directorship fees paid are not in the main related to the commitment given and expected of such directors. Subsequently, it may very well be that only those who can afford to forego an appropriate level of compensation for their time and commitment will be able to accept an invitation by the relevant Minister to join the board of a commercial State-sponsored body or the IDA.</P>
    <P>This view is confirmed by Professor Michael McCormack in his article entitled &ldquo;the role of board of directors and board practice&rdquo; published on 1 April 1982 in which he states &ldquo;the level of net compensation is so low in some companies as to make the position of an outside director not a desirable one except for the prestige or experience&rdquo;.  It is high time that we stopped putting people into State-sponsored bodies because of political preferment. If they are to be appointed they should have the necessary expertise that would justify their selection.  Ultimately we are talking about accountability for taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>In his speech on 8 May 1985 in the Seanad the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy John Bruton, on the motion to amend the terms <Col N="799" /> of reference to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies stated:</P>
    <P>The recent history of a commercial State-sponsored body suggests that in many cases boards have been less than successful in their policy of supervisory roles.  The reasons for this are many. They can include such factors as lack of an appropriate expertise and insufficient in-depth attention by directors to their duties.  There may be in some instances an attitude of mind that board appointments are essentially honorary or that there may be a lack of clarity about roles and responsibilities.</P>
    <P>However, I would contend that in the past in some cases it has been perceived that the acceptance of such directorships was one's contribution to the State and therefore, an honour.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the appointment of directors should be reviewed and that a more flexible policy regarding remuneration be adopted in recognition of individual circumstances and the significant time commitment which is required to adequately fulfil a directorship role particularly in some commercial State-sponsored bodies.  It may well be that only those who could afford to, would accept such a position.  An appropriate level of compensation should be considered but we should ensure that at all times the best people are put on these boards.  I acknowledge the committed and dedicated service given by many directors on IDA and commercial State-sponsored bodies and I acknowledge that the fees they have received were basically an honorarium rather than an adequate reward.  We have been penny wise and pound foolish in the way we have dealt with this item.  The best commercial talent available should not be placed at a disadvantage in accepting directorships of such bodies as the IDA and commercial State-sponsored organisations.</P>

      <P>The amendment to that motion seeks to introduce greater learning skills for people going into industry, languages and so on.  I have made this proposal to this House before. In the context of promoting industries, there is an Irish saying, &ldquo;Muna mbíonn ach gabhar agat, bí í lár an aonaigh leis&rdquo;. That was never more true in the marketing situation.  I was Mayor of Limerick up to eight months or so ago and I met a delegation from China here.  Two-thirds of all our exports to China come from the mid-west region.  It was interesting to see how willing those Chinese industrialists were to do business with us and with most European countries.  We are looking to Europe as a market for our goods and we are in competition with some of the most advanced technology in the world from some European countries, Japan and America.  It is utterly ludicrous and crazy for a country such as ours to talk about an industrial policy when we need to market our goods and a country such as China with 1,000 million population, exactly twice that of the EC, is virtually unknown to our industrialists.  The time is more than opportune for someone in the IDA or in the Department of Education to set about the provision of language courses in commercial Chinese.  There are people in this country doing that very successfully on a minuscule scale at present, but there is a huge opening for the type of technology that we have on offer.  The Chinese have said already that Britain is moving into the Chinese scene in a big way and other European countries are doing that also.  We are crazy if we neglect that type of opportunity when we have many young graduates, some of the best quality material engineers in the world, and we are being emasculated commercially because we are cutting ourselves off <Col N="801" /> through neglect of the biggest potential market in the world.  It is high time that somebody looked at that.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister's indication of the scene in relation to the Franciscan College at Louvain, which is the business school for Irish industrialists and which is proposed as a language training centre for Irish graduates out there.  The Minister for Labour, my colleague Deputy Ruairí Quinn, had that whole area refurbished. What is happening?  Are we just sitting back and nothing happening about that?  I understood that people from here, not necessarily graduates but marketing and sales people, would be trained there.</P>

      <Col N="802" /> I am reminded of what Alfred P. Sloan wrote in his book <i>My Years with General Motors</i>.  I quote: &ldquo;Growth and progress are related for there is no resting place for an enterprise within a competitive economy&rdquo;.  We are talking about an industrial policy the ideal of which should be to create as many worthwhile jobs for Irish workers as possible.  That policy was never more crucial than at present when more than a quarter of a million people are idle.  It is high time for all Governments, especially this one and any who come after them, to look at the whole area of industry as a means of giving employment to people.  I am reminded what Henry Ford is alleged to have said to the leader of the American Automobile Workers Union on one occasion when he brought him in and pointed out the whole concept of automation in General Motors in Detroit.  He said &ldquo;Look at that.  Not a hand.  Machines do not go on strike, are not out sick and do not need holidays&rdquo;.  The general secretary of the union said &ldquo;That is all right, Henry, but who is going to buy your cars?&rdquo; It might be almost blasé to quote Oliver Goldsmith, but two lines that he wrote are as valid today as they were when he wrote them 200 years ago:</P>
    <P>Ill fares the land to hastening ills a prey</P>
    <P>Where wealth accumulates and men decay.</P>
    <P>This Bill recognises the content of that statement.  I hope its provisions will enable the IDA to continue their good work, thereby helping to alleviate our chronic and tragically serious unemployment problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on the Industrial Development Bill, 1985.  It is strange that this Bill is to give effect to the new policy in the White Paper on Industrial Policy which was launched in July 1984, a year and nine months ago.  That is an important document, even though we on this side of the House may have strong reservations about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="803" /> Deputy Prendergast spoke of the appointment of directors to semi-State bodies.  I was amused, although my heart bled for the man, when he made the point that these appointments should not be based on political considerations.  His party have not been found wanting in having their recommendations implemented in appointments to the boards of the semi-State sector.  Irrespective of political persuasion, we must have people of ability and commitment who are prepared to give their time on semi-State boards.  In that area remuneration is important.  Many people are successful in business or in other ways and are appointed to semi-State bodies for that reason.  They are taken from their place of work or their business at a payment of, for a director of a semi-State organisation, about £750 and, for a chairman, of about £1,000 to £1,250.  That is unrealistic today.  We hear of members of boards walking in and walking out, just coming in and going away because they have not the commitment, they have not the time and they are not being compensated adequately.  Until we have a system of paying adequately for time and effort we will not get people of the right calibre to sit on the boards of those semi-State bodies.  If you have a good board, then you have good management.  I do not agree with everything Deputy Prendergast said, but I must say that a busy person who does a job well is the type of person we need in those organisations and such people must be compensated adequately and properly.</P>
    <P>The new Bill aims to encourage technology transfer, the creation of wealth and added value and to expand the international call on the Irish market by increasing exports.  However, exports are reduced and foreign borrowing is increasing in the face of deficit budgeting and unemployment.  Look at our national debt, which is in the region of £21 billion; and foreign borrowings are in the region of £8 billion.  These astronomical figures are frightening when we have such high unemployment levels.  The Bill does not appear to provide for employment of <Col N="804" /> young people or to foster small industries or encourage them in acquiring fixed assets and borrowing sufficient working capital to contribute productively to a demand economy.  While the Bill provides for certain development grants &mdash; a change from heretofore because it was prepaid to small industries in the past &mdash; now research and development will be paid about one-third, as I read the Bill, before the product is manufactured and on sale.  This is a step forward and a help, and for that reason I welcome that development.  It is an incentive to the small entrepreneur or businessman to go ahead and do a job.  It gives him the incentive of moneys which he may need. On the acquisition of high technology more useful is the provision of skills at management, marketing and design production which is the only realistic way in which an increase in jobs can be created.</P>
    <P>It is essential in the long term to develop our resources, material and human, and to identify what we can use to create jobs prior to investing in effective management.  The Bill appears to ignore job creation at this level and rather to concentrate on ensuring that benefits exceed costs in existing industries in a &ldquo;better value for money philosophy&rdquo; which is part of this Government's philosophy. As I mentioned, with increased high technology and the low rate of employment, the number of jobs created in manufacturing industry will be fewer. Linked to this, the number of serviceorientated employment prospects and the work generated in support industries will decrease.  In that area I refer to the whole area of the high technology and computerised industry which is having its effects on our employment.  While we have been encouraging it in this modern age, we must look at it more realistically. There must be other ways of creating employment and creating industrial wealth rather than going altogether down this road.</P>
    <P>The level of grants seems to be reduced in the Bill and one might feel optimistic that this will ensure that the scale of grants might be broadened to bring in more small industries.  Our whole future <Col N="805" /> depends on the small industry area.  We have seen what has happened in the USA where small industry has been developed and has been the area of job creation in the industrial sector there.  We must follow this road and we must have a special place for people who are committed to the development of small industry.</P>
    <P>A broadening of selective criteria is a welcoming development and the increase in funding available for research and development will in the long term yield more effective and efficient production, marketing and control.  However, since the facilities for borrowing in this country are prohibitive for the small businessman, a helpful provision might be to facilitate loans at a considerably reduced rate of interest.  We should be able to get a greater volume of fundings and money from the European Investment Bank and have them underwritten by our Exchequer. The high cost of money in this country is prohibitive for the initial period of any industry or any development here.  It has retarded and discouraged people who had the entrepreneurial flair.  The high level of personal taxation and service charges do not encourage the entrepreneur to enter a competitive field when local demand is severely limited because of high unemployment and there is simply not enough capital or purchasing power at present.</P>
    <P>New investment is needed to bring industrial production up to the level it was in the sixties, in the Lemass era.  The Bill does not appear to encourage new or foreign investors or to aid the local investor in enterprise development to create the growth of that period or to increase the rate of exports.  The emphasis on technology and exports might be considered a luxury when contrasted with the possibility of greater incentives and practical assistance for the small enterprise to consolidate in the absence of local demand and, therefore, to generate and increase such local demand.  Tax concessions for people who invest in localised industry should create a climate for private investment.  Our high tax rates are part of a disicentive and people who are prepared to invest locally in a business at <Col N="806" /> development stage should have a lower taxation payment and should get consideration for their courage in investing in local industry.  That is not in any of our policies and we should encourage it.</P>
    <P>In the recent budget section 84, which was an incentive to industry, is taxed and surcharged when Irish industry, especially our dairy and beef industry, can ill afford to pay the high interest rates.  Were it not for the section 84 introduced many years ago, we would not have the high level of prosperity that we have today in the area of dairying and beef.</P>
    <P>The policy of regional activity with regard to the IDA appears to be largely ignored in the Bill.  That is unfortunate because regional job targets, allocations and distribution of resources on the basis of local merit would be a greater incentive than centralised assessment and control. The IDA employ 700 people and the vast majority of these are based in Dublin.</P>
    <P>One sector of which I would not be overcritical, because it has done good work, is the IDA food sector, but this should be more regionalised.  The parts of the country where there is potential for development should be used.  I am referring specifically to Munster where there is a huge concentration of dairying and bacon processing.  We are talking about developing our bacon industry to the tune of six plants nationally throughout the country.  It is possibly a little late for this because we had to model ourselves on international markets and competition.  The Danes are among our greatest competitors.  They are export orientated, as we are.  There is a future for our pig industry with proper marketing, but that is one of our weaker areas. With regard to processing we are going in the right direction.  This is what we should have done five or six years ago, but it has taken that length of time to put our act together.  The plans were there, but we had not the necessary encouragement or leadership from those in the IDA who must have been familiar with what was happening in the competing countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" /> I will make one comment of criticism. From my information, a number of these projects will be concentrated in a fairly small area in the south east.  The original plan drawn up a number of years ago was much more realistic and was better structured from the national point of view of distribution of the factories.  It is welcome that the IDA have taken such a keen interest in this matter, that the programme is developing and that the Government have insisted that there will not be grant aid available to every crossroads development, but only for processing.</P>
    <P>Almost the entire country should be considered as a designated area in terms of the dairying criteria.  Every area gets a turn at industrial chaos and close-downs. The situation in the Cork area is very serious.  My own constituency of Cork East has the town of Mallow, up to now, a flourishing town based mainly on food processing.  Mitchelstown has suffered and also the small town of Buttevant. There has been no industrial development here in the past ten years.  Since the closure of a large county development there, the area has been crying out for industry.  People unemployed for that number of years are now on unemployment assistance and I am worried that they will have lost the work ethic.  Some industry should have been attracted to this area after that closure.  If the necessary encouragement had been given, I believe that a new food processing industry would have been started there which would have helped to alleviate the serious unemployment problem.  In the late sixties and early seventies there was a high employment rate there of about 250 out of a town population of 1,100.  I have continuously raised in the House the matter of the suffering of the people of Mallow and I want it put on the record of the House.  I have made representations throughout the constituency which have not met with any success.</P>
    <P>The new Bill does not appear to take account of areas such as tourism.  Deputy Prendergast made some good points when speaking, although I would not <Col N="808" /> agree with his philosophy.  He spoke about the Chinese and the Japanese. While the IDA do not cover tourism, there is a vast market for us to tap in Japan.  We could encourage the Japanese to come on holiday and to invest in the country.  This is one of our brightest areas of industry for attracting foreign money. China must be made an accessible market to us, but with their limited resources Bord Fáilte have not been looking into these areas.</P>

      <P>An opportunity is being missed and it is worth investigating. Mariculture and such subsidiary industries as food processing, fashion, hotels all have potential.  We then come to the forestry industry which is relatively new. We have not been taking the right decisions with this industry.  Deputy Daly as spokesman for forestry and fisheries has been promoting a very worthwhile forestry policy and continuously trying to help the processing side.  We have Woodfab, Fermoy, formerly owned by Homegrown Timbers, which is now a success. However, the real problem there is the failure of the Department of Forestry to make available adequate supplies of timber for the continuation and development of that industry.  I congratulate those who have worked in that industry which I visited on a number of occasions and which is not very far from where I live: The pricing system and the new policy adopted by the Department of Forestry are a hindrance to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If something realistic is not done in regard to an adequate supply of timber, there will only be a limited development in the processing of forestry products. We are aware of the export of small <Col N="809" /> amounts of timber, but we had vast quantities exported in the past.  I cannot understand how we cannot do what Sweden and Canada can.  We have failed to develop a good quality chipboard and surely the technology must be available.  We have the best and fastest growing timber in western Europe, which is a further help to us.  This is an area which must be further researched and State help must be forthcoming and there must be more co-operation with the Department of Forestry.</P>
    <P>Erin Foods of Mallow was one of the last semi-State manufacturing companies to be left in the food processing industry. This is facing closure in the coming days. We will see foreign carrots, cabbages and other vegetables processed and sold under the brand name of Erin Foods.  It will cost in the region of £2 million to finalise the closure of the present plant at Mallow.  No alternative industry has been found, in the food processing sector or otherwise, depite promises by Government Ministers.  I congratulate Deputy Hegarty on his appointment as Minister with responsibility for food processing.</P>

I ask that Minister to give almost all his time to procuring an industry for that very oppressed town of Mallow and to ensuring that we will see a continuation of the food industry there.  This closure is a very retrograde step and shows a lack of commitment on the part of the State. How are they going to pay redundancy money to 160 people in the workforce there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the long term, it must be recognised that an understanding of economic issues beneath the economic growth is essential to integrate the distribution of goods and services in the short term.  Education is very necessary here.  The consolidation of expenditure for training under the umbrella of AnCO might be considered an advance in co-ordinating effort at this level, and is a welcome move.  Further advance payments to small industries for research and development are a thoughtful <Col N="810" /> measure to increase the present low level of innovation in Ireland, in the context of overseas advances.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents an attempt to build on indigenous industries and to recognise the importance of overseas industry.  It appears to be a shift in resources from schemes and State agencies in order to reallocate resources to build up strength in indigenous firms.  This is effected by addressing the key problems of marketing, management and technology.  A further move is the introduction and encouragement of new schemes with a linkage programme attached.  The small industries programme and regionalisation of the IDA in the past have had good results in bringing a faster response to local industries.</P>
    <P>The better value for money philosophy should negate the notion that grants are automatic and that firms simply have to comply with certain criteria in order to receive assistance.  Both the introduction of more controlled selective criteria and the tri-annual review of enterprise projects are welcome moves on the part of the Government.  The key to development and success of industrial development lies in sound business planning and a good capital base.  The climate of industry needs to be improved at company level.  Greater investment is needed for enterprise to develop, and for the development of the country as a whole more jobs must be created which will be sustainable and productive of both marketable produce and further employment. We need to make investment available and possible.  We need to encourage the introduction of new projects and to develop the skills of people in industry in order to combat the structural weaknesses of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Though quasi social projects, such as the enterprise allowance scheme, may encourage people out of the black economy, there is little demand for local products. In some sense, such programmes could be considered in terms of reallocating work, their economic justification suspect and yet another addition to the proliferation of infinite schemes which are attempting to give credibility to selfhelp <Col N="811" /> projects and programmes.  For example, I have seen two pottery industries in one parish within a five mile or six mile radius.  In recent months in food processing we have seen four or five different manufacturers going into the spreadable butter business.  We must watch developments of this kind and we should not be giving grant aid to such programmes.  We have seen four different manufacturers at each other's throats and having law cases.  One had been a success and the others wanted to be on the bandwagon in the liqueur area. We had six or seven different liqueurs.  I understand grant aid was paid, and now we are down to two or three liqueurs. We are only damaging ourselves.  Some agency should advise against such duplication. It is the job of the IDA to lay down the law in such cases, particularly when State money is involved.</P>
    <P>Efforts like that represent little real attempt at serious job creation and it evades confrontation with the fundamental weaknesses of Irish industry.  Industrial development should be aiming at a policy designed to create more jobs, to create wealth, to seek to consolidate our own corner of international markets, and to relate incentives to performance on a selective basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Prendergast referred to the mid-west region when he was dealing with the food industry.  He spoke of the enormous success of SFADCo.  I urge that a Cork free port development authority be set up aimed at the industrial development of the area.  We have a very fine port there.  It has been the gateway to the south-east for a long time.  I appeal to the Minister to consider such a structure for the development of what is now a designated area with very high unemployment. We have seen businesses closing and all that is there now are jackdaws' nests.</P>
    <P>There has been a budget change in relation to industrial equipment.  That was a retrograde step and not in keeping with job creation policy.  Deputy Bruton, the new Minister for Finance, should look <Col N="812" /> at this again with possible deletion of this clause in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an unspectacular and non-controversial Bill, basically consolidating previous legislation in 1976, 1979 and 1981.  It is built on the Telesis report of 1981 and the industrial White Paper.  I will quote a section of the Telesis report which must be borne in mind when we are analysing the role of the IDA:</P>
      <P>A development effort aimed towards new indigenous industry must be re-organised to emphasise the building of structurally strong Irish companies rather than strong agencies to build weak companies.</P>
      <P>The IDA have served the country well but I suggest that to some extent they have got off the rails and that there are aspects of their activities that need to be examined.</P>
      <P>I believe the amount of their expenditure on administration is excessive. Section B of the Bill deals with this.  There is a simple, almost colloquial, saying going around in the business community that a number of years ago the IDA had three guys out in the field acting for one administration guy, and now the ratio is the opposite: they have three administration guys in their ivory towers at Wilton Place for every one guy out there doing the job.  In <i>Business and Finance</i> recently I spotted a colourful remark about the IDA's &ldquo;all singing and all dancing&rdquo; annual report.  I should like the Minister to convey to the IDA that we are not interested in their public relations, that we are interested only in their policy, and that they must ensure they will not become another quango, a top heavy organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill deals with designated areas.  The existing code for designated areas was based initially on the 1850 Congested District Boards legislation under the old British authority.  As with many other things like the PLV, it is antiquated and outdated for today's needs.  Subsequently there was the Under-Developed Areas Act, 1952, <Col N="813" /> amended by the Industrial Development Act, 1969.</P>
    <P>Through the NESC, the Government commissioned a report to get new criteria for designation.  The NESC report is No. 81 of 1985 and it deals with designated areas for industrial policy.  The recommendation in that report emphasises the strong need for change.  In my view, it is unfair that the county with the lowest rate of unemployment at the end of January 1986, Roscommon, with 9.4 per cent unemployment, with a total on the live register of 1,909 out of a total workforce of 20,000 should be a designated county.</P>
    <P>Similarly, Sligo had an unemployment rate of 12.4 per cent at the end of January 1986 with 2,613 unemployed, while Louth, Wexford and Wicklow, the top three countries are not designated.  Wexford has an unemployment level of 8,034, a ratio of 21.3 per cent of the workforce. It is inexplicable that the criteria going back to the nineteenth century should be in force today.  This is one bullet the Government must bite.</P>
    <P>The NESC report said in chapter 6 that the granting of designation reflected the recognition of the area's needs which are special and greater than the national average needs.  Further on it said that designation should therefore apply only to a relatively small part of the economy which is selected on the basis of its above average needs.  That is a very clear and unambiguous reason for changing the rules.  The economic problems of County Wexford are clearly greater than the national average under the criteria laid down by the NESC.  Any rational and reasonable observation of the figures will show that this matter must be moved on, and designation must be given to Wexford.  Most of the unemployed in that county are in receipt of farmers' assistance. Wexford is the worst hit county, as statistics show.</P>
    <P>I believe the White Paper covered many important areas but it missed a golden opportunity to set out explicitly a new departure for industrial development. <Col N="814" /> We should have a very active promotion policy and we should do our best to attract mobile international investment, but if we want real growth we must have a comprehensive policy for small business development.  This will not happen simply by saying small is beautiful. The Department and the IDA must address themselves to this key issue.  We need an industrial policy for small businesses because all the pointers show that the growth is in that area.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his new appointment.  Today he announced a package of 1,000 new jobs in small industries. As regards the black hole, we learned that small businesses must keep their money at home, unlike big businesses. The value to the Irish economy of small indigenous businesses is greater because we get a greater net return from them. We must discriminate in favour of indigenous industries.</P>
    <P>All the large industries in my constituency started under the small industries programme.  It must be remembered that when we are grant aiding small industries we are grant aiding a sector which has the potential to grow.  Small industries are more flexible, more durable and more adaptable in good times and in bad, and can cope with market changes much more easily than companies with larger fixed assets and investments.  I would like to tell the House the measures I think should be taken to develop the second tier of industrial policy.</P>
    <P>First I will deal with IDA aid.  I am not satisfied that the current system of grants is in the best interests of small industry development.  The small businesses committee, of which I am the chairman, strongly recommended in favour of the regionalisation of the one-stop-shop.  We will have to look at the 45 per cent fixed asset capital grant given by the IDA as it affects small businesses.  I cannot understand why approvals for grant aid cannot be given for secondhand machinery. There has been a great deal of concern about taxpayers' money.  We should not force small business to buy expensive machinery they do not want.  This puts receivers and liquidators in a position <Col N="815" /> where they can sell the assets when a company is winding down.  I feel very strongly that approval should be given for the purchase of secondhand machinery.</P>
    <P>Because of the cash flow difficulties of small firms, instead of giving an up-front payment of 45 per cent, we should give an equivalent amount of money in the form of an interest subsidy on a fixed loan over 15 to 20 years.  In other words, if a person takes out a term loan of £80,000 and if the grant aid is £24,000, that £24,000 would be fixed into the term loan and would be an interest subsidy so that he would not be affected by the changes in interest rates.  If one reads reports dealing with equity finance and venture capital, one will realise that what is needed is long term finance at a price small business can afford.  There is a need to review grants so that all grant aid could be in the form of export marketing expenditure, if required.  The White Paper moved in this direction but, in my view, even for the purposes of advertising budgets on the domestic market, IDA aid should be flexible enough to be given for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I spent the last three years studying small business development.  Small companies fail not because their order books are not full, not because they are not making money, but because they have acute cash flow problems in the second or third year of operation.  Given that the banks' collateral arrangements are crazy, that they will only lend what you already have, and even then, only if you give a personal guarantee, what we must do is alter the grant aid scheme in such a way as to make loan finance available to small firms.  I believe that a substantial degree of entrepreneurial potential is being stunted because of a lack of available finance, due mainly to a lack of financial security.  The only way to overcome this problem is by establishing a Government loan guarantee scheme similar to that in the United States and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The objective of this scheme would be to make commercial finance more readily available to new and existing small firms <Col N="816" /> on the basis that they would be a lender of last resort.  They would have to get perhaps three rejection letters from the banks.  They would need to have IDA approval as a prerequisite and that guaranteed loans would be repayble over periods of up to seven years with an initial repayment holiday of up to two years being made available.  I believe a very simple pilot scheme could be introduced for £15 million which would say that 80 per cent of the loan requirement would be guaranteed.  At the end of the day, when the IDA do their sums and the Department of Industry prepare their Estimate, it will be found that the cost is a lot less than the administration and the level of grants obtaining some of which are irrecoverable in the current situation. I am advocating that we do away with the 45 per cent grant aid on capital and instead allow an option to have an extension of the enterprise development programme to a wider sector of small business development.  That would be absolutely vital.</P>
    <P>If the purpose of granting IDA aid is to deal with the capital and equity problems of small firms or manufacturing firms generally, we must address the whole need of capital finance and loan finance for small firms.  I welcome the developments in relation to over-thecounter shares on the Stock Exchange.  I welcome the extension of the business expansion scheme.  All of these are worthwhile measures.  What we need is a simple mechanism such as a small business bond.  In the United States there is a debenture system under which one can claim tax relief if one invests small business bonds in a wide variety of companies. Briefly, it operates as follows. There are bonds of £500 which, if one is paying tax at, say, 58p in the £, means that in respect of every £1 one invests one gets back 58p.  One must keep the bond in the company for three to five years.  There is a maximum tax relief ceiling to any individual taxpayer of £10,000 and to any company of £50,000 per annum.  It is a very simple scheme.  Similar to the US debenture scheme, a small business bond here would constitute a <Col N="817" /> very simple but effective way of harnessing local personal finance into small industries and which would deal with many of the capital needs of firms that the IDA are endeavouring to address. That, coupled with approvals for secondhand machinery, with the loan guarantee scheme, with a widening of the restrictions in relation to marketing expenditure, expeditious payment of any grants, along with an option of grants per employee or for fixed assets, would form part of a new strategy for a second tier of industrial development for small firms. That is where the growth sector and the real value to the economy are to be found.</P>
    <P>It strikes me as very wrong and quite improper that the second most crucial factor of business survival here, outside of finance, is one of management and that it is not a brief with which industrial development deals at all.  The IDA have no brief or no business whatsoever in dealing with management.  All the books published, whether by the OECD, EC, all of the consultants' reports, come to the universal conclusion that, whether one is in a good or bad trading environment, faced with high or low inflation rates, high or low interest rates, the universal conclusion is that the difference between success and failure is good management, proper planning, proper financial control and proper organisation within the firm.  If we want a new generation of small industrial development, or industrial development <i>per se</i>, we must address the issue of management.  It strikes me as quite incredible that the Department of Labour, almost in isolation, can be preparing a White Paper on Manpower Policy, along with its State agencies, such as the IMI, ICC, AnCO, without reference to this Bill, when the survival of many new firms to be established and the expansion of others is dependent on good and sound management practices.  I strongly recommend that, in the same way as part of the decisions of the White Paper on Industrial Policy was to have the same board members for CTT and the IDA and to have a correlation between the two, we <Col N="818" /> must move in the same direction of integration with regard to the management field.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that when the IDA issue grant aid of any form they should have reference to and place emphasis on the assessment of the management ability or capability prior to its approval.  Part of the aid should be the &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; approach they have adopted in other countries to the extent that they will say: &ldquo;We will give you an annual or six monthly evaluation.  We will tell you where we feel your business could be running stronger.&rdquo;  We must tie those links together.  Good management must be viewed by the Government as a good investment.  There should be a significant increase effected in both the expenditure and effort on management training here. From start to finish the IDA should restate that there is a fundamental need in our economy for more management skills in small industry.  There should be a clear policy statement to address that issue.</P>
    <P>I hope those two areas can be taken up in the three year review of industrial policy as set out in the White Paper.  I might point out that section 13 of the Bill allows a Minister, to lay before this House, by way of ministerial order, what the IDA should or should not do.  It is my belief that the economic Departments of this State have been led by the nose by the State agencies under their aegis.  I believe that to a large extent the IDA wrote the White Paper on Industrial Policy.  I admit it was vetted and approved. Indeed, the principal recommendation of the Telesis report was to strengthen that Department, to ensure that the policy decisions reverted to that Department, that there was a strong grip maintained and that the directive came from the top, not the IDA leading anybody by the nose.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 16, which deals with land banks and premises, it is difficult to understand the IDA contending that they will not in any given area&mdash;in my constituency or any other&mdash;build another advance factory or buy another piece of land for land bank purposes <Col N="819" /> because they have four million square feet of advance factory space already and there is an embargo on it.  I can understand that from the sense of economics, but it strikes me as very much a Civil Service approach.  There are many such premises from which the IDA are turning people away because they are ineligible for grant aid.  Many firms have come to me&mdash;they have been manufacturing perhaps aluminium or PVC windows, engaged in certain aspects of food processing, involved in joinery, all manufacturing&mdash;but, because they are not grant aidable on account of surplus capacity, they are refused entry into these premises. Thus these premises remain idle, costing the taxpayer money&mdash;four million square feet in all.  It strikes me as only reasonable to ask the IDA, under section 16, to be less restrictive and to allow manufacturing companies which are not necessarily grant-aided into some of this advance factory space so that there can be a turnover, and industry got moving.  In many provincial towns there is no alternative proper infrastructure of an industrial nature by way of premises. Therefore, we have the worst of both worlds.  We do not have more advance factory building.  We do not have progress. There are factories remaining idle into which people want to move; but, because the IDA are too restrictive in their interpretation of the criteria, manufacturing firms cannot occupy them.  They do not want grant aid, they do not want subsidies, they just want decent premises and are prepared to pay for them.  I would ask the Minister and his departmental officials to take up that question with the IDA.</P>
    <P>I might turn now to the marketing area. I am aware, a Leas-Ceann Comhairle, that you have already ruled two previous speakers out of order in relation to marketing. Never being one to question your eternal wisdom, might I say&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that this Bill does deal with the issue of marketing?  Telesis, and <Col N="820" /> the White Paper, also deal comprehensively with marketing.  In fact, the most positive thing in the White Paper was that it said we must look to new marketing initiatives.  The CTT proposals, the market entry and development finance scheme, the group marketing scheme for small businesses and the distributor support programme were approved in the White Paper.  They are directly involved and are to the vanguard of what the White Paper was about.</P>
      <P>If we are talking about a tier of small business development as a new strategy for industrial policy, I must point out that there are aspects of marketing which the IDA, in conjunction with CTT, will need to address.  It goes away beyond the business of grafting marketing personnel, be they graduates or retired people, on a consultancy basis into firms.  It goes further than teaching modern languages in schools.  We must deal with the position on the ground.  We need a sales agency service in our overseas markets.  The problem is that small firms cannot afford to have a market presence abroad. Therefore, we must look to combining and co-ordinating small firms that are not competing with each other, the pooling of warehouse resources, such as CTT have done in Liverpool but nowhere else. Businesses should get CTT to organise a sales agency service to sell soap, handbags, sausages and other items on markets such as those in Germany on a commission basis.  Every assistance should be given by the IDA and CTT for such a move.  The State agencies should marry the two together and come up with an active solution to what is a barrier to growth in that sector.  I hope that, with the positive measures taken in the White Paper, we can go one step further on that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget decisions affecting capital allowances and the 12 per cent duty on section 84 loans undermine the purpose of the Bill before us.  There is no doubt that section 84 has not been of any benefit to the banks.  It is a benefit that has been conferred on the clients of the banks.  To put a niggardly levy on that is to cut off one's nose to spite one's face.  The <Col N="821" /> companies one is trying to help have satisfied a criteria of being the most expansionary and with the greatest potential to develop.  I would push the section 84 stronger than the capital allowances and suggest that capital allowances should only be given to the extent of the amount of money put in.  It was a move in the wrong direction.</P>
    <P>Conversely, the budgetary change about expenditure in the R and D area by way of tax relief is a commendable addition.  It is something that the Joint Committee on Small Businesses recommended. The whole area of technology acquisition, of foisting new technology on small firms, is something that will have to be addressed.  During the year the Joint Committee on Small Businesses hope to produce a report on that.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the one-stop-shop, an essential part of any industrial strategy.  If we do not get this right I do not believe we will have the type of localised development we need.  There is an anomalous position in the country in relation to county development officers. In the counties along the western seaboard county development officers are responsible to the Department of Finance. They have substantial powers and resources by way of advisory services and so on.  On the eastern seaboard the county development officers, the frontline of job creation where we have a regionalised IDA set-up, have a planning role.  The county development officer has a sort of head bottle washer role without any teeth.</P>
    <P>If we want to have localised industrial promotion and development that is meaningful to a local community we must try to harness the basic functions of development into it.  In other words, we have to have from a pooling of all the State agencies one person in a small business centre relating to the management function. That person may be from the IPC, AnCO or the IMI.  Another person should have a marketing brief, dealing with the domestic market such as those in the Irish Goods Council, or dealing with the export market, such as officials with CTT.  We need somebody with a <Col N="822" /> finance brief, from the ICC, Fóir Teoranta or the IDA, and we need a person with a development brief, from the IDA, the IIRS, county development officers or the NBST.  Those four different briefs must be put into the one-stop-shop so that it is not a question of giving autonomy to a regional board of nice guys to decide whether to give grant approvals or not.  It must be a localised advisory service that will stop this perpetual running around the southside of Dublin looking for the beautiful ivory towers to find out what schemes are available and the type of guidance and assistance that is available.  If we are serious about localised development we have got to experiment further with the one-stop-shop.</P>
    <P>We must have on the ground a coordinated service that integrates the State agency where it matters, that improves the immediacy of contact for those who need the help, and that does not duplicate the services.  It should facilitate what the Minister in the course of his speech was getting at &mdash; the company development approach.  All too often from the Department, and from the State agencies, we have the rhetoric and lip service going in the right direction; but the action on the ground, the single simplest way of getting a company development approach and a plan on a business by business and enterprise by enterprise basis, was not right.  It is not a case of getting new personnel but of redeploying existing officials along the lines of a one-stop-shop. We need a more informal and more helpful structure on the ground.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas that I could deal with in the course of this debate.  I welcome the Bill and the initiatives taken in the White Paper.  I do not think the IDA have taken on board the criticisms in the Telesis report of 1981.  They fudged some of those issues and there has been an element of complicity by the Department in that they were a part of that fudging exercise.  If the Department want to take on a new dynamic, positive and constructive approach to industrial development, they must say that they are committed to maintaining the policy of attracting and promoting international <Col N="823" /> mobile investment into Ireland which will get more and more competitive.  We have to have a second tier of industrial policy development that deals with the needs and opportunities for small business development.  Within that lies the prospect for the best return to the Irish economy and the answer to the great problem of unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other contributors to this debate, I support this non-controversial piece of legislation. We all agree with the main purposes of the Bill &mdash; industrial development and the implementation of new policy directions and incentives for industry.  I should like to pay tribute to the last speaker.  His contributions on industrial development and small industries since he was elected have been refreshing.  This evening's contribution by him was very worthwhile. Deputy Yates pointed out some of the defects in industrial development which I have noticed also.  We are embracing in this legislation all industrial development Acts passed by the House down the years and incorporating aspects of Telesis and the 1984 White Paper on Industrial Policy.</P>
      <P>I regret the fact that delays have occurred in regard to urgent matters like this. The White Paper was issued in 1984, the Second Stage of the Bill was introduced in December 1985 and is being resumed in March 1986.</P>
      <P>Section 2 merits an amendment because of the recent actions of the Taoiseach. In that section the interpretation of &ldquo;The Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism. Obviously &ldquo;Trade and Tourism&rdquo; must be deleted and I regret&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to take issue with you but I am only making a passing reference.  I regret the necessity for dropping the word &ldquo;Tourism&rdquo; because tourism had found a place within a Department where it could have been <Col N="824" /> developed to a great extent but it is now aligned with a group of other Departments.</P>
      <P>In section 3 the Minister may, by order, provide that any undertaking engaged in the provision of a service specified in the order shall be a service industry for the purposes of this Act.  I would have thought that the Minister would have been able to do so in regard to many tourist developments.  It is encouraging to note that there is an increase in our industrial exports and there is no doubt that the work of the Industrial Development Authority over the decades has been a main contributory factor.  They have been extremely successful in attracting the high-tech and pharmaceutical industries which have contributed to increased exports.</P>
      <P>I wish to pay a tribute to the Authority and staff, with whom every politician has had differences over the years, but they try desperately hard &mdash; unsuccessfully at times perhaps &mdash; and are criticised when there are failures or disasters, or when they back lame ducks which did not deserve to be backed.  Development necessitates taking risks and I would complain more about risks not being taken than taking risks which do not work out satisfactorily.  There is no doubt that the success rate has been far higher than the failure rate.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the growth of industrial exports.  Deputy Yates touched on this when he referred to the fact that, while we are discussing an extremely important Bill, many other aspects of Government also affect industrial development such as what happens in industry, its attractiveness, its competitiveness and the success of our marketing and exports. All these can be catered for outside the compass of this Bill.  I should like the Minister to address himself particularly to the impact which changes in inward processing regulations will have on 1 January 1987.  I suspect that the value we will gain from having this Bill passed will be negatived by the impact this will have on industry generally, especially the manufacturing industries to which I already referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="825" /> From an IDA point of view the attractiveness of Ireland as an industrial base is a prime consideration in selling it abroad. The tax benefits, among others, are obviously also an attraction so from 1 January next when this major change comes about in inward processing, the high-tech industry will probably be affected.  They employ about 80,000 people and some of those jobs could well be put at risk.  The Minister knows that there are difficulties in Europe at present but I understand that EC Directive 69 of 1973 has been amended by EC Directive 1999 of 1985.  The implementing regulations are being discussed and, important to industrial development as the passing of this Bill is, the implementation of these regulations is equally important to ensure that industries will not suffer because of cash flow problems arising when duty will have to be paid at point of entry and not as at present.  This could mean paying out six months in advance of the processing carried out here and then selling abroad.  The rebate can only be got back from third countries and it could take a long time to establish entitlement to such a rebate.</P>
    <P>This side of the House will be pushing very hard to ensure that industry does not suffer because of the changes likely to take place next year.  We must be vigilant in regard to EC Directives and their impact on our industrial base.  The companies who availed of the system would be exporting mostly to the European Community but also to third countries, and this new system will have a very serious impact on the cash flow of many industries.  Where the duty is paid at point of entry &mdash; as happened when Fianna Fáil were in office in the mid-sixties when a UK import deposit scheme was introduced &mdash; it should be made available at very cheap loan rates to help the industry during the intervening months to bridge the gap before the money is repaid, a suggestion which may be worth considering. This problem cannot be ignored and if we procrastinate there is a serious risk of losing existing jobs and of making our base less attractive to incoming industrialists.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="826" /> Deputy Yates spoke about the capital grant allowances and the necessity for flexibility in that regard and I agree with him.  I notice that the Bill entitles the IDA to provide rent subsidies.  The high cost of communications and electricity is an industrial burden which creates many problems and one must support the concept of giving as much flexibility as possible to the Industrial Development Authority when negotiating to ensure that the package is the best and most suitable and has the best chance of maintaining employment in the industry.</P>
    <P>I represent a city which has been devastated by job losses in the manufacturing industry.  I heard the Minister's announcement today on radio regarding 1,000 jobs for the west and that is very welcome news.  However, he made this announcement on a day when 400 jobs were lost in Shannon.  I understand that the final nail is being driven into the coffin today but Deputy Daly will be more aware of this than I am.  When one takes this loss into account and has regard also to the many other jobs that have been lost the net benefit, if any, is very small.  Successive Ministers have been announcing job numbers that bear no relationship to starting numbers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>They never tell us about the closures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In this way Ministers create false hopes.  The Minister went on in an arrogant, abrasive and confident manner to talk of the number of jobs that would be in the pipeline from the IDA within the next year or so.  In that he was going much further than any of his predecessors but I would remind him that he is not dictating now in his capacity as Minister for Justice but that he is dealing with the biggest problem facing the country, that is, the provision of jobs, an area in which this Government have failed totally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share Deputy Yates's view regarding the lack of cohesion in Government Departments.  This morning I heard a rather peculiar statement from the chief <Col N="827" /> executive of the Youth Employment Agency.  He was reported on radio as referring to people being given jobs for which they are much too highly educated. He told employers that this attitude was wrong but he did not offer an alternative. I appreciate the point he was trying to make &mdash; that a person who is too highly qualified for a certain job should not be given the opportunity of stealing that job, as it were, from someone less qualified but who was suited to the job.  However, the jobs are not available either for those who are highly qualified or otherwise. Therefore, that comment from the chief of the Youth Employment Agency was somewhat silly.  The agency itself needs a good deal of study so I would say to the chief executive and to his chairman that their first duty is to consider the problems of the agency.  While some of their schemes have been very successful, others are hairbrained schemes.</P>
    <P>From time to time we all make various requests of the IDA.  I was led to believe that special attention was given to the Cork region after all the closures there. The various agencies have been diligent in their efforts, though not so successful, in bringing employment to the area.  The only time we have any news is when the Taoiseach is visiting Cork when there is some reference in the papers to jobs in the pipeline but by and large manufacturing industry in the region has suffered very severely.  There has been a slight alternation in the designating of the area but again with little success.</P>
    <P>While emphasising the importance of industrial development, the necessity to provide as attractive as possible an industrial base and to ensure that we are competitive and well equipped technically, as I think we are, our emphasis in this Bill must be on section 29 which empowers the IDA, subject to certain conditions, to make grants not exceeding 50 per cent towards the cost of research and development projects.  Our education has made great strides in recent years but the importance of research cannot be overemphasised.</P>
    <P>Section 30 relates to the new schemes <Col N="828" /> of grants for the acquisition of technology. The area of technology is one that the IDA must concentrate on.  They have had a good deal of success in this area but we are talking of an industry that is changing rapidly.  Some of the high technology industries that set up here disappeared within a short time.  This was the case with even the biggest of them as has been experienced in this city and in the south.</P>
    <P>Forestry, fisheries and tourism are also areas of extreme importance.  Much has been said about the recent Cabinet reshuffle. In that regard I was disappointed that those three functions of Government were assigned to one Minister.  In saying that I do not intend in any way to reflect on the Minister concerned.  The point is that these are three areas with enormous potential for development.  As a member of the European Parliament it sickens me to think that our second biggest import into the Community after oil is timber and timber products.  Despite this we have not developed our forests.  We have not developed land for afforestation to the extent that might have happened.  I am not talking about the State paying for everything.  The incentive, the encouragement and the expertise have not been forthcoming.  This is an area which is wide open for development particularly because of the destruction of many of the forests in mainland Europe by the new phenomenon of acid rain.  The same applies to tourism.  We are on the periphery of Europe and while we have many difficulties relating to other industries, we have many advantages so far as tourism is concerned.  It is difficult to understand why our food development has not been more successful.  I heard the Deputy President of the IFA, Mr. Allen Gillis, on radio this morning give an excellent account of himself in relation to how we deal with the whole question of hormones.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to relate my remarks immediately to the Bill.  Mr. <Col N="829" /> Gillis emphasised the clean environment we have for food production.  Apart from exports on the hoof we do not seem to have taken the best possible advantage of that clean environment in terms of the creation of employment in the food industry.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I will be allowed to steal a little licence in the matter of referring to local problems and to draw attention to a carpet company in Youghal in which, thanks to the IDA, jobs were saved.  I accept that there are serious reasons for this and that certain commitments were made at the time the company were saved but I would ask the IDA very sincerely to re-examine that position with a view to ascertaining whether anything can be done to ensure that the jobs will be sustained. This is a good company who are trying very hard to succeed.</P>
      <P>It is becoming increasingly important for Irish industry and for jobs that the Department have more power with regard to industrial development and that there be less interference from other Ministers and from other Departments. I refer again, as did Deputy Yates to the meddling or interference with section 84. This situation together with the new interest, the tax on deposits, is undermining companies.  It is hard for people to fight for industry in the climate that exists at present.  They have my support and sympathy.  The market-place is not getting any easier.  I am talking about the market-place fighting for investment to come in.  There are many locations in the world that are being supported in very attractive ways.  I earnestly say that the Government must squeeze more tightly to ensure that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is interfered with to a lesser extent than he is inclined to be.  I am looking forward to the Finance Bill to see what it will be doing specifically on section 84 especially and the 35 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to delay the House any longer except to say that the importance of the Bill is one thing.  We have section 84 interference, the undermining of confidence with this new type of interest and the inward processing changes which <Col N="830" /> will take effect from 1 January next, all extremely important and all concerned with jobs which is what this Bill is concerned with.  I hope this Bill lifts the manufacturing industry level in my own county and city of Cork and replaces some of the many jobs that have gone. We have a wonderful base, a land bank and a deep water berth thanks to the Government before this one.  We have all those facilities.  We need more industries because we need jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and would like to say a few words, as other speakers have done, on the importance of having a sound industrial policy.  Over the past ten years there has been the increased problem of unemployment which has been with us all the time.  It seems to have got worse over the years. Our whole attitude in dealing with the problem will obviously be determined by our ability to produce an industrial policy which is capable of dealing with the situation we have on hand at present.  By way of comparison I would point out to the House that, when we talk in terms of jobs and the number of people coming on to the job market in the sixties and today, we are talking about two totally different situations.  The number of people coming on to the job market today is in the region of four to five times what it was in the sixties.  We are not comparing like with like &mdash; and there are people who do this &mdash; if we say that times are far worse and we are not producing enough jobs.  We are not producing enough jobs admittedly to cater for the job market that is there.  Certainly, we are producing many.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was mentioned by a number of people in recent times.  We have, unfortunately, a rather negative attitude to industry and industrial development.  In general, we seem to have a negative attitude which permeates right through society, through industry and through our whole way of life.  To my mind, that is one of the easiest ways to defeat the whole purpose of industrial policy or any other policy for that matter.  Things will not happen unless we make them happen. Things are not brought about by negative <Col N="831" /> people with negative thoughts or actions. Things are brought about in a positive fashion by people with positive thinking who think and act positively all the time and who believe that the people are capable of looking after themselves and providing themselves with jobs.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a discussion I had recently with a number of people, most of whom were young, who were either unemployed or had not yet got jobs.  I discovered, first of all, that they were of the opinion that they were not capable of providing themselves with jobs and, secondly, they felt they were not capable of providing other people with jobs.  That is a terrible indictment of what all of us in this House, the IDA and the various other State agencies are trying to do.  It is a failure or lack of ability on somebody's part, probably our own, to get across the very important message to those people in the market-place who have the skills, who are highly educated and intelligent that they have the resolution of this country's problems in their own hands. They have the natural ability to provide themselves with jobs and also the ability to provide other people with jobs.  Unfortunately, we do not seem to be able to fire their imagination and to tap the resource that is there.  The fault is in a number of areas.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the IDA and the other various State agencies for the manner in which they go about their difficult tasks.  Far too little credit has been given to them in the economic difficulties we have experienced over the last ten years.  It is easy to criticise when things go wrong, but we do not always come forward and hand out the bouquets when things go right which are by far the majority.  One thing which I have noticed is that there still seems to a reluctance on the part of the IDA in some quarters to take a chance.  I accept that is probably born out of a fear that something may go wrong.  That is probably the wrong attitude at present.  Unless we have such agencies who are prepared to take a chance, given the opportunities that are and have been available down through <Col N="832" /> the years, we will miss out in a very important arena.</P>
    <P>If a person has a business idea and goes along to one of the State agencies to get advice, he or she should get an immediate response.  There should be a fast and thorough follow up.  There should be no situation which has not been thoroughly investigated.  I fear, from my own experience, that there are instances where investigation of a project has not been as thorough as it should have been.  As a result, opportunities can be lost and probably are being lost.</P>
    <P>For that reason &mdash; and to a certain extent this is embodied in this Bill and the White Paper &mdash; we must be prepared to respond quickly.  We must respond quickly to the ideas that are being put forward by people who in some cases may be unemployed, who are obviously capable of doing what they set out to do, who need assistance and encouragement from the agencies, and who feel they are moving into a big bad business world which is alien and hostile to them.  It is vitally important that we give them the necessary encouragement in the early stages.  If they do not get that, they will become disillusioned and disenchanted and will go away, become introverted and say, with a certain amount of justification, that the State agencies which are there to assist them were not in a position to give that assistance or were in some way impersonal and, as a result, they continued as they were and nothing happened.</P>
    <P>Let me give a few examples.  Some time ago the Irish Goods Council referred to the area of import substitution. They outlined £1,200 million worth of goods which could readily be manufactured or processed in this country.  Some of the items which are being imported are in direct competition with items which can readily be manufactured and are being manufactured here.  There should not be any excuse for that kind of situation in a country with little more than three and a half million people.  Holland which has a population three or four times ours has been able to cater for that and to <Col N="833" /> provide its people with jobs.  I cannot understand why we are not able to fire the imagination of our people who are disposed towards setting up an industry, particularly in the manufacturing area. We are losing out badly.  We should bring the services closer to those people who might be willing to take them up.  Deputy Yates referred to the one-stop shops and I think that has been a good idea.  We need to be able to bring the assistance of the IDA, Fóir Teoranta, Córas Tráchtála and other agencies into the marketplace and into every county.  County development officers have been doing such a job to a certain extent down through the years.  The discretionary grants which are available to county development officers in the western region are not available in the eastern region.  Those people are restricted in what they can do.  They should think in terms of going into every major town in an effort to ensure that the people who are likely to set up an industry become aware of what is available to them.  They should give assistance on an ongoing basis rather than dispense it from a national headquarters where the information very often lies untouched for a long time.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of people in the small business sector who do not get sufficient advice from those services.  For instance, people who become redundant and have a reasonable amount of money should be taken into the confidence of those services and given whatever assistance is available.  They should be encouraged to set up in industry.  It is no good saying that if you encourage people into one line of manufacturing it will cause a snowballing effect and put somebody else out of business.  The IDA and other agencies are aware of what is available in the marketplace and of where the openings are.  They should be prepared to work with those people who become redundant and who may have particular skills.  They should encourage them to set up their own business.  This would not only alleviate their own problem but also the problems of others.  There is an old and very true saying that self-help is one's best preparation.  One of the reasons we have <Col N="834" /> problems in relation to manufacturing <i>vis-á-vis</i> import substitution is that we do not recognise that we can do things ourselves.  We do not want to go to the trouble or the pain, financial or otherwise, of moving into that arena.  This is something we should do as a matter of urgency, otherwise we will have nobody to blame but ourselves.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the processing of grants and grant applications in regard to feasibility studies and R and D grants.  A little more speed and positive thinking would be of great assistance to the unfortunate applicants in some of these cases. If a business is in existence and comes under trading pressure or some similar problem and they require assistance &mdash; they may qualify for research and development grants &mdash; it is important that they be responded to quickly.  The trading situation not only in this country but throughout the world changes so quickly that unless people get a quick response it may be to no avail.  Very often when assistance comes, it comes too little and too late. That is something which could and should be rectified.  While recognising the tremendous work done by the IDA and other agencies, they should try to ensure that they speed up this work because time does not stand still and in the business world nobody will wait for them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates also referred to the question of people in plush offices in the city. That is not where the bulk of the work should be done; it should be done where the individuals with the ideas for setting up an industry are and where assistance is needed.  These people will respond if they are given the impetus from the official quarters.  In my own constituency I had the experience of a large processing plant being sold on the market and nobody got any information, neither the IDA nor the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, as to who bought it, or for what purpose it was bought.  I wish to comment on the undesirability of that situation.  The IDA and other agencies give a considerable amount of assistance to firms such as that. I am not saying that this firm has been the greatest beneficiary but anybody <Col N="835" /> disposing of a major industrial operation should at least have the courtesy to tell the people who originally funded them to whom they propose to sell and for what purpose the sale is taking place.  They should have the common courtesy to tell the people who have worked for them for 20 or 30 years what they propose to do with the plant.  As part of our industrial policy we should ensure that in other instances firms, particularly firms who have had the benefit of IDA assistance, do not assume a dictatorial attitude and decide that they can dispose of their plant to whoever they please for whatever purpose they consider right.  They should consider that they have a duty and responsibility to the bodies from which they got assistance and also to their employees &mdash; and they should not be allowed forget it.</P>
    <P>The way to win success in the industrial arena, in the field of tourism or in the production of a service is to provide a good product and a good service and to ensure that the customer is as far as possible satisfied.  The customer will always remember the time when he received shoddy treatment or an inferior product.  If we did nothing else in industrial policy except instil in manufacturers a pride in the product they are selling, it would be the biggest single contribution we could make towards ensuring that we have a good sound basis for future industrial policy.  Manufacturers, workers and consumers should recognise that.  Consumers also have a duty.  They should bring it to the attention of manufacturers when they get an inferior product or when they are treated in an offhand fashion by somebody providing a service or working in an industry.  If we have a good service and a good product we will gain international recognition for providing a quality product on the market.  That is something we should always strive for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I cannot be very enthusiastic about this legislation which, while it has some desirable aspects, does not provide us with the dynamic mechanism needed to tackle and resolve our huge <Col N="836" /> employment problem.  There are difficulties throughout the economic sector and this legislation has not the necessary power to deal vigorously with employment. All I see in this Bill is a shift in emphasis from fixed assets and the reequipment grants into the development of modern technology and scientific innovation.  That is welcome, but we need a combination of many factors, including things not in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I suspect this Bill when I recall that it was tabled at about the time when we were concluding the Second Stage of the National Development Corporation Bill. This was a response from the IDA and the Minister for Industry and Commerce at that time.  The National Development Corporation Bill, originally promoted by the Labour Party after long discussion, was totally watered down.  During the course of the debate on that Bill the Minister intervened to say that he would have to draw up an agreement between the IDA and the NDC to ensure that there would not be duplication and overlapping or disputes between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This IDA Bill has been talked about for some time.  There was a White Paper on it in 1984, which was discussed for some time, and legislation was promised by the Government three or four years ago.  This legislation is now before us, but it is a major disappointment.  There is no new direction here.  There is no shortage of organisations working in industrial promotion to implement the ideas proposed in this Bill.  I am glad that there will not be duplication between the NDC and the IDA because we cannot afford it.  As I say, there is no shortage of bodies or organisations in the area of industrial promotion.  We have the IDA, SFADCo, the county development teams, Údarás na Gaeltachta, CTT, ICC, the Youth Employment Agency, the enterprise boards, the new regional boards which will be set up under this legislation, Manpower, AnCO, BIM and so on.  In many of these agencies there is a complete waste of human resources, and there is overlapping and a waste of scarce financial resources.  We need to mobilise experts in these areas at a time when we <Col N="837" /> have scarce financial resources, but we cannot afford duplication or overlapping. We need more vigorous co-ordination between these organisations to get the best possible results for the money being spent.  No one could be satisfied with our industrial promotion effort at the moment.  How could we be when we see huge bills for food imports, food which we could successfully grow at home? There is a huge bill for fish imports while our fish and fish products are being dumped, and we see timber imports at a cost of £500 million to the state when the timber could be successfully grown here. At the same time we have huge employment and structural problems.  A person in his proper senses would ask &ldquo;What are all the agencies and Government Departments doing?&rdquo; Is it not time, after all the discussion we have had here on industrial development, that we did something constructive to tackle the problems in the economy.  At the same time the problems become worse and unemployment worsens by the day and company after company closes down while we have a huge volume of imports that we could produce successfully and develop here at home.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives us an opportunity to restate what we have stated on many occasions &mdash; the need to maintain jobs. Lacking in this legislation is any provision of significance which will enable the agencies involved in the creation of employment opportunities to endeavour to maintain those jobs once they are created.  In this regard I want this evening to refer again to the closure a few weeks ago of the bus building company in Shannon with the loss of 400 or 450 jobs.  Here we have a unique development in the mid-west region where a bus building company were established and where it was clear and obvious that buses would be required for the school transport system, the city bus services, rural bus services and coaches.  At present we are importing coaches under lease arrangements with CIE while our bus building plant is being closed down.  The philosophy behind the development of the bus building operation in Shannon was that, first, it would meet the requirements of <Col N="838" /> our economy for buses for the foreseeable future and, in addition, that it would develop export orders and export business which would enable the company to be firmly established in the mid-west and to prosper.  There were complaints at the start.  People in other parts of the country felt that they alone were the people capable of building buses, but in Shannon in that magnificent experiment it was proved that buses could be produced at a cost competitive price that would equal anything that could be got in any part of Europe, that 400 jobs could be provided in the company before they were slimmed down to their present 200, and that hundreds of other jobs could be created in industries supplying component parts.</P>
    <P>Here is one area which has been identified by the IDA, SFADCo and all the agencies involved in the promotion of industrial development here.  This linkage that we must have between either multinational industry or local manufacturing industry will enable the component parts to be supplied as far as possible from within one region or one country and we will save huge bills in the import of component parts to be used in operations such as the company in Shannon that I have spoken about.  That company did exactly what was the policy of the Government, the Department, the IDA and SFADCo.  They farmed out the component parts to small industry in the region where small manufacturing companies were established.  This is the ideal project that we have talked about for years.  We have highlighted here on numerous occasions the American experience that small is beautiful and that small industry established and running alongside major industrial developments, whether they be multinational or Irish, could provide a gainful opportunity in supplying these component parts for the manufacturing industry or whatever. Here we had alongside the GAC plant a variety of small companies established by many young people who put their whole life savings into these enterprises, who had the practical experience of working in industry within the Shannon region, who took up jobs after they left vocational <Col N="839" /> school or other colleges in the area and went into manufacturing industry in SFADCo.  Then because of their experties and because they saw the opportunities and openings for the establishment of such operations they set up these small industries supplying companies like GAC at Shannon with the small parts so necessary for the survival of that company, and found useful opportunities for many people and a very valuable return for their investment in the establishment of these small enterprises.</P>
    <P>Now there is total devastation there. How can we ever again talk to people in the mid west region, the Shannon area in particular, about setting up small industry to service multinational operations or other organisations or companies under the linkage scheme which is being talked about?  How can you encourage any young businessman to mortgage his house in some cases and invest his whole life savings in the establishment of an industry to supply a company which was underwritten by the State?  The State needed a huge volume of buses in this case and there was an indication that the long term future of this company would be assured because we needed to supply our own market with buses.  We needed to replace 800 school buses.  In the school fleet alone over the next three or four years there was a viable business opportunity that they could be associated with and they could pledge their whole life savings, their work and endeavour and their future in that area.  Now they are totally devastated.  Is it any wonder that they have been here now since before Christmas?  They picketed Leinster House.  They came in here in deputations and their claim is that they are being treated shabbily because the company have been allowed to close and within 12 months, perhaps less, this summer, under the leasing arrangements which CIE have in operation, foreign coaches will be imported here.  The opportunity of supplying markets here is being thrown away because this Government have neither the courage nor the financial commitment to support that project and put it <Col N="840" /> on a viable footing and give them the orders they need so badly.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to talk to young business people in that area about creating small companies and getting support from the IDA, SFADCo or whatever when they find that the industry in which they have invested is allowed to disintegrate before their very eyes, and this Government stand idly by without lifting a finger to solve the problem.  At this late stage I call on the Minister of State and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who comes from the region and who knows well and understands fully the case I have been making and who was very vocal as a Deputy a few years ago, in 1982 when this industry was in difficulty, when the Government at that time came to the rescue to resolve the problems in the bus building plant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister might have some worthwhile interjection to make but it looks as if he is continuing the same kind of policy we have seen from this Government which is negative and defeatist.  They are throwing away opportunities.</P>
      <P>We are talking about exploiting opportunities. People all afternoon have been mentioning journeys to Japan and China but I would direct the Minister's attention to Shannon where he could do something positive and worthwhile now.  He would not have to learn hieroglyphics, either. This is a simple problem which needs to be dealt with and dealt with urgently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate that and I thank the Minister of State for meeting that deputation at a time when the Minister walked away and was not prepared to meet them although he knew full well what the situation was.  It would have been far more honest if the Minister for Communications had had the courage to meet that deputation and explain the position in relation to the company, rather than evade his responsibilities.  He put the Minister of State in to do the work which was not that Minister's responsibility at the time.  At that time the company were in production and in operation and there was no necessity for any intervention by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Full marks to the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce for standing in when the Minister for Communications had not the courage to tell the workers the position.  We are still looking to that Minister to do something positive and worthwhile in that area and he can do this.  It has been explained on numerous occasions that a formula can be found which will save the jobs of the 400 employees concerned and it could even at this late stage prevent the closure of the company.  The Minister was very hopeful on a previous occasion when the company were in difficulties and took action to save the jobs there.  I do not want to dwell too long on this aspect.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking to the Bill.  It is very relevant to legislation of this nature. The Minister said that the legislation was designed to create employment and maintain jobs, both manufacturing jobs and international services.  Those comments of his are on the record of the House.  Surely the Minister can move in and maintain jobs.  We are not talking about international services we are talking <Col N="842" /> about manufacturing jobs, providing school buses and saving a transport system which is now in a shambles, with the Government again running away from their responsibilities.  The Government have treated this company and their employees shamefully.  I ask the Government at this late stage to rectify the situation and avoid closure.  I ask them to organise the company and produce a formula with the company and the workers to save the jobs and, above all, secure buses for this country and exploit the opportunities for export.  They must first provide city and rural buses and a school bus system.  Something like £6 million is being capitalised to invest in the importation of coaches when we have our own coach building plant closing down, putting up the shutters and forcing people to sign for redundancy payments and unemployment assistance when they do not wish to do so.</P>
      <P>I regret that in the entire IDA strategy of recent times, as in this legislation, there has been a shift away from the IDA policy successful since the inception of that authority of setting down targets for industrial promotion in the different regions in which they had control.  While one might argue that they did not reach their targets on numerous occasions and had to revise and change these targets, we must get back to that form of policy. We cannot have a blanket target for the whole country.  The White Paper talks of something in the region of 3,000 to 6,000 jobs in manufacturing employment spread over a year.  This is not specific. There is a very big difference.  Will it be 3,000 or 6,000?  Can the Minister give us some indication when replying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that in the next few years the IDA in their promotion of industry in the different regions are not scrapping completely the system which they had in operation of targeting jobs for the different areas and trying to achieve those results during the course of the plan.  I live in a remote part of the mid west region, in the south west, Loop Head peninsula area and I do not want to see the remoter areas losing out on job creation. <Col N="843" /> We want a target to be set down for all the regions within an area and as far as possible the achievement of that target, either through the building of advance factories and direction of industry into those regions or whatever incentive is necessary to encourage investment and development in those isolated areas.  We cannot allow a situation in which people are moving from the regions into the centralised authority and that is happening in the IDA.  There seems to be a centralisation of that authority's operations in the Dublin office.  We see the regions being played down and the status and decision-making of the regional managements being undermined by decisions being taken at national level.  If that is happening, we certainly want to see an end to it.  Originally the intention was that, for example, the office in the mid west region would make the decisions at local level for themselves but that seems to have changed in the last couple of years.  The direction seems to be to centralise as much as possible and give as little power as possible to the regions. That is a backward step and if this trend is developing in the Industrial Development Authority, let them change it.  The people who should make decisions about industries in a region are the people of that region.  More power should be given to the regional management to establish agencies and make decisions rather than having the Dublin-based IDA office or the Minister dictating the pace, setting the scene and firing the shots.</P>
    <P>We see under section 4 of the Bill a designation of the areas by the Minister under ministerial order and section 6 requiring the Minister to prepare a review of industrial performance every three years, which is desirable.  However, it is the Minister who is involved.  Why can the regions not prepare their own review? Let us see at local level what is being done.  We do not want any blanket, overall review being done in head office and dished out with no detailed information available of what is happening in each locality.  Section 10 provides for the Industrial Development Authority being <Col N="844" /> responsible to the Minister and section 12 is concerned with the delegation of the Authority's functions.  It is under that section that the regional sub-committees will be established.</P>
    <P>I would like some clarification from the Minister on whether he is under that section giving some power to the regions, or is it just power in name?  I cannot determine whether it is the intention to set up small regional boards, what authority they will have, how they will relate to the overall industrial strategy and who will be represented on the boards.  Will public bodies have representation, or will it be just nominees of the Minister?  The same applies to section 13, and section 25 gives more power to the Minister.  This Bill is a complete and total takeover by the Minister of the IDA and the running down of the autonomy which the agency always had in making decisions regarding the different areas.  The legislation shifts the money around, gives a bit here and a bit there, but there is no overall expansion in that regard.  The heavy hand of the Minister is coming in, obviously attempting to get his fingers on the Industrial Development Authority and the industrial agencies.  That is something about which I am not too enthusiastic.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the importance of small companies and the need to provide as much financial expertise as possible for these companies who often cannot afford it.  It is very expensive for any small business to have access to this type of expertise which is so necessary to enable the companies to survive and prosper.</P>
    <P>It should be possible for the IDA or some agency, with the help of local authorities, to provide a blanket system of financial expertise which would be made available jointly to groups of small companies who would then be able to avoid the necessity individually to provide themselves with such financial expertise.  In the whole of the service industries we are losing millions of pounds because we are not able to produce components for the multinationals, for the computer industry.  We have lost magnificent opportunities in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="845" /> This should be possible if small companies were provided with some financial assistance and financial expertise by the IDA or SFADCo.  It is not financially possible for small companies to provide themselves with expertise individually. This Bill could be useful from that point of view.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also useful because it draws attention to marketing.  I do not want to repeat what has been said on this subject but we must pay more attention to developing our marketing.  Still, one of the first actions of the Government on taking office was to cut by £1 million the funding of CTT.  I do not know the exact figure for that first year but I understand the CTT budget was cut by £1 million.  I had an opportunity in 1982 to promote the sale of Irish fish in Cairo but I found there was nobody who could help in that entire area.  There was only one agent, working on a fee basis, to cover most of Egypt and all of Africa.  The Egyptian authorities told me in 1982 that they would be prepared to enter into an agreement with us and they would have taken all our surplus fish under a trade agreement. However, as I have said, there was only one agent covering the whole of Africa and Egypt.  He could not give a full service to Irish industries; he did not have a chance because if the Danish Government or somebody else could play a bigger part that man would not be able to promote the Irish case at all.  That is most unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to support the Government in any initiative they may take to provide new markets and finance for an agency to market Irish goods abroad.  If we could produce quality commodities at the right price and can guarantee delivery on time, we could sell almost anything anywhere.  At the time of the Cairo promotion I met a person from Galway who was selling in Egypt, representing Cross, Ballinasloe, who could sell because he was able to deliver on time and could give a back-up service.</P>
    <P>We need manpower in our marketing efforts, not the twopence-halfpenny efforts the Government are putting into it.  We must put more effort in future into <Col N="846" /> design and after sales service and all this must be backed up by finance to enable our firms to do it properly.  We cannot do it if we cut back on the budget of the very organisation we should be taking care of, CTT.  We cannot expect them to go out to market our goods and to make opportunities for us in circumstances of that kind.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that I am not enthusiastic about this Bill.  There is a proposal in one section to establish management committees on industrial policy which will be chaired by the Department &mdash; more departmental and ministerial control of industrial policy.  Our aim should be to have these committees providing local knowledge for local needs, chaired by people who know what the disadvantages are.  However, it appears that such commitees will be centralised in Dublin.  That should be changed and those committees should be chaired at local level throughout the regions.  Those committees should work with the people who are concerned with regional development.  I ask the Minister to tell us what are his intentions in this matter, will those committees be centralised in Dublin or based locally?</P>
    <P>There are other sections with which I am not happy and I should particularly like to know the impact of section 21 which sets out the new selectivity criteria under which the IDA will be empowered to make grants towards the cost of fixed assets.  The IDA will have to take into account a number of issues other than the operations of the company and the product it will be marketing and its prospects of long term viability.  A series of criteria will be considered which heretofore were not taken into account.  That will have to be done in a flexible but positive manner.  The emphasis in this legislation seems to be to shift from fixed assets to technical acquisition.  That is desirable but we should not try to get away from the idea of supporting fixed assets.  This would be very important in areas where it is very difficult to locate industries.  While it might be attractive to set up an industry in SFADCo, it is much more difficult to do so in isolated regions, particularly in the western counties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="847" /> There is a need to continue the system which has been in operation up to now and to provide substantial grants for fixed assets.  It is much more attractive to establish an industry near a city or industrialised areas, but we should not do anything that would be to the disadvantage of setting up an industry in isolated areas.  The Minister should take into account the fact that there are physical problems in locating an industry in isolated rural areas &mdash; telecommunications problems, bad roads and poor infrastructure. We have to provide some attractions for these areas; otherwise there will be no prospect of creating any jobs in the west.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House any longer, but I believe my comments have been constructive.  This legislation is weak and will not revitalise industry.  I consider that this legislation is the response by the Minister and the IDA to the National Development Corporation. We want more jobs but we do not want to see the spectacle of one State agency competing with another.  We do not want any overlapping in this area.  The Minister should be very careful because, if this is allowed get out of control, our industrial development will take a step backwards. As I said, this is a weak and feeble Bill introduced by this Government to tackle a chronic situation.  The Government have lost a major opportunity to provide a constructive framework for industrial development over the next ten or 15 years.  They have lost the opportunity to exploit the potential in many areas, particularly in the economic area, and to develop our own resources so that we need not import goods, but can create employment, as we are doing at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  The former Minister, Deputy John Bruton, when introducing this Bill was continuing the industrial policy discussed in the White Paper published in July 1984.  At that time the Minister set out objectives and means of examining industrial performance and policies.  He has done <Col N="848" /> major work in consolidating a great deal of legislation.</P>
      <P>The Irish are very conservative and this was noticeable when one listened to the Opposition speakers who seemed to be totally against change.  They appear to be happy with the way the IDA are performing. Although the Minister has retained a great deal of what was in other legislation, he has made three significant omissions from the previous Acts.  It is worth recalling the legislation which has been consolidated.  In the Explanatory Memorandum, the Minister says:</P>
      <P>... The Bill will therefore repeal and re-enact, with amendments, the Industrial Development Authority Act, 1950, the Industrial Development Acts, 1969 to 1981, the Undeveloped Areas Acts, 1952 to 1969, and the Industrial Grants Acts, 1959 to 1969, omitting provisions which are obsolete or no longer necessary.  The most significant provisions being omitted are:</P>
      <P>(i) IDA's powers to provide and arrange housing for employees in industry; (Sections 11 (iv) and 16 of the Industrial Development Act, 1969);</P>
      <P>(ii) IDA's powers to pay reequipment grants (Section 38 of the Industrial Development Act, 1969); and</P>
      <P>(iii) IDA's powers to investigate the effects of protective measures and to examine proposals in relation to the imposition or revision or tariffs, quotas or other protective or developmental measures and to summon witnesses in this regard;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very concerned about the closure of GAC in Shannon.  The policy which established the setting up of that company at Shannon has not been questioned. This company are giving employment to many of my constituents, both directly and through the small industries programme.  I am concerned that the Government do not appear to be providing the necessary funds and I appeal to the Minister to have the position reviewed before anything final is done in <Col N="849" /> the Shannon area.  This company have provided many opportunities for unskilled workers.  While this company have not yet got any export orders, it appears that a breakthrough is imminent.  They have sent a prototype bus to Darlington, Britain, and they believe they have reasonable prospects of success.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to convey to the Cabinet the concern of the people in my constituency about the possible closure of this company.  The IDA have provided a tremendous service for this nation.  At one time there was a drift from the land and people had to emigrate.  In their efforts to tackle this problem, previous Ministers utilised the IDA to the best of their ability.  Changes in technology and different skills which have developed over the past few years have meant that the Minister had to review the situation and he asked the IDA to put greater emphasis in different areas.  I believe our greatest asset is our well educated workforce. They have a temendous grasp of the new technology.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the arbitrary and precipitate decision of the Government to close down Carysfort <Col N="850" /> College and requests that immediate action be taken to ensure that this great and valuable institution be retained as an integral part of our higher educational system, with a specific role in teacher education.</P>
    <P>Ar an gceád dul síos, déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Teachta Cooney as ucht a cheaptha mar Aire Oideachais le déanaí. Tá comhghairdeas tuillte freisin ag an Teachta Enda Kenny de bharr a thofa mar Aire Stáit sa Roinn chéanna.  Is cúis áthais agus cúis bhróid domsa mar urlabhraí do Fhianna Fáil ar chúrsaí oideachais an rún seo a chur os comhair na Dála anocht, go háirithe as ucht an clú agus an cháil tá bainte amach ag Coláiste Carysfort ar fud na tíre.</P>
    <P>I wish to place on the record my personal congratulations and those of my party to the new Minister for Education, Deputy Patrick Cooney, a constituency colleague of mine from LongfordWestmeath. I wish him well in his tenure of office.  I wish to extend my congratulations also to the Minister of State at the same Department, Deputy Enda Kenny, and to wish him well in the onerous but, I am sure, rewarding task ahead of him working in close consultation with the Minister.  I should like to place on record also the honour and pleasure it gives me as spokesperson for my party formally to move this motion.</P>
    <P>I have been very heartened by the many amendments put down to this motion.  If proof were needed that education is such a lively, interesting and vital topic in every day life in Ireland that is evident from the fact that the Government have put down an amendment in the name of the Minister for Education. There is another in the name of The Workers' Party and latterly there is one also from the Progressive Democrats. Therefore it is one of the few ocasions on which each party have participated in a debate such as this.  I welcome the fact that there is such interest shown by all parties in this matter.</P>
    <P>When perusing the various amendments to the motion, it struck me that each of the three, the one in the name of <Col N="851" /> the Minister, that in the name of The Workers' Party and that in the name of the Progressive Democrats, while very worthy and well-intentioned &mdash; as is illustrated by the words they have used &mdash; fights shy of mentioning words like &ldquo;teacher training&rdquo;, &ldquo;teacher education&rdquo;, &ldquo;pre-service education&rdquo;, and of those words which mean that an element of Carysfort College should be maintained as turning out primary school teachers.  I cannot put it any plainer.  I should say that various terminologies are bandied about.  One often hears of teacher training, of teacher education, of pre-service training but all mean the one thing &mdash; equipping young men and women in this country to be primary school teachers. That is essentially what Carysfort College has been doing over a great number of years.  They have been doing so in their present abode since 1903.  Prior to that they did so from their Baggot Street premises for a great deal longer.</P>
    <P>When this issue broke four weeks ago and when I was engaging in research for this debate I was fascinated by the history of the Sisters of Mercy and to learn what they had contributed not alone to the educational scene but in truly historical sense to the social fabric of this country.  In the course of this debate it is only correct that we pay tribute to that tradition, history and culture which was begun so many years ago by Mother Catherine McAuley.  By way of a gentle aside, for no other reason but to show my deep interest in the subject, I should say I came across a very interesting personal historical fact.  My grandfather on my father's side was a primary school teacher.  He was married twice.  His first wife was a graduate of Baggot Street, of the early Mercy Convent.  She taught with him in a small two-teacher school in County Clare.  She died early in life.  Later he married one of the first graduates of Carysfort College.  In speaking here this evening I feel I am representing much of what happened in the past and what I hope will continue in the future for this very historic establishment.</P>
    <P>The case before us this evening is that <Col N="852" /> of Carysfort College and what should or should not happen this great college.  I would appeal to the new Minister for Education to consider carefully the case we put forward here this evening, to retain Carysfort College as an integral part of our higher education system, with a specific component role in teacher education.</P>
    <P>I regret greatly &mdash; indeed it is a matter of great regret thoughout the country &mdash; that the Government, by their contradictory actions and statements on the Carysfort College issue, created conflict, heightened tensions, giving rise to uncertainty and doubt not alone among the student staff and management of the college but throughout the country where the name of that college is hallowed and respected.</P>
    <P>It was exactly four weeks, not alone to the day but to the date, that I asked in this House at 3.45 in the afternoon what were the Government's intentions with regard to Carysfort College.  Let me immediately remove any cloud that might surround the question I asked, as the Ceann Comhairle graciously allowed me to do on the Order of Business, and which I had every right to do as spokesperson for my party.  Four days later I noticed that Young Fine Gael castigated both the Archbishop of Dublin and myself for, as they contended, having exploded this issue.  I have never met His Grace, the Archbishop of Dublin.  I hope I shall some time.  I greatly admire things he has said and done.  I have never met him nor he me.  We have never communicated; we have never spoken directly to one another or through intermediaries.  I want that clearly stated.  As that week went on I understand that the Minister sought &mdash; by way of various television, radio and press statements &mdash; to put across different versions of how she would have announced the closure of the college had she been given <i>carte blanche,</i> so to speak, without my &ldquo;interference&rdquo;.  My &ldquo;interference&rdquo; was because I sought to raise this issue on the floor of this House where we are constantly told matters of importance to the country should be first aired.  I sought to raise it where, as of right, I felt <Col N="853" /> it should have been raised.  An historical analysis will show that when I raised it the information had already been imparted to all the relevant authorities concerned about this matter.  Therefore, rather than anticipating the event I followed it.  It is a matter of regret that a grouping that from time to time imagines itself to be in the forefront of social and liberal issues has chosen to completely misinterpret what happened and put false statements on the record.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister's amendment is well intentioned but it is too vague for everybody concerned.  It does not have a specific commitment written into it.  I understand that the Minister will be making his contribution tomorrow night and it may be that he will elaborate more fully on the intentions in his amendment.  If it is his intention to retain a commitment to teacher education we will be glad.  If that specific commitment is given it may be that there will not be a need for a vote on the motion. A vague undefined policy about the future of the college will not satisfy the public.  Like many others it is my belief that it would be economic, social and educational folly to close the college. Fianna Fáil feel that Carysfort must be retained as a dynamic enhanced centre for education.  The board of the college have readily acknowledged the need for a new vision for the future for their establishment. Their vision is not a dream that cannot be attained; it is practical, comprehensive and, above all, can be implemented.</P>
    <P>When the dispute arose four weeks ago the board of the college were very hurt. Those people had put forward a carefully prepared scheme for rationalisation to the Department and while part of the proposal had been discussed other elements had not.  As a result there was disappointment by the board of management. Those people acknowledge that the proposals for rationalisation can be implemented.  The topic for discussion tonight is the contribution of the Sisters of Mercy over the past 150 years.  They were involved in the monitorial system at first and later in the full education training <Col N="854" /> sense.  A commitment to people over 150 years cannot be thrown away lightly. What Carysfort is good at is teacher training, its essential role down the years.  The college wishes to retain a specific role in teacher education allied to other third level education courses.</P>
    <P>When we talk about how advanced women are, about the chartering of new territory, the climbing of new frontiers and use feminist terminology we forget that Mother Catherine McAuley, and her sisters in religion, were liberated before the term was ever coined.  The young women who went through their training schools, at Baggot Street or Carysfort, returned to their communities to become figures of leadership and motivators. When the history of the role of women in Ireland is written the part played by the religious pioneers should be clearly identified.  The first priority of the Mercy Order was the care of the poor and that led Mother McAuley, and her sisters, to believe that they could best help the disadvantaged through education.  It was their view that the less well-off should be given the opportunity for advancement through the national school system.  The qualifications bestowed by Baggot Street and, later by Carysfort gave women teachers a status which they took back to their communities and made them leadership figures.  The term women's liberation had not been coined but those women teachers knew what it was to achieve and wield power in the sense of motivation, of leadership, of induction into education.  They experienced the joy of seeing the interaction of their work with their pupils brought to fruition as the young men and women became the leaders in society in the early twenties.</P>
    <P>I have always held that nuns are the most marvellous realists in the world. They have coped with the changing circumstances of life, have become managers and dynamic people in their own way.  The Sisters of Mercy at Carysfort are well aware that there will be fewer children going through the primary school system in the future.  It would be very foolish of me, and would not be sustainable as an argument, if I advoager <Col N="855" /> cated that we should continue Carysfort solely as a teacher education college.  We are all aware that falling birth rates will result in fewer pupils going through the national school system but we cannot say that because of that our pupil-teacher ratio problems in such schools will vanish. They will not.  Our objective should be to establish a better pupil-teacher ratio. We should never become complacent about that.  Between 1977 and 1981 the Fianna Fáil Minister for Education, Deputy John Wilson, set about lowering the pupil-teacher ratio but that work has been halted.  We should work to improve that ratio all the time.  The fact that pupil numbers will fall should not lead anybody to say that we do not need an improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio.  I recognise that falling numbers will pose a problem but, like everything else in life, adversities have opportunities in them.</P>
    <P>The board of the college rose to the challenge put to them swiftly and with great intellectual acumen.  With their experts they prepared a plan for rationalisation which they presented to the Government for consideration.  Because the brief given to the Order by their Foundress was teacher education, it has been an essential part of the work of the Mercy Order since.  Such a brief cannot be ignored.  Carysfort and, before it, Baggot Street have been carrying out this work very well for more than 150 years. When I drew up our document, Education &mdash; The Early Years, I said very clearly that the falling birth rate would have an effect on the future role of teacher training colleges.  We, therefore, proposed that the surplus capacity in colleges of education &mdash; this was exactly a year and a half ago &mdash; should be used to provide a comprehensive range of in-service courses for all teachers allied to a component role for teacher education.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the facilities of Carysfort College which should be addressed in the broad scope of this debate is that of the Curriculum and Examinations Board.  I do not think it should be sited in Carysfort, as has been suggested, because it was announced by <Col N="856" /> the former Minister that the headquarters of the board would be in Athlone.  It would be very foolish of me to say that that should be changed, and I know that the Minister would not dream of doing so. However, the setting up of the statutory Curriculum and Examinations Board, which is due to be enacted through legislation in this session, has suggested far-reaching changes in the curriculum and examination system at second level.  The Government, the Opposition, pupils, teachers and boards of management agree that there should be changes in the curriculum and we look forward to the legislation coming before us.</P>
    <P>The setting up of that board means that there will be a great need for huge ongoing and regular professional help to assist teachers to cope in an ever-changing and more demanding society.  I know what that means because, before I was elected to this House, I was a teacher and even at that stage &mdash; four years ago &mdash; the world was changing rapidly.  While I know that there is need for change in the curriculum, we will be proceeding <i>festina lente</i> because it must be very well thought out.  Nobody, least of all the Department, expects teachers to go into the classroom when the changes are brought about, albeit gradually, particularly in the element of assessment of examinations, without adequate preparation.  New subjects are proposed, including new mathematics, changes in literature, different languages, aural and oral elements of European languages, increasing emphasis on project work and continual assessment. Many of these changes are already taking place through experiments.  With the setting up of the board these changes will become more evident and prolific, but they cannot come about without teachers constantly attending in-service courses.</P>
    <P>There is no other job which requires men and women to work for up to 40 years without renewal or reinvigoration. Generally speaking, second level school teachers have very few areas of in-service training.  From time to time primary school teachers have opportunities in this regard, but this does not apply at second <Col N="857" /> level except in the case of those run by the various disciplines such as the history society, history teachers' association or the language teachers' association.  They do their best but they operate within very limited means.  With the advent of the board there is a huge need for courses for teachers which Carysfort College could provide.  They already run some of these courses and are adaptable to change.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to note the Minister's visit to Carysfort last week.  I was there about two years ago at a function and had the pleasure of visiting it again within the last few days.  I saw the convent and the college and I was very impressed by the people with whom I spoke and the general atmosphere.  I was also very impressed by the modern equipment and infrastructure which is being added to the college and which makes it one of the foremost centres for education throughout Europe.  There is marvellous technological equipment, theatres, lecture rooms, electronic equipment, videos and television.  There are acres of knowledge which could contribute so much to the future of education.  It makes one wonder at the mentality of someone who could write a letter saying that she regretted that Carysfort College would be closed. This is what the former Minister for Education, Deputy Hussey, did four weeks ago.  The letters quite clearly stated that Carysfort College would close.</P>
    <P>The purpose behind the debate is to put forward our ideas but, most of all, to seek a declaration from the Minister as to what his plans are regarding the college. We know that they need to be explored with the appropriate authorities and that there is much talking to be done. We wish to know if there will be a component of teacher education in the college in the future because, if not, the road ahead for other developmental plans will not be very straight and the Sisters of Mercy, as owners of the establishment will see that their essential role in life &mdash; the education of teachers to educate young people &mdash; will not be carried on. Everybody would like to know where he or she stands in order to plan their next step.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="858" /> Perhaps the Minister is wondering how all these activities could be housed in one establishment.  That is the point I wish to make the central issue of the debate. There can be marvellous educational advantages from the interaction of the various groups of people who would be involved in an enhanced vision of a Carysfort College of the future.  First of all, there would be a group of student teachers, teacher training, teacher education or in-service education, whatever one likes to call it.  They would be diminished in numbers, but they would be carrying on what has been done so well over the years.  There is also an essential need for very intensive courses for teachers of all kinds.  I am particularly concerned with second level teachers because courses for them have been greatly neglected.  There would also be third level courses for the higher educational system.  These courses could be very well run in Carysfort College as they have the equipment and the skill to conduct them.  The debate so far on third level courses in the context of Carysfort has focused on the humanities &mdash; the social sciences, communications, the liberal arts and child studies as well as youth community work studies.  All of these are very valuable in themselves.</P>
    <P>On the programme &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on 5 February, which was the day after the news of the closure of Carysfort burst on us stunned citizens, the former Minister said that Carysfort was not suitable for technological third level education.  I would dispute that statement.  Either the Minister had not visited the buildings before then or else she had been there and had not noticed the advances that I have observed there in the past few days. Trinity College, which is very old, adapted its buildings very successfully in their plan for diversification development. There is no reason why Carysfort should not be adapted to provide third level education in selective technologies in conjunction with liberal &mdash; humanities &mdash; arts third level courses.</P>
    <P>There is a growing and respected volume of opinion that to be a good technologist <Col N="859" /> one must first be educated. These new and exciting technological developments can be leavened by the old sciences of knowledge of the arts and of the humanities.  I am expressing what I have long considered to be the case when I say that an educated technologist would be best able to cope in a changing environment.  I do not agree with the trend whereby the whole emphasis in the world is on technology at all costs but a basic education is imperative to the development of a good technologist.  That basic education followed by a third level education in the humanities and the arts would equip one for a latter type of professional education if that was what one wished for.</P>
    <P>Those who speak of education purely in a technological sense are missing the whole point of the advances in education because one cannot succeed in all of the new sciences unless one has first been imbued with the whole science of education. Technology, which ten years ago we regarded as exciting and dynamic, is almost outdated and outmoded now.  To cope with those changes one must be properly equipped and the best way to achieve that is to be educated properly in the real meaning of that term.</P>
    <P>Another course which Carysfort would be entirely suited for would be educational psychology for which there is a huge need.  We have ignored this area up to now.  There are some such courses at primary level but none at second level. When a young child is considered to be suffering from some disorder of behaviour for which assessment is required, he is assessed clinically from the health point of view but there is no interaction between that type of assessment and the educational course the child is following. We must pay much greater attention to this type of education.  We must pay more attention to the lacunae in the system for this type of disability and there will have to be close liaison between the Departments of Health and Education in this area.  There must be continuous monitoring of children suffering from various <Col N="860" /> disorders, either educationally or clinically.</P>
    <P>Carysfort could play an exciting role in this area.  The college could pioneer a whole new discipline of educational psychology. I foresee a role, too, for the college in the area of computer education. Through an intermediary I have had discussions with the computer firms and they would be very interested in helping to set up within Carysfort a computer resource centre for educationalists and students to use at will and later for students pursuing third level courses.</P>
    <P>My hope for Carysfort is that it will retain a component of teacher training education, that it will continue to turn out national school teachers, that it will bring forward a whole range of inservice courses for teachers of all levels, that it will provide educational psychologist courses, perhaps leading to full degrees and that it will have a computer education resource within its portals.  Perhaps I have wandered from the point from time to time but I am very involved in this issue because what we are talking of here tonight relates not only to Carysfort but to the case for education in the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>This is an historic occasion.  Since the teacher training colleges were set up so many years ago, since the Sisters of Mercy embarked on their pioneering work for the poor and for the education of young people, this is the first time that the representatives of the country have been talking not just about the scaling down but of the phasing out of the teacher training element within Carysfort.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote a delightful statement from Viscount Morley, who was Gladstone's secretary, when he visited Our Lady of Mercy College in Baggot Street in 1894.  He said, and I quote from the publication, <i>Our Lady of Mercy College, Centenary 1877-1977:</i></P>
    <P>I must say that these women please me vastly.  Their atmosphere is human, they are keen about their work; it is all moving and alive with sympathy; not mechanical, all chalk and a blackboard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="861" /> Here we are in 1986.  If the Viscount found the college all that exciting and dynamic all those years ago, why should we not have a new vision of Carysfort and decide here this evening that the college has a future and that part of that future is the continuance of what the college has been doing so well in the past, that is, teacher training?</P>

Beidh sé soiléir os na fíricí seo gur ghlac an Rialtas leis an mbealach ceart chun na fadhbanna sa ghné seo den oideachas a réiteach nuair a chinn siad ar chríoch a chur le hoiliúint múinteoirí náisiúnta i gceann de na coláistí oideachais mhóra. Tharla dá thoradh san gur chuir an tAire Oideachais in iúl do Bhainisteoir an Choláiste, A Ghrása Ardeaspag Caitliceach Bhaile Átha Cliath, go raibh sé i gceist deontais i leith na hoibre seo a chealú i gcás Choláiste Bhantiarna na Trócaire, Dún Céirí.

      <P>that Dáil Éireann notes the action of the Government in rationalising the facilities for the training of primary teachers and in seeking, through discussions with the interested parties an alternative role in higher education for the Carysfort College, having regard to its structure and traditions, the expertise of its staff and the developmental requirements of education generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Faoi na Rialacha do Scoileanna Náisiúnta is é an tAire Oideachais a chuireann cabhair i bhfoirm deontais ar fáil do na coláistí oiliúna chun a chinntiú go mbeidh <Col N="862" /> i gcónaí dóthain múinteoirí náisiúnta oilte ar fáil chun an t-éileamh atá orthu i scoileanna náisiúnta a shásamh.</P>

Is iad na coláistí sin ná Coláiste Oideachais Naomh Pádraig, Droim Conrach; Coláiste Oideachais Bhantiarna na Trócaire, Páirc Dhún Céirí; Coláiste Oideachais Mhuire gan Smál, Luimneach; Coláiste Oideachais Eaglais na hÉireann, Ráth Maonais; Coláiste Oideachais Froebel, Cnoc Síon; agus Coláiste Oideachais Naomh Muire, Marino.</P>

    <P>Chomh maith leis an cúrsa trí bliana atá luaite agam bhí cúrsa bliana ann do chéimithe ollscoileanna gur theastaigh uathu bheith ina múinteoirí náisiúnta ag an chuid is mó de na coláistí oideachais. Sé an fáth a bhí leis an éileamh an-mhór seo ar mhúinteoirí náisiúnta ná go raibh ag an am sin roinnt mhaith oidí ag imeacht as an seirbhís ar pinsean agus araile.; méadú ar líon na ndaltaí a bhí ag tosú sna scoileanna náisiúnta agus sraith de fheabhsaithe ar an gcoibhneas idir daltaí agus múinteoirí rud a chabhraigh go háirithe le laghdú ar ranganna móra sna scoileanna.  Chomh maith le sin do tharla ins na seachtóidí béim mhór ar oideachas speisialta as a d'fhás roinnt mhaith scoileanna agus ranganna speisialta timpeall na tíre ar fad.  Sin an stair agus an cúlra a thógann muid go dtí an pointe atá faoi chaibidil againn inniu.</P>
    <P>This scene has changed dramatically on all fronts.  The year 1980 saw a peak in the annual number of births which has declined in each successive year since then.  This decline is due to affect the <Col N="864" /> population of children to be catered for in national schools, firstly, by slowing down the rate of increase in the primary school population and subsequently, if maintained, leading to a substantial decrease.  Working on population and birth assumptions compatible with those used in the Central Statistics Office publication, <i>Population and Labour Force Projections, 1986-1991,</i> the total primary school population, while undergoing a small increase up to 1987-88, is projected to fall from that level by as many as 80,000 children by 1995-96.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary for me to spell out the influence such a population trend is likely to have on employment prospects for national teachers.  The second important factor which influences these prospects is the wastage rate from the profession itself.  The number of teachers who would have to retire on age grounds remains at a low level, in the order of 140 or so each year for the next decade. Retirements for other reasons have also declined markedly in recent years.  This may well be a reflection of the difficulty of finding alternative suitable employment outside of teaching but it is also influenced by the improved maternity leave provisions which facilitate married women teachers in continuing their professional careers while they are having families. Indeed the scarcity of jobs for national teachers in itself produces a constraint in that people who might have resigned their posts and left the profession for a few years if they were assured of an easy re-entry would no longer be inclined to do so.</P>
    <P>My Department was not slow to recognise this situation and since 1981 have been taking steps to moderate the flow of qualified graduates from the training colleges.  This is an area of high level manpower requirement where we cannot walk away from our responsibilities.  Colleges of education produce graduates with a B.Ed. degree, the sole employment currency of which is the national school system in Ireland.  The State has a responsibility in relation to supplying teachers to that system as well as <Col N="865" /> responsibility for aiding the colleges which train them.</P>
    <P>It would be a poor exercise of this responsibility to invite young people to spend their time and resource in attaining this specific qualification without a reasonable assurance of future employment in the national school system. Accordingly, the steps taken to meet this problem have consisted, firstly, in reducing and then suspending the one year post-graduate course in the colleges and reducing intake numbers to the B.Ed. degree course.  These measures have resulted in a reduction of the student population from a high of some 2,600 at the peak period some ten years ago to a little over 1,800 at present.  Despite these measures the assurance of immediate permanent employment in the schools which for so long accompanied the attainment of qualifications as a national teacher is no longer there.  Of those who qualified in 1983, some 16 per cent are still without permanent posts.  These are important statistics.  The corresponding figures for 1984 and 1985 as of 25 February last are 42 per cent and 68 per cent. The latter figure throws into stark light the difficulties trained teachers are having in acquiring full time permanent posts.  While the overall employment situation of recent graduates is eased considerably by the availability of longer term substitution work and of temporary posts in replacement of teachers absent on career breaks or for other approved reasons, it is abundantly clear that the intake to the colleges of education will have to continue to be at a very restricted level for some years to come.</P>
    <P>The conclusion from all of this is, I believe, inescapable.  The capacity of the three larger colleges of education is estimated at 2,500 student places.  The student population in the three colleges together amounts to a little over 1,600 and this is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future.  The hard fact of life is that we are maintaining at considerable cost to the taxpayer three major colleges of education for the initial training of national teachers when two would suffice to meet the present and future needs of <Col N="866" /> the primary school system.  To fail to recognise this fact or, having recognised it, not to take any action about it, at a time of scarce resources in education and scarce resources generally, would have amounted to a dereliction of duty on behalf of any Government and the Minister for Education.  It is incumbent on all of us at such a time to seek to allocate the resources available to us in the most effective manner possible and nowhere is this more critical than in the realm of education.</P>
    <P>The population bulge of the late seventies will lead to further expansion in the number of pupils to be catered for at the post primary level and in due course at the third level of education.  At this latter level the Government are already committed to a programme of capital investment which, though large by any standards, will not suffice to meet the total projected demand for places in third level education in the nineties.  It is in this context that the resources hitherto available to the Carysfort College must be reallocated and the role of the college itself redefined, subject to agreement with the management and the owners of the college.</P>

      <P>Caithfidh mé a rá ag an bpointe seo gur cúis mhór bhróin dom go bhfuil na toscaí amhlaidh go gcaithfear críoch a chur le hoiliúint oidí bunscoile i gceann de na coláistí oideachais mhóra. Tuigim go bhfuil an brón céanna ar gach duine atá eolach faoi na coláistí seo agus faoin gcaighdeán sármhaith oibre a rinneadh iontu i gcónaí.  Is mar theist ar na coláistí an dea-cháil atá ar a gcuid múinteoirí agus an bród atá orainn mar gheall ar dea-mhianach na múinteoirí sin.  Tá sé seo fíor i leith gach ceann de na coláistí. Caithfidh mé a rá go speisialta i leith Choláiste Dhún Céirí gur eol dom go rímhaith dúthracht agus díograis Siúracha na Trócaire leis na blianta fada agus an dea-shampla den chéadscoth a thugadar i gcónaí i gcúrsaí uaisleachta agus i gcúrsaí foirfeachta do mhúinteoirí na tíre seo ó <Col N="867" /> bunaíodh an coláiste i Sráid Bagóid in 1877 agus ina dhiaidh sin i nDún Céirí ó 1901.  I rith an ama sin &mdash; tréimhse níos mó ná céad bliain &mdash; do thuill na traidisiúin a bhunaigh Siúracha na Trócaire buíochas an Stáit agus urraim agus meas na tíre i gcoitinne, idir mhúinteoirí, tuismitheoirí agus daltaí.  Ba mhaith liom a rá go neamhbhalbh go gcreidim nach le dímheas d'aon tsórt ar an gcoláiste féin nó ar an sárobair a rinneadh ann in gcónaí a roghnaíodh Coláiste Dhún Céirí.  Nuair a bhí sé socraithe nach leanfaí le bunoiliúint oidí náisiúnta i gcoláiste oideachais mór éigin tá mé cinnte nárbh fhurast in aon chor an coláiste a roghnú.  Ba léir nárbh fhéidir an rogha a bhunú ar chomparáid idir fhiúntas acadúil na gcoláistí oideachais mhóra ó tharla iad uile ar aon chéim ó thaobh foirfeachta oibre.  Tá mé deimhnitheach gur cuireadh toscaí uile an cháis san áireamh agus go ndearnadh dianmhachnamh ar an scéal ina iomláine sar ar deineadh an roghnú seo.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom leis tagairt do Choláiste Dhún Céirí i gcomhthéacs amháin eile.  Mar is eol don Teach is é príomhdhualgas an mhúinteora náisiúnta teagasc a thabhairt in ábhair churaclaim na mbunscoileanna do dhaltaí a bhíonn ag freastal ar scoileanna náisiúnta.  Is ceann de na hábhair sin an Ghaeilge &mdash; teanga náisiúnta agus príomhtheanga oifigiúil na tíre seo.  Is ceann de dhualgais an choláiste oideachais mar sin, na scoláirí a ullmhú agus a oiliúint chun go mbeadh siad ábalta tabhairt faoin obair fhíorthábhachtach seo sna scoileanna.  Níl aon dabht ná gur chomhlíon Dún Céirí an dualgas seo go críochnúil agus go dílis i gcónaí agus is mór an chreidiúint atá tuillte acu de bharr sin.  Tá an Ghaeilge mar chuid bhunúsach riachtanach de oiliúint mhúinteoirí náisiúnta agus do fhorbairt iomlán an mhúinteora agus geallaim go gcaomhnófar go dílis an dearcadh sin san athchóiriú atá beartaithe anois.</P>

    <P>I want to take this opportunity to thank the management, staff and students of Carysfort College for the very generous and warm reception extended to the Minister for Education and myself on our recent visit there.  We had an opportunity, <Col N="868" /> like Deputy O'Rourke, to be shown around the college and convent.  The history of this remarkable building was outlined for us and we saw at first hand the old, new and ultra-modern facilities which the college has at its disposal.  We also had an opportunity to have some brief discussions with members of the staff and to meet with the student body. The motion proposed by Deputy O'Rourke and Deputy Andrews is somewhat premature in that discussions have yet to take place.  The amendment allows for proper discussions to take place regarding the future of Carysfort College, a future which I believe can play a major role in the education of our young people, brighter even than the glories of its long and distinguished past.</P>
    <P>Once again I draw the attention of the Dáil to the amendment proposed by me to this motion.  The facts which I have outlined and the further facts which will unfold as this debate progresses, clearly support the progressive amendment as put forward by me, rather than the motion proposed by Deputy O'Rourke and Deputy Andrews.</P>
    <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>1.  To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes the action of the Government in rationalising the facilities for the education of primary teachers and in seeking, through discussion with the interested parties, to establish an alternative role in higher education for the Carysfort College, having regard to its structure and traditions, the expertise of its staff and the developmental requirements of education generally.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to this debate and to support the amendment in the name of the Minister for Education.  I wish both the Minister and the Minister of State success in their new briefs.  The Minister has given a distinguished service in several other areas over the past long period and I have no doubt that he will do likewise in this Ministry.  I have no doubt also that the Minister of State will bring his background prior to coming into politics to bear on a very important Department.  I would like to express my gratitude to Carysfort College as a centre for education over the past 100 years or more.  Its history was briefly outlined by the Opposition spokesperson.  I would like to join with her in paying tribute to the long, distinguished role that Carysfort College has played in education.  A debt of gratitude is due by all of us to the Sisters of Mercy and the staff for their good work which ensured that our young people got much of the basics right.  I hope that this discussion will produce some ideas and will be a start in ensuring that Carysfort College maintains a role in higher education.  We are all aware of the tremendous asset we have in the board of management, the staff and the physical college which was added to as recently as 1982.  The college should be maintained for the benefit of the people. We must ensure that taxpayers' money will continue to be used.  There is tremendous potential for the future of Carysfort College.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition spokesperson made proposals this evening.  I hope the Minister and the people involved in Carysfort will explore every avenue in order to keep the college open for the benefit of the people.  We are aware of changing needs in education and we must look at all the aspects including the vast sums of money spent on education generally.  We must get the best return for our money. We must look critically at Carysfort which is a college that has tremendous potential.  The resources provided as recently as 1982, the library, an auditorium, a sports centre, an audio-visual <Col N="870" /> centre and lecture theatres should be used for educational purposes for the people coming onstream in the future. At the end of the day the people should be the winners.  I am glad that both the Minister and the Minister of State went to the college last week to see the facilities for themselves.  I attended the open day briefly lat week and it demonstrated the very good facilities which should be utilised.  Everybody recognises the need for change.  In getting the best for the people we should look at the educational facilities and at the Department of Education. We should have a complete review of the educational system.</P>

      <P>In reviewing education there should be discussions between the Department and everybody else involved.  We are all aware that more jobs must be found and that fewer jobs will be found in some areas, so we must look at the broad spectrum of education in order to tackle this problem.  I hope full consultations will take place between the staff, the students, the board of management and the Department to find the best solution.  Staff are obviously concerned about their future and assurances have been given to them.</P>
      <P>This debate should be used to produce new ideas.  One suggestion made was in-service training.  Discussions should take place to examine the options available and no one should enter discussions with a totally fixed mind.  Obviously too many places are being provided in the three colleges.  This necessitates change.  I hope at the end of the day we will make the right decisions and I hope that Carysfort, in the words of the pamphlet I have received, will be working for Irish education.</P>

      <P>I am beginning to wonder whether I am in Dáil Éireann or whether we should be here discussing the closure of Carysfort College on the basis that it should never have been suggested that it be closed.  The contributions in both Irish and English in relation to this <Col N="871" /> problem have appalled me.  There is a bland dismissal of the reality that an effort was made by the former Minister for Education to close, on behalf of the Coalition Government, one of the best educational facilities not only on this island but in Europe generally.</P>
      <P>It amazes me that people can come in here and talk about plans for discussions and meetings with the good nuns, the academic staff and the students.  We should not be here at all tonight discussing this.  There should never have been any motion before the House or any proposals in the first instance to close Carysfort teacher training college.  The Government should address themselves to why, in the first instance, they proposed the closure of Carysfort at all.  It may be that the Minister and his splendid and very good Minister of State on the way back from Carysfort last Friday to Government Buildings had some sort of Damascene conversion, that the light struck them.</P>

      <P>I urge upon the Minister and his Minister of State to look at their amendment more closely, although a close examination of this amendment does not bring us all along the road on which this side of the House wants the matter to be brought.  We want a rational plan for the continued, coherent application of the educational policies of Carysfort teacher training college.  We ask the Minister and the Minister of State to address themselves to that.  The staff and the students were shocked by the peremptory announcement of their colleague, now the Minister for Social Welfare, four weeks ago.  Will they address themselves to that and why it caused such grave hardship and concern in that academy in Blackrock?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I congratulate the Minister for Education and his Minister of State on their appointment to their present portfolios.  I hope they will put this chapter behind them quickly and <Col N="872" /> address themselves to other pressing problems in the area of education confronting this nation.  In paying tribute to their appointments in their senior and junior portfolios let me also pay tribute to the Opposition spokeswoman on Education, Deputy Mary O'Rourke.  She has shown one of the great strengths necessary in Irish political leadership, that is, consistency in her political repertoire. This strength was witnessed during this whole debate beginning four weeks ago.  On television, radio, here in Dáil Éireann and outside the confines of Dáil Éireann, she has conducted a vigorous, articulate and intelligent campaign in the Carysfort cause.  I do not want to let this occasion go by without conceding to her the laurels which we have achieved partly here this evening.</P>
    <P>Four weeks ago the then Minister for Education curtly proposed the closure of Carysfort college of education and in so doing she fired another depressing broadside at Ireland's young population and especially her student population.  If we are serious when we describe our young people as a great national asset, surely the case must be to reinforce, not to dismiss, Carysfort college as it is now and as it should continue, a recognised college of the National University of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister's curt decision also dismissed, with hint of neither reason nor policy, the teachers of the 110 year old college whose educational record has influenced almost every family in this country.  It dismissed also the initiatives of the college staff put forward over two years ago for the development of third level education in Carysfort and the country as a whole, because the Carysfort issue cannot be separated from the vitality of Irish education as a totality.  The Government's arbitrary and thoughtless attack on the college over the past four weeks is a direct assault on the quality of Irish education.  The manner of the Minister's announcement was roundly and rightly condemned.  It still disturbs me at least for two reasons.</P>
    <P>The first relates to the fact that at the time of the announcement and over the <Col N="873" /> past four weeks the Government gave no reason for their proposal to close Carysfort college.  The whole affair has existed in a vacuum.  The decision was summary and not located in any policy.  Irish education surely deserves better.</P>
    <P>A second cause of disquiet has been the treatment of the Carysfort community. What about the nuns, the staff, the students and those people who look after the confines of the college and its grounds?  It is one thing to propose to close a facility but quite another to adopt an irresponsible method of communicating the decision.  Moreover, to ignore the college development plan is to compound the casual attitude of the Minister with a lack of interest.  In times of challenge if we ignore the creativity and initiative of our people, we as a people will never recover from our many present problems. Still, this is what the Government have been doing and have done again in relation to Carysfort.  The way in which the decision on Carysfort was communicated to Carysfort is a reflection of what is going wrong in this country as a whole. The damage this Government are inflicting on our people is not only the result of a failed policy.  It is sapping from our people whatever creative activity, vision and spirit of progress we have left.  This is why the rigidity of the Minister's initial statement depressed me.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government have learned at least one thing from the events of the past month.  There are people out there who will not allow them to bury their heads in the sand and who will fight back, and fight a Government bent on depriving this country of all hope and initiative. Only last Friday the present Minister for Education seemed to continue the thoughtlessness of his predecessor.  He should remember that the Taoiseach sent her to the oblivion of the Department of Social Welfare.  I intend no disrespect to the Department of Social Welfare.  I do not consider the shifting of Ministers from one portfolio to another as demotion. I see the service of a Minister in the service of the State as a tremendous privilege and whether you are in Social Welfare, Education or Finance it is all the <Col N="874" /> same; you are still serving your country in whatever capacity the Taoiseach of the day wants you to, and so be it.  However, she was sent, for want of a better word, to Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Last Friday Deputy Cooney went to Carysfort and was received with great courtesy by the President, Sister Regina Durkan, and the staff and students of the college.  From what Sister Regina said in yesterday's <i>The Irish Press</i> it was clear that the visit was informal and that both parties agreed that no statement would be issued to the Press.  It appears that the Minister went public and speculated on the future of the college.  I stress the word &ldquo;speculated&rdquo; for it is quite clear that this issue will not be solved (a) while the Minister continues to disregard the openness of the Carysfort community and (b) while he continues to disregard the merits of Carysfort's case.  A central part of this case is contained in our motion, and its bland dismissal by the respected Minister of State is not good enough.  His amendment to our motion offers some hope, but it does not solve the problem, and concern remains as a result of the amendment.</P>
    <P>We believe that our motion proposes the solution to the problem.  In the area of pre-service training Carysfort has over 100 year's experience on which to draw and the present prognostication is that we may not have the same need for primary teachers in the future because of the decline in the birth rate.  This experience must not be totally ignored but the teacher training element must be retained in the college.  That is fundamental to the continuance in existence of this great college.  They do not want it to remain totally as a teacher training institution; they want an important teacher training element retained in the college. Is that too much to ask?  Is that too much to give?  I say &ldquo;may&rdquo; because a declining birth rate is not a totally tenable argument for reducing the number of primary teachers.  The question of teacher-pupil ratio must also be a consideration.  We all know that especially in urban areas, there are thousands of children in classes of over 40 and even 50 pupils.  That is a <Col N="875" /> matter of fact and of record.  One can imagine the damage being done to some of those pupils.  That is not the fault of the teachers, the pupils, or the parents, but the fault of successive Governments which failed to see that one of the great solutions to the tragic disparity between pupil-teacher ratio is its reduction as a matter of national emergency.</P>
    <P>I remember from a submission made to the New Ireland Forum, of which I had the honour to be a member, that we in the South would need between 4,000 and 5,000 extra teachers just to put us on a par with the pupil-teacher ratio of Northern Ireland.  The Minister's arguments for a decline in the number of teachers are therefore spurious, untenable and unacceptable.  As with everything else, this Government work backwards from the solution of most convenience, ignore the problem itself and end up making a mess of both.</P>
    <P>A second aspect of teacher education is the in-service sector.  This must be developed, although not to the exclusion of a pre-service facility at Carysfort.  In-service education is a recognition of what every parent and teacher knows &mdash; that especially in recent years the role of the teacher has been changing at all levels. As parents and as legislators we must face this problem and try to cope with the new situation facing education.  We have also our own problems; we have to distinguish between the Church and the State as legislators.  We are coming to grips with that problem, although I never had any difficulties with it.  Even the much discredited <i>Building on Reality</i> recognised the need to develop in-service stating &ldquo;The up-dating and widening of teachers' skills throughout their careers is seen as a most important element in providing a modern and flexible education programme and in improving the quality of education generally.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>However, in this specific area as in so many others of Government policy, this document is as dead as the letters of it. It is not as if the Minister has been short of constructive suggestions.  Fianna Fáil's so ably produced document, on <Col N="876" /> primary education <i>Education &mdash; The Early Years</i> written by Deputy O'Rourke and published in 1984 advocated that surplus available capacity in the colleges of education be used to provide a comprehensive range of in-service courses and outlined in some detail a course in school management. As one might expect, there was no response from the Minister or from her Department at that time.</P>
    <P>Also in 1984, Carysfort submitted to the Minister an extensively researched document on the development of the college. This was one of a series of responses submitted from the colleges in response to the Minister's <i>Programme for Action in Education</i> which had been published the previous January.  Again, despite the fact that the Carysfort report reflected the vital resources and range of college, despite the fact that the college honestly and honourably responded to what should have been an important basis for discussion, there was no constructive response from the Minister.  The Carysfort proposals were not even considered worthy of some serious and further exploration. All this yet again begs the question &mdash; are the Government really interested in education?  Have they any sense of responsibility?  Here we are, four weeks after the initial announcement was made with only a vague idea of the plans for the future of the facility, and for the present Minister's view that he has exciting plans for the college we must rely on a newspaper correspondent.  I wonder what the Minister means by exciting?  Is it physically exciting, emotionally exciting, mentally or intellectually stimulating? Certainly his excitement has not transmitted itself to this side of the House and I would not imagine that it has transmitted itself to the good people in Carysfort.</P>
    <P>If the Minister proposes to introduce short term courses in this area, a policy feature that we have already in the area of youth employment, this is not acceptable. Neither is it acceptable that Carysfort should be detached from the other teacher education colleges or from the National University.  If there is to be reform it must be in its only true context, <Col N="877" /> that of Irish education as a whole.  Carysfort College, no more than any of the other colleges, is not an educational ghetto.  It cannot be cut off from its sister colleges.  Moreover, from its pre-service base and experience it can develop its already existing in-service programme and diversify into other areas also.</P>
    <P>In relation to its present in-service programme, Carysfort's diploma in the management of learning difficulties has been particularly successful.  This is a two year course and addresses the need to acquire the necessary skills to help pupils who are failing for whatever reason, to develop intellectually, emotionally and/or socially.  This course fits in with the oft repeated commitments of the previous Minister to remedial education. However, it is not enough to talk.  There is a need for early intervention in this area and only such action can have the desired positive results for those children with learning difficulties.  Similarly, the Carysfort in-service summer school shows the college's commitment to positive results.  These courses range from the exploration of curriculum and methodology to review workshops for recent graduates and courses to examine classroom disruption.</P>
    <P>These courses are not only a reminder of the expertise of the Carysfort staff but a reminder that all colleges and universities involved in Irish education must address these broader problems which have been increasingly thrown out by a changing society.  The sorry thing about the Carysfort issue is that (a) the staff were and are willing to do this and have been rebuffed by the Minister for Education and (b) given the best situation in which the developed strategies to address these problems is a diversified one, that is, one which integrates pre and in-service courses with other areas such as technological education and computer resources, the Government are not only shunning expertise but turning a blind eye to the needs of a changing educational scene.</P>
    <P>If the Government continue to dampen the initiative of its people, as in the case of Carysfort, it not only damages the <Col N="878" /> credibility of Government at large but compounds that sense of alienation of which the Taoiseach likes to talk so often in relation to Northern Ireland.  I wonder if he has looked in his own backyard lately, or into the schoolrooms of Ireland or the college campuses to which he occasionally likes to pay lip service?  It is pointless trying to encourage Northerners to talk to us or trying to encourage foreign businessmen to invest here if the Taoiseach is losing credibility with his own people, particularly with our young people.  The Minister's proposal on Carysfort is a catalyst of all this and the way in which the issue was handled by the then Minister, the lack of policy that it betrayed both in the long and short term least, shortsighted.</P>
    <P>There is another shortsightedness of which the Minister and the Government have been guilty and that is shortsightedness in economic terms.  At present, a total of £2.5 million per annum is paid to Carysfort, of which £0.5 million comes from student fees and higher education grants.  Of the pay sector, £150,000 is paid out in pensions and the remaining £1.6 million goes out on staff pay.  As £600,000 is returned to the Exchequer in PAYE, the net cost of running Carysfort is £1 million per annum.  Are this Government suggesting that they will save £1 million in staff pay by insisting on the closure of Carysfort?  Do they not realise that they may have a zero saving, given the cost of early retirement and redeployment, not to mention the legal case which undoubtedly the staff have and undoubtedly will face up to?  This event becomes more unlikely having regard to the Minister's and the Government's amendment to the Fianna Fáil motion, but it is still there. Even in these areas, the legal and economic, the Government approach to this issue shows all the signs of having been taken very lightly.  Again I stress it is only reflective of the type of management of this country since the Coalition took office.</P>
    <P>The same lack of concern for the taxpayer is shown on the capital side.  Carysfort College is reportedly valued at £20 million.  If the Minister wants to develop <Col N="879" /> the third level sector, it may, of course, be possible to build a much inferior facility for between £10 million and £15 million. The interest alone on such a venture would amount to at least £1 million per year.  Do the Government expect the already hard pressed taxpayer to face that bill?  The answer must be that the administration are not quite sure where they are, what they are doing and where they are going.  On both the pay and capital side there will be a net loss to the State if Carysfort is closed or if the issue continues to be approached in a negative way.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Shannon Bus Assembly Factory.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for giving me the opportunity to bring this matter before the House, because we regard it as very important.  With your indulgence, I intend to give some of my time to Deputy Daly.</P>
      <P>As the House knows, in the late seventies the Bombardier company was set up at Shannon to build buses.  Those buses were to serve the schools, city bus services, provincial bus services and the building of coaches was on the stocks at the time.  The arrangement at that time, and as far as I know it still obtains was that the actual building operation was owned by SFADCo and the tooling and equipment was, and still is, owned by CIE; and there was an arrangement with the Bombardier company to have the factory used to build buses to suit the transport developments envisaged for the entire country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A considerable number of such buses were built.  The Government, and I at that time, heard certain complaints about the quality of the buses.  I did a survey of drivers who, for the most part, indicated that the buses were good, sound, reliable and that the percentage availability was <Col N="880" /> very high.  Later the Bombardier company passed the operations on to GAC and they shared directors.</P>
    <P>The important thing to reflect on is that there were as many as 450 people employed, 200 in the assembly of the buses and 250 involved in various types of manufacture to service the bus assembly company.  At present, with the disastrous unemployment position and particularly with the availability of large numbers of young people who have been trained in certain manual skills, this House and the Government are not thinking sufficiently seriously, because we are not merely dealing with 450 people, that number can be multiplied by two or three in order to get the true figure of the numbers relying on this business.</P>
    <P>The product was a reliable one.  The factory was set up properly and the numbers engaged were substantial.  In the light of all this and of the serious unemployment problem, the Government should make a serious effort to give this industry a chance.  What is the value of the total tooling and machinery of that factory?  What does one do with it now? How can its value be realised?  Will the IDA be able to put something in place of the GAC operation and take up that company's capital investment?  What about the much vaunted National Development Corporation?  What will they develop?  Why will they not invest in one of the easiest forms of investment available?  The factory is there for leasing, the equipment is there for use. Would it cost a great deal?</P>
    <P>I am trying to stimulate people to think deeply on this serious matter, to think along the lines of the possibility for development. There are various agencies, many development organisations such as the NDC, who should be interested. There are also the IDA and SFADCo. All of these should be dealing with this problem and trying to get a viable industry going at Shannon.  As I said, there are many young people highly trained in manual skills.  The GAC company had inputs from sheet metal workers employed in supplying the main factory. There were people making the metal <Col N="881" /> parts for buses, there was a metal workshop and there were people engaged doing a highly skilled job in the making of upholstery.  Those people were spread over the area and getting first class employment through their association with the main company.</P>
    <P>Those involved in employment in that area will regard many of the activities of this House as a charade if nothing is done to salvage something form this situation. There is no problem about providing a building, which would be a big obstacle if a new business were being established. There would be no problem about providing grants for machinery and tooling because they are already in place.  As I have said, there is no problem about the provision of skilled work people.  They are already there, their skills having been developed by training.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the Minister for Industry and Commerce has applied his mind to and engaged the minds of his officials with this problem.  I look forward to hearing him on what the possibilities are, on what possibilities have been explored.  Have the IDA been consulted and if so what was their exact answer? Has whoever has responsibility for the infant National Development Corporation given an opinion on this?  If so, the House would be interested to know what that opinion is.</P>
    <P>With regard to one major area to which my collegues may refer, what is the Government decision with regard to the provision of school buses?  Is there a Government decision on that matter? Has a decision been taken to discontinue the provision by the Department of Education of buses for school transport? I do not know but the House is entitled to know in this context as well as in the broader educational context.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to make contact with all those areas I mentioned, as well as CIE, of course, and the Department of Transport &mdash; we will have the Committee Stage of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill tomorrow &mdash; who must be interested in the fate of this factory at Shannon. Again I urge on the Minister and this House the seriousness of the situation, <Col N="882" /> the importance for us, as public representatives to be seen to be concerned when so many people are being put out of work in an area which is manufacturing a product which can be very useful for the further development of our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Wilson for giving me this opportunity to support the case he has so ably made in support of the retention of this company and the maintenance of employment and productivity in this excellent plant at Shannon. I had an opportunity on Second Stage of the Industrial Development Bill to put my views before the Minister, but I ask him once again to keep in mind the very serious situation facing these employees. As Deputy Wilson said, we have a highly skilled workforce and if this company closes, these people will have no prospect of alternative employment in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that region over the last few years we have had an over-dependence on the high technology computerised electronic field, and there is a need to balance the base of industrial production in the area between the electronics and highly skilled areas and the manufacturing of heavy industry.  As I said, we have a highly skilled workforce producing an excellent product, which I am reliably informed is very much in demand.  The information available tells us there is an urgent need for replacing at least half of the school bus fleet.  In other words, 400 school buses are urgently needed to supplement the fleet, to provide replacements and to streamline the fleet, most of which has been working for more than 16 years.  Some of these buses are in a very dilapidated condition and badly in need of replacement. This company can provide these 400 replacements at very competitive prices.  There was some criticism of this plant in the past.  It was said that it could not compete with imported products.  It was said that a similar product could be imported much more cheaply but that is not the case.  The Department, in consultation with CIE and the company have established that the bus manufactured at Shannon can be produced at a very competitive price and compares more <Col N="883" /> than favourably with similar products on sale any where in Europe.</P>
    <P>At present a prototype bus produced by this company is in Darlington for tests and it is hoped that substantial orders will result.  Up to now these tests have been very satisfactory and I am told that the company are devastated that, just when they were about to make a decision on whether to place an order with the company at Shannon, they heard a petition is before the courts to have the Irish company wound up and that the hearing is likely to be sometime in the middle of this month.</P>
    <P>The situation is critical and the Minister should be able to find a formula to enable this plant to continue in operation. I understood from Deputy Prendergast's speech this afternoon that the Minister had proposed a formula which at least would enable discussions to take place. Perhaps the Minister could tell us this evening what that formula is.  Even at this late stage it might be possible to start negotiations to ensure that the company remain in production.  I believe the company, with some State assistance, could put before the Government a very viable proposition.  If the Minister tells us what his proposals are, an early decision could be reached and this could stabilise the position in Darlington because unless the position is clarified soon, the propects of getting this very substantial order will be lost and this could have very serious effects for the company.</P>
    <P>There seems to be an impression that special Government assistance is required in this case but that is not so. With many other threatened closures the Government reluctantily gave financial backing, although there was no guarantee that the companies would reach profitability, but if the Government gave this company financial support they would be getting in return a very valuable product, and this should be taken into account. Giving assistance to this company would not be the same as grant-aiding some of the companies about which we have had discussions in this House in the past.  The Government can support this company <Col N="884" /> by giving a commitment to purchase buses.  These are some of the best buses that can be bought in Europe and they are produced in Ireland by a very highly skilled workforce.  This company buys component parts from small businesses which have been set up in the Shannon area for this purpose.  I appeal to the Minister to take some action and see that something positive is done for this company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I lend my support to my colleagues and appeal to the Minister, even at this late stage, to take immediate action to save this company?  It is a young company and has proved to be a competitive company.  Its accounts and performance are ethical, but its fate lies in the hands of the State.  We need to improve the school transport buses.  We now have an opportunity to provide 400 much needed buses.  I want the Minister to clarify this situation.</P>
      <P>I support my colleagues because some of my constituents work in that company and in my county there are several small manufacturing companies totally dependent on supplying some of the base structures to GAC.  If GAC goes, those other companies will go.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to adopt a positive attitude, to provide the capital investment needed to create the jobs, to provide the public service vehicles needed in the school transport area, ensuring this company continues in operation, making its contribution to the development of the western economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely understand the Deputies' concerns about employment at Shannon, particularly in GAC.  The GAC factory at Shannon were obliged recently to lay off their workforce in excess of 200 because they had no further orders on hand.  The company's problems stemmed from the fact that they have been totally reliant on domestic market demand for buses to maintain production levels.  They became almost entirely dependent on Exchequer-related bus purchases which, <Col N="885" /> in recent years, have been rolled forward to assist the company.  However they recognised that their long term viability &mdash; here we should understand that the &ldquo;viability&rdquo; is important, that every company must be viable, must survive in the commercial world and that companies cannot rely continuously on Government financing for their future survival &mdash; was based on export orders.  While the State gave every possible assistance to their efforts to identify and develop export markets, no sustainable markets were secured.  The board of directors have their responsibilities in relation to the company.  It is not up to me to comment on their responsibilities or to give any direction in relation thereto; they must act as a board of directors in a commercial company.</P>
      <P>GAC (Ireland) Limited &mdash; formerly Bombardier (Ireland) Limited &mdash; have manufactured buses in Shannon since 1979, virtually wholly for the home market.  When the company were established it was recognised that there was a requirement by CIE for urban and rural bus replacement.  Over the past six years GAC produced to meet this requirement. I should point out &mdash; and it is relevant to the involvement of the State and State support for the company &mdash; that to date CIE have purchased approximately 800 buses at a cost of close on £100 million, that is, of taxpayer's money.  I consider that to be substantial State support for the company.  I put this forward as an indication of the support given by the State sector to the company.  The company produced a good product &mdash; I do not deny that and fully accept what the Deputies opposite have said &mdash; but it was recognised at the outset that the demand in Ireland for buses would never be adequate in the long term to maintain the factory at full production.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The company produced a good product.  But it was recognised quite clearly that the demand in Ireland for buses would never be adequate in the long term to maintain the factory at full production.</P>
      <P>In the State sector side of the economy obviously there is a limit to the number of new buses CIE can afford to purchase and operate.  In the recent past, market demand had been created artificially by the rolling forward of future years' requirements for buses.  However, this rolling forward could never be more than a short term expedient.  The domestic private sector bus fleet is made up to a large extent of second-hand vehicles, limiting the ability of GAC to sell into this market.  This domestic market alone, therefore, could not sustain GAC's production capacity in the long term.  The long term viability of the Shannon operation was dependent on the gaining of export orders, which the company have failed to do to date to any extent.</P>
      <P>I took a similar Adjournment Debate on this subject on 18 December last.  In that debate I pointed out and I must repeat, because there is need for clarity in this matter, there has been a downturn in demand and increased competition for exports in the bus building market. Europe has seen many plant closures and a major rationalisation in the industry. Japan has recently become a great penetrator of the export markets, thus increasing the difficulties for the longer established exporting companies.  The international market is highly competitive and is fraught with import restrictions and stipulations about local content of production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is against such a background that GAC have been attempting to reduce their reliance on the domestic market by winning export orders.  Deputy Daly's interjection is not sustainable because CIE have purchased 800 buses, good buses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I must repeat this, because people may not want to accept it but nonetheless it is a fact, that it is the State sector which has been the supporter of GAC in recent years.  I do not want to go into this in any party political manner. I merely want to put the facts on record.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is against the background of an extremely competitive international market that GAC have been attempting to reduce the reliance on the domestic market by winning export orders.  The world bus market itself has been depressed for a number of years with a number of manufacturers going out of production.  The downturn in the demand for buses has been caused by two factors, first, the overall reduction in the demand for public passenger transport facilities and, second, the tight control over capital expenditure in a recessionary situation which leads to an extension of the average age of bus fleets because of the deferral of replacement buses.  The efforts of GAC to break into the international market have not been as successful as hoped.  Perhaps this is because GAC, being a fairly young company, operated under certain disadvantages in comparison with their more established competitors such as Volvo, MAN and British Leyland.</P>
      <P>GAC produced a high quality bus with a lot to offer.  With the assistance of Córas Tráchtála they sent demonstration buses on trial both to the British market and to the Middle East.</P>

      <P>They recently built and shipped a prototype bus to a Darlington bus company for testing.  Testing is expected to take up to six months, when contracts will then be signed by the successful company in, say, September on October this year.  The possibilities of such a scenario would not become clear until late 1986 at the earliest.  Consequently with no immediate prospects for orders the company laid off most of their staff on 24 January 1986.</P>
      <P>Over a number of months exhaustive efforts have been made to provide orders in the interest of maintaining employment at the factory.  The school bus situation was examined in detail, as were CIE's future bus needs.  However, CIE do not have the resources or the need to acquire any further buses in 1986 apart from their existing order with GAC for 39 buses for the replacement of their rural bus fleet which will be completed when the present order is finalised.</P>

      <P>The present closure of GAC must be viewed in the context of a global recession in the bus building industry and that of other major manufacturers in the United Kingdom and on the European mainland faced with similar layoffs.  The company were not alone in their search for export orders. Everything possible was done by the appropriate State agencies to assist GAC in identifying and developing export outlets, thereby improving their future prospects. In addition, over £200,000 was allocated to the company by Shannon Development by way of grants towards research and development on their product. Unfortunately, the hoped for export markets failed to materialise.  In all these circumstances the company's position has become uncertain.</P>

      <P>Of the 47 female offenders in custody on 4 March 1986 24 are mothers of children under 15 years of age.  There are several sanctions available to the courts at present which may be applied as alternatives to a custodial sentence.  These include fines, compensation orders, probation orders, peace bonds and community service orders.  It is a matter for the courts to decide the appropriate sanction to be applied in each case.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the comments made by the chairman of the Legal Aid Board in presenting the board's report for 1983 and 1984 to my predecessor recently.  I also note that the chairman acknowledged in the same connection the serious problem for the Government that arises from constraints on public finances.</P>
      <P>In deciding in May 1985 to expand the civil legal aid scheme by making resources available for that purpose under a provision in the Funds of Suitors Act, 1984, the Government acknowledged that there was a need to give priority to the provision of civil legal aid services despite the current financial difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four new law centres will have been established by mid-1986 under that expansion including three centres in new locations, at Tralee, Athlone and Tallaght. The Government also indicated that it was hoped that further law centres would be opened in 1986 and 1987 if sufficient funds, for that purpose, were available under the Funds of Suitors Act. As my predecessor said in answering Parliamentary Questions on 29 May 1985, this will depend on the cost of the new <Col N="713" /> Children's Court for Dublin, which is also to be funded under the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has indicated that the groups he is referring to are, in particular, itinerants, the Hare Krishna group and car-park attendants.  The existence, in our society, of itinerants is a social problem which in my view cannot and should not be treated as one to be met primarily by police action.  It is necessary that the Garda Síochána should intervene in certain circumstances but, on the whole, itinerants as a group need social support to improve their lot and I do not propose to suggest to the Garda Síochána that they should take anything in the nature of special or concerted action against them.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any valid ground why the Garda Síochána should take any concerted action against groups such as the Hare Krishna group.  If they overstep the limits of the law, the Garda will no doubt intervene but the intervention would be on the basis of some specific breach of the law on a particular occasion and would not be directed at the group in a general way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Síochána do not concern themselves with persons who hold themselves out as car-park attendants at particular times on the public street.  This is something that has been going on for years in Dublin and the Garda authorities have informed me that they do not think it would be appropriate for the Garda Síochána to take an initiative against them.  I suggest that matters of that kind might well be considered by an appropriate committee of the corporation or by <Col N="714" /> some other committee concerned with Dublin traffic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the pressure on accommodation at Mountjoy has obviously increased the pressure on available facilities I do not think it right to link that pressure to the recent deaths in the prison.  In one case the prisoner died from a self-administered overdose of an illegal drug which he had illicitly obtained and in the other three cases the prisoners were accommodated in single cells, a situation generally regarded as desirable.  In fact, in at least one case the prison authorities were criticised for removing the prisoner from a two-man cell to a single cell.</P>
      <P>The Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System recommend an across-theboard increase in statutory remission from one-quarter to one-third, rather than as suggested by the Deputy.  No decision has yet been taken on this recommendation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice when the original intention to establish Wheatfield Prison as a women's prison was changed to the present plan of having it as a general prison; the reason; the number of prisoners who will be accommodated; the number of jobs which will be provided; whether in view of the very serious unemployment problem in the area preferential consideration will be given to local unemployed people; the protection which will be given to people living near the prison; and the extra facilities which will be provided to <Col N="715" /> compensate people living in the area for the insecurity, stress and the devaluation to their housing that the prison will cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was publicly announced, when the Wheatfield lands were acquired in 1979, that it was intended to locate a place of detention for young male offenders between 16 and 21 years of age and a prison for women on the site but separated from one another.</P>
      <P>Between 1980 and 1984 site development, servicing, perimetering of the two custodial enclosures and construction of services buildings common to both were completed.  Construction of the custodial buildings was to begin in 1982 but because of financial limitations from 1981 onwards it was not possible to commence work until 1984 and, even then, it was possible to allocate finance for the place of detention for young male offenders only.  Construction of the women's prison was postponed.</P>
      <P>As the numbers being committed to custody by the courts was increasing significantly, and as the financial situation made it impossible to commence construction on another planned place of detention for young male offenders in Cork, and as it was becoming increasingly clear that there would be likely to be intense local objection to the establishment of new places of custody in other areas, the accommodation in Wheatfield for young male offenders was redesigned to accommodate 320 rather than the 120 initially announced.  Decisions to proceed with changes of this kind evolve over a period and it would be misleading to attempt to ascribe them to a particular date.  I should make clear that the accommodation being provided is still intended to be for young male offenders and not adults.  Construction is well advanced and is due for completion before the end of 1987.</P>
      <P>A staff of about 250 prison service personnel is likely to be required.  Recruitment to the prison service is through open competition, conducted by the Civil Service Commission and examinations are publicly advertised from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="716" /> For the same reason as the other change was made, the other proposed institution was also redesigned to increase accommodation from 60 to 144. Tenders can be invited and a contract placed when resources permit.  The layout is such that cell accommodation not required for females could be used for males, who, by use of a linkway, could use the occupational and other facilities in the nearby place of detention.</P>
    <P>When account is taken not only of the category of offender expected to be accommodated but of the high levels of perimetering and the facilities for surveillance that are being provided, there is every reason to be confident that good order and safe custody can be maintained and that there will be no special risks to residents in the locality.  I am confident that experience will show that there is no ground for fears in that respect and that it will be found that no harm will be done to the locality,.</P>

      <P>I am informed that in the case of an application made by a solicitor, the grant normally issues in 12 weeks.  In the case of personal applications there is a delay of approximately six months in getting an appointment with the personal applications officer.  However, thereafter the grant normally issues in less than three weeks. There are, however, special arrangements for dealing with cases where serious hardship might be caused by delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there has recently been an increase in the time taken to issue grants by the Probate Office.  The reason for the delays is an increase in the volume of business against a background of <Col N="717" /> restrictions on recruitment to the Civil Service.  Everything is being done to improve the situation but, necessarily, within the staffing restraints aimed at keeping down public expenditure.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The company in question was recently obliged to lay off its workforce due to the fact that it had no further orders on hand.  Its problems stem from the fact that it has been totally reliant on domestic market demand for buses to maintain production levels.  To date it has almost entirely depended on Exchequer related bus purchases which, in certain years, were rolled forward ahead of immediate requirements.  It recognised, however, that it's long term viability had to be based on export orders.  While the State has given every possible assistance to its efforts to identify and develop export markets, no sustained outlets have been secured to-date.</P>

Any person who has made a valid application and who has not yet received a visit from an inspector, will be sent a letter of approval by 10 March. The work involved should not be commenced before receipt of such letter and will, of course, be subject to the requirements applicable (other than the prior inspection requirements) when the person concerned applied for the grant.</P>

Following discussions, the local authority agreed to redesign certain aspects of the scheme.  When the revised proposals are received in the Department, they will be considered without delay.  The road grant commitments for 1986 notified to Dublin County Council include a sum of £500,000 for a westerly extension of the Tallaght by-pass.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 47 together.  The processing of applications for the £5,000 surrender grant is a matter for the appropriate housing authority up to the stage of certification for payment.  Certificates for payment of the grant are provided by the housing authority in whose functional area the house being purchased is situated and this is not necessarily the housing authority to which the applicant's original dwelling has been surrendered. For these reasons, the Department's records do not include details of the number of tenants who have surrendered their dwellings to a particular authority or the number of applications pending in the area of a particular authority.  The numbers of grants paid to date in respect of private houses built or purchased with the aid of the £5,000 grant, in the functional areas of Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council are 280 and 958 respectively.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer submitted a claim to the inspector of taxes on 22 January 1985 for tax relief in respect of loan interest paid in 1984-85.  An amended certificate of tax-free allowances for 1984-85, incorporating the appropriate interest relief, was issued to him in February 1985.  The tax overdeducted from his earnings since the previous 6 April was refundable by his employer on the operation of this certificate.  A review of his liability for the year 1984-85, which has recently been completed, revealed that the correct amount of tax was deducted from his earnings in that year. The taxpayer has been granted interest relief of £574 in his certificate of tax-free allowances for the current year, 1985-86.</P>

I am hopeful that these negotiations can be brought to a satisfactory agreed conclusion in the current year.</P>
      <P>It has been the policy of successive Governments that pensionability in the public sector be confined to wholetime, salaried employees who are directly employed under a contract of service. Any departure from this general policy on superannuation in the public sector, in respect of those doctors who provide services as self-employed independent contractors in the general medical service, would have very serious implications for many other groups who are similarly excluded from pensionability. These would include a variety of parttime employees and self-employed or fee-paid individuals who provide services to the State.  The cost implications of any extension of public sector pensionability, beyond the well-established categories of entitlement, would be such that the prospect cannot be contemplated.  No estimate of the costs of providing a public service pension specifically for those doctors who participate as independent self-employed contractors in the GMS has been prepared.</P>

    <P>The figures above show vacancies which are filled on a temporary basis and the decision on filling them on a permanent basis will be made by the health boards when the budget allocations for 1986 have been examined.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons why the vacant posts have not been filled.  They arise from service developments, staff mobility and redeployment and decisions in respect of them are made on an ongoing basis by the management of the health boards.  The vacancies in the process of being filled represent those which have been advertised, or for which interviews are being conducted at present, and include some which are listed as filled on a temporary basis.</P>

      <P>Because of the variations in the type of children catered for from residential home to residential home, and consequently, in the type and cost of the service provided, it is not possible to give a true average cost per child for maintenance in residential care on a health board area basis.  Not every health board has a need to have provided the full range of residential services in its area and may avail of facilities funded by neighbouring boards as the need arises.  Homes are funded directly, on an agreed budget basis, by their local health board and latest available audited accounts relate to the year ending 31 December 1984.  I have set out, therefore, in the following tabular statement a <i>per capita</i> breakdown of each health board's expenditure on residential care in their area in 1984, based on average occupancy that year:</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a person must have not less than 26 contributions paid since date of entry into insurable employment.  The person concerned, who was a full-time student until June 1985, claimed unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance on 16 December 1985.  According to the Department's records the person concerned has not got 26 contributions paid and therefore does not satisfy the contribution condition for entitlement to unemployment benefit.</P>

    <P>Her claim for unemployment assistance was disallowed on the grounds that by failing to furnish particulars of her means she failed to show that her means did not exceed the statutory limit.

    <P>The person concerned continued to submit medical certificates after 13 November 1985 showing the same incapacity and her claim has been further disallowed from that date.  She has been notified of this disallowance and advised of her right to appeal.  Payment of disability benefit was issued in error for the periods from 2 December 1985 to 11 December 1985 (£52) and from 12 December 1985 to 8 January 1986 (£138.80).  The additional medical evidence submitted in respect of the period March 1985 to November 1985 was forwarded to the appeals officer for consideration.

      <P>It is understood from the North-Eastern Health Board, which administers the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in County Louth, that the person concerned made an application under the scheme for assistance towards his mortgage repayments.  The board decided that the applicant was not entitled to a weekly allowance on the ground that his means, consisting of unemployment and pay-related benefits, exceeded the limit for entitlement.  However, an exceptional needs payment of £300 was made to him on 25 February 1986, towards arears of interest on his mortgage repayments.</P>

      <P>The unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that his means, derived from the profit from his holding, and from capital, exceeded the statutory limit.  Under new arrangements in operation since 12 June 1985, there is a special procedure for dealing with applications by smallholders for reinvestigation of means.  Following reinvestigation by a social welfare officer, details of the various items of income and expenses upon which the deciding officer makes his decision are sent to the applicant. Where he is dissatisfied with the decision he can appeal and ask for an oral hearing at which he can put his case in detail to the appeals officer.  A number of temporary appeals officers were appointed to deal with oral hearings of appeals by smallholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned appealed prior to the introduction of the new arrangements and as the appeals officer considered that he had sufficient information to proceed without an oral hearing, he decided, summarily, that the means of the person concerned exceeded the statutory limit.  It was not the practice at that time to issue a detailed breakdown of the means assessed.  The person concerned has applied to have his means reinvestigated and the papers were referred to the social welfare officer.  His entitlement to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of the means assessed against him.  If he is then dissatisfied <Col N="764" /> with the amount of means assessed against him it will be open to him to appeal and request an oral appeal hearing.</P>
    <P>The claim papers are at present with the social welfare officer and it has not been possible in the time available to ascertain the position regarding any receipts received.

There is also need to expand production and to organise marketing in a cohesive way so as to gain a greater influence in the market place.

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The major part of soft fruit production in this country goes for processing and output has remained fairly constant over the past five years at an average annual figure of 3,200 tonnes.  About half of this went to local processors and the other half was exported in temporary preservative to processing firms in the UK. Imports of soft fruit preserved by freezing or in temporary preservative were also fairly constant over the same period at an annual average of 530 tonnes.</P>
      <P>Under EC regulations there is free trade in soft fruit products.  Imports into the Community of raspberries in temporary preservative are subject to a minimum import price.  Also strawberries and raspberries preserved are subject to a minimum import price.  Also strawberries and raspberries preserved by freezing or in temporary preservative from non-EC countries are subject to a monitoring procedure by the EC Commission to ensure that there is no distortion of trade.</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture operate a certification scheme for soft fruit planting material to ensure that there is high quality material available to growers. An Foras Talúntais is carrying out a programme of research on a number of aspects of soft fruit production, including the breeding of new varieties, evaluation of new varieties and various aspects of crop management and husbandry. ACOT has assigned fruit enterprise advisers to the main soft fruit production areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the reason a person (details supplied) in County Cork was not paid headage money when in fact his Department in Cork indicated to him in writing that he was in the disadvantaged area since 25 June 1985; and if he is not being paid, the reason he was informed he was in this area in June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason my Department indicated in June 1985 to the person named that he was in a disadvantaged area was to inform him of his entitlement to a reduction in the milk co-responsibility levy from a current date in 1985.  It was not, however, possible to pay 1985 headage grants in the extended areas from a current date in 1985 even if the necessary additional Exchequer funds had been available.  The reasons for this are that disadvantaged areas schemes operate on a calendar year basis and the 1985 application forms for sheep, cattle and beef cow headage had already been issued, sheep inspections had been completed and cattle inspections had commenced by the time (27 June 1985) the extended list of disadvantaged areas had been approved in Brussels. Both flockowners and herdowners in the area concerned can, of course, apply for headage grants under the 1986 disadvantaged areas schemes.</P>

      <P>Under the Community regulations milk quotas are tied to the land.  Accordingly a quota may not be leased or sold unless the land to which the quota is attached is leased or sold.  I have laid down that valid legal leasing agreements must be entered into to ensure that adjustment of quotas will occur only where bona fide land transactions have taken place.</P>

      <P>The number of gardaí to be appointed to the force in 1986 will depend on the number of vacancies arising during the year due to retirements, deaths, or resignations etc.  It is difficult to give a precise figure but present indications are that a total of about 270 will be appointed this year.</P>
      <P>Candidates who qualified at the competitive interview conducted by the Civil Service Commission in connection with the last recruitment competition were placed in order of merit by the Commission and are considered for appointment in that order.  Recruitment is continuing but a decision has not yet been taken as to precisely how many of those who qualified in the last recruitment competition will be offered appointments. This will depend mainly on when the next recruitment competition will be held.  The standards and requirements for admission to the force are at present under review with a view to introducing new procedures for the next competition. Pending completion of this review I am not in a position to indicate when that competition will be held but I hope to be able to make an announcement in the matter shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149 and 150 together.</P>
      <P>Proposals aimed at reducing the amount of Garda time spent in the courts are constantly under review by the Garda authorities and certain changes in procedures within the courts system have already been put into effect notably in the Dublin Metropolitan District Courts where a great deal of summonses scheduling work has been computerised.  The implementation of other proposals will require amending legislation.  I should mention that sections 12 and 22 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, which provide, in certain circumstances, for the admissibility as evidence in criminal trials of proof by written statement and proof by formal admission, would have the effect of reducing Garda time spent in court attendance.</P>
      <P>With regard to the situation in Galway District Court, I understand cases are dealt with expeditiously, and that the timetable of cases is arranged so that Garda cases, in which a garda is prosecuting in his own name, are called first in each day's session so that individual gardaí are not unduly delayed in court.</P>
      <P>A measure that is generally considered appropriate in relation to the reduction of Garda time spent in court attendance is the extension of the fine-on-the-spot system.  The question of improving and extending the existing system is one of the matters currently being considered by the inter-departmental committee on enforcement of roads related legislation under the aegis of the Minister for the Environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151, 153 and 154 together.  There are two courtrooms in Galway courthouse and I am satisfied that these are sufficient.  No District Court sittings have been lost to date as a result of sittings of the High or Circuit Courts.  When both courtrooms are required by the High Court the local authority provides alternative temporary accommodation for the District Court in a local hall.  Under the provisions of the Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935, responsibility for providing and maintaining courthouses rests with the relevant local authority.  It is a matter for the county registrar, in the first instance, to arrange with the local authority for any repairs he considers necessary.  In the event of failure by a local authority to keep their court accommodation in proper repair and condition the Minister for Justice is empowered under section 6 (1) (a) of the 1935 Act to direct the Commissioners for Public Works to carry out the necessary repairs on the basis that the local authority will be required to recoup the costs and expenses involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="777" /> My Department have been in correspondence with Galway Corporation impressing on them their responsibilities in this matter.  While the power to involve the office of Public Works has been invoked in the recent past in relation to specific works for Galway courthouse, I do not consider that such involvement would be warranted at this stage in relation to further works considered necessary, but I am keeping the situation under review.</P>
    <P>The major restoration of Tralee courthouse was undertaken by Kerry County Council and the project was completed in September 1981.  The total cost of the project (£577,000) was borne by Kerry County Council who were given access to the local loans fund for the purpose.</P>
    <P>Waterford courthouse was restored by the Office of Public Works on foot of a direction by the Minister for Justice under the 1935 Act.  The project was completed in August 1982.  The total cost (approximately £1.7 million) was met initially by the Office of Public works but the cost was recouped by Waterford Corporation which were given local loan fund facilities for that purpose.</P>
