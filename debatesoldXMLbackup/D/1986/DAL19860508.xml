    <P>
      <Col N="272" /> SECTION 55.</P>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 55 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposed to this section as a matter of protest against the tax impositions of this and all the following sections.  We are opposing this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, this section, along with the others that follow it, forms an integral part of the financial provisions made by the Government in the budget. The purpose of these financial provisions is to provide for reductions in the income tax provisions we have had occasion to debate already.  As I pointed out to the House, we are having significant reductions in income tax in this year's budget.</P>
      <P>I must confess to a certain puzzlement that Deputy O'Kennedy would seek to oppose this section because it is merely an interpretation section.  Whatever about opposing sections that actually mean something, opposing sections which merely determine the meaning of terms would suggest to me that perhaps Deputy O'Kennedy had not even read the Bill, or certainly the section, before he decided to oppose it.  It is not normal to suggest that one will oppose an interpretation section, whatever about opposing sections that impose a charge, when there may be a legitimate reason for so doing.  I am puzzled that Deputy O'Kennedy should oppose an interpretation section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is easily puzzled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the public would be interested to know why an interpretation section, rather than the others which we would reach in a few minutes, should have been chosen by Deputy O'Kennedy as something he would oppose.  Although the section contains two lines only &mdash; and therefore would not <Col N="273" /> tax anybody to read them &mdash; I would have to ask the Deputy whether he actually read the section before getting up to oppose it.  It would appear to me that opposing an interpretation section is a rather odd procedure, to say the least. However, I will read the section for the benefit of the House so that the House can come to its own conclusions as to Deputy O'Kennedy's momentous logic in deciding to oppose a section of this innocuous character.  The section says:</P>
      <P>In this Part &ldquo;the Order of 1975&rdquo; means the Imposition of Duties (No. 221) (Excise Duties) Order, 1975 (S.I No. 307 of 1975).</P>
      <P>I must ask myself: what great issue of public policy is Deputy O'Kennedy raising when he wishes, perhaps, to seek to have this House vote on this section involving considerable loss of time in a debate of limited time, indeed limited on the basis of an agreement with Deputy O'Kennedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wants, I will explain to him again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be interested to hear from Deputy O'Kennedy why he should oppose an interpretation section. Certainly I am prepared to be enlightened on this subject, as that is reasonable, but I must confess to a certain puzzlement that the Deputy would wish to oppose an interpretation section when he has plenty of opportunity all day to oppose and discuss substantial sections that impose actual charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not need to justify to this Minister or this Government what action I take and the reasons for it.  But, in so far as the Minister does not appear to have even the capacity to understand our position on this whole Part I indicated to him, had he been listening, that I am opposing this as a formal protest against all of the other sections that follow imposing the heaviest levels of excise duty across a range of <Col N="274" /> products, be they petroleum, beer, spirits, each and every one of them.  If the Minister is not conscious of the fact that this Government have raised indirect taxes to the highest level of any country in western democracy, then he should not be where he is.  After full consultations, on behalf of my party, I have decided that this section which the Minister acknowledges is an interpretation section &mdash; I presume it is inserted for some purpose because the Minister inserted it at the beginning of the customs and excise provisions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy reads it he will know exactly what is its purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of it. It is for that reason that I am using this procedure, if you like to demonstrate our total opposition to what follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is interesting as an indication of the studiousness with which Deputy O'Kennedy applies himself to his brief, that when he has plenty of opportunity to oppose sections that actually impose charges, he proposes to initiate a debate on an interpretation section which merely defines, for the purpose of the section, what order we are talking about, that is the Order of 1975.  It does not impose a charge; it does not argue about any matter.</P>
      <P>I would have to assume that this is an example of the same studiousness that Deputy O'Kennedy applied when he put the Members of this House, and his own party, through the House to vote against section 3 of the Bill.  If that vote had been carried all of the tax reliefs granted in this budget would have been withdrawn and we would have been back to a higher level of taxation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not dealing with the point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet Deputy O'Kennedy and his colleagues on the other side voted against the tax reliefs in this budget.  Therefore, I must ask myself: what degree of thought did they put into <Col N="275" /> the position they adopted in this House, having called for larger tax reliefs, they then proceed to actually vote against what they would describe as the limited tax reliefs.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that Deputy O'Kennedy should seek to oppose an interpretation section but in view of the illustration&mdash;and it is merely an illustration I have just given&mdash;of his mastery of parliamentary tactics, I am not really surprised that he should choose to oppose an interpretation section when there are plenty of others he could have opposed.  I suppose I am not to be a judge of Deputy O'Kennedy's parliamentary tactics.  Indeed, I am advised that he consulted with his Leader on this subject as well, or so he tells us, and that after deep consultation he decided to oppose this section.  I invite the Leader of his party to intervene in this debate and perhaps advise us why he agrees with Deputy O'Kennedy in deciding to oppose a mere interpretation section when there are so many other things upon which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In continuing my contribution, I have no wish to be interrupted by Deputy Haughey, or indeed to provoke the Deputy by pointing out the ridicule in which he is putting himself and his party by defending his spokesman on this occasion in proposing to waste the time of the House in a division on a mere interpretation section, which as far as taxation is concerned means absolutely nothing.</P>

      <P>But that does not appear to worry Deputy O'Kennedy.  He is perfectly happy to oppose a section of this kind.  I should like to advise the House, in view of the fact that Deputy O'Kennedy has raised the matter, that this is quite a lengthy Imposition of Duties Order of 1975.  It contains many sections, but to the best of my knowledge it has been accepted as a normal part of a Finance Bill that this order be cited in Finance Bills in the definition section at the beginning of this part of the Bill each year as being the order of 1975.  That definition is accepted; we would have to cite the order in full in the Bill if we were not allowed to use the shorthand term &ldquo;Order of 1975&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy has complained about the length of the Finance Bill.  It would be far longer if we had to reproduce the entire contents of the order of 1975, which runs to many pages.  I am sure that he is familiar with the order, having read it, in view of his having raised an objection.  I would invite Deputy O'Kennedy to indicate what objection he has to the order of 1975 being cited in this case by shorthand rather than <i>in extenso.</i> It strikes me as rather strange that when he could oppose so many substantial <Col N="277" /> matters in the Bill he chooses to have a division on a mere interpretation section.  I must say that it reminds me of his parliamentary folly on section 3, when he opposed the giving of tax reliefs.  He is similarly wasting the time of the Members of his own party by going <Col N="278" /> through lobbies on an occasion of this kind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I must confess to a certain amusement that Deputy O'Kennedy has now succeeded in his great ambition and had a division on the interpretation sections.  Obviously, his warm feelings about this interpretation section were not shared by many of his Members because a very large number of them were absent.  This suggests that it is not only Deputy Haughey who has no confidence in Deputy O'Kennedy but the entire Fianna Fáil Party have no confidence in him either because they did not show much confidence in turning up for the division lobby this morning.  This suggests that Deputy O'Kennedy should, to use the time honoured phrase, consider his position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section imposes extra excise duty on petroleum products. I want to outline in detail the impact of the excise and VAT levels which the Government have imposed on petroleum products.  The House having listened, if they do, will be satisfied that as a consequence of the level of excise duties which are being imposed by the Government the case for opposing this section is unanswerable for those who wish to listen.  For those who do not, it is a matter for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time the Minister for Finance has had some good advice, not just from this side of the House but, may I say as well, from sensible Deputies in his own party in relation to tax impacts, particularly the effect they are having on certain regions.  I want to instance sensible Deputies such as Deputy McGahon, who has on many occasions spoken in this House on behalf of his constituents, who have been very seriously affected.  I suspect that this must be affecting County Meath, the county which the Minister and Deputy Farrelly represent.  They must know that the impact of the level of duty which they are imposing on hydrocarbons has been disastrous for the whole economy but in particular has decimated the Border regions.  I would like to illustrate this by reference to figures which cannot be contradicted because they are official <Col N="281" /> figures released by the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>When this Government came into office in 1982 the actual consumption of petroleum products was 49.10 million hectolitres.  That consumption dropped in 1985 to 41.71 million hectolitres, a drop of over eight million hectolitres. This represents a drop of 20 per cent in the current consumption below last year's figures.  To go back a little further, because this Minister had a hand in this during his short period as Minister in the last Coalition Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>1980 would be a good year to go back to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going back to 1980 if the Minister would allow me to do so.  All the indications are that his stay in office this time will be even shorter and that the consequence of the excise duties which he is imposing will be even more disastrous.  The actual consumption of petroleum products in 1980, before this Minister got his hands on the loot as a previous leader of his party would have said, was 61.75 million hectolitres.  That is quite extraordinary.  That figure has now dropped to 41.71 million hectolitres. The drop in consumption of petroleum products since then is exactly half of current consumption.  There is no State anywhere in the world that can point to such a huge drop in the consumption of any product and especially petroleum products. This is as a direct consequence of the level of taxation imposed by this Government and which the Minister now proposes to increase in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tax element in the retail price of premium grade petrol is now 67 per cent. Before this Minister went in the wrong direction and started to impose penal levels of taxation, the tax element on the retail price of premium grade petrol was 48 per cent.  We are witnessing the most outrageous consequences of ridiculous levels of taxation on our petroleum products in particular.  This can be further illustrated by reference to the effect it is having especially on the motor industry. The fall off in consumption is reflected <Col N="282" /> even in general revenue.  Before this Minister came into office there were increases of the order of 25 per cent per annum.  The increase in revenue from petroleum products in 1984 over 1983 was just less than 2 per cent.  With this extra level of excise duty being imposed, all the indications are that the Minister is determined to do four things: first of all, to ensure that the revenue which will accrue even to himself and to the Revenue Commissioners will be further diminished; secondly, to crucify the motorists and the motoring public; thirdly, to decimate the industry; and, fourthly, to continue to make a major contribution to the Exchequer of the British Government through cross-Border leakage which is particularly evident in this area.  In 1980 petrol sales through retail outlets represented 1,325,000 litres.  In 1985 that figure had dropped to just over one million litres.  These figures are available in the Minister's Department.  The Government seem determined to continue on this path and Excise duty receipts are dropping all the time.</P>
    <P>Between 1982 and 1984 deliveries of petrol to outlets in Border areas, including the Minister's constituency&mdash;my colleagues have been arguing in favour of some scope for economic activity in their counties&mdash;dropped by 58 million litres causing the closure of 57 filling stations and the loss of not less than 200 jobs. This pattern has increased since then and is continuing all the time.  Anyone who goes near the Border will see, as I have seen myself on more than one occasion, that we are witnessing the inevitable consequences of crazy tax levels.</P>
    <P>Since I came to the Oireachtas I have not seen a Government getting the benefit of such opportunities from outside as this Government have been getting. The price of oil on international markets has dropped in the space of nine months to pre-1973 levels.  Everywhere else throughout the world Governments are properly taking advantage of this marvellous bonanza to generate new economic activity by passing on the benefits of falling oil prices, which have dropped in nine months by as much as <Col N="283" /> they increased in ten years.</P>
    <P>But what do the Government propose to do?  They propose not only to maintain present levels of taxation but to impose more and more taxes.  Even when benefits are due to accrue, the people are being told that the Government are determined that these benefits will not be passed on.  I wonder if the Minister was up in time this morning to hear on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; a very eminent international economist and consultant on government policy, Victor Kian, who will be addressing the Marketing Institute of Ireland this evening on the subject &ldquo;Going for It&rdquo;. His theme will be that, now that we have a chance, we should take it and go for it. He was asked this morning what the Irish people ought to do in present circumstances. I would point out that he is not associated with any group in Ireland.  He told the interviewer that the first thing the Irish people should do is to change the Government.</P>
    <P>The man is an international economist of the highest repute.  He said that, instead of allowing the extra benefits from outside to be passed on here, the Government are continuing to follow the blind path of imposing extra taxes on every possible commodity.  <i>The Irish Times</i> today carries an advertisement for this evening's lecture and on the back page, in the same column, the paper carries an advertisement from motoring interests headed &ldquo;Axe the Tax&rdquo;.  It states:</P>
    <P>Did you know:</P>
    <P>1.  That for every £10 you pay for petrol the Government tax take is £6.67?</P>
    <P>I do, and so does the Minister.  In other words, out of every £10 paid, retail, for petrol the retailers and the petrol companies take £3.30.  The petrol companies have been described as major barons and as &ldquo;The Seven Sisters&rdquo;, but they are getting only a minuscule proportion of the price of petrol, 3.30 per cent.  The advertisement continues:</P>
    <P>2.  That when you buy a £10,000 <Col N="284" /> family car the Government collect £4,200.</P>
    <P>Cheers for the Government, who collect 42 per cent out of every £10,000 car sold. The advertisement goes on:</P>
    <P>3.  That Government taxes on motoring amount to £800 million a year &mdash;£1,200 per car owner.</P>
    <P>That is the reality and motoring interests have found it necessary to draw public attention to the harsh taxes of the Government.  The final paragraph in the advertisement is:</P>
    <P>Join the campaign to cut motoring taxes.  Visit the SIMI Stand in Hall E at the Spring Show and collect your free car sticker.</P>
    <P>That is the only free thing car owners will get.  Maybe the Minister should go there. The advertisement finishes &ldquo;Axe the Tax&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The figures I have given demonstrate beyond yea or nay that it is time the Government realised that a policy based on imposing the highest levels of tax on every possible product has been disastrously wrong.  One of the reason why those Border counties, with which the Chair is familiar, have been decimated in the past few years is that the price differential in regard to petrol here and in the North is a major attraction for all Irish citizens living within 30 miles of the Border to go North to buy petrol, to the benefit of Margeret Thatcher and her Chancellor of the Exchequer.  Of course, while they are there to fill their tanks they buy other commodities in respect of which the price differential may not be so great, beer, spirits and other goods. The Irish economy generally, but the Border counties in particular, even the Minister's county, have been suffering greviously from such differentials.  My advice therefore is that, instead of axing the tax we should axe the Government because while they are there the economy will continue to suffer, and so will our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The most substantial <Col N="285" /> advice the Deputy gave during his long contribution, and the only one with which I agree, was to people to visit the Spring Show.  He, particularly, is not in a great position to put this case because when he was Minister for Finance in 1980 he had the doubtful distinction of adding 13.3 per cent to the tax on petrol.  The budget this year increased the tax by 3.6 per cent, only a quarter of the level of increase imposed by Deputy O'Kennedy when he had the honour to hold the office I now hold.  We all learn from our mistakes and perhaps Deputy O'Kennedy, in Opposition, has realised how bad his 1980 budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Deputy to do the same in regard to the 1980 figures.  I make the point that our level of taxation on petrol is not by any means the highest in Europe.  France, Italy and Denmark have higher rates of taxation. Deputy O'Kennedy will not be aware that in discussions in the meetings of the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers which I attend regularly, views have been expressed by a number of Ministers that it is appropriate during this year for them to increase further the level of taxation on petrol in order to ensure there is not a distortion of energy prices on a temporary basis because of the recent fall in prices.  Other Governments are considering increases in petrol prices on top of existing levels.  I can tell the House we have no plans to follow that advice which is being tendered by member Governments in the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should follow the advice of Deputy McGahon. He is a sensible man.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The ultimate result of Deputy O'Kennedy's advice would be that taxation policies here with regard to excise duties would be determined not by decisions of our Government but by the decisions of Her Majesty's Government in Britain.  If Deputy O'Kennedy's advice were to be the guiding principle, essentially we would set our petrol price by reference to whatever decision was made by the Rt. Hon. Nigel Lawson, Chancellor of the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>For reasons that are well known to the Deputy &mdash; he had a part in them &mdash; we have a far larger financial requirement. A vast amount of spending was initiated in 1977 by Deputy O'Kennedy and his colleagues and thus we now have the situation that virtually every pound of income tax has to be used to pay interest on debt.  Essentially, we have to run the country on whatever revenue we can get from VAT and excise duties.  Were that not the situation, of course we would have lower levels of excise duties on petrol.  We would like to be able to do what some other countries have been able to do, but not all countries because, as I have pointed out, three other countries have higher rates on petrol.  If we had not accumulated this very large level of debt through policies in which Deputy O'Kennedy played a large part, we would not need to have duties as high as they are. However, we can only take the situation as we find it, as it was left by Deputy O'Kennedy and his friends when they left office initially in 1981 and finally in November 1982.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy seems to be unable to make speeches for himself.  He has to quote foreign economists who are offering political advice to us.  Deputy O'Kennedy might not think it entirely appropriate to use quotations of that kind.  The Irish people are well able to make up their own minds about who should govern them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The people are well able to make up their minds about how <Col N="287" /> they should be governed without the advice of foreign economists, quoted with approval by Deputy O'Kennedy, in addition to his suggestion that we should keep our policy on excise duty in line with that initiated by the Government across the water.</P>
      <P>Of course I have to admit that the level of excise duty on petrol is higher than we would like it to be.  I further admit that it causes considerable distortion of trade on the Border, that because of the wide difference in price there are people who frequently buy their petrol on the other side of the Border.  Anybody who did not admit that would be blind.  That is the case and there is no point arguing about it.  What we have to recognise is that that situation is the direct result of the fact that our income tax is entirely used up in debt servicing.  A large part of the responsibility for that rests on the shoulders of the party opposite because they got the country to the point where we do not have the freedom we would wish to levy lower taxes of various kinds.  Deputy O'Kennedy opposes the suggestion that we should raise the money by substantially increasing income tax and he also opposes cutting public expenditure in various areas.  Unless he wants us to do those things, I cannot see what choice there is, given the legacy of debt the Government have to service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but to have an unacceptably, and regrettably, high level of taxation in respect of excise duties. That is the reality that faces the country and no amount of sonorous oratory by Deputy O'Kennedy will change that fact or erase his own record in the matter. When he had the opportunity to do something about it he increased petrol prices by 13.3 per cent in 1980 as against an increase of 3.6 per cent this year.  Those material facts must be put before the house.  If Deputy O'Kennedy calls for a vote on this occasion, I hope he will have more support from his party than he got <Col N="288" /> on the last division.  He was able to get in only 57 members of his party.  It appears they do not share his view of parliamentary amusement and time wasting in calling for a division on the interpretation of sections.</P>

      <P>The Minister has invited me to call for a division but I do not propose to do that immediately.  He referred to 1980, the year after I was responsible for financial affairs.  Will he indicate the total tax on a premium grade of petrol after 1980?  Then, let him indicate the difference between that and what he is now proposing.  Those figures will show more than anything else the real facts of the situation.  The Minister made the case that I imposed a crushing burden of taxation on motorists.</P>

      <P>I invite the Minister to put on the record the total tax element on a premium grade gallon of petrol after I left office as Minister for Finance and to compare that with the figure he is now proposing by way of total tax.  The figure is now 178p of the total price of 266p but before the Government came to office on the last occasion the figure was 138p. There has been an increase of 40p per gallon of petrol in the past few years.</P>

      <P>I was sorry to hear Deputy O'Kennedy make personal references to the Minister for Finance. At least he should give the Minister credit for introducing a Finance Bill that was a great improvement on the budget.  For <Col N="289" /> that reason I pay my compliments to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy O'Kennedy, I was up early this morning and I heard that economist exercising all his eloquence on radio in an appeal for a change of Government. The first thing that crossed my mind was that the economist was visiting this country to deliver an address and that he did not know the Opposition.  Otherwise he might not have been so eloquent.</P>

      <P>I have visited many countries but I always made sure when I was abroad as a guest never to make any reference to the economy or the state of Government within a country. We hear the Minister blaming Deputy O'Kennedy for the high rate of duty on petrol and Deputy O'Kennedy blaming the Minister for it.  The motorist does not give two damns who is responsible &mdash; he has to pay.  I appeal to the Minister to do something about the price of petrol.  While he states that other countries have higher rates of duty on petrol, these countries may not have such a high rate of tax and the outrageous rates of insurance which amount to sums of £1,000 or £1,200 per annum for some motorists, as well as the additional price of oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the dearest possible motoring in the world.  In Ireland motoring is no longer a luxury but a necessity.  Every worker has a car, although whether he has paid for it is a different matter.  Every family must have a car.  Taking into consideration the level of taxation and the amount of money screwed out of motorists by the insurance companies, as well as the amount taken in additional taxes by the State, the time has come for the <Col N="290" /> Minister for Finance to set up a commission to investigate the problems of motorists.  That commission should be given six months to make a report on methods of bringing down the price of motoring.  It is impossible for motorists to pay the present rates.</P>

      <P>I was expecting the reductions in the price of oil and petrol on the international market to be passed on to the motorist to a much greater extent rather than used to relieve the Exchequer.  The Minister for Finance has plenty of common sense and an abundance of intelligence and, whatever Deputy O'Kennedy may say, he knows the people, meets them and realises their problems.  I ask him to examine the problems of motorists in regard to the rates of duty on petrol and to convince his Cabinet colleagues that it is in the interests of the people and of the economy that a greater amount of the reduction in prices should be passed on to the motorist. I am a firm believer in this principle and it would be wrong if I did not make that statement and give the Minister the value of my opinion in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most serious aspect of the difference in petrol prices here and in the Six Counties is that when a motorist crosses the Border to fill his tank he does not immediately return to the Republic but spends more money.  If he is accompanied by his wife and family they may do their shopping across the Border.  This is a considerable loss to our economy and it is adding considerably to the economy of the Six Counties.  I cannot say whether it is part of Government policy to encourage spending by people from the Republic in the Six Counties for the purpose of improving the economy in the North of Ireland.  I assure the House it is not the way I would do it.  It is wrong that this encouragement should be given.  Some motorists have to travel only a couple of hundred yards to cross the Border.  We all know, Border Deputies especially, that it is quite wrong to have this great gap in the price of petrol as between here and <Col N="291" /> the North because we are encouraging our people to contribute to the financial structure of the British Government in Northern Ireland.  I would be the last man in this House to contribute one penny to the British economy.  There is a principle involved in this matter in the Border areas.</P>
    <P>There is also a grave concern on the part of motorists who feel they have been rooked by the insurance companies and through the tax on cars and on petrol, especially when they read in the papers about the vast reduction in the price of oil from Arabian oil wells and elsewhere. A greater proportion of the reduction should be passed on to the motorist.  If the Minister cannot do it now, let us hope that next year he will be presenting an even more favourable budget and that, in the light of the opinions which are being expressed, he will do something to help the motorist.  He must realise that motoring is no longer a luxury but an absolute necessity.</P>
    <P>It is alarming how many people employed in Dublin drive up each day from the midlands.  A great part of their income is spent on petrol, money which they should be spending on food and clothing for their families in order to improve their standard of living.  I ask the Minister to do something within the next few months to assist the motorist who feels he is being scourged by the insurance companies and by the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with every word Deputy Flanagan has said.  I come from a Border constituency and Sligo town is only 30 milies from Enniskillen. Many people go there to fill their petrol tanks.  People from Manorhamilton and other parts of north and south Leitrim also cross the Border.  They are not just filling their cars, they are bringing home the groceries and various household goods from Northern Ireland and leaving their money to the British.  I am concerned about that.  I am concerned about the number of small businesses and shops that have closed in recent times in Border <Col N="292" /> counties and in Sligo town.  Only yesterday I put down a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce asking him when it was hoped to reduce the price of lubricating oil to coincide with the reduction in the price of petrol and other oils.  The Minister replied that he was not aware of any difficulties at present in relation to the price of lubricating oil further arising from the reduction in petrol and petroleum products generally or otherwise.  We know very well that the price of lubricating oil has not come down.  Whoever gave that reply did not do very much research into it.  I am asking the Minister here now to find out the price of lubricating oils because people are going across the Border and bringing back five-gallon drums of it at less than half the price it is in the Republic.  There has been no reduction whatsoever in the price of lubricating oils here to coincide with the way the price of petrol has come down in recent times.</P>
      <P>People are going across the Border to buy parts for cars, tractors and other things.  If something is not done about the price of petrol our hard-pressed motorists will not be able to keep going.  A car is no longer a luxury; it is a necessity in every part of Ireland today.  A person using a car every day to go to work is taxed to the hilt.  The Minister here this morning blamed Fianna Fáil.  He blamed Deputy O'Kennedy and his Government. The Minister is going into the fourth year now in Government.  Let the Government govern the country and not go blaming Fianna Fáil for every thing that goes wrong.  The Minister should forget about that.  We have listened to this for the past three or four months. This Government were elected three and a half years ago.  For goodness sake, let them govern the country.  The Government are borrowing more now than was ever borrowed before and they are borrowing it not for productive purposes but to pay men on the dole.  I say to the Minister for Finance to forget about Fianna Fáil.  He is three and a half years in Government.  Let the Government govern the country the way they should.</P>

      <P>It would take more than four years for the economy to recover from the appalling consequences of the most notorious political document ever produced, the 1977 Manifesto, the repercussions which will be felt well into the next century by the unfortunate people.  Having said that, I am going to identify with much of what has been said by Deputies from all sides of the House. Deputy Brennan spoke about the situation in Sligo, 30 miles from the Border. I would like to tell the Minister about the chaotic situation in my economically crippled town of Dundalk, which has borne the brunt of the Ulster troubles over the last 20 years without any compensatory measure or any recognition from any Government, my own included. I would point to the lack of a definite Border policy.  What political party has ever produced a Border policy?  In 1984 the Border area was clearly identified by the European Economic and Social Council report as being among the most underprivileged areas in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in the Border region cannot be allowed to deteriorate any further. My town is the biggest in Ireland, with a population of 30,000 people, and it is a receiver's graveyard.  Virtually every business that is left has a &ldquo;For sale&rdquo; notice.  The only real activity is by the receivers and their staffs and the hundreds of thousands of people who go through there on their way to the North to the new town of El Dorado, Newry. It has been clearly said here today that petrol sales are the big drawing power. Is the Minister aware of the new trading village that has suddenly appeared in County Armagh, Hillside, at Carrigastiken, three miles from Dundalk on the Forkhill Road, where in the last year three major petrol stations have been erected.  These are not tent villages.  This is a permanent village with three petrol stations, a shoe shop, a grocery shop and two off-licences.  Their turnover in the first year of operation was in excess of £6 million.  That money is coming directly from the town of Dundalk and the loss to the Irish Exchequer is in excess of £4 million because of the extent of the <Col N="294" /> Exchequer take from drink and from petrol.  That is an appalling wastage to the Irish economy.  There is a loss of £4 million in one little area, and we have 70 miles of Border from Dundalk to Buncrana. How much is Ireland losing?  In 1984 the exodus across the Border was horrific and it reached a crescendo with a loss to the Exchequer of about £500 million which went to the authorities in the North.  That is £500 million that we have given to Margaret Thatcher.  The Government must acknowledge the wastage in the Border area and the terrible loss.  They must find some way to close the avenues of loss.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan said that a car was now a necessity for the Irish family.  I believe there are many Irish families who are now doing without a car because of the frightening burden to the lower income family.  If they have a car they are working for the hire purchase company. Cars can be up to £1,200 cheaper in the North&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are supposed to be a member of the EC which was designed to equalise trading conditions between different countries.  That type of difference cannot be explained to the man in the street.  I appeal to the Minister, who has made a very good start in his Ministry, to recognise this dreadful drain on the Irish economy and to reduce the price of petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As many Deputies said, petrol is the drawing card which attracts people across the Border.  Once there people buy everything, including the Sunday joint. That drain on the economy in the border region has left us economically crippled. <Col N="295" /> In the latter part of 1984,200 buses passed through Dundalk to the North every Saturday.  They came from every county. The Belfast Chamber of Commerce advertised in the Irish papers the virtues of shopping in the North.  I want the Minister to reduce the price of petrol significantly to allow traders in the Border area to compete.</P>
    <P>Two national petrol companies have closed all their outlets in the Dundalk region and the few family-run businesses which are attempting to sell petrol in the Border region have to suffer the indignity of cars pulling in for 50p worth of petrol to get across the Border.  That cannot continue.  In conclusion, I ask the Minister to produce a definite Border policy for this most hard-pressed region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think my point has been proved.  We are now in May 1986 and we have some economic realities to face.  We have heard about some of them from Deputies on different sides of the House.  There is a high degree of unanimity about the economic realities we have to face, particularly in Border counties where the level of economic devastation is frightening.  One of the reasons we have that situation in those counties is that the Minister for Finance, his predecessor and the Department of Finance, seem to believe that the Republic of Ireland is some sort of autonomous island in the middle of the Atlantic and is not influenced by events elsewhere.  Of course, that is not the case.  The Minister, I thought, put it a bit too simplistically when he said that, in complaining about the level of taxation in hydrocarbons, Deputy O'Kennedy was suggesting that the level should be set in this country by the Right Honourable Nigel Lawson, Chancellor of the Exchequer.  It is a reality that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer fixes the rate of duty and therefore the price of petrol and allied products on part of this island, that there is a land border which is very extensive, that people are free to cross it, and that they do cross it in very large numbers not just for the purpose of buying petrol alone but to spend money on many other items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was intrigued by Deputy Flanagan's comment that this was a form of foreign aid.  Of course, it is.  We are the only country in the world which provides foreign aid to Britain.  I would be glad to live with that fact if the people in Northern Ireland were the only beneficiaries, but the major beneficiary is the British Exchequer.  I am not aware that the United States, Germany, Japan or any wealthy country provides foreign aid to <Col N="297" /> Britain, but the Republic of Ireland does. The reason we do this is because the Minister for Finance does not see that on an island where there is a land border between two jurisdictions you cannot have tax rates which are totally out of line with another, otherwise you distort the situation entirely.  Whether we like it or not, we have to take account of what the tax rates are in the other jurisdiction on this island, because if we do not we will devastate a substantial section of our community and lessen the overall tax take by the increases which are imposed.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted figures which would suggest that the rate of duty on petrol is higher in three other European countries than it is in Ireland, and he may well be right.</P>

      <P>There has been a marked decrease in the world price of <Col N="298" /> oil in the last six or nine months but, unhappily, this country has had the least benefit from this.  One would hardly know that the world price of oil has halved in the last year.  Perhaps if one were an industrialist using heavy fuel oil one would be aware of this fact, but an ordinary consumer of petrol or diesel would not know it because the reductions have not been as great as they should have been.  For the most part, the world price reductions have been taken up by increases in tax.  This is not happening in the majority of other European countries.</P>
      <P>For some reason motoring has always been picked out as fair game to be squeezed to the maximum possible extent.  It is worth going back to a limitation which was brought in in the 1974 Finance Act. A limit of £2,500 was placed on the value of a car for trading purposes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Companies who because of the nature of their business have to have substantial fleets of cars are being charged corporation tax on profits which they notionally make only because of that provision, but where they <Col N="300" /> have to pay corporation profits tax on profits that they do not make at all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is worth recalling in the context of this section that travelling expenses, for example, for, among others, Deputies and public servants have increased perhaps more than fourfold from that time, fivefold in some cases to take account of what is happening.  Those increases are justified, but I would have thought similar increases would have been justified for those who have to provide cars either for their employees or for themselves in the course of their business.</P>

      <P>Deputy, please stay with the section.  That is not in the section.  We are talking about hydrocarbons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very much related to what was guillotined by consent yesterday. To come back to hydrocarbons, it is not just petrol and such hydrocarbons in which we see a completely distorted situation.  Urea and nitrogenous fertilisers are manufactured from hydrocarbons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Stay away from nitrogenous fertilisers and do not refer any more to manures.  Stay with hydrocarbons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doing so.  Among hydrocarbons is natural gas.  Nitrogenous fertiliser is manufactured from natural gas, therefore from a hydrocarbon. Therefore, the duty applicable to certain hydrocarbons is appropriate and the price of hydrocarbons is appropriate.  Recently I had a question down which was disallowed for some technical reason as to why the cost of urea in this country at the moment is twice what it is in the world market.  It seems very difficult to get any explanation on that point.  Perhaps it is not surprising that we face a similar situation in regard to petrol, diesel and other hydrocarbons and that we seem unable <Col N="301" /> to get any satisfactory explanation in relation to it.</P>
      <P>Just before Christmas the Government decided to abolish the National Prices Commission.  Basically I do not quibble with that decision because the need for them at that time had largely disappeared. Now, even though inflation is extremely low and is projected to fall due to external factors even further by the end of this year &mdash; I hope that will be so &mdash; advantage is being taken of that particularly in regard to petrol.  The Government are making very little attempt, although they still retain all the necessary powers, to ensure that profiteering does not occur.  This sort of thing is not very noticeable in Dublin where there is competition but, in remoter parts of the country where there is a petrol station about every five or ten miles of the road, it is very noticeable, and very little the average consumer can do about it unless proper steps are taken to deal with it.</P>
      <P>In conclusion let me say it is very regrettable that there is such a huge discrepancy between the price of petrol here and in other European countries and particularly in Britain and Northern Ireland. The Minister is being quite unreal if he thinks we can act in isolation, that we can have levels of taxation on hydrocarbons, or anything else of that nature that is portable, which is completely out of line with a neighbouring jurisdiction.  We cannot do that and the sooner we begin to learn it the better because the cost of not learning it can be seen in the ghost towns which line our side of the Border.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to launch an attack on the Minister on the cost of motoring because, give or take a penny or two, no matter who is in the Minister's seat the position will be exactly as it is as long as the present political attitude on every side of this House prevails and anybody who sits there will have to do exactly what the Minister is doing. As one who comes from a peripheral region which is largely rural, let me say that anything that puts up the cost of <Col N="302" /> motoring discriminates against rural areas, particularly western areas.  The businessman, the farmer and the resident on the west coast suffer more than people in the part of the country I come from who, in their turn, suffer considerably more than those in Dublin.  Whether you are a private individual or are engaged in business, a car is an absolute necessity if you live in rural Ireland.  I do not agree that it is an absolute necessity for private citizens who live on the east coast and are fairly close to the amenities such as shops, places of worship and so on.</P>
      <P>Increased taxes on motoring and putting up costs discriminate against people in rural areas particularly in the west where generally they earn lower wages than people elsewhere because the industries they are involved in are less competitive.  They have enough disadvantages.  Very often I hear demands for regional policies that will transfer wealth to poorer areas from richer areas at both national and European levels.  Instead of always looking for handouts of money, we should search out the policies that discriminate against the poorer areas.  This is one such policy. By doing something about this, we could help to resolve a very serious problem for business people and private individuals in the poorer areas and improve their standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consider people who establish an industry in County Fermanagh.  I wish such people well because I carry my republicanism all the way.  I have as much respect for the businessman in County Fermanagh who is trying to establish a business as I have for such a person in County Leitrim.  I will not discriminate against him or advise anybody not to trade with him.  I am a free trader at European level, particularly in the Irish context.  I despise the person who claims to be a republican and the next day tells Leitrim County Council not to give a contract to the Business down the road in County Fermanagh.  He does not want to do business with them because they do not trade in the State.  However, if we want to have one country the best way of <Col N="303" /> promoting the development of relationships is to open up the Border to allow free trade.  Of course, free trade must be fair trade and it has not been fair along the Border for a number of years largely because of our Government's policies.

When I spoke on the budget I said we should devalue our currency and freeze wages and salaries, which is how I would resolve the problem.  Let other people who think this tax is wrong identify where they believe the money should come from, or where spending should be cut to compensate for the money the Minister would have to concede if he reduced this tax.  Having made that point clear, I am entitled to refer to the problems this tax creates.

I am quite prepared to face the political consequences of any action we take to reduce this tax but other Deputies are not.  They want it every way. Observers on the Northern side of the Border, shrewd business people who have watched us for 50 years, know we will not change.  They are establishing sites close to the Border to entice people from the South.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  This tax is encouraging further trade in the North, <Col N="305" /> which is regrettable, as it is the only one of our major trading partners which has a balance of trade in its favour.  The House should seriously consider the discriminatory effect which this has on the Border regions.  If two industries, one on each side of the Border, produce a similar product and find it necessary to put three cars and three sales people on the road, it is obvious that the one on the Northern side will have a great advantage which, spread over three cars and three sales representatives will be enough to swing the balance in favour of the manufacturer in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>This situation has been aggravated recently by the movement of British currency. If there is a downward trend in British currency tomorrow, people will cross the Border and the day after goods will cross the Irish Sea.  That is the trend and I urge the Minister to take note of it, regardless of what the hooters and shouters say in this House.  We must make it possible for the person who needs transport to survive in business.  Spending must be reduced or taxation increased in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if my words will fall on receptive ears as the Government seem to have all the answers in the House.  However, they are not communicating them to the people outside the House and do not seem to heed the views of ordinary people who are trying to eke out a living in very difficult circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that to request a reduction in the price of hydrocarbons, petrol, agricultural diesel and so on would mean spending cuts to help finance such a reduction.  The answer to that was contained in Deputy McGahon's speech. The level of taxation on hydrocarbons means that Northern Ireland benefits by about £500 million.  To reduce the rates of taxation on hydrocarbons here would be self-sustaining and would ensure that, without the need for any spending cuts, the level of economic activity generated on this side of the Border would be very significant.  If even a lower figure than <Col N="306" /> £500 million is accurate, Deputy McCartin's assertion that one would have to cut spending does not stand up to examination. It is implicit in our amendment that we seek fair competition for traders on this side of the Border.  That is a reasonable suggestion and it is quite clear that we have traders on this side of the Border who can compete, given the opportunity to do so.  However, they are not given that opportunity because the policies of our Government ensure that they are not in a position to compete.  Cognisance will have to be taken of that in view of the devastation caused in Border counties. Obviously I am not as aware of the situation as those who represent Border counties, but we are all aware of the bus loads leaving our own constituencies to shop in Newry.  That results not only in a lack of economic activity in Border areas but in a drop in business throughout the country.  It is very difficult to quantify the loss in figures but the concern expressed by all Members should convince the Government that funds are being soaked from the economy by shoppers going across the Border.  We are not economists and we do not have the figures, but we are aware that this is a major problem. Something will have to be done about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has the figures.  They are relatively simple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCartin had an opportunity of making his contribution without interruption and I am not prepared to tolerate him interrupting me.  It is not possible to quantify the loss to the economy and I do not think anybody can tell me how many people leave County Offaly each weekend to shop in Newry. I do not think Deputy McCartin can tell me what Leitrim people spend on groceries across the Border.  I do not think it is possible for the Minister to put a figure on that loss.  But it is a major problem and it is not confined to the sale of petrol and diesel.  Grocers and small traders who are being harassed by the Revenue Commissioners suffer most through the loss of this business.  Those people are asking Members to do something about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="307" /> I do not claim to be an expert in this field and I will not give the Minister convoluted statistics in an effort to prove that a scheme would be self-financing but I can assure him that unless something is done we will be in serious trouble.  Business concerns along the Border are suffering and the loss is being felt further afield.  The Minister must be aware, being from a constituency that is close to the Border, that many people make the journey to Newry and other Northern shopping centres, at weekends.  When we suggested a reduction in VAT rates on electrical goods last year to help business people in the South we said that it would prove to be self-financing.  That move brought results and the reduction was self-financing although the Department of Finance did not think it would be. Many electrical businesses were saved from total destruction by that reduction in VAT.  The Minister must take cognisance of Members who are unable to argue in academic terms about this problem. The case being made today is valid.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McGahon said, if we do not do something about this problem we are on a hiding to nothing.  Deputy Brennan from Sligo dealt with the cost of agricultural diesel and lubricating oil. Many farmers have approached me about that matter.  Yesterday Deputy Brennan received a reply to a question he raised in regard to that but it is obvious that the reply was not composed by the Minister because I presume he knows something about the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave the matter with the Chair.  I will obey the Chair because he is a man of sense.  The farming community, who are experiencing great difficulty, have had to pay a lot more money for diesel.  Some Members claim that farmers do not pay enough, that they have a great time and that if the Government got more from them everything would be as sound as a bell.  However, the farming community are getting a raw deal in that the huge reduction in the price of hydrocarbons has not been passed on to them. We must bear in mind that the income of farmers last year dropped by 17 per cent and that this year the figure will be greater because of the debacle in Europe some weeks ago.  An effort should be made to help the farming community in regard to the price of diesel oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seasonal workers who have been offered jobs by Bord na Móna do not find it economically worth while accepting the work because of the cost of getting to work.  A man in Clara who is asked to go to Boora as a seasonal worker with Bord na Móna for six months and help him accumulate sufficient stamps to keep him going during the winter.  It will cost that man between £20 and £30 per week to travel to work.  The Minister must be aware that economically it is not worth a person's while travelling any distance to work if he or she earns £200 per week. We should make it worth their while to go to work.  The cost of petrol is definitely too high.  A reduction in the price does not mean that the Government have to embark on spending cuts elsewhere in the economy.  We must consider that a lot of money is being lost to the economy because of the high cost of petrol.  All we <Col N="309" /> are asking for is a small reduction to relieve the hard-pressed sectors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members who live within a short distance of the Border, I am concerned about the number of people who travel North to do their shopping. We all accept that the price of petroleum products is high and we would like to see it reduced dramatically.  The price has not fallen in line with the fall in oil prices on the international market. However, only one Member has put forward a proposal to raise the revenue that would be lost if petrol prices were reduced to the figure that prevails in the North.  The overall cost of motoring over the last ten years has increased considerably. Between 1977 and 1981 the Government increased the duty on petrol by 35p per gallon.  We must bear in mind that during those years inflation was running at 22 per cent and the increase in the duty on petrol played a big part in that.  It is true to say that the Coalition also increased the amount of duty on petrol, but the difference is that inflation now is in the region of 2½ per cent and is heading for zero.  There is a big difference in what people can buy with their take home pay now compared to what it would have bought in 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all realise that the cost of travel to work constitutes a heavy burden on one's wage packet each week.  For the life of me I cannot understand why people do not share this burden.  I am talking from experience of large numbers of people in housing estates in my constituency, people working in the same factory and on the same shift.  They all drive separately to work when the sensible thing to do would be to take one's car every third or fourth week only.  I have put that proposition to them several times but they said they prefer to travel separately and so on.  Certainly it is not easy for people who have to drive perhaps 30, 40 or 50 miles to different jobs in different locations and on different shifts.  I know of certain people who will be working for Bord na Móna this summer, people from parts of my constituency, who could <Col N="310" /> share travelling expenses, saving them a considerable amount of money.</P>
    <P>There was reference to the price of diesel oil to the farming community.  It should be remembered that the price of diesel oil to the farming community this time last year was £1.35 a gallon, whereas last week that figure had dropped to 87p a gallon.  Therefore, any Deputy contending that there has not been a substantial reduction in the cost of that product is not being factual.</P>
    <P>There was mention also of lubricating oils by one Deputy.  I accept the Deputy's concern about the reply he received to his question, that it was not an accurate reply.  I know because I happen to be involved in a small way in the distribution of lubricating oils.  I know the price of lubricating oils has been considerably reduced over the past two months.  I accept the Deputy's complaint in that respect; it would appear that the Department involved should have carried out somewhat more research.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan's suggestion about the establishment of a commission to investigate the overall cost of motoring is an excellent one, with a view to ascertaining where overall reductions could be effected.  It must be acknowledged that the cost of running a family car has risen out of all proportion in recent years. There was mention of the cost of excise duty on new cars and so on.  If the condition of our roads generally was better, then any new cars purchased would last a good deal longer.  It should be remembered also that a Government were elected to office on a wild manifesto in 1977, who decided to do away with tax on those cars.  Yet, within two years, they had doubled the £10 and £20 road tax rates.</P>
    <P>In the four years when the yield from that tax was non-existent local authorities were short of money, leading to a rapid deterioration in the condition of our roads resulting, in turn, in extra money having to be spent by the motorist on the maintenance of cars.  Therefore, it is amazing that Members of the Opposition should come in to the House and contend that this Government are crippling the <Col N="311" /> motorist to the extent of the figures they mentioned.  Yet no Opposition Member, including Deputy O'Malley &mdash; if a substantial reduction was effected in this tax, and I accept that it is particularly necessary in Border areas with which I am familiar &mdash; has suggested where the money will be found.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies mentioned the bus loads of people going to Northern Ireland to shop.  From the references to petroleum oils and so on, I wondered did such people go up on the bus to buy petrol because it appeared that was what they were doing.  I would prefer to think they were not going to buy petrol.  Deputy McGahon referred to the situation in 1984.  It should be remembered that, since then, this Government reduced the rates of VAT with the result that it is not now worth people's while going to the North on the bus to shop as they did heretofore.  There are no constructive suggestions as to how any such reduction in tax could be funded.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There was also a reference to the foreign aid we are providing for Britain because of the extent of trading going on, with people prepared to travel to the North to buy different commodities.  It appeared to me that the same Deputy was thinking about the time when he and his Government were involved in ensuring that people up there received foreign aid as far back as 1970.  As Members of this House, collectively, we should bring forward constructive proposals to compensate the Exchequer for any reduction in tax yield of the magnitude envisaged.  Because of our overall economic situation we must guard against imposing a burden on future generations by borrowing money to pay for such concessions <Col N="312" /> because that would not be a responsible way to tackle the problem.  I contend that the concern of most Deputies in this respect is genuine.</P>
    <P>The arguments put forward by Deputies who formed part of Fianna Fáil Governments, such as Deputy O'Malley and Deputy O'Kennedy, do not speak well for the way they conducted the country's affairs when they were in a position to do something about the situation.  As I said earlier, from 1977 to 1981 there was a 35 per cent increase and the present increase would be smaller in percentage terms when one takes into consideration the value of take-home pay.</P>

      <P>I shall be fairly brief because most of the points with regard to the petrol retailers in the Border constituencies have already been covered.  I am opposing this section because this increase affects every individual item purchased.  The cost of transport is a major factor in prices generally.  An important point has been made with regard to the regularly increasing cost of travel, particularly for people going to and coming from work.  Because of the scarcity of jobs, people have to travel ever further to work.  This has been happening over the past number of years. Travel costs are not tax deductible under any budgetary measures.  No Minister for Finance has allowed this.</P>

    <P>The effect of transport costs in every sphere was illustrated recently by the fact that cattle were dying in the west and north-west counties for lack of fodder. This was available in the south eastern counties at a reasonable price, but the cost of transport prevented farmers from being able to purchase that essential fodder in the south east.  Even in a small country with relatively short distances to travel such as Ireland, the cost of transport is an enormous factor in everything we do.  It is surprising that we have to bother having these petty reductions and increases in the budget at all, but I suppose it gives Deputies a useful opportunity to talk about them and making our views known.  However, in a couple of months' time there will be another reduction <Col N="313" /> of 10p, of which the Minister will grab back 5p.  The price of oil is one of the major factors in giving a boost to the economy.  If the Minister is preventing this boom, he is preventing job creation. He is increasing the cost of food products and everything else.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers on the Government side have emphasised the need for Deputies opposing these measures to say where the money can be got.  There are many ways in which that money can be got.  Deputy McCartin suggested a wage freeze.  A freeze on all handouts and grants should be suggested and the vast sums handed out by the Minister for Finance in grants used elsewhere.  Each year our party make submissions to the Minister for Finance showing where money can be got, new taxes imposed, taxes collected which remain uncollected.  On the section relating to VAT I shall be suggesting that £60 million could be saved on VAT refunds to unregistered farmers. It should be ensured that farmers register so that the actual amount of VAT to be refunded will be known, instead of having this purely notional figure which is increasing substantially every year.</P>

      <P>That £60 million saving could enable the Minister to remove the section dealing with the increase in the price of petrol and, more importantly, the 71p per hectolitre increase on diesel oil which will increase overall costs and inhibit the expansion and development which the Minister and the Government side are saying are on hand for private enterprise.  Transport costs as well as transport difficulties with regard to the conditions of the roads, are an inhibiting factor and the cost of fuel represents a very large part of these costs. This increase will have an effect, not just on those using cars or selling petrol, not on any particular section of the community, but on everybody.  The cost of fuel is reflected in the price of everything bought <Col N="314" /> in the shops.  For that reason we are opposing the section.</P>

I want to ask the support of the House for one suggestion in relation to this section.

      <P>If all sides of the House were to put their minds to tackling the present system of petrol handouts, we would not have to be imposing the proposed rate of customs and excise under this section.  It might be possible to hold the present rate of excise on hydrocarbon oils.  If we could get the oil companies to reduce their costs instead of employing these gimmicks, which in reality are being paid for by the motorist, that would be some help.  I feel strongly that that problem should be tackled.  It would reduce petrol and oil costs significantly. This House would not then be asked to pass sections of this Bill maintaining such high rates of excise on hydrocarbon oils at a time when the price is falling dramatically in other countries and here.  It could be allowed to fall even more.  We would be able to reduce excise duty if we were to tackle that specific problem.  The Minister might suggest to <Col N="315" /> some committee of the House that it might look at that point on an all-party basis.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, it is very hard to do anything about the level of taxes we have, be they excise duty or income tax, when the Government are spending two-thirds of GNP.  There is no point in criticising the Government for crippling people on one day when later on the same day we ask them to cripple people even more by spending money on all sorts of schemes while condemning them for not spending money on other schemes.  We all have pet schemes.  It is extraordinary to want to cripple people more, on the one hand, while, on the other hand, criticising the Government for crippling them to the exent they have been crippled. We have to get a certain reality into the House.  I made some suggestions yesterday about where more taxes should come from and I stand over them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious from the debate and from the speakers on the Government side that there is general agreement that taxation is too high, particularly in relation to this section.  The Government are fully aware of the consequences of the difference and disparity in the cost of fuel oils in the Republic and the Six Counties.  I, as a Border Deputy, am familiar with the devastating effect which the taxation system, as it now stands, has had on many areas in the Border regions.  Businesses are closing in the Border areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must be aware of the drastic fall-off in the Border areas in the sale of petrol and oil.  Nobody in the present day would consider purchasing fuel oil on this side of the Border if he was any way convenient to the Six Counties area.  It is a valid question to ask as to where do we find the money.  I am sure that the Minister must have in his Department the figures in relation to the haemorrhage that has taken place in the Border areas in respect of the money which is crossing to the other side.  The unfortunate aspect of this is that the <Col N="316" /> majority of the money crossing into the Six Counties area is money which has been paid out by the Government.  No matter what way we look at it, taxation on fuel oils has had a direct and indirect effect on virtually every aspect of our lives.  We are totally dependent on it no matter what walk of life we are in.</P>
    <P>Contractors can no longer compete within County Donegal and the other counties within the Border region in relation to public works.  Their counterparts in the Six Counties can undercut them on any contract.  It all hinges on the cost of oil.  The time must have arrived, if it has not passed, when the Department of Finance must seriously look at the imposition they are putting on people in the Border regions.  I believe we are being discriminated against in relation to taxation. The Revenue Commissioners are hounding business people who are making no money.  Why are they making no money?  Because of the chronic taxation system which is being imposed on virtually every commodity in which they have to do business.  In no way can they compete with their counterparts in the Six Counties.  Therefore, there must be some recognition taken of their situation and there must be some harmonisation in taxation in relation to this part of the country and the Six Counties if we are going to make any impression on our prevailing chronic unemployment situation. Despite all the drawbacks and difficulties, the tourist industry in Counties Donegal and Sligo earned £70 million last year.  I put it to the Minister: what would the tourist industry make in that region if there was an equalisation of taxation?</P>
    <P>Another disadvantage in respect of Border regions which I want to put to the Minister is in relation to the 35 per cent of oil which must be taken from Whitegate. Northern Ireland distributors are entering this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I said, business is collapsing in the Border regions.  Contractors can no longer compete with their counterparts in the Six Counties in relation to public and private works.  There must be some movement made by the Department of Finance where prices and taxation can be harmonised.  We can no longer support taxation in the region of 65 per cent to 66 per cent on a gallon of petrol.  I would ask the Minister to seriously consider this aspect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister asked me to inquire about the level of duty in 1980.  I can now tell the Minister that the figure I have is that the total price after my budget in 1980 was 150.3p and the total tax was 75.2p.  The Minister said that I imposed a huge level.  They compare with the present figure which I have been referring the Minister to of well over 178p.  Those facts are inconvertible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the Deputy making that change, it was 51.4p and he increased it to 75.2p which is a very substantial increase in percentage terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister better check his figures.  I have got these directly from the Revenue Commissioners.  I can give the Minister the precise date for all <Col N="318" /> of them.  Total tax before my budget was 55p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If you look proportionately at the increase in the present budget, which is a tiny percentage increase on the previous level of tax, the level of tax increase by Deputy O'Kennedy was proportionately much larger both on the previous base of tax applied and in absolute terms.  That is a fact. There is no need to spend much time on it as the record is there.</P>
      <P>Deputy Conaghan urged that we harmonise our tax rates with those of the UK.  I would have to point out to Deputy Conaghan that the UK is a petrol exporter and producer.  It is also a motor car exporter and producer.  Countries which produce products of that kind tend to have lower tax rates on their own products for mercantilist reasons than countries which import those products. As far as economic policy is concerned we are in a different position.  We are not a motor car manufacturer nor are we a petrol producer.  Obviously we could decide, regardless of our interests being different from those of the British, to follow their tax rates.  One of the purposes for which we obtained independence was that we would be able to make our own decisions about the structure of our tax policy.  Some people would say that even though we have done that we should follow what is done in Britain.</P>
      <P>If we are not to have excise duty on petrol at its present level we would have to raise the tax in some other way.  I doubt if Deputy Conaghan, Deputy O'Kennedy or any other Deputy who spoke on this would suggest that we increase income tax further to pay for a reduction in the price of petrol.  Some Deputies put forward the view that reductions in the price of petrol would be self-financing. They would not.  I would like to be able to reduce petrol by 5p per gallon but a reduction of that amount would reduce revenue in a full year by £11 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A reduction in the rate <Col N="319" /> of excise duty of 15p per gallon would result in an estimated loss of £30 million per annum.  Those are not figures I have produced out of my own imagination. They have been prepared by the Revenue Commissioners who have, as Deputy O'Kennedy will know, a long standing record of making accurate predictions in regard to revenue.  These figures should be accepted by the House as indicating the choices which we face.  Where will we get the money if we do not levy it on petrol?  Nobody, with one or two exceptions, in this long debate on this section has put forward alternative suggestions as to where we will get the money.</P>
      <P>Many comments were made on cross-Border traffic.  I agree it is regrettable that there is any significant cross-Border traffic.  It is also regrettable that excise duty on petrol is as high as it is.  I would very much like to be able to reduce it, but our other taxes are already spoken for.  As I have already indicated, the entire income tax revenue, with virtually no exception, has to be used solely to pay for the service of debt.  This means we have to put a much heavier burden than we would wish on the remaining taxes. We pay for every service, the defence service, the health service, the Garda service and all the other activities of the State out of excise duty and value-added tax because virtually the entire revenue from income tax is used up in servicing the debt.  If we did not have such a large debt we would not have to rely so heavily on taxes other than income tax.  We could use income tax revenue to pay for ordinary services and all taxes could be at a lower level.  Unfortunately, those debts have been accumulated over a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies opposite call simultaneously for increases in public spending and reductions in taxation which will result in even further increases in borrowing.  If we are not going to increase taxation and at the same time we increase spending, the only way we will get the money is by increasing borrowing further.  That means even higher levels of debt.  Not only would income tax be used in servicing <Col N="320" /> debt but perhaps some of the other taxes as well.  The result of that would be that our remaining taxes which are not being used to service debt would have to be raised even higher still.</P>
    <P>It is easy for Deputies on the opposite side of the House and on this side to say they are in favour of lower taxation.  We are all in favour of lower taxation.  The difficulty is to find the money to reduce the taxation.  Certain cuts would have to be made to do so.  If any party or Deputies opposite have suggestions for reducing expenditure I would be delighted to receive them.  I would also be delighted to supply them with information as to exactly what would be saved by their proposal.  I hope that invitation will be taken up by Deputies who may have ideas how this might be done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a significant reduction in the extent of cross-Border shopping traffic since 1984.  The customs and excise service carry out sample surveys on cross-Border traffic on particular days chosen at random.  I am glad to be able to tell the House that not only was the amount of cross-Border activity less in 1985 than it was in 1984 but, furthermore, the sample surveys carried out so far in 1986 indicate a further reduction than that which obtained in 1985.  That is a good <Col N="321" /> sign but the result so far is very inadequate.</P>
    <P>I would very much wish to reduce the tax levels on petrol further.  I would like to see the price being reduced even more than it has been already.  For that to happen it is necessary to pursue a policy which is prudent and which will create a reasonable balance between expenditure and taxation that can be sustained.  Some of the suggestions made from time to time at various gatherings outside for the spending of £800 million would give a short term boost to the economy, but the ultimate result would be higher taxes and economic difficulties before very long. That is not what this Government are pursuing.  We are pursuing a policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We must also remember that there has been a significant substitution of diesel for petrol and this, in some part at least, is attributable to the fall in petrol sales, not the rise in taxation. It is important to point out that there are other significant factors and it is important to bear in mind that the Government's tax policy in regard to motor vehicles&mdash;while one admits that it is fairly harsh&mdash;is that we have to rely unduly heavily on exise duties, such as those on petrol, in order to balance the economy.  We have sought to achieve an equitable distribution of the tax burden for industry as a whole.  For instance, the duty on spare parts has been abolished <Col N="322" /> and we have reduced the tax on repair services in order to provide an incentive to the Irish part of the motor industry which in the main is concentrated on the wholesale sector.  On the other hand, we put heavier duties on the importation of new cars so as to give relatively favourable tax treatment to the Irish sector of the car industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that in the course of the debate Deputies raised all this, with the exception of Deputy O'Kennedy.  Whereas we have a relatively heavy level of taxation on imported new vehicles, we have abolished the tax on spare parts and reduced it on repairs, so people will be able to keep their cars longer and, at the repair end, the industry will be able to give more employment.  It is modest but it is an indication that in the financial climate this year we are doing as much as we possibly can to reduce the level of taxation.  I very much wish to see a reduction in the level of petrol tax.</P>
      <P>I understand and accept what Deputy McGahon and Deputy Flanagan said about the distortion in the Border regions because of the present high level of taxation on petrol here.  I represent a county which is close to the Border.  I agree that significant disruption is being caused, and it would be my ambition to see financial conditions created here as a result of economies in spending and prudent management of our economy, without having to resort to any of the artificial stimuli suggested by the Opposition, in order to achieve a reduction in tax levels.  I acknowledge the case made for Dundalk by Deputy McGahon.  I agree that town more than any in Ireland has suffered from its proximity to the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear the contribution of the Father of the House.  We are all very glad to see him back in such great voice <Col N="323" /> and health after illness.  The Deputy has spoken during many years with great eloquence since he first came here in 1948, and it was good to hear him this morning contributing with such force and conviction.  I am sorry we have spent so long on this section, considering that there are many points to be made on other sections which we may not be able to reach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never heard such a lot of distortion.  The Minister's backbenchers obviously accept the reality of the position and I am surprised the Government and the Minister have not taken cognisance of the viewpoints of those Deputies.  The Minister most certainly is letting down Deputy McGahon who has been trying to protect the interests of his Border constituents.  The Government have sold Deputy McGahon down the river.  The Minister tried to distort the figures given by Deputy O'Kennedy in regard to 1980.  The tax take on petrol then was 34.7 per cent.  In 1982 it was 47 per cent and now, because of extraordinary incompetence by the Minister, the tax take on petrol is 66.7 per cent and 59 per cent on auto diesel. The Minister tried to confuse Deputy Conaghan on comparisons with the UK, but we must remember that the UK was an exporter of petrol and that they manufactured motor cars.</P>
      <P>The Minister must realise that Ireland is isolated from the other EC countries in relation to taxation on hydrocarbons. We have the highest taxation in that respect of any EC country except Italy.</P>

      <P>Our taxation on hydrocarbons is about 70 per cent greater than in Germany and one-third higher than in Denmark which is about average for the EC.  Denmark is a welfare state, the envy of the world.  The tax take here is 30 per cent more than in France.  The Minister cannot confine his tight argument to a comparison of our taxation on hydrocarbons <i>vis-á-vis</i> the United Kingdom and <Col N="324" /> leave it at that.  There is no doubt the Irish motorist is being fleeced savagely by the Government.  Most middle income and lower paid workers are suffering as a result of Government action.  Because jobs are so scarce, many have to drive considerable distances to their places of work.</P>

They incur considerable travelling expenses getting to work but, because of the PAYE structure, they cannot claim any compensation.</P>
      <P>We have reached the stage of diminishing returns.  No matter what diversionary tactics the Minister engages in, the public are well aware of what is happening.  On the opposite side there are people who are very good at creating diversionary tactics.  For instance, Deputy G. Mitchell is more concerned with vouchers for golf balls and so on at the various petrol stations. I hope the Minister will accede to the honest pleas of honourable and credible people such as Deputy McGahon who know what is involved.  This Minister and this Government have fleeced the Irish motorists in every way. They have penalised them in the taxation they have imposed on petrol and also in respect of the cost of cars.  We will deal with the latter point later on.</P>

      <P>I am glad Deputy O'Kennedy has returned to the House after a lengthy absence, obviously refreshed and in good humour.  I hope I do not give the impression of being irritable just because I have been here all the time. The information I have indicates that, while Ireland admittedly has a very high price for petrol, it is not the highest in Europe.  As at 1 May the French price in terms of Irish pence per gallon was 269p, the Italian rate was 278.9, the Danish rate was 268.3 and the Irish rate was 266.4.  I have to admit it is higher than the average in Europe but it is not the highest.  France and Italy who represent a large proportion of the population in the Community, as well as Denmark which has a very good reputation with regard to employment, have higher rates of taxation on petrol.</P>

      <P>I am giving that information so that people will not denigrate <Col N="326" /> this country by making inaccurate statements in terms of international comparisons. Of course our prices are too high and of course the Government would like to reduce them.  I am not going to defend the present levels on the basis that they are economically desirable or are an energy conservation measure.  I regret very much that the prices are as high as they are, but the reason is due to the debts we have, the servicing of which absorbs all our income tax.  The Government have to run the country on VAT and excise duties and thus the returns in this area will be higher than they would be if it were not for the burden imposed on this Government.  We have to service the debts incurred in the past.  The biggest splurge in debt creation was initiated by Deputy O'Malley, Deputy O'Kennedy and the other authors of the 1977 manifesto, as Deputy McGahon pointed out clearly two hours ago.</P>

      <P>Our excise duties are so high because so much money has to be used in servicing our debts.  This costs us our entire income tax revenue.  Therefore, we are forced to have excise duties on petrol that are far too high because they have to finance the running of the country.  This would not have happened if our finances had been managed more prudently in the past.  We cannot rewrite economic history.  The Government have to deal with the present situation and regrettably, we have to have taxes at a higher level than would otherwise be justified.  I have told the House it is my ambition to reduce these prices as much as possible in the years ahead.  I recognise clearly the case made by Deputy McGahon and other Border Deputies, that these tax levels have a bad effect on Border towns.</P>

When this Government came into office the total national debt <Col N="327" /> was £12.7 billion, admittedly very high. The total national debt now is £21 billion, an increase of well over 70 per cent.

My God, I wish we did.</P>
      <P>On the question of hydrocarbon taxes, it has to be noted that the Minister has deliberately refused to give the tax levels imposed in other countries.  He has tried but failed, although he has advisers accompanying him.  We asked for tax levels to give the comparative level of taxes on the gallon or litre of petrol here. The Minister has deliberately refrained from giving the figures because he knows they would show that our tax levels on hydrocarbons are the highest in Europe.

      <P>The Minister knows that the tax levels here on hydrocarbons are the highest in Europe.  If he does not know it, then he should.  He criticised my absence from the House for ten minutes. I have no facility for obtaining other information except by making direct telephone calls.  I have no administrative staff and I was telephoning the Revenue Commissioners. The Minister could get any of his personal advisers to obtain the <Col N="329" /> information I received through making that telephone call.</P>
      <P>The Minister was not prepared to disclose the levels of tax in 1980 but he said that I had raised those taxes to an unprecedentedly high level.  I will give those figures and any of the Minister's advisers should be able to confirm them for him.  Total tax in 1980 on premium grade petrol was 75.2p, while the total price was £1.50.  Now the total tax, as a consequence of the actions of the Minister's predecessor and his proposed action today, is £1.78, 20 per cent more than the total price in 1980.  These are simple facts.  I am speaking from official figures and I totally repudiate and reject the Minister's argument.</P>
      <P>On 30 April this year I tabled a question for written reply concerning excise duty on petroleum and petroleum products in each of the years 1982 to 1985 inclusive.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no interest at all in Deputy John Bruton personally.  I am talking about the office he holds.  The Minister for Finance gave me those incorrect figures.  The written reply on 30 April 1986 went on to state that the correct figures for 1980 and 1981 were 61.75 million hectolitres and 55.16 million hectolitres respectively.  Now that we have the correct figures from the Minister we have the admission that in 1980 petroleum products accounted for 61.75 million hectolitres and in 1985 that figure had dropped to 41.71 million hectolitres.  It will drop further in 1986.  The drop of 20 million hectolitres represents half of total current consumption.  The question covered excise duty on petroleum and petroleum products.</P>
      <P>The Minister has the gall to suggest that what we are proposing to him would inevitably lead to loss of revenue, but what we are proposing is the only guarantee of renewed revenue.  As a consequences of his policy and that of his predecessor, we have seen consumption lost through cross-border leakage, a downturn in the tourism industry and lack of capacity in the domestic market.  Those facts alone demonstrate that if the Minister desisted from imposing even these extra taxes today &mdash; and there have been persuasive arguments from all aides of the House &mdash; he would get enhanced revenue.  Let the Minister not ask where he is going to find the extra money.  Those figures demonstrate that we have lost 50 per cent of what we should have because of the tax levels the Minister has imposed. In the interest of the motorist, of the public and even of the Revenue Commissioners, I would ask the Minister not to persist on this course on which he seems to be hellbent and which would guarantee a further drop in consumption and a further loss of revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand the frustrations of some Deputies on the Government side, in particular people like Deputy McGahon, who are obviously tied by the Whip, so I will not embarrass them by making an issue of that.  But I cannot accept the Minister saying taxes are too high and that if he could do something <Col N="331" /> about them he would.  The only person who can do something about those taxes is the Minister.  Now is his chance, and by doing it he will get enhanced revenue. By dropping this proposal alone he would get at least £30 million in revenue.  If the taxes were reduced to anything near what they should be with falling oil prices, the Revenue Commissioners would get at least £100 million.  The revenue figures have fallen quite flat and, if the Minister persists in this course, he will find that next year we will be acceding the case when we sit on those benches because the facts speak for themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to query the taxation of petrol versus LPG car gas.  Perhaps the Minister could give the figures for one over the other?  I heard an advertisement which was broadcast recently on the radio which states that there was some good news for the motorist in the budget, that tax did not go up on LPG.  In relation to the overall trade balance position <i>vis-á-vis</i> all of the oil which is imported and LPG, is that a by-product of our gas industry in Ireland?  If so, would it not be possible to have a very progressive policy of reducing the tax on LPG, even maintaining a high tax policy on petrol and thereby reducing imports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I went over much of this this morning so I will not repeat myself.  I suggest that the Minister should accept that we have reached the point of diminishing returns.  I would like to point to the reduction of tax on betting which has been successful.  It was reduced last year from 20 per cent, which was a penal imposition, to 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Border area and the constant haemorrhage of money from that region, I honestly believe if taxes and excise duties were reduced to a more realistic level the Exchequer would get more money.  I appreciate the difficulties of any Minister for Finance but I feel that the stereotyped approach which has been adopted over the years should be discontinued and a more realistic look should <Col N="332" /> be taken at the Border region, particularly as far as the price of petrol is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Government have had success in stopping the tremendous drain of money that was experienced in 1984 by reducing excise duties and taxes in the 1985 budget, and this had a beneficial effect and was much appreciated by business people along the Border.  That definitely stemmed the flow of people and of money out of the country.  If the Minister would accept that the law of diminishing returns exists here we would not be experiencing the loss to the Exchequer, in 1984, of £500 million.  There is a tacit acceptance that the Border region is expendable while the Ulster troubles persist and while our terrible economic problems exist and that there is not much we can do about it.  But we can no longer ignore the Border area because economic activity there has ground to a halt.  I quoted the figure released by the North of Ireland authorities, £500 million.  At what stage will the Government say the drainage is unacceptable?  If it went to £1,000 million would they then feel it was no longer acceptable?</P>

      <P>Deputy Yates asked about the tax on LPG.  It is about 50 per cent of retail price.  That compares favourably, percentage-wise, with the percentage for petrol which is around 66 per cent.  Deputy O'Kennedy made reference to figures for the fall in the consumption of petroleum products generally.  The main fall was in the non-road fuels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a 44.8 per cent reduction in the non-road fuels since 1980 whereas the fall in petrol used on the roads is about a 15 per cent fall in consumption.</P>
      <P>The question of a reduction in petrol prices at this time being self-financing was again raised by Deputy O'Kennedy although I noted some of the Deputies on his own backbenches did not seem to have much confidence in this claim.  My information from the Revenue Commissioners is that, for every one penny reduction we could make in the duty, we would lose about £2 million which indicates that if we were to reduce the price by about 15p we would lose about £30 million in revenue.  I would have to admit however that the tax is at a very high level and if it were to be increased any further we would probably have a situation where we would indeed experience diminishing returns.  But my information, supplied to me by the best qualified people available, the Revenue Commissioners, who obviously want to maximise the tax take, is that a reduction of this kind would, in fact, reduce the actual yield quite significantly as I indicated.</P>
      <P>The Government did reduce some of the taxes considerably and these have, perhaps, this year at least &mdash; although it takes longer than one thinks &mdash; paid for themselves.  So there is no question of our having a closed mind to making reductions if we can be satisfied that they will finance themselves.  I would also say, as relevant to the claim made by Deputy O'Kennedy that these tax concessions would be self-financing, that there has in fact been a substantial fall in the retail price of petrol in recent times as a result of the fall in oil prices and that has not led to any great increase in consumption. If that self-financing argument were to stand up, one would have expected that the other reduction would have yielded a very large increase in consumption.  That was, if you like, a dry run or a demonstration of what would be the effect on consumption&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that the Minister is again proposing an increase in the excise duty on spirits.  We welcome the fact that his predecessor listened to the case we made &mdash; for once &mdash; and did not add to the excise duty on spirits.  The figures available to the Minister prove that the consumption of spirits increased as a consequence of that decision, which is welcome.  It is regrettable when the trend is in favour of at least maintaining current excise levels and not increasing them that the Minister is reverting to the old pattern.  I am afraid we will see not only reduced consumption but reduced revenue.</P>

If he likes, I can produce the figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am looking forward to Deputy O'Kennedy's Parliamentary Question on the subject because the answer will disprove his case.  It was necessary to put a modest increase on the excise duty on spirits.  However, the section also provides for the abolition of certain duties also applying to spirits, for example, the duty on immature spirits and the extra duty charged on spirits where deferment of duty is availed of, <Col N="342" /> both of which are relatively ancient charges, one of them dating back to 1915, which are being abolished.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 60.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 60 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing here with the rate of excise duty and drawback on beer which the Minister is proposing to increase by £3.30 on the standard barrel.  It is again evident from the figures available to the Minister that the increase in the excise duty on beer caused the level of consumption to drop by at least 12.5 per cent to 15 per cent.  It demonstrates the necessity to take a more prudent and balanced approach to the imposition of excise duties on consumer products.  I should like to bring to the Minister's attention that, in addition to the magnetic attraction of the other side of the Border because of low petrol prices, everybody going up there to shop avails of the opportunity to purchase large quantities of beer.  As other Members said, we are giving a grant-in-aid to the British Government, which is not part of our function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mainstay of our tourist traffic, the ordinary British working class holiday markers, are now sharply conscious of the fact that the price of drink generally, and beer in particular, is so much higher here that they are not coming any more.  The Minister must acknowledge that the decline in tourism from the working class British, who were our best friends in many ways because of traditional association and many other things, has had a major effect on tourism and on revenue from excise duties on beer.  I urge the Minister &mdash; without any great confidence &mdash; to reconsider his position because the dramatic effect of such a decision, when <Col N="343" /> our tourism from other areas will obviously be affected by recent developments, will be felt all over the country. We should try to re-establish the tourism market from Britain.</P>
    <P>In normal times the consumption of beer during the holiday period grows by at least 20 per cent because of the impact of tourism.  That also applies to spirits and, to a lesser extent, to petroleum products.  We will not now see that growth and the Minister should reconsider this proposal because the facts prove that there has been a drop in the consumption of beer over the past few years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I must state that the fall-off in tourism from Britain, which the Deputy described, goes back to the beginning of the Northern troubles.  It was a major fall.  We have never reached the level of numbers of tourists coming here from Britain that we reached in 1967 and 1968, before the troubles in Northern Ireland became a major factor.  While I agree that the price of drink is a factor in determining holidaying patterns.  I think political considerations, unfortunately, have played an even larger part in keeping this group of tourists, whom I also value, away from us.</P>

    <P>Tá thart ar £11 mhilliún á chur ar fáil <Col N="353" /> ag an Rialtas i mbliana d'Údarás na Gaeltachta le caitheamh ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht agus leis an nGaeilge agus bíonn airgead de bhreis air sin le fáil acu ó fhoinsí eile.  Ní beag an cúnamh Stáit é sin ag féachaint don ghéarchéim airgeadais agus is deimhin liom go bhféadfar dul chun cinn suntasach a dhéanamh leis an soláthar sin ach é a chaitheamh go stuama.  Is eol dom go bhfuil fadhbanna airgeadais ag an Údarás agus tuigtear uathu go bhfuil coinníoll á chur le cibé litreacha tairiscinte atá á gcur amach faoi láthair nach bhféadfar deontais a íoc go dtí go mbeidh airgead a dhóthain ar fáil. Bhuail an tAire le hionadaithe ón mbord chun an cheist in iomlán a chíoradh leo agus tá a n-iarratas ar chaipiteal vótáilte breise á bhreithniú mar ghnó práinneach faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Maidir le fostaíocht sa Ghaeltacht bhí méadú ag deireadh gach bliana ó 1981 ar aghaidh i líon na ndaoine a bhí fostaithe go lánaimseartha i dtionscail a fuair cúnamh ón Údarás/ó Ghaeltarra agus tá súil agam go leanfaidh an dul chun cinn sin i 1986.</P>

      <P>Harbour development in the fisheries interest is grant aided from the Fisheries Vote of my Department except for locations in designated Gaeltacht areas, which are grant aided by Roinn na Gaeltacha.</P>
      <P>The level of grant from the Fisheries Vote varies in accordance with the status of location of the harbour.  In the case of the five harbours scheduled as fishery harbour centres under the Fishery Harbour Centres Acts i.e., Castletownbere, Dunmore East, Killybegs, Howth and Rossaveel, the total cost of development is met from the Fisheries Vote and my Department or the Office of Public Works as appropriate are responsible for maintenance and management of the harbours. Grant aid of up to 75 per cent is available for development of harbours on the north west, west and south west coasts and up to 50 per cent grant is available for development of harbours on the remainder of the coastline.  In these cases the local authority are required to provide the balance of the cost and to undertake maintenance of the completed works.  In the case of harbours located in designated Gaeltacht areas Roinn na Gaeltachta provide a 100 per cent grant and the local authority are required to undertake maintenance of the completed works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Harbour development projects with an investment in excess of £35,000 are eligible for consideration for assistance from the European Regional Development Fund provided that national assistance is first committed to the project.

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already stated what the costs are and where the grants are available.  The European Regional Development Fund provides assistance through specific investments which exceed £35,000 and which are of the following type: (a) investment projects in the industrial, craft or service sectors which relate to economically sound activities and which help to create and maintain permanent jobs; and (b) infrastructure and investment projects the costs of which are borne by local authorities or by any other organisation responsible for carrying out infrastructural projects and which contribute to the development of the region or area in which they are located.  The fund does not contribute to either industrial or infrastructural projects unless national assistance is first committed.  In Ireland, this means that only projects which are already being financed by the public capital programme may be considered for fund assistance.</P>

Other countries are in a position to export mackerel to Nigeria and they are in the exact same position.  It is obvious that their authorities have assisted them in some way.  Would the Minister of State or the senior Minister consider leading a delegation of Irish processers to Nigeria to discuss on a Minister to Minister basis the possibility of obtaining these licences.

      <P>The Minister's initial reply referred to improvement grants as part of the strategy to develop better holidays for home holidaymakers.  One would have thought the Minister would have had an interest in a scheme he announced himself.  However, I shall be glad to <Col N="371" /> receive the information from the Minister. He referred also to long-term strategies of Bord Fáilte.  That is the kind of old bumph we have been getting for many years.  Will the Minister please explain exactly what he means by long-term strategies when my question asked what he proposed to do in the short-term to attract holidaymakers in 1986?</P>

      <P>I cannot comment on the reason for the transfer of a question from one Minister to another.  I am attempting to answer the questions presented to me.  I have no knowledge and had nothing to do with the transfer of a question.  There was a major problem regarding pollution of Lough Sheelin some time ago.  As a result, a certain amount of grant aid was made available <Col N="373" /> from the Department of the Environment in the form of a grant for transportation of slurry that allegedly had been causing pollution.  What was done to rectify the situation has been quite successful. The Lough Sheelin management committee was reconstituted as from 1 January 1985.  Membership of the committee consists of four representatives of the farming organisations, two persons from the IFA and two representatives of the farmers' association in the area. There were also two representatives from Cavan County Council, one of whom was chairman of the committee, one person from ACOT, one representative from the ESB, one representative from the Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry and one person from the Central Fisheries Board.  Joint inspections by Cavan County Council and the Central Fisheries Board were carried out during the winter and spring.  A recent inspection was carried out on 20 March and the conclusion was that generally the condition and quality of the lake is quite acceptable.</P>

      <P>I should like to take the Minister up on his use of the word &ldquo;generally&rdquo; because there has been a deterioration in the quality of the water in Lough Sheelin during the winter.  It is a matter of concern that the Minister for Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry seems to be unaware of this, because the Department of the Environment are dealing with it.  Will the Minister say when the committee to which he referred last met?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <P>I cannot give the Deputy the exact date when they met.  I do not think it is a reasonable question but if the Deputy wishes to get that information I will find it out for him and communicate with him.  Most of the storage units for the slurry were inspected in February. Much of the slurry has been spread outside the Sheelin catchment area and it seems unlikely that further storage problems could have arisen by the end of March.  Spreading of slurry may be <Col N="374" /> carried out in the Sheelin catchment area between April and September provided it is in accordance with requirements and the moisture of the soil at a particular time.  The overall condition of the lake at present is acceptable.</P>

That scheme was suspended when this Government came to office and now the quality of the water is deteriorating.  Will he request the Minister for the Environment to keep his Department informed? I maintain that Department should be the prime Department in ensuring that the quality of this lake is preserved.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there is dissatisfaction among some fishermen with certain aspects of the regulations governing salmon fishing but I do not accept that there is general dissatisfaction with them.  These regulations are intended primarily to conserve stocks of salmon to ensure its survival as a species for exploitation by future generations.  I am satisfied that the majority of fishermen recognise and accept the need for such regulations.</P>
      <P>I understand that there are some fishermen serving or facing prison sentences arising from breaches of the relevant regulations.  While the regulations are kept under constant review by my Department and are amended from time to time as considered necessary, I have no plans to change the legislative provisions relating to penalties for breaches of these regulations.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be aware that his predecessor had a number of meetings with representatives of these fishermen in the various board areas and that they have expressed their general dissatisfaction at the way the regulations are being imposed?  Does he intend to meet the fishermen this year, now that we are about to start the salmon season? <Col N="378" /> The Minister will be aware that there have been many incidents and problems during the past number of years and would it not be in the interests of peace, harmony and conservation if the Minister took an opportunity to meet these fishermen to try to reach some kind of solution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been done. We have met the IFO &mdash; I have gone to Donegal to meet a number of people &mdash; and I have gone to Helvick.  If I were to get requests from individual groups rather than the IFO as a unit it would be better because the IFO say they represent the interests of drift-net fishermen.  For the information of the Deputy, in recent years illegal salmon fishing has increased. The protection staff employed by the boards to conserve stocks are the subject of attack by many of those people.  There has been violence, including the use of firearms, slash hooks, flares and iron bars.  They have been used by fishermen against the boards' protection staff.  The families of some of the protection staff and board managers have been threatened by those people.  It arises because there are certain regulations governing the length of net, the type of net and so forth.  There are quite a number of these 900 drift-net licence holders trying to break these laws and regulations, no matter what is said or done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question No 31 and priority question No. 40 together.</P>
      <P>I recognise that the security problems on the Continent will have serious consequences for US travel to Europe this year and that Irish tourism will be affected to some extent by the reluctance of Americans to travel.  It is also evident that hotels specialising in group package business from North America are particularly vulnerable at this stage.  I do not, however, consider that this represents a crisis situation for the hotel industry and I confidently expect that Ireland as a tourism destination will perform considerably better than other European countries in so far as American business is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to minimise the effects of the European security problem on our US tourist traffic, Bord Fáilte are undertaking a major drive to promote Ireland as an alternative destination for Americans fearful of travelling to Continental Europe.  Over the next couple of weeks the board, with the support of the Irish <Col N="380" /> industry and American-based tour operators, will mount a concerted sales and public relations drive in North America. The Minister will be participating in this effort and I am confident that through this very positive action the effects on our tourism resulting from American attitudes to Europe will be minimal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's remarks are incredible when he suggests that this international terrorism and security problem will have a minimal effect on our hotel industry.  Is the Minister aware that cancellations range from 25 per cent in the Leinster area up to 50 per cent in the south west due to the effects of the Libyan situation and international terrorism? Will he give details of how Bord Fáilte intend to spend the £600,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that it is a major crisis.  I accept that there have been cancellations of tour package arrangements but with careful promotional marketing we can recover a substantial proportion of the American business.</P>
      <P>The promotion in which Bord Fáilte will engage will involve the hotel and tourism sectors and the air companies.  I should like to compliment them on their expeditious and professional response to Bord Fáilte's call to join in a massive promotional campaign in America.  It will involve over 60 people drawn from Bord Fáilte, other State tourism organisations, American-based tour operators who specialise in Irish business and the sales personnel of a number of Irish commercial tourism companies who have experience of working in the American tourism market.  During an intensive two-week period, over 4,000 travel agents in a dozen major American cities will be visited by someone from Ireland with a strong sales message.  In addition, the campaign incorporates increased advertising, increased publicity and public relations among the American media at local level and direct mail sales contact with previous inquirers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>American travel to Europe has been seriously affected, due mainly to the fears <Col N="381" /> raised in the minds of potential tourists as a result of acts of terrorism and by the confrontation between America and Libya.  There is evidence that Ireland as a destination is not seen in the same negative light as the Mediterranean countries. Nevertheless, any decline in overall travel to Europe will obviously affect us. Understandably the focus of public attention has been on the cancellations which have been reported.  It must be borne in mind, however, that many people are still coming to Ireland, that bookings are still being received and that there are still many people in America who want to come to Europe but who need reassurance and encouragement and may yet change their plans and come to an alternative European destination, namely, Ireland.

      <P>As announced in the budget, the duty on motor vehicle parts and accessories is being phased out.  The sum of £0.5 was provided in the budget to cover the cost arising from this.  The reduction is consistent with the Government's policy of reducing the cost of spare parts to provide more employment in the repair sector of the industry and prolong the life of motor vehicles by encouraging replacement of defective parts rather than replacing the vehicle itself with a new imported vehicle.  This provision is reasonable.  It is giving encouragement to the repair sector of the motor industry, which has the highest relative degree of Irish labour content.</P>

      <P>Many of the sections we have been dealing with are interrelated. This section proposes to increase the excise duty on mechanically propelled vehicles.  I would like to make some general points to the Minister.  This is a very considerable increase.  Perhaps the Minister could indicate what the comparable levels of excise duty on cars in 1982 were in respect of the horsepowers mentioned in this section.  It is important <Col N="397" /> that we should be able to compare the current level with the level that operated in 1982 before this Government took responsibility.  I do not suppose that this question takes any one by surprise and I am quite sure those figures are available.</P>
      <P>There is a need for a reduction in the excise duties on cars.  From July next the repair and maintenance of all types of moveable goods will attract the low rate rather than the standard rate of VAT, and that applies to all types of moveable goods.  Significantly, in respect of other goods, there is no requirement as seems to be applied to the motor trade to make self-financing arrangements, as was asked of the motor industry in 1983.  In last year's budget the motor industry was given a concession of a reduction in the excise duty on spare parts of from 25 per cent to 10 per cent.  The concessions cost the Minister approximately £3 million, but he gained about £10 million from the increase of 4½ per cent on the excise duty in 1983.  The excise duty on spare parts was unique to Ireland, in any event; we are the only country in the EC that has excise duties on spare parts.  This would be scheduled for removal in any event because the EC do not like it and they will be moving to get harmonisation in that area.  Also, it adds to the issue we have been discussing, the Border difficulties and the discrimination in terms of trade as between traders on this side and those on the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to give some figures to back up the case I would make that the excise duty reductions which are now required to offset the 4.5 percentage increase in the excise duty of 1983 would be of the order of 1.8 per cent, as the duty is now calculated on the recommended retail price inclusive of duty and VAT, whereas in 1983 it was calculated on the wholesale price.  For that reason a reduction of 1.8 per cent, which is not a major reduction and that is why we have carefully moderated the proposal we are making, would bring the excise duty to 19.9 per cent for cars up to two litres and 22.9 per cent for larger cars as distinct <Col N="398" /> from the levels the Minister is now proposing, and an excise duty of that order is still very much higher than any that operates elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There are other facts that underline the need for the Minister to adopt a much more sensible approach to the whole taxation of the motor industry.  We dealt with hydrocarbons this morning.</P>

      <P>I am not going to delay on this.  I just want to make the argument, because they are all inter-linked. When the Minister replies we will see what progress we have made.  New car registrations have dropped dramatically in the last number of years.  I have the figures here.  It is important that we record these and the impact they are having on unemployment in the trade generally.  In 1981 about 106,000 new cars were registered here.  In 1982 that figure dropped to 72,800.  In 1983 it was 60,800. In 1984 it was 56,451 and, as far as I can ascertain, in 1985 there was a slight rise to approximately 60,000.  But since 1981 new car registrations overall dropped from 106,000 to 60,000.  That demonstrates the impact of taxation generally, whether we are talking about excise duty on cars or excise duty on hydrocarbons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us compare that with the position in the North.  No one would claim that the North has a very healthy economy. For obvious reasons it is anything but a thriving economy.  Nevertheless, new car registrations in the North increased from 44,427 in 1981 to 68,627 in 1984.  By 1984 it was well in excess of the total numbers being registered here, from a time when car registrations were less than half what they were here.  If that is not a dramatic indication of the impact of taxation on cars and hydrocarbon oils and on the <Col N="399" /> motor industry generally, I cannot think of anything else that is.  To put it another way, excise duty and VAT in the Republic for cars up to two litres represents a 72 per cent increase on the pre-tax price and on large cars an 81 per cent increase on the pre-tax price, whereas in the North it is a 25 per cent increase on all cars. What we are seeing here is another example of what we were arguing about before lunch, the decimation of that industry as evidenced by all the facts, reduced consumption, reduced revenue and, most important of all, the fall-off in the numbers employed in this very labour intensive activity, the motor trade itself.  Since 1980, 9,000 jobs have been lost in the retail motor trade &mdash; the figure dropped from 24,000 to 15,000 &mdash; and up to 300 retail motor trade outlets have closed completely.  Most of those remaining have had to trim employment levels to an average of two-thirds of their 1980 labour force, and in some cases to one-half.</P>
    <P>There is another way of confirming what I am saying and that is to look at the number of total registered apprentices.  I have given the figures for employment tax and consumption generally, but let us look at the impact this has had on total registered apprentices.  In 1980, there were 4,339 registered apprentices in the motor trade; in 1981, there were 3,546; in 1982, 3,236; in 1983, 2,842; in 1984, 2,552; and in 1985, 2,450.  I do not believe there is anything I can add to those figures.  This is a classic example of the legal principle <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>, the facts speak for themselves.  Even at this late stage, the Minister should acknowledge those facts and do something about them. It is not enough to say that taxes are high. The only man who can do anything about this is the man I am addressing now.  I hope I have got through to him in some way and I await his response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is only able to make reductions in taxes to the extent of the financial means available to him.  To suggest, as is often the case in <Col N="400" /> newspaper headlines and in superficial comment, that the Minister simply by an act of will or by getting a bright idea in the middle of the night has the ability to reduce taxation is to suggest powers which Ministers simply do not have. Ministers have to deal with realities and for Deputy O'Kennedy to personalise it and to look at me in a meaningful way and say all I have to do is say the word and taxes will be reduced, is to promote a naive view of politics which even Deputy O'Kennedy does not believe.  The reality is that I can only reduce taxation in one of three ways &mdash; reducing expenditure, increasing taxes or increasing borrowings, and none of those options is open to me for reasons which the Deputy understands.</P>
      <P>I do not share his sense of upset at the fact that the sales are down of new imported motor cars, to whose manufacture Irish people have contributed little or nothing and which have created few or no jobs in the manufacturing process in Ireland.  The sale of new motor cars is the only imported product which has succeeded in being politically promoted by the Opposition in this House.  People do not come in here looking for tax reductions on most imported goods&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Bemoaning the reduction in the sales of new cars or looking for tax reductions to increase the sales of new cars shows that Deputy O'Kennedy is engaged in an import promotion campaign. I do not believe there is any merit in promoting increased sales of new imported Japanese, American, British or German cars.  We should try to prolong the life of existing cars, and try to adjust the existing car fleet by whatever means possible to ensure that we use less imported fuel.  Remember the motor car is a service, but it does not contribute to our national wealth.  We do not produce the fuel for the motor car; nor do we produce the motor car.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy referred to Northern Ireland.  I will read a quotation which he will enjoy, and perhaps even Deputy Mac Giolla will enjoy it from the point of view of its irony.  This statement was made by a Conservative Member of the present British Government, who was the holder of the Northern Ireland Office.  Speaking of the United Kingdom he said Northern Ireland was the part of the United Kingdom which had the largest number of BMWs on the road and the largest number of unemployed people in any part of the United Kingdom.  I do not believe there is any <Col N="402" /> great case to be made for comparing this part of Ireland with Northern Ireland. They do not produce cars either and yet they seem to spend more of their money importing motor cars than we do.  We have a more sensitive situation in that we try to prolong the use of our existing fleet of motor cars rather than importing new ones.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that in this budget, and on the last occasion I had the opportunity to introduce a budget in January 1982, we took steps to reduce the rate of excise and tax duties.  That was such a good budget that it was carried on by my successor, Deputy MacSharry.  While many people look back on that budget from one viewpoint, another important aspect is that 90 per cent of its contents won not only the support of this side of the House, but was subsequently adopted by Fianna Fáil when they came into office.  No budget ever achieved such a degree of unanimity of support in practice, if not in oratory, than that budget.</P>

Rather than having a new car as a status symbol, I would like to see the ability to conserve one's car in good, safe, working order for as long as possible, as a new status symbol.  I realise from the Japanese or German point of view that would not be a particularly good recommendation, but from the point of view of the Irish economy with its productive capacity, rather than boasting about the number of new cars we are selling we should be boasting about the <Col N="403" /> extent to which we have been able to extend the life of our existing car fleet on a safe basis.  I make no apology for the taxation on the sale of new cars.  I would far prefer to see any tax concessions that can be given, given in such a fashion as to prolong the life and promote the energy efficiency of the motor vehicle fleet we have for the sake of the balance of payments and employment.</P>

I will give the Minister the point that I have had numerous representations from the motor trade, the drinks industry and <Col N="404" /> every sector of activity trying to convey to me as spokesman on Finance the serious state of their industry.  Many of the facts I have brought forward in the course of this debate were presented to me by the various interest groups.  That they feel it so necessary to disclose all of this to a spokesman for the Opposition is evidence that they feel they are in a desperate state.  It is evidence of the impact which we see in unemployment, in reduced revenue and in the decimated state of the motor industry.  I am amazed to hear the Minister suggest that what I am proposing in this is that the Irish people go into an insane whirl of purchasing cars, that they will all go out buying new cars at a rate they and the country cannot afford. I made no such suggestion.  I think the Minister will take it that it is accepted that a car is a necessary element for most people at this stage.</P>

      <P>If in 1981, 106,000 new cars were registered and that number had reduced to 60,000 in 1985: (1) there is an unduly dramatic decline in the number of new cars; and (2) in the Minister's former role as Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism he would have faced up to what the Road Safety Association pointed out, that one of the major causes of the heavy rate of serious accidents on our roads is the fact that our vehicle stock is defective and much older than that in other countries. Cars are in a bad state of repair.  How often do we hear that from the Road Safety Association?  The figures I have presented here demonstrate the extent of the decline in the industry, the drop in <Col N="405" /> the number of new cars, the drop in employment and the drop in revenue as a consequence of the level of duty imposed. Let me add the increase in the accident rate which is recognised by the Garda and everybody.

      <P>Of course we must try to ensure that our cars are in good and safe working order, but in many cases our existing stock of cars is not properly maintained by the owners.  Vehicles are allowed to fall into a poor state of repair frequently with neglect of the servicing of the cars and hence the neglect of an opportunity to create employment here. My fiscal policy regarding motor cars is to do everything possible to encourage people to maintain existing cars in good working order and prolong their life rather than take the superficially easy but ultimately more damaging option of buying new cars.  There is a tendency to see a new car as some sort of status symbol.  It should not be seen in that light.  The aim should be rather to encourage the prolongation of the life of our existing car stock.</P>

      <P>This section deals <Col N="409" /> with major changes in VAT and I can only deal with two or three illustrations here.  We have only nine more minutes in which to discuss this and therefore I propose to make general comments on the level of VAT charges and to listen to what the Minister has to say.  I want to illustrate our case by giving two example. One is the building industry and the other refers to hurleys and the continuing imposition of VAT.  Hurleys are an essential part of our native game and, as the Minister acknowledged in a reply to me some time ago that he does not know how much is yielded by VAT on hurleys, I ask him to accept the assertion of the Gaelic Athletic Association that it is a major burden on them, particularly in providing hurleys for young people.  Hurling is a healthy outlet for young people and it is time that hurleys were exempted from VAT.  When I was in the Ministers seat I increased the grant to the GAA by twice the estimated cost of VAT.  If the Minister cannot remove VAT he should consider following my example in 1980 which would make him welcome in every village community throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Yes, and the Minister would see Tipperary coming back to greatness.  It is essential to remove VAT on hurleys, not just for the sake of the GAA but for the sake of healthy community life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a consequence of the imposition of 5 per cent VAT on the building industry 40,000 people are unemployed.  That is an enormous number of people in what is in every sense a domestic industry and the domestic characteristics of this industry far outweigh any other.  All its employment is domestic and almost all of the input is also domestic.  There has been a cutback of £18 million on the capital programme, with all the consequences we have seen for employment in this major, labour intensive industry.  We know that money does not grow on trees, <Col N="410" /> but it is much better to put it into productive use in regard to road maintenance, house construction, industrial and hotel construction, anything which will generate activity in the economy.  The return from the building industry is perhaps the best we will get; and it is regrettable to note that cement sales to the end of April this year, compared to the same period last year, which was disastrous, were 17 per cent down on the previous four months.  This is mainly attributable to the effect of VAT as the public cannot afford to pay it and many builders simply cannot absorb it.  A gentleman from a major firm came to tell me &mdash; not to complain &mdash; the extent of the drop-off in investment by them in this country.  This is one of the biggest companies and 80 per cent plus of their investment programme is outside the country to maintain, as he put it, the 20 per cent skeleton at home.  I do not want to name firms in the construction industry but I have met all of them recently&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Their only basis of survival these days is by transferring their investment programmes outside the country.  It is time we stopped that nonsense because we cannot afford to have their money reinvested outside the country or to have employment generated in another state while unemployment continues to grow here.  Grants can only assist in a small way and the only thing that might help would be to lift the extra burden of VAT which the Minister's predecessor imposed. Perhaps we can discuss this further on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I join in this very sincere plea to the Minister to remove VAT from hurleys, since he is not even aware of the amount taken in.  There are hurling clubs in every parish in Ireland and we are trying to keep young people involved in their national games so that they will not resort to vandalism.  We should encourage them to play hurling and the Minister would perform an excellent service, particularly for rural areas, if he removed VAT on hurleys.  The GAA are our greatest national organisation and, in recognition of what they have done for half a century for young people, the Minister should be courageous and remove the VAT.  It is unfair and unjust and is preventing young people from purchasing hurleys to develop great skills which all parties should be encouraging. If he removed this imposition, the parents in rural areas would be grateful to him forever&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to thank you, Sir, for having allowed me the time to discuss this important matter on the Adjournment.  It is unfortunate that the Minister for Health is not present to listen to the case I propose to make in relation to the cutbacks that have taken place in the North Western Health Board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The North Western Health Board have always taken a very responsible approach to their deliberations in relation to the adoption of the Estimates, have always given full recognition to the economic difficulties of the country.  The board have now come to the point that they are unable to absorb the massive cutbacks of £3.2 million in the 1986 Estimates or run the services within the region without effecting a very drastic rundown in those services and lay-off of staff.  Since 1980 cutbacks in the Department funding have amounted to 20 per cent.  During the period 1980 to 1986 the board received special additional allocations for a small number of approved developments, namely, the extension of Letterkenny General Hospital, the orthopaedic unit at Sligo General Hospital, the community nursing units in County Donegal and a unit for mentally handicapped at Stranorlar in 1986.  The cost of these services amounted to £6.4 million.  Therefore, in 1986 terms the total value of the 1980 level of resources, together with the adjustments made by the Department since then for approved services, is £79.7 million, which is 20 per cent greater than the 1986 allocation.  It could be said that <Col N="416" /> we had 20 per cent more resources for the services we provided in 1980 than is being provided this year, which is a clear indication of the cuts effected in that period.  Despite these cuts a number of significant changes have been made in that period by way of internal transfers between the service budgets, thus allowing for the establishment of a number of new services.</P>
    <P>When the Minister met a deputation from the board on 28 February 1986 he indicated that the case made to him, and the points contained in the documentation supplied, would be fully considered and that another meeting would take place within two or three weeks.  The Minister also asked the board to defer consideration of the major service changes which would arise from the cuts implied in his letter of allocation of 29 January 1986.</P>
    <P>We welcome the presence of the Minister here.  It is clear that he is fully aware of the consequences of the £3.2 million cutback.  He received a full report from the CEO of the health board and knows the consequences for that board.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the effects which the cutback will have on the underprivileged in the north-west region.  Community care services have been cut by £700,000, which equals 3 per cent of the total budget.  The cost of transport services to hospitals, clinics and the like is £615,000 made up as follows: day hospitals, £110,000; workshops, £90,000; external clinics, including Dublin, Galway and other hospitals, £85,000; internal clinics £330,000.  Transport to the day hospitals and workshops will be continued and also for people attending the renal-dialysis unit, but all other transport services will be discontinued.  This is where the crunch comes and where the hardship takes place.</P>
    <P>I am not pleading a special case for the North Western Health Board, or that we should get special treatment.  I am saying we are not getting the recognition we should be getting.  I wish to put on record that the area which the board serves has special features which do not appertain to the areas of other boards.  First, this <Col N="417" /> is mostly a rural region; secondly, the majority of the people live long distances from the services; thirdly, 85 per cent of the population live outside towns; fourthly, the average income per family is the lowest in the country; fifthly, we have the highest population over 65 years of age of the entire country, which in itself normally implies a greater demand for hospital services; sixthly, the region also has 3.78 hospital beds per 1,000 of population, which is the lowest in the country.</P>
    <P>These circumstances put a severe drain on scarce resources.  If we were to make comparisons, we could compare a person living in North Inishowen with a person living in Ballymun in Dublin, needing to attend a hospital clinic.  The distance in the Donegal case is 40 miles each way, imposing a cost of about £30 for a taxi, compared with a bus fare of 70p each way in Dublin.  If we were to go to the other extreme and consider a Donegal person who has to attend a hospital in Dublin, we would be talking of a figure in excess of £100, by comparison with the 70p Dublin bus fare.  These are the economic factors.</P>
    <P>When one comes to the human aspect and takes into consideration a sick person having to make all the arrangements in relation to a journey of almost 200 miles each way, an overnight stay in the city and transport to and from the hospital, surely this is clear evidence that no consideration has been given by the Minister's Department to the consequences of the cutbacks and the effects on human beings whom the Minister and I and everybody else desire to serve.  Public transport in the north west region is virtually non-existent.</P>
    <P>I am putting it to the Minister tonight that there is no way in which the North Western Health Board can operate or maintain services within the present allocation.  I believe in all sincerity that the Minister recognises that fact.  We acknowledge that he allocated an extra £310,000 for the very important renal-dialysis units in Letterkenny and Sligo and for the running of the Buncrana community <Col N="418" /> welfare home.  I appeal to him to take into consideration the arguments which I am putting to him and to provide extra funding to alleviate the hardships now being imposed on the people in that region.</P>
    <P>The people about whom I am talking here have a disabled person's maintenance allowance of about £36 to £40 a week.  How can we expect those who are sick to arrange transport and get to a clinic in Letterkenny or Sligo hospital, or to a clinic in Dublin, and provide the money needed for those journeys?  It is clearly impossible.  Many of such people will forego attending the clinics and eventually will wind up in an acute hospital. The responsibility must fall on the Minister's shoulders as the man responsible for providing the money for these services and as the only person who can redeem those people from this ridiculous situation.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record that the CEO and officers of the North Western Health Board are stretched to the pin of their collar to maintain the operation of the services within the north western region. The Minister will be forced to admit that the North Western Health Board, of which I had the privilege to be chairman last year, have never come to the Minister with a case which was not valid.  I am pleading the case for that region against the cutbacks which we have had to accept in the Estimate.  This is only one aspect of the effects but it is a very serious one.  We are hitting at the most under-privileged people within the community, a community which has the highest rural population, the least number of acute hospitals, with distances of from 40 to 100 miles involved.</P>
    <P>There is no way in which the Minister or his Department can justify an allocation to the north western region which was equated with the needs of the boards in other parts of the country.  I am speaking here specifically in relation to the Eastern Health Board and Dublin.  We have not the same facilities.  We are a remote region, virtually out on a limb. <Col N="419" /> No argument can sustain the cutback of £3.2 million.  I am asking the Minister seriously to consider the plight of the health board officials and the staff who are responsible to the Minister in the community.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say we have kept in line with the policy thinking of the Minister's Department and of the thinking of the previous Government in relation to the Department of Health as regards developing the community services.  We have developed the services and the board now find that they have not the funding to maintain them.  The consequences of the shortfall would be a justifiable argument for the Minister to go to the Government and ask for the extra funding for the North Western Health Board.  We acknowledge the extra £310,000 given, but that does not overcome the difficulties in which the board find themselves and that the unfortunate people depending on their services are asked to bear.</P>
    <P>In view of the very constructive and successful meeting that the chairman, Deputy Harte, the CEO of the North Western Health Board and I had with the Minister, I hope he will give full recognition to the very detailed document which the CEO presented to him in relation to the situation in which he finds himself.  I conclude with a final appeal to the Minister to have a hard look at the difficulties in which the under-privileged people now find themselves and the difficulties in which his staff find themselves in trying to maintain and run a health service in the most difficult region of the eight health boards.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak on this subject, but I support Deputy Conaghan.  As he said, the whole area is a very rural, remote one and is deprived.  We are far removed from the urban areas.  The Minister must treat our appeal sympathetically and ensure that transport is laid on for our senior citizens. In the past the service may have been abused but there are a number of elderly people who have no means of transportation. They have to hire a taxi, and to hire <Col N="420" /> a taxi from Bellaghy and Charlestown to Sligo would cost £16 to £17.  That would amount to about half of an old age pensioner's weekly income.</P>
      <P>I am appealing to the Minister, the same as Deputy Conaghan has done already, to make sure that our old age pensioners who have no way of getting to clinics have free transport, particularly those who are asked to travel to Dublin. For goodness sake, how are they supposed to get there unless there is an ambulance service?  That ambulance service should be continued in order to bring these people to our capital city.  In our area we have not buses on every route as they have in Dublin.  If we had, it would be easy for people who have free transport to get to hospitals and clinics.  In supporting Deputy Conaghan I hope that the Minister will see fit to give old age pensioners who have no means of transportation whatsoever free transport to hospitals and clinics in Dublin, or wherever else they have to go.</P>

      <P>I apologise to Deputies for not being present when the debate opened.  I presumed that we were starting at 5 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The North Western Health Board's overall allocation for 1986, including their share of the expenses of the General Medical Services Payment Board and to the cost of voluntary hospitals and homes, is £84.441 million.  This compares with a figure of £80.282 million at budget stage last year, which is the comparable figure to be taken.  Basically, this is an increase of slightly over 5 per cent.  I would argue that, with the inflation rate down to 2½ per cent, for health board expenditure it is probably another 1 per cent higher because of the change in foodstuffs and so on.  There are compensatory changes against that 5 per cent.  For example, the cost of energy in health boards is substantially down.  The overall increase to £84.441 million as against £80.282 million at this time last year is up by a reasonable proportion of £4.159 million.  If one takes the direct expenditure of the board, this year the allocation is £66.48 million as against £63.31 million <Col N="421" /> at budget time last year.  Again, this is up by around 5 per cent.  I do appreciate that this is a very tight figure, but everyone has been used to getting 10 per cent or 12 per cent and at one stage 15 per cent increases.  I am not saying that they necessarily applied to the North Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>In a situation where the budgets have been tight, all of the health boards have been examining the services they deliver to the population at large.  I met a deputation from the North Western Health Board on 28 February.  In regard to the problems which Deputies generously indicated, I agreed that we would make additional moneys of about £310,000 available for the continuance of the renal dialysis services, which are absolutely essential, and for the Buncrana Community Nursing Unit.  I will also be able to provide some limited funds to finance the community psychiatric services, which are very good in the area.  These have been turned around into the model we are all endeavouring to introduce. That, in effect, is a limit on the situation and we boil it down now to the transport.</P>
    <P>I would point out that the ordinary transport arrangements for the North Western Health Board will continue to be provided directly to the day hospitals. That is as it should be.  It will be provided to the renal dialysis service units.  It will continue to be provided to the mental handicap units and from one hospital to another.  There will also be certain cases where special arrangements will be made.  A register of those cases is being drawn up by the health board.  In addition, special concession travel has been made available by the public transport authorities in the area on presentation of authorised clinical appointments.</P>
    <P>There is a discontinuance of the automatic entitlement to transport services to clinics or to X-rays, but where there is any kind of genuine hardship involved there is a refund of reasonable transport expenses incurred.  I presume this will include a taxi requirement on a pre-authorised basis.  I want to assure Deputies that any person in genuine need <Col N="422" /> should not and will not suffer undue financial hardship arising out of these measures.  I want to make it absolutely clear that there is no reduction in the ambulance service, which is essentially an emergency service but which is used fairly widespread within the area for a variety of other purposes.  That is not being withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Therefore, certain automatic taxi facilities are being curtailed.  Knowing the officers of the health boards, that can be done and shall be done in a sensitive and reasonable way.  I want to thank the Deputies for the fact that when I received the deputation we had a constructive and very responsible attitude shown by the health board and their CEO when we got down to discussing their budget for 1986. It was an extremely effective and reasonable exchange of views.  I will keep the budget of the North Western Health Board under monthly review in the Department.  If I have any additional funds available throughout the year, I will bear in mind the representations of the Deputies here this evening.  I will not be in any way stinting on them should any additional moneys come through either on appropriations-in-aid or any other aspects of additional funding which might arise for one reason or another within the overall framework of the revenue allocation to me for 1986.</P>
    <P>These are the main observations I would like to make.  My job is to deliver the services at the least possible cost.  The high cost of transport is one of the major studies undertaken by the Department. These studies have been circulated to the health boards.  Therefore if the boards take some of the aspects of our reports on tow in relation to their budgets, I cannot in any way criticise them.  I want to assure my parliamentary colleagues that that is all I have by way of non-capital health expenditure for the health board.  I must remain within my budget framework.</P>

      <P>There is no <Col N="382" /> definitive method of valuing a forest estate and to say the least the exercise is a complex one.  Because of the long term nature of the forestry enterprise, the valuation of the estate at any time is highly sensitive to assumptions made as to the rate of interest, in real terms, that may be expected on the investment and the likely trends in timber prices over a period extending up to 50 years.  By assuming different rates of interest the review group on forestry estimated the value of the State forest estate as between £2,500 million and £350 million.  The group did, however, state that the State forestry enterprise had succeeded in achieving profitability of 2 per cent over and above inflation.  Assuming a continued profitability level of this order, the value of the estate would be in the region of £1,100 million.</P>
      <P>The methodology used by the review group in their calculations is set out in Appendix 4 of their report a copy of which is available in the Library of the House.</P>

Indications are that acquisitions in 1986 will exceed that figure but at this stage it is too early to make a firm prediction.

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason disability benefit was discontinued to a person (details supplied) in County Dublin; the reason no other social welfare benefit was allowed; and if, in view of the circumstances of this case she will have the matter investigated with a view to ensuring that their family do not have to endure any further hardship.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit to 12 January 1986 after which date payment was disallowed following an examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  He appealed against the disallowance of benefit and was examined by a different medical referee who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  His appeal has been referred to an appeals officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing of his claim on 8 May 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the question of whether the person concerned should <Col N="389" /> have received any other social welfare benefits, the position is that when his claim for disability benefit was disallowed he was informed of his right to sign for unemployment benefit.  He has claimed unemployment benefit from 14 April 1986 and payment has been made to date.</P>

      <P>The entitlement of a claimant to pay-related benefit with flat-rate unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that the sum of weekly flat-rate unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and income-tax refunds may not exceed 85 per cent of the average net weekly earnings of the claimant.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 14 February 1986 and his claim was allowed at the maximum weekly flat-rate of £74.50 less a weekly deduction of £1.00 towards recovery of an overpayment of supplementary welfare allowance paid to him.</P>
      <P>In the case of the person concerned, the 85 per cent calculation is based on both earnings for insurable employment and unemployment benefit received in the period 6 April 1985 to 1 October 1985, when, apparently, he went abroad for some months prior to his claim.  The 85 per cent limit on his claim is £63.95 and as the weekly flat-rate unemployment benefit payable exceeds this figure, pay-related benefit is not payable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following a recent review of the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned his means were assessed at £45.95 weekly derived from the benefit of board and lodgings on his father's holding.</P>
      <P>The method of calculation of the benefit of board and lodgings, where the household income is derived from farming, is to estimate the yearly profit from the farm and to divide that amount between all members of the household, including the applicant, on a weighted basis.</P>
      <P>The profit from the farm in this case was estimated at £7,170 per annum and the person concerned was deemed to enjoy one-third of that income, that is £2,390 per annum or £45.95 weekly.  His means, accordingly, exceeded the maximum rate of unemployment assistance payable in his case and his claim was disallowed.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the disallowance of his claim and his case has been submitted to an appeals officer for determination at the earliest possible date.  His entitlement to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of the outcome of the appeal.</P>

      <P>Following investigation of his unemployment assistance claim the means of the person concerned were assessed at £3.45 weekly derived from the value of capital.  He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £29.30 being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £32.75 less means of £3.45.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> He was, however, in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance pending a decision on his claim and a refund of £269.29, deducted from arrears of unemployment assistance due, was made to the health board.  The balance of the arrears amounting to £97.46, was paid to the claimant on 30 April 1986.  Further weekly payments of £29.30 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of injury benefit since 25 March 1986 in respect of an incapacity resulting from an accident at work.  He had previously received injury benefit in respect of the same incapacity from 3 January 1986 to 17 March when he submitted a final certificate.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to pay-related benefit depends on the amount of reckonable earnings per week in the relevant income tax year.  His entitlement in respect of both claims depended on the earnings in the income tax year ended on 5 April 1984.  In the absence of any earnings in that year he failed to satisfy the conditions for pay-related benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of a contributory old age pension requires a person to have a yearly average of at least 20 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from his year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned reached old age <Col N="392" /> pension age on 27 December 1985.  He submitted a claim for a contributory old age pension on 2 October 1985.  The Department's records show that he has a total of 170 reckonable contributions in the relevant period which, in his case, is from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1985.  This is equal to a yearly average of only five and, therefore, he does not qualify for a contributory old age pension.  He was informed accordingly on 6 December 1985.  He is at present in receipt of a noncontributory old age pension at the rate of £51.10 per week.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if all of the smallholders in receipt of unemployment assistance have had their means tested since the notional means test was abolished in 1983; the number of smallholders who had unemployment assistance payment terminated or reduced as a result; the number who received increased payment; the number of oral hearings requested and granted; and the number of applicants who were successful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The means of all but four smallholder recipients of unemployment assistance have now been assessed on a factual basis.  The position at the end of April 1986 is that following review, payment of unemployment assistance has been reduced in 4,358 cases and has ceased in 3,099 cases.  Payment was increased in 3,146 cases.</P>
      <P>With regard to the number of oral hearings in respect of appeals made by smallholders, statistics are not maintained in a manner which would enable the information sought by the Deputy to be furnished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, under the new arrangements, introduced in June 1985, smallholders who were dissatisfied with the factual assessment of their means were afforded the opportunity of having their means reviewed again.  If dissatisfied with the review, it was open to <Col N="393" /> them to request an oral appeal hearing, and this was granted in all cases.</P>

      <P>He subsequently submitted details of his employment record confirming that he has sufficient contributions paid to qualify for payment of benefit.  All benefit payable to 5 April 1986, when he was certified fit to resume work, has now been issued to the person concerned.</P>

      <P>The payment of headage grants to qualifying farmers for maintaining cattle and sheep represents a considerable boost to farmers' incomes in disadvantaged areas such as Connemara.  Payments to farmers in this country under the 1986 headage schemes will be close on £60 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government policy aims at ensuring the further development of farming in Connemara and in the other areas that suffer from severe problems due to poor <Col N="394" /> soils and adverse climate.  This involves much more than the provision of headage payments; in particular the benefits under the western package provide considerable opportunities for the development of small farms throughout the west.</P>
    <P>I hope that the substantial opportunities under existing policies will be more fully exploited by farmers so that greater incomes can be derived from increased production, including more livestock qualifying for headage payments.</P>

      <P>Because of the difficulties of livestock farmers due to weather conditions, arrangements have already been made for the transport by Army vehicles of hay from the south and south-east to the north and west including the Connemara area.  In addition, since mid-December advance payments of 30 per cent of the ewe premium amounting to £4.90 per ewe and totalling £7.2 million have been <Col N="395" /> made to 23,600 sheep owners in the disadvantaged areas.  On 24 and 25 April headage payment advances of £15 per suckler cow and totalling £4 million were made to 44,500 beef cow farmers in these areas. The feed voucher scheme, which is now closed, applied to all parts of the country including Connemara.</P>
