      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire):</i> The principal indication of consumer spending in the short-term is the monthly retail sales index, which is compiled by the Central Statistics Office. This index shows that for the first eight months of 1986, the latest period available, the value of retail turnover increased by 2.5 per cent compared with the corresponding period in 1985.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce (a) the number of development proposals submitted to the National Development Corporation since the National Enterprise Agency were subsumed by the NDC this year; (b) the number of development proposals at present being considered by the NDC; (c) the number of development proposals approved by the NDC since the NEA came under the umbrella of the NDC <Col N="845" /> this year; and (d) the total value of the projects approved in this period and the value of the investment capital allocated to them by the NDC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): A Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Oral Question No. 2 and Priority Question No. 27 together.</P>
      <P>The total value of the investments approved by the National Development Corporation Limited &mdash; NADCORP &mdash; since taking over from the National Enterprise Agency on 11 June 1986 is £2,981,000.  No investment by the corporation to date has required my permission or Government consent.  Details of the investments made will be contained in NADCORP's annual report, which is required to be made to me not later than six months after the end of the corporation's financial year.  This will subsequently be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  It would be inappropriate to make a general statement on the work of NADCORP in advance of this report.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the White Paper on Industrial Policy, the question of a role for NADCORP as a holding company for existing State industries is to be considered by the Government in the light of progress of NADCORP in its basic and innovative tasks.  The stage for this consideration has not yet been reached. For a similar reason any question of a transfer of other State-held shares to NADCORP has not yet been considered.</P>
      <P>The remainder of the information sought related to the day to day operations of the corporation in regard to which I have no function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true to say that this corporation have made no new investments at all other than those for which they are now responsible having taken over from the National Enterprise Agency?  If that is so, does the Minister consider that to date, the corporation have not performed any useful function? Could the Minister also indicate if there has been any assessment made to date as <Col N="846" /> to what areas of our economy or industrial development the corporation propose to concentrate on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy must not have heard my reply.  I will read the first sentence again:</P>
      <P>The total value of the investments approved by the National Development Corporation Limited &mdash; NADCORP &mdash; since taking over from the National Enterprise Agency on 11 June 1986 is £2,981,000.</P>
      <P>Since they took over they have done that. There are eight projects that have been funded.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question I should say that the remit of the NDC is laid down in legislation and is a very wide remit indeed. The executive of the NDC, under the direction of their board, have the right to invest within that remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>My apologies for having misunderstood the first part of the Minister's reply. Would the Minister say if the function of the NDC is to be innovative and if he can indicate whether the eight projects in which the corporation have invested to date have been of a high-risk nature, or whether they have any specific function in developing areas not developed already by other companies in the industrial sphere?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would agree that the investments they have made to date have been innovative which I hope will lead to the creation of good, long-lasting jobs in manufacturing industry. I do not want to name the companies involved.  They will be outlined in the annual report which will be before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first part of the question, the Minister has given the number of development projects taken <Col N="847" /> on by the National Development Corporation. Would the Minister say how many proposals have been submitted to the corporation and the number at present being considered by them?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> These are matters of the day to day running of the company and I do not have a function in that regard.  The Legislature here decided that the day to day running of the company would be vested in the National Development Corporation and board, not in the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage in the life of the National Development Corporation &mdash; which was ten years in gestation and finally born on 11 June last &mdash; is the Minister satisfied that they are proving to be any better at the creation of jobs than their predecesor?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As the Deputy rightly says, the NDC were vested on 11 June 1986.  Since then they have made what I would consider to be substantial progress.  They have their structures in operation.  They have advertised for a chief executive and I would envisage them continuing to make substantial progress in the years ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that he regards the National Development Corporation as an innovative body.  Of the eight projects he says have been funded or invested in by the corporation since their inception, could he say how many are new?  Could the Minister also indicate how many jobs are at present involved in those eight projects?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This is the kind of detail which will be contained in the annual report of the National Development Corporation.  I am not prepared to treat the NDC differently from other agencies.  It is not the function of the Minister to dwell on the day to day activities of the company.</P>

      <P>That is not at all satisfactory.  I am not attempting in any way to interfere with the day to day operations but the Minister is responsible to this House for the direction in which the NDC are going.  I am asking a simple question: are the eight projects in which the corporation have invested to date new ones or projects previously in existence which could not be financed by the private sector?  Also can the Minister tell me how many jobs are involved in those eight projects?</P>

The House has decided already &mdash; when it passed the relevant Bill &mdash; that the National Development Corporation will be obliged to present an annual report to both Houses within six months of the end of the financial year.  The Houses, in their wisdom, decided that the day to day running of the company should be communicated to the Houses in this manner and that is in accordance with the decision already taken by the Houses.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the level of unemployment in Castleisland and in North Kerry generally.  I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that they are actively promoting North Kerry as a suitable location for industrial development.</P>
      <P>In 1985 14 small industry projects, two of which were located in Castleisland, were approved for North Kerry by the South-West Region Small Industries Board.  These projects have the potential to provide 71 jobs, 11 of which will be in Castleisland and represent an investment of £490,800.  So far this year, a further ten projects have been approved for North Kerry, including two in Castleisland. These projects represent total investment of £320,000 and the potential to create 46 new jobs, 22 of which will be located in Castleisland.</P>
      <P>In medium-large industry the IDA support for three overseas companies in Tralee &mdash; Ridgeview Mills, Beru and Burlington Industries &mdash; and one in Listowel &mdash; Melchert Elektronik &mdash; will lead to the creation of 355 new jobs.  In addition Kerry Co-op and their subsidiary Henry Denny and Sons increased employment by almost 200 in 1985.</P>
      <P>The IDA are actively promoting their available factory space and nearly 700 acres of land in the North Kerry area for the full range of industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the number of recent closures of established firms in Castleisland, is the Minister satisfied that every effort is being made to provide alternative industry in that town?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Yes.  As I said, the IDA are actively promoting Castleisland in common with the rest of north Kerry.  I am sure they will continue to be successful in the promotion of Castleisland.  If we look at the figures for 1985, we will see there was no loss of jobs in manufacturing industry in Castleisland; there was an increase of one.  In 1984 there was a decrease of five jobs <Col N="851" /> over the whole year.  Over the two years, 1984 and 1985, there was a decrease of four jobs in Castleisland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates to the unemployment problem in Castleisland. I am aware, and I am sure the Minister is also aware that a number of traditional firms have closed down in Castleisland. We are not talking about manufacturing industry in particular but also the service industry and supply services.  There is a dearth of employment in Castleisland as a result of the closures of these traditional firms.  I ask the Minister what proposals he has for the provision of employment to take up the slack that was caused by the closure of these firms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Both questions relate to manufacturing industry and inquire what the IDA are doing. The IDA have responsibility for manufacturing industry and not for other areas of employment.  As I have said, the IDA are actively promoting the Kerry region. There is a full-time executive in Tralee who is actively promoting all towns in north Kerry.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am informed by the Central Statistics Office that the north west and Donegal planning regions together have the highest rate of unemployment in the country.  The Government's national plan <i>Building on Reality</i> sets out the Government's overall programme for employment creation and economic development.  In so far as industrial development is concerned, <Col N="852" /><i>Building on Reality</i> incorporates the principal elements of the White Paper on Industrial Policy which was published in July 1984.  The White Paper established employment growth in industry and the maximisation of value-added as the primary objectives of industrial policy.</P>
      <P>The main elements of industrial strategy are: (a) increasing emphasis to be placed on the development of indigenous industry; (b) greater inter-industry linkages between foreign-owned and indigenous industry; (c) the continued attraction of projects from overseas, particularly those projects performing key business functions; (d) the creation of more new small industries under the IDA small industries programme which has now been fully regionalised; and (e) a shift in State support from fixed asset investment to export marketing development and technology acquisition.</P>
      <P>In the north west and Donegal planning regions manufacturing employment at the end of 1985 had increased by 550 over the corresponding figure for the end of 1984.  All of the area in question is designated for industrial policy purposes and as such is in a position to attract a higher level of grant assistance for industries locating there than is available in the non-designated areas.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy is, no doubt, aware that the recoupment of financial assistance given by the Industrial Development Authority in support of industrial projects is a matter for the authority.  In reply to an earlier question on the matter, the House was informed on 11 February 1986 that negotiations with regard to the repayment of IDA assistance were then in progress between the IDA and United Technologies Corporation, the parent company of Mostek at the time of the closure.</P>
      <P>In reply to a further question, I informed the House on 5 June 1986 that all capital grants paid to Mostek had been recouped to the IDA.  Efforts are continuing to sell to a suitable purchaser the factory premises; if and when this takes place I understand that a substantial part of the proceeds will be paid to the IDA. Training grants amounting to £0.676 million have not been repaid; these are not normally refundable.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Section 16 of the Industrial Development Act, 1986, provides that the Industrial Development Authority may provide premises for the establishment, development or maintenance of an industrial undertaking.

      <P>That makes common sense.  I was informed that an individual wanted to provide employment and was not interested in grants but in one of the IDA units.

      <P>The provision of facilities for industrial development is the responsibility of the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
      <P>I understand from the authority that they have no plans at present to build an enterprise centre in Drogheda but that they would be willing to consider assisting local community groups in the provision of such a centre subject to a planned and co-ordinated approach from the local community.  IDA have a working agreement with the Youth Employment Agency whereby the agency take the lead role in community initiatives and manufacturing proposals arising from these initiatives are then referred to IDA for consideration.

The IDA's north east regional office in Dundalk has a list of those vacant premises and will consider giving grant assistance <Col N="860" /> towards renting and modifying them provided suitable manufacturing projects can be found for them.  As well as that there is a community-led initiative where normally the YEA would take the lead and the IDA will be very glad to cooperate in the establishment of an enterprise centre, as suggested in the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 13 and written Question No. 40 together.</P>
      <P>The question of designation generally was the subject of a National Economic and Social Council study which was initiated by my predecessor.  The study was concerned with a review of the criteria for designation.</P>
      <P>Subsequently the Economic and Social Research Institute were asked to produce a detailed review of the implications of the recommendations of the NESC report on designation.  This ESRI report has been completed and is currently being examined in my Department. Until this examination is completed it would be inappropriate for me to designate any further areas in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Meanwhile County Louth will continue to be treated as a priority area by the IDA for industrial development purposes.  As an instance of the results being achieved, Ecco Ltd. of Dundalk announced a £17.0 million investment this year which is <Col N="861" /> expected to involve the creation of 280 additional jobs over the next four years. Accuray Ireland Ltd. of Dundalk, established in 1981 to manufacture a range of computer based process automation systems, doubled its manufacturing space in September 1986.  This expansion is expected to provide 40 extra jobs over the next two years.  Tatung of Taiwan recently announced the establishment of a £10 million consumer electronics manufacturing factory in Drogheda with production due to commence in the middle of next year.  Within two years 200 jobs are expected to be created by the company with a further two stages creating 200 additional jobs, subject of course to market conditions.</P>
    <P>Small industry also has an important role to play in the county and as has already been announced, in the period January to August 1986, 14 projects were approved with a total employment potential of 69.  In addition to the foregoing developments the IDA are promoting 50,000 sq. ft. of advance factory space and 130 acres of land for industrial development in the county.</P>
    <P>I think it is clear from the foregoing that every effort is being made by the IDA to address the county's undoubtedly serious unemployment problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that there are up to 8,000 unemployed in the county and that the manufacturing job base there has been so severely eroded in the last four years that there is a need for urgent action to tackle the problem?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

The board have 900 jobs to be taken up this year but that cannot be done because of the failure to appoint the IDA representative to the board of Údarás.  Will the Minister agree that the co-operation that existed between Údarás na Gaeltachta and the IDA when there was a representative of the IDA on the board resulted in great achievements?

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="869" /> Industry and Commerce whether in insurance matters Lloyds have operated in Ireland since 1976 under very favourable terms, as they have a global authorisation which allows any syndicate to enter and leave the Irish market at will, and are also exempted from much of the detailed financial disclosures required from other companies as can be seen from the very limited information contained in the Blue Book; the steps he is prepared to take to ensure the insurers who are not members of the Irish Insurance Federation and, in particular, Lloyds contribute in the same meaningful way to resolving problems encountered by firms who cannot obtain liability insurance on a commercial basis; and in view of the recent difficulties at Lloyds and in order to ensure that all insurers are subjected to the same financial controls, if he considers it is now desirable to subject Lloyds to the same financial disclosure requirements as other insurers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Bruton) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Bruton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory and administrative arrangements for the operation of Lloyds' syndicates in Ireland, which are not unduly favourable to them, reflect the particular structural features of Lloyds. While a global authorisation has been granted, each syndicate is legally and financially independent of the others and is entitled to take commercial decisions in its own right.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, under administrative procedures agreed between my Department and Lloyds, I am required to be notified of new syndicates entering the market; any syndicate wishing to leave the market must comply with certain procedures which require written notice of a minimum period of three months, and in some cases six months, to be given to me together with details of the syndicate's portfolio.  Furthermore I require to be consulted before a syndicate may reenter the market.  I would take as serious a view of the random entry and exit of Lloyds' syndicates, as I would with any other insurance company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="870" /> I acknowledge that the requirements for financial disclosure are different from those of other insurance undertakings but again it must be noted that Lloyds is not an insurance company but a market for insurance.  Over 400 independent syndicates underwrite business in Ireland at present, with premium income ranging from as little as £1 to as much as £5 million, which is exceptional.  The forms of return required of insurance companies are not, in general, appropriate to the unusual structure of Lloyds and the returns furnished by Lloyds reflect that situation.  The quality of information is kept under constant review by my Department and the Deputy will be interested to know that additional returns in respect of the motor syndicates are now being submitted.  The 1985 Blue Book, to be published shortly, will contain this additional information.  I would emphasise that the returns submitted to my Department by Lloyds in respect of its Irish business are sufficient for the proper supervision of the business concerned.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the availability of liability insurance.  members of the Irish Insurance Federation have about 90 per cent of the total non-life insurance market.  Under an arrangement with my Department, the federation have agreed to examine cases where there are difficulties in obtaining liability cover from federation members.  However, no guarantee is given that cover will be provided. Lloyds and some other insurers are not members of the IIF and do not participate in the federation's referral arrangement.  However, these insurers do review cases at my Department's request where their policyholders have difficulties in renewing cover.  Lloyds does insure about 12½ per cent of the Irish liability market.</P>
    <P>As the insurance supervisory Authority, my primary responsibility is to ensure that companies meet their legal solvency and reserving requirements and ultimately I cannot compel any insurer to quote in respect of any risk much less at a particular premium.  However, I am most concerned to find solutions to the <Col N="871" /> problems in the liability insurance market and I expect all insurers operating in the market to contribute to that effort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Under what arrangement do Lloyds get their global authorisation to operate in the liability area in this country?  When was the arrangement made with them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangement was made with them in 1976 under statutory instrument 115 which changed from licensing of syndicates on an individual basis to licensing Lloyds as a single entity. This carried with it considerable advantages. Most particularly it effectively made Lloyds into a branch office establishment and it brought attendant advantages such as the maintenance and localisation of technical reserves which are considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister say he has sufficient supervisory control over the Lloyds' syndicates operating here when they only make returns under four headings &mdash; premiums, commissions, claims paid and claims outstanding &mdash; as against the 21 headings under which other insurers have to make returns?  How can the Minister determine, for instance, whether they have an underwriting loss or profit on their business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I outlined in my earlier answer, it would not be practical for returns as required by other insurance companies to be required of each of Lloyds' syndicates.  As I pointed out, they range from very tiny sizes to some considerably larger.  That is why they are not required to have the detailed returns required of other insurers.  However, I am quite satisfied as to the solvency requirements and the protection in particular of the policy holders who would be dealing with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, would the Minister agree that the Lloyds' syndicates operating here can come and go at will and in fact do, and that the situation is not the <Col N="872" /> same for the Irish insurers who, by and large, take on all risks?  But Lloyds' syndicate can, if they dislike a particular risk, decide not to take it.  This leaves many people unable to get liability cover.  Is the Minister aware that because of some failure of the Lloyds' syndicates in the UK, legislation was introduced there to bring about a better control?  Will the Minister still confirm that he is satisfied that all the Lloyds' syndicates are honouring their commitments in the liability area for this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, on the question of the Lloyds' syndicates coming and going, as I outlined in my earlier reply, an agreement has been hammered out between Lloyds and my Department regarding the establishment and disestablishment of the syndicates and they include such requirements as the transfer of policy holders to another syndicate or insurance company.  They include issues such as prior notice given to the Minister, among other things.  On the question of refusal of certain types of liability, there is a formal arrangement with the Federation of Insurers, of which Lloyds are not a member, but that is not a compulsory arrangement and any insurance company can, ultimately, turn down a policy.  We cannot force them to take risks.  We do not have negotiations with Lloyds in regard to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is not working.  Why should the federation take up the bad risks that Lloyds are trying to dump on them?</P>

Indeed, the East Wall Road centre and the units in Gardiner Street have just become available during 1986. There are almost 1,000 people employed in these units and, as they become fully utilised, it is expected that this will increase to almost 2,500 people.  These initiatives represent an investment of almost £20 million.</P>
      <P>Since January 1983 the inner city, for a period of five years, has been a designated area where projects can qualify for special incentives from the IDA.  This enables the Authority to provide grant assistance up to a level of 60 per cent for suitable manufacturing or internationally trading service industries.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with the other job-creating State agencies and local community-based groups, the IDA is endeavouring to ensure that all these initiatives and subsequent projects will recruit the maximum number of inner city residents.</P>
      <P>In addition the IDA has also devoted considerable resources to its Dublin small industries team who have an ambitious target of creating 260 projects in Dublin during 1986.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister be good enough to say whether he is satisfied with the progress to date in the achievement of the targets set out by him, by the IDA and by the Government in the context of this black spot?  Has he any further proposals for somehow gaining priority for this area to deal with an emergency in the city centre in terms of total lack of employment at present?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce given the forecast by the IDA the employment in manufacturing industry will continue to fall in 1986, following a net loss of 5,800 manufacturing jobs in 1985, if he considers that the crisis in the manufacturing industry is of the gravest proportions and <Col N="876" /> that output in industry must be increased as a matter of urgency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that there is a crisis in manufacturing industry.  Recent figures released by the Central Statistics Office indicate an easing of the trend of the decline in manufacturing employment. Output continues to grow although it is too early to estimate precisely how large that growth will be in the current year.</P>
      <P>The Government's strategy for industrial development is set out in the White Paper on Industrial Policy, which was published in July 1984.  The principal elements of the strategy are:</P>
      <P>(a) increasing emphasis to be placed on the development of indigenous industry;</P>
      <P>(b) greater inter-industry linkages between foreign-owned and indigenous industry;</P>
      <P>(c) the continued attraction of projects from overseas, particularly those projects performing key business functions here;</P>
      <P>(d) the creation of more new small industries under the IDA small industries programme which has now been fully regionalised; and</P>
      <P>(e) a shift in State support from fixed asset investment to export marketing development and technology acquisition.</P>
      <P>A number of initiatives have been taken to implement the Government strategy including the introduction of the technology acquisition grants, employment grants for small industry, the company development approach, the national linkage programme and the establishment of the National Development Corporation.  The aim is to promote a stronger industrial base which will lead to a growth in employment in industry and also, as a consequence, in the services sector.  In 1985 these policies succeeded in creating 12,000 first time jobs.  The target for 1986 is 13,000 first time jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated <Col N="877" /> that in his view there is no crisis as far as the manufacturing industry and jobs are concerned.  Will he not agree that, given that for the three years 1983, 1984 and 1985 we had 1,151 closures, 1,738 liquidations and 413 receiverships and for the first six months of 1986 we had 384 liquidations and 58 receiverships and the Central Bank indicate a decline of 1.5 per cent in the numbers at work, investment in industry having fallen by 3 per cent annually over the past four years must be a huge factor in the crisis I contend we have in the manufacturing and services sector?</P>

      <P>Some fine day I might have something to do with the American economy. In the meantime I will do the best I can here at home.  Will the Minister not accept that the growth in industrial production has dropped by 2.5 per cent while jobs in industry have fallen by, on average, 3.7 per cent?  Will he not agree that the flight of capital out of this country is a huge factor in this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not agree that there is a flight of capital out of this country.  With the UK alone we are involved in trade now in day to day movements which annualised amount to about £8 billion.  Therefore, normal trade movements of money explain what the Deputy has alluded to as a flight of capital. On his figures for the reduction of jobs in manufacturing industry, first, as <Col N="878" /> he is aware, over the past four or five years, and even longer, there has been a tremendous movement towards automation and that has resulted in job losses in existing manufacturing industrial plants but, as well as that, there is a reclassification of the statistics the Deputy may not be aware of.  The practice in manufacturing firms now, not only in Ireland but in Europe and the US, is to be involved solely in the main business they are about of producing the particular product.  Services such as distribution, catering, cleaning and security, which were previously in-house and which statistically were recorded as jobs in manufacturing industry, have now moved out of the plant and are coming in under the statistics for the service industries.  The Deputy will find there is an increase in the number of people involved in the service industries.  I suggest what he is looking at is a reclassification of statistics rather than a decline in manufacturing industry.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am not interpreting the figures.  I have pointed out that the practice in manufacturing industry now is to concentrate on their primary objective and that other functions which were traditionally in manufacturing industry are being contracted out.  Caterers are being brought in from the outside; they are not in house.  Security people are being brought in from the <Col N="879" /> outside quite frequently; they are not in house.  Distribution frequently is not in house at the moment.  Consequently what was previously a job in manufacturing industry is now a job in the service industries, but it is still there.  I am simply informing the Deputy of what the situation is.  I am not putting any cast or colour on what is happening.  I am just telling him what is happening on the ground.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>On that basis I wish to ask the Minister what juggling he can do with the current figure of those unemployed at nearly 300,000.  Surely those figures arise from the drop in production in industrial activity and the drop in investment in industrial activity.  Is the Minister saying there are not, as I indicated, these drops in manufacturing industry and the service industries?  How then does he explain nearly 300,000 people unemployed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce, given the absolute urgency of putting the Irish insurance industry on a sound competitive footing, if he considers it may be appropriate to revise Government policy to the industry <Col N="880" /> to assist it to exploit the growing opportunities in the internationally traded financial services industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Government's policy to encourage the Irish insurance industry to operate on a strong competitive basis so that it can meet the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities presented by a changing market.</P>
      <P>The Government have undertaken a range of measures to improve the insurance environment.  These have been detailed on previous occasions in this House.  However, the primary onus is on the insurance industry itself to plan for its development in the years ahead.  My Department have been in dialogue with the industry on the steps which should be taken in relation to the pending freedom of services in non-life insurance.</P>
      <P>I am also generally supportive of the conclusions and recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities which, in its report published in December last, examined the impact of certain EC legislation on the Irish insurance industry.  In this context I can say that it is our intention to pursue negotiations on the draft services Directive with a view to achieving whatever reasonable safeguards can be obtained for the insurance sector in Ireland.  The importance of this issue has already been highlighted in the declaration made by the Government in relation to the Single European Act.  That declaration states that, in relation to harmonisation of legislation on insurance, the Government would expect to be able to rely on a sympathetic attitude from its Community partners for any special provision made for the position of the insurance industry in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister did not really follow the question which was geared towards the international trade services, particularly so far as the insurance industry is concerned.  The Minister says that in the past the improvements with a view to helping the <Col N="881" /> insurance industry have been detailed. Would the Minister regard the two Bills introduced by the Government as being in that improvement programme, namely, the Courts Bill which proposes to abolish juries, and the Insurance Bill, 1986?  Is it intended to have these matters attended to before the House rises for Christmas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would regard the Courts Bill, the Insurance Bill and the other Bills in relation to industrial safety as major contributions to the improvement of the insurance environment.  The Second Stage of the Courts Bill has already been taken and the agreement of the Whips will presumably provide for the Committee Stage in due course.  I am hopeful that it will be taken early.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister trying to mislead the House?  He knows it has been decided to shelve both of those measures, as far as the abolition of juries is concerned, because some deal has been done with the Bar Council and because of the question of representation at court proceedings.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;was to tighten up on solvency arrangements and to introduce regulations in relation to intermediaries. If the Minister was genuinely interested in protecting the insurance industry he would insist on having these matters completed during this term.  It is not the Minister's intention to do so.  What does he regard as the estimated losses by the insurers in the general insurance area for this year and has he any solution whereby he might make them ready to take on board the freedom of services directive which will be coming on stream in a few years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he considers that the latest Central Statistics Office figures for trade, which indicate that in the first ten months of the year, exports have fallen by £535 million below the level for the same period in 1985, give grounds for concern; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The export figures quoted by the Deputy should be put in perspective.  First, the fall he refers to relates to export values only; there has been no reduction in the volume of exports in 1986 to date over the same period in 1985.  Secondly, the full picture for the first ten months of 1986 shows that Ireland's trade surplus reached a record £544.5 million, almost twice the surplus for the corresponding period last year.  Thirdly, the latest trade figures for 1986 reveal that October was the sixth month in a row during which Ireland's trade was in surplus.</P>
      <P>I would, of course, like to see even better performances.  The fact of the matter is that the decline in the value of exports was due primarily to external factors &mdash; the decline in the value of sterling and the US dollar and the slower than expected pick-up in world demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can say, however, that CTT have launched a major initiative to help indigenous exporters direct their efforts to reap more fully the benefits in European markets arising from the favourable value of the Irish pound against EMS currencies.  Three hundred firms have already committed themselves to taking part in the campaign.  This initiative is <Col N="883" /> supplemental to CTT's existing full range of services to exporters.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful of better prospects for exports in 1987 resulting from these efforts and from a better world trade environment generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the value of exports declined by 6 per cent in the first ten months of this year and that in October of this year the export of office machines and computers was well down on the same period last year and that this would indicate a falling off in the high-tech area?  Does the Minister not regard this as being somewhat disturbing?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There is a decline in the value of exports but there is not a decline in the volume.  The principal reason is that people who have contracts into the UK and US are getting less because of the weak dollar and weak sterling.  In the hardware side of the electronics industry, that is true.  From the phenomanally high rates of export from 1981 to 1984 in hardware electronics there has been a decline but that is in line with what is happening all over the world.</P>

      <P>Section 3 of this Bill enables the Minister of the day to make regulations permitting building societies to advance bridging finance.  I understand that the building societies are unhappy with the broadness of the section.  They feel that the powers the Minister is taking are too broad simply to enable them to advance bridging finance but that is not the point with which I am concerned.  What I am concerned with is that nowhere in this Bill is there power taken by the Minister to control the rates <Col N="972" /> being charged by the building societies. In fact, in one particular section the Minister specifically excludes himself from controlling such rates.  That is the section we are talking about at present.  In this section it says that the Minister may make conditions other than conditions in relation to the rate of interest chargeable on a loan.  If we are serious about controlling and regulating the activities of the building societies the question of the rates they charge is one of the key areas with which we should be concerned.</P>
      <P>It seems extraordinary that in the Bill before us the Minister is not taking that power and that in relation to the advancing of bridging loans is specifically excluding himself from taking power to control interest rates.  If one were to ask any persons who have a mortgage what was their greatest concern about building societies they would say that it is the amount of money which they have to pay out every month and the substantially increased amount of money which they are going to have to pay out from now on as a result of an arbitrary increase in rates by the building societies.  That is the reason I have tabled this amendment.  It is to delete the proposal that the Minister may not take power to control the rates the building societies may charge on a bridging loan or other types of loans &mdash; power which he might be able to give them under this section as it stands.  After all the hullabaloo about this Bill and the row kicked up by the building societies and by the Minister about what he was and was not going to do to trim their sails it is extraordinary that the Minister is excluding himself specifically from controlling the interest rates the societies will charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to accept either of these amendments.  Their effect would be to assign to the Minister of the day direct control over the rates being charged by building societies.  As the House knows that would be contrary to the long established policy of successive <Col N="973" /> Governments and contrary to the practice which has been engaged in normally in relation to financial institutions.  If these amendments were to be accepted the effect could be to seriously undermine savers' confidence in the building societies in that they might feel that the Government of the day might for whatever reason move to control rates.  What one must hope for is that the societies will act responsibility and cast their rates in accordance with the market forces rather than in any other way.</P>
      <P>Were the House to accept these amendments it would mean that the building societies would be put in a different position <i>vis-à-vis</i> their competitors in the deposit market.  It has been long established and a practice accepted by the House in different debates in relation to the societies that it would not be in the best interests were the Government to seek to control directly the rates of interest being charged.</P>

      <P>I have to disagree with the Minister.  The amendment in no way tries to restrict the market forces.  It would require a much more extensive Bill and a much larger change of face in this House to achieve that kind of amendment. What my amendment seeks to do is simply to exclude the Minister's own statement in the Bill that he can make conditions for the advancing of bridging loans other than in relation to the rates being charged.  As the legislations stands there is no obligation on the Minister to make any conditions in relation to the advancing of loans.  If he so chooses he does not have to introduce any conditions whatsoever.  Simply by deleting the proposal I am talking about the Minister would have the option that if at some time in the future the building societies were acting in a way which he or the Government of the day considered to be contrary to the common good, he would have the power to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;, that he wanted to restrict the rates they were charging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 9, which is being discussed with this amendment, would give the Minister the power to set conditions in relation to the rate of interest being <Col N="974" /> charged by a building society on a loan. It is not a power which he would have to use.  Presumably, it would not be a power which a Fine Gael Minister or perhaps a Fianna Fáil Minister would want to use but it is quite conceivable that conditions may arise in the future where the existence of such a power alone would encourage the building societies to act responsibility and not dip their hands too deeply into the pockets of the people who have mortgages with them.</P>
    <P>I press this amendment because there is no reason the Minister should not accept it.  There is no obligation on him to operate it if he does not wish to do so, but it would be an important power for the Minister, the Government or any future Government to have.  This is the least this House can do when householders are faced with massive mortgage increases over the next few weeks.  If we are to be seen as being relevant to what is happening or to have any control over running this country, this is the least we can do in relation to the building societies. At the end of the day the question is: who runs the country, the financial institutions or this House?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The most important power the Minister has under the section is that he may prescribe conditions and the types of loans, secured or unsecured, which the societies may from time to time be allowed to offer.  If there were to be widespread abuse by certain societies of the powers which might be extended to them by a Minister from time to time by regulation made under this section, it would be open to the Minister to amend the regulations or, perhaps, to withdraw the facility made available to the society to advance that type of loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their submission on the Government discussion document the Irish Building Societies Association said: &ldquo;There is no reason why this finance should not be offered within the building society system and at a substantial cost saving to the housebuyer.&rdquo;  In that connection they were referring to bridging finance.  I do not want to enter into a wider discussion of the section, but it is wrong for the <Col N="975" /> Deputy to suggest that this section is included to allow the societies to make available loans for bridging finance purposes. The section, as drafted, allows the Minister to make regulations after consultation with the Minister for Finance and the registrar in relation to different categories of loans for different purposes which the societies might be allowed make available to their members.</P>
    <P>I indicated that it was my intention that bridging finance should be the first of those facilities which might be made available to the societies, that I would carefully monitor how the societies would operate that new power and that, in turn, would influence any further regulation or extension of the range of loans which might be made available by the societies. In that way the Minister has adequate control mechanisms available to him.  For the reasons I gave in my initial reply, I do not think it would be prudent to accept these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very interesting to note that in the first response the Minister makes to the first amendment to this legislation, he does a complete climb down on all the reasons he gave for the introduction of this legislation.  This legislation was introduced as part of a posturing by the Minister.  He said what he was going to do with the building societies; he said they had been big bad boys who were misbehaving and that he, Mr. John Boland, TD, Minister for the Environment, was going to control them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday many mortgage holders were told they would have an extra 3 per cent to pay.  This happened since rates could not be controlled because of market forces.  Market forces have caused this 3 per cent increase.  These market forces are the direct result of the mismanagement of the economy by this Government.  Because of this mismanagement we have a current budget deficit of nearly £1,500 million.  These market forces are the reason Government borrowing is running at £24 billion. Approximately 250,000 people are <Col N="976" /> unemployed and more than 10,000 people are emigrating &mdash; the flower of our youth literally walking the streets of London, New York and the cities of Australia.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the Minister's first contribution on Committee Stage was that he was not taking any power onto himself to control these market forces.  I accept that.  I believe it would not be possible.  I agree with the Minister's position on the amendment proposed by The Workers' Party, because as well as the mortgage holders we all want to protect, we must also protect the interests of the one million savers in building societies.  We cannot control the interests rate paid by mortgage holders without affecting the interest rate being paid to savers, the ration between savers and mortgage holders being 7:1.  I accept the Minister's position on this.</P>
    <P>It would be nice if this were possible, but it would depend on the type of society in which we lived where everything was controlled, but we do not live in such a society.  We live by choice in a society where there are regulations but not total control.  If the Irish people at some future stage wish to go for total left wing ideology, that will be a different kettle of fish but, as long as market forces prevail, the rights of the savers have to be protected. It was interesting that in his first response on Committee Stage the Minister recognised the limitations and the powers he has as Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned my reference to the fact that this section proposed to enable building societies to advance bridging finance.  I made the point that I understood the section was broader than that, but I understood that was his primary purpose in introducing this section into the Bill.  I am aware that the section is broader than that and that there may be other forms of finance which, under regulation, the Minister may allow them to engage in, but that is not the point of my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point of my amendment is that the Minister should have power in relation to <Col N="977" /> the advancing of bridging finance and, under section 9, in relation to the rates chargeable by the building societies in general, and that he should have power to control those rates.  I wish it were possible to introduce left wing ideology by a simple amendment like this &mdash; it would make life very easy &mdash; but it is not.  This is far from being a left wing ideological proposal.  The proposal is simply that the Minister should not deny himself the right to control interests rates if he feels or his Government or any future Government feel it necessary to do so.  I want to remind the House that this Government operated price control until very recently.  When price control was abolished the Fianna Fáil Party shouted loudest about its abolition.  Price control is an interference in the market mechanism.  There can be all sorts of debates as to how effective it was or was not.  I know that, for instance, the Consumers Association of Ireland are quite concerned about the manner in which prices have been affected as a result of the abolition of price control. What I am talking about here is simply that the Minister should not exclude himself from having the power to control rates if he or his Government so wish and that, under the provisions of amendment No. 9, they would have that power if they wished to exercise it in relation to interest rates in general.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is unreasonable.  I do not think anybody other than the wildest of right wing Tories, or radical Tories as they like to call themselves nowdays, on which sections of the Fine Gael Party like to model themselves, would argue for complete and unbridled competition in any area of life because it has been shown to lead to the most atrocious abuses and poverty in many areas.  This Government, in line with their declared social democratic image &mdash; in relation to bridging loans or other types of loans the Minister may decide should be allocated by a building society &mdash; should retain the right to control interest rates when necessary.  Furthermore, in relation to the provisions of amendment No.9, they should take the power to control the rates <Col N="978" /> building societies will charge in the future.  That is a reasonable request: there is nothing extraordinarily radical about it.  It has been done in other areas of life.  There are restrictions all over the place on the free market here and in other capitalist countries.  This is not seeking to introduce anything more than price control in another form.</P>
    <P>For that reason I would urge the Minister to accept the amendment and urge the Fianna Fáil Party to support it.  There is much screaming and shouting when a building society announces a mortgage rate increase, yet when there is an opportunity afforded under the provisions of this Bill to give power to the Minister to control those rates, or at least have that power hanging over the building societies, I find it extraordinary that the Government on one side and the Fianna Fáil Party on the other refuse to grasp that opportunity.  I find it inexplicable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opening remarks on the introduction of the Bill I outlined its purposes.  I said they were to deal with a number of matters relating to the operations of building societies which have given rise to some dissatisfaction with the societies on the part of the general public while, at the same time, enabling societies to expand their services by permitting them for the first time to engage in lending other than by way of mortgage.  That is the basic purpose of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time I went on to criticise the level of increase that had recently been announced.  I still adhere to those views. I was asked in public several times in relation to those increases whether I envisaged taking on the power, on behalf of the Government, directly to control interest rates.  I said clearly at that time that would not be my intention.  It is appropriate, as the Bill provides for it in a later section, to deal with the vexed question of tiered interest rates.  In relation to rates chargeable generally, rates on offer to depositors, I do not <Col N="979" /> consider it would be prudent to endeavour to control that end of the market when financial institutions do not have the rates which they offer controlled by them.  It would distort the market unnecessarily.  We must take into account the fact that building societies constitute an important instrument in housing policy and in the provision of housing finance.  What this Bill seeks to do is to control some aspects of the operations of building societies which have given cause for concern among the general public for a number of years.</P>
    <P>In relation to interest rates generally, I repeat the views I expressed some weeks ago when the building societies announced the scale of the increase, that it was my belief that sanity and reason would return to the financial market place in a relatively short space of time and that by early in the New Year we would see a sharp reduction again in interest rates charged generally, not just by building societies but in the financial marketplace &mdash; rates on offer and rates charged.  I felt it was particularly unfortunate and inappropriate that the level of rate increase &mdash; which was led by one society and in relation to which others followed &mdash; was pitched at the level it was.  I know a number of the other building societies were not happy with the level of that increase.  Be that as it may, it would not be prudent for me or the House to react to the intemperate size of that increase by being intemperate enough in return to take on the control of interest rates generally, which is what these two amendments seek to do.  It is a little disingenuous of the Deputy to say he is merely suggesting the exclusion of this set of words.  Implicit in the acceptance of the exclusion is the acceptance of the inclusion and I am not prepared to accept the inclusion of those powers for the reasons I have given.  It is perhaps inappropriate to speculate as to which of the other speakers the Deputy was referring to when he began to draw political comparisons with radical Tories and other groupings in this House.  In relation to all of these ideological matters I should <Col N="980" /> prefer &mdash; as I have endeavoured to do in the Houses over quite a number of years &mdash; to rely instead on pragmatism and common sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>We could enter into a nice debate on ideology, pragmatism and what they are but I do not propose to enter into such debate at this stage.</P>
      <P>I hope I did not give the impression of being disingenuous.  If the Minister says I did I accept that I may have but it was not intended.  My point in relation to section 3 is that the Minister is specifically excluding himself from having the power to control the rates on bridging finance or other kinds of finance that the building societies may be enabled to advance under the provisions of that section.  The Minister, in specifically doing that, is denying himself the power.  The deletion of the words I propose to delete leaves it open to him to control rates if he or his Government so desire, taking all of the circumstances into account.  In any event amendment No. 9 seeks to give the Minister power to control interest rates, again, if he so desires.  It is not mandatory on him to do so.  It is a question of the circumstances prevailing at any given time, so that he have the power if required.</P>
      <P>In one sense the Minister has strengthened my case in his last remarks about the panic reaction on the part of the building societies in recent months in relation to world financial markets, that it is his belief that in the New Year interest rates will level off, that in his view there was no need for them to apply the increases they did.  Surely it makes sense that, if the Minister had power to control interest rates he could, at the same time as expressing his view, say to the building societies: &ldquo;Look, I have this power to control these rates if I choose and, unless you agree either to a reasonable increase or none, depending on the circumstances, then I will use that power&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should the hundreds of thousands of mortgage holders of this State be subject to the vagaries and panic of directors, comprised of a clique of people who run <Col N="981" /> these building societies virtually as private enterprise companies?  Presumably the Minister has a wider view of world markets and the way the economy is developing or not developing and therefore he should have the power to say that an increase should not be more than 1 per cent, 2 per cent of 3 per cent.  It is not unreasonable to ask the Minister to take that power.  If Deputies refuse to accept this amendment, surely they are displaying the phoniness engaged in a month ago when everybody was shouting about the poor mortgage holders who were being held to ransom by the big bad building societies and we had to do something about them.  Now when we have the opportunity to do something about them, we funk it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take up the last unparliamentary comment made by Deputy De Rossa.  I ask him to clarify how he would see his amendment operating? If we give to any Minister the right to control the interest rates at which a building society can loan money, we also give him the right to control the deposit rates.  I do now know whether he would like to see a society where both controls would prevail.  If building societies were operating in isolation in the money market, I could see some merit in what Deputy De Rossa seeks to achieve.  He knows as well as I do that in the free society in which we live that is not the position.  However insulting he may appear towards building societies &mdash; I am not here to defend building societies &mdash; they can provide an attractive proposition to any worker who wishes to invest any surplus money he may have and get a dividend from it.  I do not see anything anti-society in the service which they give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If as a result of people depositing moneys we have a situation &mdash; and there is plenty of evidence of it &mdash; which is in direct opposition to that which obtains in countries in the east, and people can have attractive homes built almost to their own specification, surely that is desirable rather than having the situation which obtains in other countries which I visited <Col N="982" /> where people live in boxes &mdash; chest-of-drawer living I call it.  I have not come across any worker in a eastern country who could afford the type of house which we have here.  Where is socialism in that? What are we hoping to achieve by introducing controls on deposits and loans? People would be forced to live like people in countries with those controls.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why anybody who is seeking a loan should have to seek a bridging loan.  Local authorities and building societies should be able to provide loans when approval is given. Deputy De Rossa cannot make a case against the situation that obtains in our country.  Nobody is forced to put money on deposit with a building society.  People have been encouraged to do so and as a result they have helped their neighbours to invest in attractive houses.  They could not have done so if this scheme did not operate.  I reject the right of any Minister to control interest rates on loans in the same fashion as I would reject his controlling the rates at which deposits are made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the views of my colleague, Deputy Jim Tunney.  It was interesting to hear the Minister again trotting out his hoary old chestnut of the big bad wolf of one society leading the way with an announcement and the innocents in the remaining societies, despite their best wishes, having to follow in regard to an increase in interest rates. The reality which is well known is that the increase in interest rates is not a result of any of the societies, of their own free will, wanting to increase them.  It is a result of the market forces which the Minister spoke about, the market forces caused by the Government and the mishandling of the finances of the State by the Government.  That is what has driven interest rates up not only for mortgage holders but for all sections of the community. Interest rates are now over four times the rate of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister's prediction that interest rates will drop soon after Christmas is accurate.  However, it does <Col N="983" /> not seem to be borne out by the predictions of Coopers &amp; Lybrand and other organisations who are predicting that the present rates of interest will continue because of the mismanagement of the economy.  Far from being a panic reaction of the societies, as the Minister described it, it is a reaction brought about because of the market place in which they have to operate to get in funds so that they can lend them on to people who want to buy houses.</P>
    <P>As a result of the introduction of DIRT the Government have chased over £1,500 million out of this country.  That has had a traumatic effect on the flow of funds to building societies.  They are not in a position &mdash; and the Minister recognises this when he talks about market forces &mdash; to sit back and offer to investors a rate of interest which is lower than that of their competitors.  They need funds from investors so that they can lend that money to people who want to buy houses.  It is interesting to look at the size and the scale of the organisations with which we are dealing.</P>
    <P>Recently fact sheets were made available on the societies and the membership of the four larger societies, the Irish Permanent Building Society, the First National Building Society, the Educational Building Society and the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  For the year ending 1985 their total assets amounted to £2,638 million with 932,000 investors and 135,000 borrowers.  The money which is made available on loan to those people does not belong to the building societies; it belongs to the people who invest with the building societies at competitive interest rates.  The investors, numbering in excess of one million, make their money available so that 135,000 people can have a roof over their heads. It is worth reflecting on that figure.  It was wrong to describe the reactions of the societies as panic or to create the impression, like Deputy De Rossa, that by the stroke of a pen it is possible to restrict the mortgage rate.  It is wrong to convey the impression that the mortgage rate can be restricted in isolation from <Col N="984" /> the investment rate.  I wonder if Deputy De Rossa is aware that life is not like that.  I disagree with the view of Deputy De Rossa that we were prepared, to use what Deputy Tunney described as an unparliamentary word, to funk the opportunity to trot behind him in support of his vote-catching amendment.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's amendment reads well and, undoubtedly, it will read well in the handouts of The Workers' Party.  I have no doubt that those handouts will try to portray how well The Workers' Party TDs tried to defend mortgage holders. We are here to defend mortgage holders and we are doing that by trying to change the Government and bring in an administration that will create an economic climate that will lead to interest rates falling to European levels.  There is little point in Deputy De Rossa posturing and telling us that by tabling his amendment he will be stopping interest rates going any higher for mortgage holders.  That is not the way life is.  I am sorry the Minister got back to the hoary old chestnut of creating the impression that when one society lead the way others are dragged behind them.  That is not the position, and the Minister knows that.</P>

      <P>I am arguing for the right of the Minister to control interest rates if he, or his successors, choose to do so in whatever circumstances may arise in the future.  That could arise tomorrow.  Unfortunately, those who have spoken against this amendment have painted the picture of the choice being between unbridled rate increases by building societies in response to what they perceive to be the market conditions or what Deputy Tunney sees as a totally unsatisfactory housing stock such as he saw in eastern Europe.  It is not that simple.  The State has all types of controls on the free market forces that operate here.  The simplest comparison is price control which we had up to recently. The country did not become a socialist State or a socialist society in the years when price control existed.  The introduction of price control represented an attempt by a free market government to control the free market in such a way that those who sought to make excessive profits at the expense of the common citizen were controlled.</P>
      <P>I presume the Minister, and his successors, will control interest rates if given the power, in the same way that price controls operated, as a means of preventing excessive profit-making and profit-taking by the building societies.  The building societies like to portray themselves as non-profit organisations or as mutual societies acting in the interest of the savers and mortgage holders but building societies in 1985 made a profit of £30 million.  They may not describe that as profit but as a surplus.  Nevertheless, it represents a profit on the amount they took in from investors and lent out.  In a bookkeeping sense they made a profit of £30 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The building societies will argue they need that money but the Minister and the Government have a wider responsibility than to the investors or mortgage holders of any company or building society.  The ordinary man and woman in the street <Col N="986" /> have to pay interest to create those large profits.  It is for that reason I am suggesting that the Minister should have this power.  He should be able to control excessive mortgage rates.  Deputies Tunney and Burke are arguing the Minister's case very well but it is not a choice between dropping interest rates on the diktat of the Minister and, therefore, affecting the income investors may get from building societies.  It is a question of ensuring in our type of economy that no company or building society has the free power to exploit at will mortgage holders or anybody else who has to avail of their services.  The Minister should have power to control the activities of building societies.  Where necessary, he should be able to control their interest rates.  There is nothing revolutionary involved in that.</P>
    <P>Those who are referring to the power building societies have and the way mortgage holders are at the mercy of building societies but refuse to support this amendment should in future keep their mouths closed when the issue of building societies increasing their interest rates unreasonably comes up again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Deputy for his advice which was interesting. The various provisions of the Bill do more in real terms to help and protect the interests of the borrower than the Deputy's amendment.  That amendment could have most serious consequences for the long term viability of societies. Implicit in it is an effort to assign to Government greater power, the power to control interest rates on the financial markets generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection I suspect the Deputy has taken the opportunity of the passage of this Bill to express views which he might feel more at home expressing in relation to legislation dealing with the Central Bank or on a Finance Bill.  The amendment would have as much relevance if the Deputy had sought to assign to me the power to control international interest rates or the value of sterling on the London market.  The Deputy obviously has unlimited confidence in my <Col N="987" /> ability to be able to interpret the most appropriate rates that might be charged in the context of Irish market conditions. The simple fact is that we are an open economy and despite all the political statements we have heard this afternoon, our interest rates are affected extraordinarily by the prevailing rates in our nearest neighbouring country.  If a Government were to seek to control interest rates here in regard to societies it could only do so after consideration of the rates payable on the London money market and we all know how ridiculous a proposition that would be.  There is no point in a Government taking on powers which they could not exercise in the way the Deputy presumes.</P>

    <P>(5) The Registrar may, at any time as circumstances may demand, revoke a direction under subsection (4) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This provides for a situation where, following the making of regulations by a Minister allowing for certain types of loans to be made available by societies, the registrar is of the opinion that the making of those loans not secured by a mortgage may be prejudicial to the ordinary regulation of building society business.  That would confer on the registrar the power to issue a direction to the society prohibiting and restricting the society in making loans under section 3 (1), that is, loans other than those secured by way of a mortgage.  The registrar would be able to invoke that power where he considered it expedient to do so, or where a society had carried on business in a manner prejudicial to the regulations. The criteria of orderly and proper regulation are referred to a number of times in the 1976 Act from which the registrar would take a particular interpretation.</P>

      <P>It is always somewhat dangerous to provide illustrations, as I have discovered to my cost.

      <P>Here we come to the interesting powers the Minister is taking unto himself, the purpose for which loans can be made.  This is apparently designed specifically to enable the societies to provide bridging loans.  But the Minister himself does not specify this in the section. He merely gives himself powers in relation to loans.  I am anxious that bridging finance would be included as distinct from the manner in which the Minister has it drafted at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I find this suggestion somewhat extraordinary.  The building societies generally have been expressing a great interest in being allowed to carry on other activities and engage in the provision of a wider range of services than they have been confined to traditionally. I indicated several times that I considered the making available of bridging finance for house purchase purposes a most suitable addition that might be taken on by building societies.  Societies generally have been calling to be allowed make other type of loans available as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I had the Bill drafted I considered it more appropriate that the section should be cast wide enough to allow the Minister to make regulations from time to time with regard to the types of loans, secured or unsecured, which might be made available by societies so that, if it was felt that the societies were in a position to do so, the Minister could progressively expand the range of loans which societies might make available.  I had in mind in particular that the initial loans to be considered would be home related loans of one sort or another.  It was indicated to me that societies were interested in becoming involved in <Col N="990" /> making loans available for other purposes relatively far removed from the broad definition of home related.  I am taken aback to discover that some societies are now saying they wish to be confined merely to the making available of bridging finances.  This seems to be totally at odds with all of the previous submissions made by the societies generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has clarified that because if it is as broad as the Minister is now outlining, I see no difficulty whatsoever and would welcome it.  It is important that the societies should be in a position to offer loans on items other than homes.  The societies are such a major financial arm of the State now that they have a role to play in the development of the State.  I, therefore, go along with the section as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that at a recent meeting which I had with the non-IBSA societies they outlined the range of loans and I asked them to indicate in descending order of priority the types of loans they were primarily interested in.  I am in broad agreement with their scale of preferences.  It would be unnecessarily restrictive and unfortunate if the House were to confine the Minister to the power to make regulations to extend the additional activities of the societies only to this area of bridging finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take if from what the Minister has said that he recognises the flexibility of the societies and the options that should be available to them to ensure they can operate to their maximum potential and compete with the other financial institutions.  I hope the Minister and future Ministers will make regulations to ensure that the other services and facilities can be made available through building societies in competition with the other institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the primary effects of this section, if it is used wisely, will be to allow the societies, by engaging in a wider range of loan activity, to make sufficient money to more than offset any <Col N="991" /> loss of income they might experience as a result of the implementation of some of the provisions in later sections which are designed to protect the borrower, particularly at the time of purchase.  I am totally at a loss today to discover that in a very recent submission made by IBSA they have suggested that this section should be amended so as to confine the right of the Minister to extend their powers solely to bridging finance. Yet in a response which they made in May of this year to the Government's discussion document on building societies, whilst they spoke about bridging finance, they also went on to suggest that home improvement loans were another area where the interest rates charged by banks were particularly heavy.  They said that the building societies would be happy to offer similar finance at a substantial reduction on the banks' interest rate. Now it seems as if for some reason the IBSA societies want to confine themselves solely to bridging finance.  In the context of legislation and the making of subsequent regulations I do not think that would be appropriate now.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 6 is relevant, Deputy Burke.  If <Col N="993" /> the House is agreed, amendments Nos. 5 and 6 can be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No, amendment No. 6 is different.  I will take amendment No. 5 on its own.  It is dealing with section 4.</P>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister is walking into a situation where he says that he is against tiered rates because that is increasing interest rates on some mortgage holders. Working on the assumption that by removing tiered rates or premium rates all loans will be brought down to the level of the low interest rate or standard interest rate, our worry and concern on this side of the House are that by removing the premium rate, rather than reducing all rates down to the lowest you will have an equalisation up from the lower interest rates and the lower interest rates will be increased.  We are not prepared on this side of the House to accept that threat and we want this amendment written into the Bill so that the effect of the removing of the premium rates will not be that the lowest rate will be increased on mortgage holders.</P>
      <P>The Minister works on the basis that tiered rates are unique to the building society movement, but all financial institutions use systems of tiered interest rates.  For example, banks charge at least three different rates to their A, AA and AAA customers and in such case the effect is that the smaller the borrower the higher the interest charge.  As a consequence, small domestic bank borrowers tend to subsidise large commercial and industrial borrowers.  The reverse happens with the building societies.  They charge a tiered rate to the high borrower, the large borrower, who is subsidising the man on the standard mortgage.  My worry and the concern of Fianna Fáil are that in removing the tiered rate the Minister will increase the mortgage interest rate for those on the standard mortgage.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that, apart from any other considerations, the amendment in the form presented would have no real effect.  I must point out that the term &ldquo;premium rate&rdquo; for example, <Col N="994" /> occurs nowhere else in the Bill.  Furthermore, I do think the House can legislate that the effect of A, B and C will not be D.  I do not think the amendment could reasonably be included in the Bill for those reasons if not for others.</P>
      <P>The only practicable way to give effect to what the Deputy is seeking would be to have accepted the amendment proposed by Deputy De Rossa earlier which would give the Minister power to control interest rates, and this amendment in another form seems to be suggesting that very course of action which the Deputy has rather categorically turned down and rejected on behalf of his party already. As I mentioned when speaking on section 3, the Bill is well balanced.  The intention of the Bill is to ensure that the additional powers to advance loans which might be made available to societies under section 3 would enable them to make sufficient additional &ldquo;profits&rdquo;&mdash; societies are not expected to make profits as such &mdash; sufficient additional surplus in order to offset any reduction in income which might be experienced through any of the later provisions.</P>
      <P>For a long number of years now the largest of the societies traditionally have not operated tiered interest rates, yet that has not in any way inhibited them from both growing to the size they are today and offering their loans generally at the basic rate.  As I mentioned on Second Stage, the trends in other places have been away from tiered rates and I would have hoped that at this time, bearing in mind the market conditions and the likelihood of additional competition moving into the Irish home loan market, the trend would have been away from tiered rates generally rather than towards them.  For that reason I thought it appropriate to introduce section 4 into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me point out to the House that the surplus which building societies have, rather than profits, after meeting their outgoings by way of interest payments and their investments and their management expenses including advertising, is reflected by way of increased reserves. It is important that the societies keep their reserves at a reasonably high level, <Col N="995" /> but it seems through close examination of some of the expenses incurred by the societies that by judicious application of the extended provisions of section 3, the societies will be more than in a position, assuming prudent management, to meet any opportunities which this or subsequent sections may bring about for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister will not accept this amendment because I have no doubt that the proposal in the bald terms in which it is made by the Minister to abolish the tiered interest rates will have the effect of driving up the interest rates for the small borrower and lowering them for the largest borrower. That is not something we want to see achieved in this House.  That is asking the small man on the standard rate to subsidise the interest rate of the fellow who can afford a £60,000 or a £70,000 mortgage.  I do not support that.  Whether he likes it or not, that will be the effect of the Minister's decision.  Unless the Minister can guarantee that will not happen I am going to push this amendment to a vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very apprehensive about giving illustrations but there has been no uniformity or sanity in the way in which the tiered rate has developed over the years.  The tiered rate regime is very unfair mainly to the average house purchaser.  Two of the larger societies have until recently traditionally operated without any tiered rate and they have been very successful.  Three societies have commenced their tiered rates at loans above £20,000 while one of the main societies commence their tiered rate on loans above £21,000.  Two further societies commence tiering at £25,000. The average loan is £24,000 and loans taken out by people on relatively modest incomes are often above that level.  Considering that fact, it is obvious that certain societies are operating a tiered rate at a level below that of the average loan.  One society operates a premium rate of 1½ per cent above the standard for loans in the <Col N="996" /> range of £20,000 to £25,000.  Two other societies have a similar premium on loans from £25,001 in one case and £26,001 in another case, up to £30,001.  Those illustrations clearly show the discriminatory treatment of house purchasers. Bearing in mind that the average house purchaser has little choice when he goes to take out a home loan because he will have been saving with a society for a number of years and has little option but to seek to obtain his home loan from them it is obvious that the tiered rate is unfair as it often commences at a level below the average loan and at a premium of as much as 1½ per cent above the basic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious the Minister is not prepared to accept our amendment. The Minister knows that it is not possible to have a stable financial rate of interest for money at any level.  If the tiered rates are abolished people borrowing the smaller amounts will be asked to carry those who can afford a bigger loan.  That is obvious discrimination against the less well off.  I question the Minister's figure of £24,000 being an average loan.  All the loans which the building societies give are not for house purchase.  They are often for renovations or extensions to existing houses.  The average loan would be in the region of £20,000.</P>
      <P>I am surprised at the Minister's failure to grasp the principle of the building society movement.  The Minister talked about people having to deal with one society in order to get a loan.  If one wants financial stability, to encourage savings and to create a situation where loans are available, there must be some system that will protect the institution.  Surely the Minister would not agree that people investing in building societies should be able to withdraw their money overnight and move somewhere else and create total disruption in the financial markets.</P>
      <P>The Minister must accept our amendment or give us a firm guarantee that those on the bottom rate will not in effect have to carry those on the upper end of the market. The Minister should recognise that the associated banks, the Housing</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> Finance Agency and the local authorities all have a fixed tiered rate.  We have the 12 per cent rate and the 9¾ per cent rate which are fixed rates.  That could be termed discrimination against the people who borrowed at 12 per cent who would like to have their money at 9¾ per cent. At the moment in some cases farmers are paying 5½ per cent while in other cases they are paying 17 per cent to financial institutions and banks.  Unless the Minister can give a clear guarantee to protect the people at the lower end of the market, we will have to press this amendment.</P>
    <P>We should remember that there are one million investors in the building society movement, that there are about one million people living in houses mortgaged to the building societies.  The Minister should recognise that fact and the fact that every other institution operates a tiered interest rate.  He should give us a clear guarantee that the people at the lower end of the market will not have to carry those who can offord to pay the rates.  The Minister must recognise that in order to get funds to the building societies they must be able to pay a tiered deposit interest rate on investments.  In order to protect the liquidity of the societies they must lend at a tiered rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot do more than again refer to the most recent discussion I had with a number of societies.  It was made clear to me that if a reasonable extension of their lending powers were made available under section 3 the increased income which that would generate would offset or more than offset whatever reductions to the income they might experience as a result of the provisions of this and subsequent sections. The tiered interest rate regime has no logic or sanity to it.  The tiering starts in different societies at different levels and involves different premium sums.  The most telling thing of all is that the two societies who represent 60 per cent of the entire mortgage market have traded with considerable success over many years without ever having to resort to the introduction of tiered rates.  If those societies who have shown their ability to grow on <Col N="998" /> the basis of charging a single rate to their borrowers can do so successfully there is no reason why other societies cannot adjust their operations so as to make all their loans available at the basic rate.</P>
      <P>In the context of the most recent discussion which I had with that group of societies, I am quite satisfied that the overall provisions of the Bill will strengthen the building society movement and ensure that the borrowers will have removed from them, particularly at the time of purchase and also on other occasions, additional charges which they find objectionable and unacceptable.  The provisions of the Bill should have no effect on the basic rate charged to borrowers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister on two occasions referred to recent meetings he had with societies outside the IBSA and who are not members of that association. He considers that their views should be the final word in the building society movement.  It is interesting to note that the major member is also a subsidiary of the Bank of Ireland, a bank which charges tiered interest rates.  Indeed, their entry to the building society movement has distorted investment patterns within building societies.  The Minister also said that the building societies represented 60 per cent of mortgage holders who are not charged tiered rates.  That, of course, was pre-DIRT and the distortion it has had on the inflow of funds to the societies.  We will not oppose the Minister's decision in regard to tiered rates if he can guarantee that the person with a mortgage of £80,000 or £100,000, for which he or she is charged a tiered rate, will not be subsidised by the person who has a mortgage of £20,000 or £25,000.  If tiered rates are to be introduced, the interest rates should not be pushed up for the small borrower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the fact that building societies who never charged tiered rates have now changed their policy as a result of the introduction of DIRT.  I presume he is referring to the larger society in particular because, of <Col N="999" /> the two I mentioned, only one sought to change their policies in relation to borrowers in recent months.  The Deputy is quite wrong.  At a meeting which I had with IBSA members, we were informed that the largest society had taken a decision six or seven years ago to impose tiered interest rates on their borrowers. That was an extant board decision which had not been implemented over the past six or seven years because of the policy of management not to charge tiered interest rates to borrowers.  However, they informed us that in recent times the management had decided to implement the board decision taken some years ago.</P>
      <P>That, of course, raises the most serious question in relation specifically to those who borrowed from the society between the taking of the board decision and the announcement by the society of their intention to impose tiered interest rates on their existing borrowers.  It shows quite clearly that, while the society have traded very successfully during that period and expanded their activities, they had taken a decision &mdash; on the information made available at the meeting which took place between the IBSA members and civil servants from my Department, the Department of Finance and myself &mdash; at board level six or seven years ago to introduce tiered rates but had not implemented it until late summer this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is incredible and unacceptable <Col N="1000" /> and, when one compares the performance of the society, during that period and earlier, with the board decision one can only speculate that it is quite clear the society did not need tiered rates during that period.  Building societies in Britain have removed the practice of charging tiered interest rates over the past few years and all the indications are that increased competition in the home loan market will make the charging of tiered interest rates impossible for any society in the foreseeable future because of market forces.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill are balanced and additional incomes will be available to societies which respond properly, employ proper management techniques, technology and marketing strategies. They will be in a position to gain sufficient additional income from the extension of their powers under section 3 to more than offset any change in their income pattern resulting from the provisions of this or subsequent sections of the Bill.  I have no hesitation in personally guaranteeing that I am satisfied that societies which operate under a proper management structure will not suffer any reduction in their surplus as a result of the implementation of the Bill.  I cannot, of course, give the House any undertaking in relation to the management performance of any individual society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1003" /> In page 4, subsection (1), line 1, after &ldquo;Registrar&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;and provided that any consequent loss of income to the Societies will not be passed on by way of increased interest charges to mortgage holders&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 6 (1) reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, after consultation with the Registrar, prescribe rules in respect of any one or more of the following matters, either generally or by reference to a specified class or classes of rules or societies, denoted by reference to such matters as the Minister may consider appropriate:</P>
    <P>(a)  the prohibiting or restricting of the charging of redemption fees;</P>
    <P>(b)  the making available to a member to whom a loan is to be made of the report made under section 79 (1) (b) of the Principal Act relating to the value of any security for the loan;</P>
    <P>(c)  removing or restricting the right of a society to require a member to effect insurance on any security for a loan with an insurer directed by the society;</P>
    <P>(d)  precluding or restricting a society from requiring a member to pay its costs of legal investigation of title to any such security; and</P>
    <P>(e)  the arranging by a society through an insurer nominated by it for the provision of mortgage protection insurance.</P>
    <P>We can live with these provisions but have reservations regarding paragraph (a) which deals with the prohibition or restriction of the charging of redemption fees.  The argument is made that this will mean greater movement of members from one society to another and will have a detrimental effect on societies generally. However, as far as the common good is concerned, I go along with it.</P>
    <P>As in the previous amendment, I want to ensure that in removing the charging of redemption fees, whatever losses the societies incur resulting from these changes in their operations will not be passed on to mortgage holders.  I want <Col N="1004" /> this amendment written into the Bill so that mortgage holders will be guaranteed that the loss of income will not be passed to them.  That is the nub of my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how effective it is for me to give any guarantees to the House because in the debate on the last amendment the Deputy said he wanted me to guarantee that the amendment would not have the effect of increasing rates to borrowers generally.  He said if I was not in a position to give that guarantee he would be obliged to call a vote.  I gave the guarantee but he immediately called the vote.</P>
      <P>I understood amendments Nos. 5 and 6 were being discussed together.  The points I wanted to make on amendment No. 6 I have already made on amendment No. 5 but I will go through them again if the Deputy or the House so desire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are writing into the Bill the abolition of the charges and the making available of valuation certificates and changes in the legal fees, I see no reason why we should not also write into the Bill my amendment which will provide that any consequent loss of income to the societies will not be passed on by way of increased interest charges to mortgage holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have explained already I am quite satisfied that a combination of the increased scale of activities which would be made available to the societies by regulations made under section 3, together with a more careful examination of the management expenses incurred by certain societies, will more than offset any loss of income to the societies through engaging in those practices which are regarded &mdash; I think the House generally would accept &mdash; by the public in general as being unacceptable and objectionable.  If Members care to read down the list of items set out in subsection (1) it will be clearly seen that many of these are charges which fall on a borrower either at the time of initial <Col N="1005" /> purchase or redemption of a loan in order to change home and obtain a new loan. For that reason in particular it is important that the costs to be incurred by a borrower at that time should be kept to a minimum.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the additional income which can be generated through the availability of additional loan facilities to the societies &mdash; through ministerial regulations under section 3 &mdash; and a more careful husbanding of the management expenses of societies, so as to ensure that there is still a reasonable level of surplus income over outgoings, will result in there not having to be any additional rate charged to the borrower in any other way.  It would defeat much of the purpose of this section were the societies to engage in the lazy course of finding some other method of passing on these charges to the borrower.  That is not the intention of the section.</P>
      <P>The intention of the section is that it should be read and examined in conjunction with the provisions of the Bill as a whole and in relation to what we are trying to do in regard to the future operation of the Irish building society movement. I am quite satisfied that the operation of the regulations under this section should not have the effect of increasing interest rates to borrowers.  All of what I have said is on the assumption that the management of the societies operate reasonably and in the interests both of their investors and borrowers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be the Minister's intention that the effect of this proposal to abolish redemption charges, the making available of valuations, changes in the insurance option and legal fees will be extra costs to the societies which will be passed on to mortgagees.  But its undoubted effect will be that societies' income will be reduced.  Our fear on this side of the House is that that reduction in income will be passed on to the mortgage holder.  The abolition of redemption charges constitutes an abolition of a source of income to the societies &mdash; at the stroke of a pen by way of ministerial order &mdash; and that reduction must be made <Col N="1006" /> up somewhere else.  I do not want it made up at the expense of mortagage holders.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that if the societies use the provisions of section 3 properly they will be able to increase their income from other areas and operations.  That may be so.  If that is its effect I welcome it.  But I want it written into the provisions of this Bill that people who are redeeming their mortgages, who will be saved a redemption fee as a result of the provisions of this Bill, will not do so at the expense of their neighbours who may have a mortgage with the same society.  I do not want a situation to evolve in which valuation fees will be increased because of bonding and other operations, or because of the implications of the valuation being made available to the mortgage holder.  Those involved say this will increase the fees of valuers and that those increased fees must be passed on to somebody. I do not want to see them being passed on to the mortgage holder.</P>
      <P>The Minister says it is not his intention that that should happen, that it is his intention that the provisions of section 3 would give the societies larger income and that he would hope also for more efficient management of the societies which would save funds.  The only way we can guarantee the direct co-relationship between the abolition of redemption fees, the making available of valuations and so on, is to write into the Bill that it will become the law of the land that the Minister may, after consultation with the registrar and provided that any consequent loss of income to the societies will not be passed on by way of increased interest charges to mortgage holders, prescribe rules in respect of any one or more of the following matters, and so on.  It is vitally important that mortgage holders be protected in this House as far as we can possibly do so.  Consequently I ask the Minister to accept this amendment. It may not be his intention that, in removing redemption fees, he will increase the mortgage interest rate on those remaining within the societies holding mortgages but that will be its undoubted effect.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment in so far as it goes.  Indeed I am slightly surprised that its effect would be much the same as that I was endeavouring to achieve in amendments Nos. 3 and 9 where the Minister would have the power to control increases in interest charges to mortgage holders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that it is general and I support the amendment in so far as it goes.  The one quibble I would have with it is that it reads:</P>
      <P>... and provided that any consequent loss of income to the Societies will not be passed on by way of increased interest charges to mortgage holders.</P>
      <P>Does that mean that if the Minister wanted to make regulations in relation to redemption fees and so on, but the building societies said they could not do this without increasing the interest charges, under the amended section the Minister would then have to back off making the regulations because it says &ldquo;provided that any consequent loss of income of the Societies will not be passed on...&rdquo;?  That is the problem with the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the situation has been put very succinctly by Deputy De Rossa.  It would be ironic if the House adopted an amendment the effect of which was to thwart the intention of the section.  May I say, in the politest way possible, that I am afraid Deputy R. Burke is adopting a rather schizophrenic approach to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Implicit in the Deputy's contribution on this amendment is the suggestion that the management of the societies intend to or would act totally irresponsibly and, as a result of regulations made under this section, seek to recover any change in income through an <Col N="1008" /> increase in interest rates.  Yet, when we commenced discussion on Committee Stage, the Deputy was advocating very strongly reliance on the responsible attitude which would be pursued by managements of building societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not follow the Minister down that road.  What I am proposing here is related directly to the abolition of the redemption fees, the making available of valuations, the insurance option, legal fees and the effect that they will have in a loss of income to the societies resulting from the changes proposed in this section.  This has nothing to do with the general question of market forces, mortgage and investment rates that the societies offer.  If the Minister implements the provisions of this section their effect will be to abolish redemption fees.  If he abolishes redemption fees there will be a loss of income to the societies.  If those societies suffer such loss of income I do not want that being passed on to the mortgage holders.  I do not want two neighbours &mdash; one selling his house prematurely being saved a redemption fee on that transaction &mdash; and the other remaining in his home and suffering an increase in his mortgage interest rate resulting from the loss of income on the abolition of these redemption fees.  We are not prepared to go along with that and consequently we are pushing our amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to endorse what Deputy Burke has said.  The Minister must recognise that what he proposes here is contrary to the system which operates right across the board.  Every institution offering a mortgage goes through the same legal proceedings.  They have their own solicitors who check out titles, the applicants have their solicitors and if the mortgage is to be redeemed there is a redemption fee.  Unless the Minister is prepared to recognise that in changing the whole system dramatically it will have a major effect on the income of societies and unless he guarantees that he will protect the borrowers in what he proposes to do so that they will not have to carry <Col N="1009" /> the extra charges that will be needed in order to make up for the loss of income, then he must accept our amendment. Consequently, we have no option but to push the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained that in discussions with one group of societies, albeit the smaller societies, they expressed the view that the additional income which the operaton of section 3 would generate for them would at least offset, and quite likely more than offset, any change in their income profile through the implementation of the provisions under section 4 and section 6. Once again, I invite the House to address itself to the size of the management expenses charged by some of the societies. With a combination of the additional income to be generated through the operation of section 3 and a judicious approach towards management expenses generally, bearing in mind the inevitable changes that will come about in the marketplace in relation to the provision of finance for house purchase loans, it is eminently possible and reasonable to assume that the societies will be more than in a position to be able to accept the regulations made under section 6 without any loss of income to them to such an extent that would turn their minds <Col N="1010" /> towards an increase in interest rates charged to borrowers or a reduction in rates to investors.  We must remember that from now on the most important thing a society has is its customer base. Its market will be customer driven.  The societies that do best will be the ones who accept that basic philosophy and respond to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister can give the assurance that building societies will increase their income by so much as a result of section 3, that they will be so efficient in relation to their operation and their management expenses, will he not accept that the wise way to proceed is to write into the Bill that he will abolish the redemption fees and the other restrictions to make sure that the societies do not pass them on to the existing mortgage holders?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f) restricting the amount of money a society may spend on advertising&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to add a paragraph to the section.  It seeks to restrict the amount of money the Minister would allow a building society to spend on <Col N="1014" /> advertising.  I suggest that we could take amendment No. 11 with amendment No. 10.  The second amendment seeks to restrict the amount of money a society may pay to directors in relation to fees, expenses, pensions and other emoluments.</P>
    <P>Basically, the amendments seek to deal with two matters apart from interest rates.  Most mortgage holders are extremely concerned about both.  There is little doubt that building societies are the largest advertisers in the State &mdash; perhaps Guinness might outdo them in some respects.  Building societies' advertising budgets would run into millions each year.  I am led to believe that the Irish Permanent Building Society have had an advertisement on RTE every day since the station was established.  One could understand this, perhaps, if building societies were in direct competition with each other, but in fact they are not. By and large they operate a cartel, certainly in relation to interest rates for depositors and mortgagees.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said earlier in relation to my first amendment, when the Irish Nationwide decided they would increase their rates by 3 per cent the other building societies felt obliged to do the same.  That is a clear indication of a cartel in operation. At the same time they spent huge amounts of money, apparently to compete with each other, on advertising. Apparently they compete with each other in the establishment of branches at every crossroads.  For instance, the EBS have their HQ in Westmoreland Street but they spent a substantial amount of money opening a branch office directly across the street.  That is not acceptable and it does not indicate that the free market which has been praised from both sides of the House today is operated to any great extent by the companies.</P>
    <P>In relation to directors' fees and expenses, we have vast amounts of money designated as expenses payable to building society directors, though strangely enough, the moneys designated are not broken down as between one director and another.  We can only estimate what they are getting by dividing <Col N="1015" /> the amount of money by the number of directors involved.  It would appear to vary between direct payments to directors of between £7,000 and £10,000 or more, and other emoluments of one kind or another of up to £30,000 each per year.  Directors attend about a half dozen meetings a year and the figures I have mentioned seem an extraordinary amount of money.</P>
    <P>I have put down these two amendments to offer the Minister an opportunity, which he has not taken in the Bill so far, to restrict such operations by building societies in a way that would make sense to the vast majority of mortgage holders who are concerned about the massive expenditure of those societies in mock competition with each other but who at the same time operate cartels in relation to interest rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that amendment No. 10 in its present form is necessary.  Under section 76 of the 1976 Act the Minister already has this power. He is empowered by that section to make, on the recommendation of the registrar, such regulations as he considers necessary or expedient for the purpose of securing proper and efficient management of the societies and for promoting the orderly and proper regulations of building society business. The regulations may provide, amongst other things, for limits on expenditure arising from its operation and management, including limits on advertising expenditure, so that if it were considered appropriate to introduce these controls the legislative provision is already enshrined in the 1976 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 11 I would like to draw the attention of the House to Government amendment No. 12 which provides for a faster procedure for the implementation of rules which already exist under section 10 (3) on the 1976 Act in so far as they relate to the appointment and removal of the board of directors.  I understand that we are not debating amendment No. 12.  I just want to draw the attention of the House to the <Col N="1016" /> similarity between amendments Nos. 11 and 12.  I would suggest to the House that the course set out in amendment No. 12, which provides among other things for appeal to the courts which it is considered prudent to have included in the legislation, is a better way of dealing with the matter than that set out in the Deputy's amendment No. 11.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It may well be as the Minister states, that amendment No. 12 is better.  I am not competent to judge as between one and the other.  The purpose of placing amendment No. 11 under this section was that the Minister is taking the power under this section to make particular regulations and specify certain conditions for the building societies to operate under.  If the Minister is satisfied that the power I am asking him to take under amendment No. 11 is taken by him under amendment No. 12 then I will be happy to withdraw amendment No. 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But in relation to amendment No. 10, the Minister says he thinks he already has that power under the 1976 Act.  The Minister may have quite a lot of powers under the 1976 Act which do not appear to be implemented.  If for no other reason, we should draw attention to the fact that the societies appear to be a law unto themselves in a whole range of areas and the amount of money spent on advertising, the amount of office space taken up by building societies and so on is nothing short of a scandal, and they do not appear to bear any relationship to the business of getting investment and providing loans.  It does not make sense. One would assume if the open market were operating in this area that efficiency alone would call for the closing of many of these branches.  We know, for instance, that the banks, who are no great friends of mine nor I of theirs, are closing branches down all the time in attempts to rationalise their operations, while at the same time we have this mushrooming of building society branches.  Perhaps the Minister could repeat the point he made in relation to amendment No. 10 and <Col N="1017" /> where he feels he has the power in the 1976 Act to restrict the advertising.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers that I referred to are contained in section 76 of the 1976 Act and those give the Minister power to make regulations, after consultation with the registrar, for the purpose of securing the proper and efficient management of societies and promoting the orderly and proper regulation of building society business.  Those regulations could provide for limits on expenditure which arise from the operations and management of the societies, including limits, if it were considered wise to do so, on advertising expenditure.  The House will recall that in relation to this general question of the provisions of the 1976 Act, which the Deputy has raised, I indicated my intention on Second Stage to use some of the powers available to me under the 1976 Act in conjunction with making regulations following on the enactment of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some merit in Deputy De Rossa's point in regard to the amount of advertising on radio, television, and in the national and local newspapers. In the event of excessive advertising the Minister is satisfied that he has the power to limit it.  The societies also should examine this question and be prudent in their spending on advertising at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa also referred to the number of branch offices springing up around the country while the banking institutions are closing down offices.  It is true that a number of bank branches have closed in different areas but there is a difference between banking institutions who own the premises and have permanent staff and the building societies which in many cases, while owning the properties and having permanent staff in the larger towns, use offices which they do not own and which do not employ permanent staff but whose staff are paid on the basis of some form of commission. There are quite a number of building societies in the medium and larger towns and I see some merit in that.  Perhaps it <Col N="1018" /> is different in Dublin but, as a Deputy representing a rural constituency, I see some merit in offering the people a choice as between banking institutions, credit unions, building societies and post offices.  People have enough commonsense to be able to decide which area to go to in regard to finance.  The credit unions provide a service for the smaller borrowers, borrowing sums which would not normally be large enough to purchase houses.  That may be what Deputy De Rossa has in mind when he talks about the expansion of credit unions.  It is good that people have a choice.  I understand that when an office is opened up a certain amount of expenditure and costs are allowed and then a particular person works on behalf of the society in the area. I would rather see a progressive building society in a town in a shop premises that would otherwise be closed down and where a couple of people are employed. It is not a black and white situation.  There are some merits in having building societies so that people have a choice in regard to where they wish to do business.  In regard to advertising I see some merit in the societies being prudent.</P>

      <P>I do not want to delay the House on this, but perhaps the last Deputy misunderstood my point in regard to rationalisation in the banks and the expansion of building society branches. I was simply drawing an analogy as between one financial institution operating within the open market and the building societies which we are told are operating within the open market.  People are rationalising and presumably expanding their costs in relation to the provision of these branches whether they be owned, leased or whatever.  That was the point.  I am not arguing for the withdrawal of building societies from towns.  I am talking about restricting the proliferation of building society premises.  The EBS have their headquarters at one side of Westmoreland Street and a branch office on the other side of the street.  It is ridiculous.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where rules to which this section applies have been prescribed, and the rules of a society to which they are declared to be applicable by the regulations by which such rules have been prescribed are not in the opinion of the Registrar substantially in accordance with the rules as so prescribed, the Registrar shall notify the society of his opinion within one month after the commencement of the regulations, and in such a case the prescribed rules shall, with effect from three months after the commencement of the regulations, be <Col N="1020" /> part of the rules of the society and shall have effect notwithstanding any existing provision of the rules of the society.</P>
    <P>(3) (a)  A society may, before the expiration of the period of three months specified in subsection (2) of this section, appeal to the Court against the opinion of the Registrar.</P>
    <P>(b)  Where an appeal under this subsection is upheld, the rules of the society may remain in operation.</P>
    <P>(c)  Where an appeal under this subsection fails, the rule prescribed shall, with effect from one month after date of the Court's decision on the appeal, be part of the rules of society and shall have effect notwithstanding any existing provision of the rules of the society.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Let me ask your permission.  Sir, and the permission of the House to insert the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; in two places in paragraph (c) at the top of page 3 in the list amendments.

      <P>This amendment provides for a faster procedure for the implementation of rule changes in so far as they relate to the appointment, remuneration and removal of the boards of directors of societies.  Under section 10 (1) (3) and <Col N="1021" /> (4)  of the 1976 Act this question is dealt with.  The registrar must within six months notify any society whose rules are not in accordance with the prescribed rules laid down in regulations and specify a date not earlier than a year from the commencement of the regulations for the coming into force of the rules.  There is also a right of appeal to the High Court within three months.</P>
      <P>Essentially this amendment is to shorten the time span involved.  While I indicated to the House that I intended using the provisions of section 10 of the 1976 Act, on further reflection I feel it is better to insert this provision specifically into this legislation while retaining the role of the registrar and the right of appeal of a society to the courts.  This amendment would have the effect after the making of regulations for providing the registrar to notify his opinion within one month of the making of the regulations and for the rules to come into effect three months after the commencement of the regulations, but with right of a society to appeal to the court before the expiration of that three-month period and in the event of the court upholding the regulations for the rules to come into effect within a further period of a month after the court decision.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Bill be passed at this stage, but I must say I am fearful of some of the conditions in it. While I take the Minister as being well intentioned in regard to some of them, there are others who would question his intentions.  However, taking it on the basis of the Minister being well intentioned in regard to the abolition of redemption fees and the tiered interest rates, my fear about this legislation is that it will increase on existing mortgage holders the interest rates resulting from the decision which will have an effect of a loss of funding on the societies.  Whether that is the Minister's intention or not, I fear that will be the effect of his proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is a need for major building society renewal legislation.  The last Principal Act was in 1976 and there is need at this stage for the introduction of comprehensive building society legislation. The intention of the Fianna Fáil Party in Government will be to introduce such comprehensive legislation dealing with all of the operations of the building societies as they are at the moment and <Col N="1025" /> to allow our national building society movement to handle the competition which undoubtedly will come in here resulting from EC regulation changes and as a result of the changes in the British Parliament as they affect the societies in the UK.</P>

      <P>I concur with the sentiments expressed by my colleague, Deputy Burke.  The Minister has put a hastily prepared Bill together.  Judging by the last two amendments he proposed, obviously he has had second thoughts on the situation.  It is obvious from what he proposes that the borrower will have to carry the can at the end of the day because the Minister could not give us any guarantees.  The difficulty is that we will be faced with fierce competition from outside building societies because no later than 18 November the Halifax Building Society came into Northern Ireland and acquired a full chain of offices right across the North.  As Deputy Burke said, it will be up to Fianna Fáil on their return to Government to protect the interests of the financial institutions, with emphasis on the building society movement.</P>

      <P>As I said at the outset, the Bill is designed to protect the borrower to eliminate objectionable practices as well as helping to secure a future for the building society movement and to encourage and, indeed, to regulate them into doing some of the things one would expect in normal market conditions would have been done anyway.  The validity of the approach of the Opposition can be interpreted fairly well through the last two contributions.  I have endeavoured to act on behalf of the consumer in this legislation and I am quite certain the result will be to the benefit of the borrower.  Indeed, in its own way it will provide for a healthier future for the building society movement in the face of the certain increased competition which will come about in the near future.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, concerned about the repeated accidents at, and continuing discharges from, the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant and conscious of the dangerous threat it poses to the life and health of the Irish people and to the whole environment on this island, calls on the British Government to arrange for the immediate closure of this dangerous installation.</P>
      <P>This motion underlines the fact that responsibility for Sellafield rests with the British Government.  Accordingly, any call for the setting up of inspectorates or the involvement of outside agencies is secondary to the main call on the British Government for the closure of Sellafield. The greatest pressure we can bring to bear on the British Government is a united call from this Dáil for the closure of Sellafield.  In the interests of the people we must act as a united Parliament as it is the only pressure which the British Government will recognise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1027" /> This is the third time this year Fianna Fáil have tabled a Private Members' Motion on Sellafield.  On each of the previous occasions not only were our motions rejected by the Coalition but we were accused by them of being alarmist. Given the serious and very real threat which Sellafield poses to our country and the irresponsible way in which the Coalition have handled the issue in their dealings with Britain, Fianna Fáil make no apology for continuing our campaign to shut Sellafield down.  In July 1983 when we raised the matter in an Adjournment debate, our protests were dismissed out of hand.</P>
    <P>The facts of the intervening years have proved that not only have leaks continued but Sellafield has been seen to be, in the words of the Tánaiste last Thursday, 27 November 1986 &ldquo;badly run and incompetently managed for virtually its entire period of operation and has posed and continues to pose a real threat to the people of this country&rdquo;.  That is like the conversion of St. Paul on the road to Damascus.  On 17 February 1984 as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 18 February the Tánaiste and Minister for Energy met the British Environment Secretary, Mr. Patrick Jenkins, in London and the Tánaiste said he was particularly satisfied with the talks and that Mr. Jenkins had reassured him that an incident such as last year's could not happen again.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste said that scientific evidence available then did not indicate adverse effects for the Irish people but expressed concern at accidental discharges and long term consequences and pressed that releases from Sellafield must be as low as reasonably achievable.  That is the same Tánaiste who now says Sellafield has been badly run and incompetently managed for virtually its entire period of operation.  That is a big change from February 1984 and from the stance taken during the course of the two Private Members' Motions put down in 1986 by Fianna Fáil.  This statement and the decison of the Government to support this <Col N="1028" /> resolution tonight is another U-turn for the Tánaiste and the Government.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil on 11 March last the Tánaiste seemed quite reassured that British Nuclear Fuels had commenced a programme which included measures designed to effect significant reductions in radioactive discharges at Sellafield. Later on that night the Tánaiste said he was assured by the Nuclear Energy Board that the levels of artificially produced radioactivity in the atmosphere and in the environment were low and did not constitute a health hazard to the Irish people.  Given the Tánaiste's remarks last Thursday night I can only congratulate him on his St. Paul like conversion even though it is the eleventh hour as far as the Irish people are concerned and it is way past the eleventh hour in the life of this administration.  I do not want to be too harsh.  All I can say is that I am glad that the Tánaiste and the Government have seen the light.</P>
    <P>The only way the real threat from Sellafield can be removed is with all party support for this resolution to close Sellafield. The implications of the threat from Sellafield should have transcended party politics but they did not because this Coalition would not vote in this House to unite the people.  Sellafield is a national worry and it demanded a national response.  It is by such a resolution that the Danish Parliament, for example, called on Sweden to close their nuclear plant which threatened Denmark. Britain will find it difficult to resist a united call to close Sellafield.</P>
    <P>I will mention other examples of the attitude of this Government and their Ministers in relation to Sellafield to highlight their irresponsibility in dividing this House twice this year on this issue.  In reply to a parliamentary question the then Minister of State, Deputy E. Collins, accused Deputy Haughey, the Leader of Fianna Fáil, of indulging in alarmist questioning and said there was no danger to people living in Ireland from discharges in Sellafield.  Let us look at that in relation to the Tánaiste's recent comment about its being badly run and incompetently managed for virtually its <Col N="1029" /> entire period of operation and that it posed and continues to pose a real threat to the people of this country.  Who was right?  Was it Deputy Haughey when he called for its closure or the former Minister of State, Deputy E. Collins, who is now being isolated by his Government who are now accepting the Fianna Fáil motion.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Kavanagh, on 1 August 1984, when the British Government decided to prosecute BNFL for unauthorised discharges, said that a reduction in any contamination would have very beneficial effects on Irish waters but reiterated that radioactivity levels would not pose any health risk to Irish people and that at the moment the contamination in our waters was so slight that it was not dangerous.  Arising from that prosecution, BNFL were fined £10,000.  Again and again we had examples of Ministers coming into this House defending BNFL for what they were doing.  Deputy E. Collins said last December in the Dáil that on the question of discharges into the sea from the Sellafield plant he had no reason to believe the United Kingdom were not carrying out their obligations under the relevant international agreement which is the Paris Convention of 1974 on the prevention of pollution from land based sources.  Compare that with the Tánaiste's conversion of last Thursday night.  We were the ones on this side of the House who were accused of being alarmist and misleading the Irish people.  Now, in the eleventh hour of their life, the Government are accepting the call for the closure of Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House provides all parties with a unique opportunity to come together and, in the name of all Irish people, to demand the closure of Sellafield.  This issue also crosses the Border; at the recent SDLP conference their spokesman on the Environment reiterated his call for the closure of Sellafield. I was more than a little surprised at the amendment in the names of Deputy O'Malley, Deputy Molloy, Deputy Keating, Deputy Harney and Deputy Wyse. When Deputy O'Malley was Minister I <Col N="1030" /> was his Minister of State and like many people, particularly those in the south-east, I remember he was a passionate defender of nuclear installations and proposals for Carnsore.  However, the amendment will not have the effect that even the Government are now seeking. He wants an urgent meeting with the British Prime Minister to insist on the closure of Sellafield but we want a united call from the House demanding closure. At any rate, I welcome Deputy O'Malley's conversion on the issue and the acceptance of our policy for a united call for the closure of Sellafield.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil repeatedly warned that leaks would continue at Sellafield.  We are not reassured by declarations that such leaks will not continue.  Neither are we confident that all these leaks are reported.  For example, earlier this year there was a leak which British Nuclear Fuels first denied, they then admitted it but tried to downgrade the scale of the accident.  After a series of investigative reports, the truth came out.  The fine of £10,000 on British Nuclear Fuels earlier this year was imposed not only for exceeding the limits but for failure to keep proper safety records at the plant, confirming what I said regarding the non-reporting of leaks.</P>
    <P>Again and again Coalition Ministers have been fobbed off by the British Government and by British Nuclear Fuels.  In February 1984 the British Minister for the Environment told our Minister for Energy that leaks such as those which occurred in November 1983 would not happen again.  Well they did &mdash; again and again and again.  In their 30 years of operation there have been over 300 accidents at Sellafield, including a fire in 1957, when the prevailing winds were blowing towards the Irish coast.  We are all familiar with the very strong body of evidence available that that incident resulted in a series of Down's Syndrome children being born in the Louth and Down areas because there was a particularly destructive wind blowing from Sellafield.  Earlier this year such dangers were highlighted when the winds from <Col N="1031" /> Chernobyl reached our shores.  The Minister recognises these facts, despite his statement last March that Sellafield had never exceeded the limit it is authorised to discharge.  How could Fine Gael and Labour Deputies vote against a call for the closure of Sellafield in March and May and now join us?  Thank God, they have seen the error of their ways but it is a pity the conversion did not happen sooner.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and the Government will not adopt a head-in-the-sand approach to this issue.  The Minister should be consistent in word and deed. If his recent statement means anything, he should take this opportunity of having an all party stand on the issue.  I am glad he is accepting our motion.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, the Minister said that if satisfactory standards of safety were seen to be operating and if we could have confidence in the safe operation of the plant without endangering the Irish people, its continued operation would not be opposed.  How could a Minister for Energy make such a statement and then vote against a call for the closure of Sellafield twice in one year?  I am glad he has done a somersault by supporting our motion but it is a terrible shame that the threat to the health of our people is only now being recognised by the Government because we are approaching a general election and because of the difficult voting position in the House.  Over the last few weeks, during Private Members' debates they have done U-turn after U-turn. Last week, for example, the Minister for Finance said there could be no changes in relation to social welfare payments and the Minister for Agriculture said that tough decisions had to be taken. By that evening we had the spectacle of the Minister for Social Welfare doing a complete about face on behalf of the Government.</P>
    <P>It is terrible to think it has taken this precarious voting position of the Government to force them to join us when they should have made moves many months ago.  The public look to parties in the House to express loss of confidence in the <Col N="1032" /> continued operation of Sellafield.  This is all the more urgent in view of proposals to expand the plant, not just as a nuclear plant but to deal with nuclear processing. It is proposed to double its size which means the potential for further incidents and a Chernobyl-type disaster less than 100 miles from our shore.  The issue demands a responsible response from Dáil Éireann, there must be a united resolution, on behalf of the Irish people, to the British Government to close this monstrosity.</P>
    <P>The Government's U-turn on this issue in accepting our motion is a recognition and admission that the consistent approach taken by this party has been correct.  It is a matter of national regret that time has been lost and that the united Irish call for the closure of Sellafield is only taking place now.  However, better late than never.  I call on the Government to use the full resources of their Departments, in particular Foreign Affairs, to highlight the fact that a united Irish Parliament has called for the immediate closure of Sellafield.  I have no doubt that the moral pressure which will result from such a call will be something which the British Government will not be able to withstand.  I have no doubt that when such a call is made and when an extensive campaign is initiated by all Government agencies worldwide that the moral pressure will eventually close Sellafield.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Burke and the Fianna Fáil motion which states that Dáil Éireann, concerned about the repeated accidents at, and continuing discharges from, the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant and conscious of the dangerous threat it poses to the life and health of the Irish people and to the whole environment of this island, calls on the British Government to arrange for the immediate closure of this dangerous installation.  This motion, as Deputy Burke said earlier, is a repeat of similar motions put down by us on 11 March and 6 May of this year which amazingly as it now seems were opposed by the Government and in particular by the Minister for Energy who put down <Col N="1033" /> rather innocuous amendments conveying our concern and calling on the British Prime Minister to ensure a thorough review of safety at the plant.  That was his reaction and response on those two occasions.</P>
      <P>I wonder, as Deputy Burke wondered earlier, if the Minister would now explain his sudden conversion over the past week on this issue?  I must say that on this side of the House we are grateful he has managed to see the light in relation to some of the issues which Fianna Fáil have been concerned about over the past year. His claim of Fianna Fáil playing politics on the issue on the last occasion now rings rather hallow when we see his own conversion.  Of course, Deputies Cluskey and Taylor became similarly enlightened last week following our Private Members' motion on the Christmas bonus issue but having said that I am pleased the Government and the Minister have finally agreed to support our motion on this issue tonight.</P>
      <P>My own bona fides to speak on this motion are twofold.  As a radiologist who is involved with radiation every day of my professional career, I am only too well aware of the hazards and the potential dangers of radiation.  Many of the pioneers of radiology and my own predecessors died from leukaemia and various forms of cancer because they were not aware of the dangers of radiation. Secondly, I was appointed earlier this year to chair a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities to investigate and recommend the closure of Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sellafield plant sited in Cumbria just across the Irish Sea from the east coast must present the greatest threat ever to the Irish people.  Can one imagine the horror of a similar disaster to Chernobyl occurring at Sellafield?  Can one imagine the consequences for Ireland should such an event occur?  Are we to be totally dependent on the prevailing winds for our survival from such a threat? Surely, no country can be subjected to such a threat from a supposedly friendly nation and neighbour?  Surely, we as a <Col N="1034" /> member of the EC are in a position to call on our European partners to assist in ensuring that we achieve our objective in having this dangerous monstrosity closed?</P>
    <P>A major disaster or accident at Sellafield could have disastrous consequences for Ireland.  We all know what happened at Chernobyl earlier this year. We read and saw the horrendous results of a nuclear disaster.  We also read about the shoddy workmanship, the theft of building materials, and the substandard concrete which was used in the building of the fifth reactor at Chernobyl.  Let us compare that with the picture at Sellafield or Windscale as it was previously called but where following a PR exercise the name was changed.</P>
    <P>British Nuclear Fuels have been repeatedly caught out.  They have concealed information and they have hid and denied the various accidents which have occurred there since the fifties.  We condemned the Russians for concealing the recent disaster but are British Nuclear Fuels or the British Government for that matter any different?</P>
    <P>We are all aware for some time now of the unsatisfactory position which prevails at Sellafield.  The revelation by Derek Jackman, a nuclear scientist, earlier this year places the situation into its propoer perspective.  He revealed that the discharges of radioactive material around the Windscale site in Cumbria following the accident in the fifties were 40 times higher than stated in an independent inquiry &mdash; the Black report &mdash; set up three years ago to investigate cancer levels around the plant.  The nuclear authorities now admit that the figures they gave to the Black inquiry were wrong. Doses received by the population over a three year period were five times higher than those originally recorded.  With that kind of record, how can this Government repeatedly accept any reassurances from Britain regarding Sellafield?  How can the Taoiseach and the Minister for Energy accept so blandly from the British Prime Minister that there are no dangers? Surely, we owe to the Irish people and <Col N="1035" /> future generations to ensure that their safety is maintained?</P>
    <P>A British House of Commons report said that the greatest concern was felt about liquid discharges from Sellafield which are by far the greatest source of discharge of radioactivity in the United Kingdom.  The report stated that the United Kingdom discharges more radioactivity into the sea than any other nation in the world and that Sellafield is the largest recorded source of radioactive discharge in the world.  As a result, the Irish Sea is the most radioactive sea in the world.  This report also states that the discharges contained a higher level of the more harmful radio nucleates such as ruthenium 106, strontium 90 and, of special concern, plutonium 239.  This committee also found that not all of the radio nucleates discharged into the sea are diluted or dispersed.  Some find their way back to the land.</P>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board have repeatedly assured us that the levels being monitored in the Irish Sea are minimal and way below the recognised safety levels but the question which must be asked is whether there is any such thing as a safe level of radiation?  As a radiologist, I would have to say emphatically no.  What was regarded as a safe level of radiation ten or 15 years ago is now totally unacceptable today.  Who is to say that with more sophisticated measuring techniques that the safety levels of today will not be completely unacceptable in a year's time?  There is also the cumulative factor.  All radiation is cumulative. Therefore, in that context there can be no such thing as a safe level because following accumulation any level will eventually become hazardous.</P>
    <P>I am sure in this debate tonight reference will be made to background radiation and to the fact that we cannot control that.  I accept that, but Sellafield is something we can control and eliminate and surely, that is something we must ensure.  There must be some provision under EC rules, either under the Euratom Treaty or the Paris Convention, whereby we can insist on the closure of <Col N="1036" /> Sellafield.  1987 is going to be European Environment Year.  The fourth EC action programme on the environment for the period 1987 to 1991 will be formulated and adopted at the beginning of 1987. Among the priorities singled out by the Commission are atmospheric pollution and pollution of the seas.</P>
    <P>The seas identified by the Commission for particular attention are the Mediterranean and the North Sea.  The Irish Sea, as I pointed out earlier on, is heavily at risk from nuclear discharge.  I wonder can the Commission be made to recognise this fact and include the Irish Sea in their forthcoming action programme? The Commission has always maintained that economic development depends on the preservation of natural resources and growth cannot be assumed if the environment is not protected.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me say that the inaccurate information being provided by the authorities at Sellafield and the poor safety record of this plant suggests and confirms that the only safe solution is to insist that the Sellafield plant be closed forthwith.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to speak on this motion on Sellafield. I would like to take this opportunity of supporting my party colleagues, Deputy Burke and Deputy Ormonde, who have contributed to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of the Sellafield nuclear plant is a chronicle of one accident after another.  People in my constituency and in the neighbouring counties Down, Meath, Dublin and further north in Antrim are very much exposed to the fall-out from Sellafield.  They have had to live with the worry and stress of the proximity of Sellafield, just across the Irish Sea.  Medical researchers and general practitioners, particularly in Counties Louth and Down, have discovered particularly high rates of miscarriages and stillbirths, especially in north Louth and Down.  In 1979 the rate of stillbirths was 3.5 times the national average; in 1980 it was twice the national average. Those statistics must indicate that there is <Col N="1037" /> something seriously wrong in those areas. There are no other elements which could influence those statistics, apart from the proximity of the Sellafield plant.</P>
    <P>This might be an appropriate time to ask whether the Department of Health and the Nuclear Energy Board have shown sufficient concern about the danger that lurks day and night for the people of Louth, Down and the east coast generally.  Can this Government continue to expect the people of those areas to live with the fear of a major accident at Sellafield?  Recently we had the horrific accident at Chernobyl.  Perhaps that accident brought nuclear reprocessing plants into proper focus and heightened awareness worldwide of the great danger posed by nuclear plants in general.</P>
    <P>Sellafield is just a few miles across the Irish Sea from the most heavily populated areas in this country.  We are expected by the British Government and by British Nuclear Fuels to live with the worry, stress, fear and apprehension of a serious accident at Sellafield.  It has a history of one accident after another.  It is only in recent times that medical researchers and GPs have heightened public awareness of the great danger with which we have been living for so long.</P>
    <P>Surveys carried out on birds in the region of the Chernobyl accident showed levels of radioactivity well above the accepted levels of safety.  We must consider whether birds from the Sellafield area which migrate across the Irish Sea are a danger to people living on the east coast, in the midlands or throughout the country as a whole.  Can we continue to adopt a cavalier attitude and pretend there is no real danger?  Perhaps the assurance from the Nuclear Energy Board that we have nothing to fear will allay our worries in the short term but I do not think we can dismiss in the long term the danger that they pose.</P>
    <P>Our population along the east coast are seriously at risk from Sellafield.  Accidents and leaks through the years have gone unchecked.  Much of the damage thus caused has been unnoticed until recent times.  The particular interest of medical personnel in Louth and Down <Col N="1038" /> has served to bring the Sellafield plant into proper focus.  If a major accident were to take place at Sellafield, what sort of plans have the Nuclear Energy Board or the Government to deal with it?  Are we completely exposed to the dangers? Is our attitude dominated by a &ldquo;fire brigade&rdquo; mentality?  These are the fears and difficulties we must live with.</P>
    <P>It was indicated at a recent conference in Britain that the incidence of childhood leukaemia is about 20 per cent higher than normal in the vicinity of ten of the 14 nuclear plants in England and Wales. That clearly indicates that radioactivity poses great danger not only to us but to the people living in the general area of these plants.  It was confirmed that childhood leukaemia can be caused by relatively small doses of radiation.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to take the decision which should have been taken long ago and demand that the British close Sellafield and leave people in this part of the world to live their lives in relative peace and tranquility without the fear of a major accident at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>We depend very much on our agriculture industry.  There is intensive horticultural production along the east coast. After the Chernobyl accident there was a major reaction to much of the produce and fish on sale in those areas.  People have considerable investment in their agricultural enterprises, yet they must live with the knowledge that even a minor accident and scare at Sellafield could devastate their business.  We cannot continue to live in circumstances like that. We have a monster on our doorstep which stalks the people of this land day and night.  The one solution is the closure of Sellafield.  It should have been closed years ago.</P>
    <P>In the 1950s there was the Down's Syndrome cluster in Dundalk and the research work on those cases has never decided conclusively what the exact cause was.  There is always the fear that an accident at Sellafield around that time was the primary contributory cause.</P>
    <P>I am calling on the Minister to ensure that those sorts of accidents will never happen again.  Let us call on the British <Col N="1039" /> Government and on British Nuclear Fuels to realise the dangers involved and close the plant immediately.  Recently there was an indication that the British were looking at alternative sources of energy which would be much safer than nuclear power.  I hope the British will see the error of their ways and accelerate the movement towards alternative sources of energy.</P>
    <P>This is one of several debates we have had in this House on the subject of Sellafield and the nuclear industry in general. Deputies on both sides of the House have made wide-ranging, constructive and worthwhile contributions.  Public representatives here appreciate the great danger involved, particularly for the people on the east coast.  I hope this debate will be the final one and that the Government will accept our motion and demand that Sellafield be closed forthwith.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>As this House is aware, the Government have been extremely concerned for some years about the Sellafield Nuclear Processing Plant, following an incident in November of 1983 which resulted in widespread radioactive contamination of adjacent beaches and which was later found by a UK court to have been totally unacceptable.  I then, in my capacity as Minister for the Environment, requested a meeting with the then UK Secretary of State for the Environment, Mr. Patrick Jenkin, M.P.  At that meeting, the first meeting of its kind to take place between the two Ministers in relation to Sellafield, I expressed the opposition of the Irish Government to discharges of radioactivity from the plant and called for routine discharges to be reduced and eliminated as soon as possible.  I also expressed Ireland's opposition to the practice of dumping of radioactive waste at sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then Ireland has taken every opportunity, in contacts with the UK authorities and at international meetings, to express our anger about radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea.  At the <Col N="1040" /> meeting in June of the Paris Commission, the body responsible for the prevention of marine pollution from land-based sources, Ireland again called for the elimination of radioactive discharges from all nuclear installations, through the use of the best available technology, and for immediate reporting of unplanned discharges. We emphasised the major public concern about incidents, particularly in regard to reprocessing operations at Sellafield, and about radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>I have spoken previously, on a number of occasions, about the levels of such discharges to the sea.  This House is, of course, fully aware of the monitoring programme being carried out by the Nuclear Energy Board and by the universities. The board's ongoing programme includes monitoring of radioactivity levels in fish, seawater, seaweed and sediment taken from the Irish Sea.  Independent research programmes are also undertaken by the Environmental Radioactivity Laboratories at University College, Dublin and Trinity College, Dublin.  The results of these monitoring programmes have clearly shown that contamination has occurred in the Irish Sea as a result of the discharges from Sellafield.  However, the radiation dose to the Irish population resulting from Sellafield is very small and would be, on average, less than 5 per cent of the revised limits advised by the International Commission for Radiological Protection, and 2 per cent of background radiation.</P>
    <P>A report published earlier this year by the Nuclear Energy Board on their monitoring of radioactivity levels in the Irish Sea between 1982 and 1984 confirms that the radioactive contamination of the Irish Sea decreased rapidly with increasing distance from Sellafield.  It also shows that the levels of contamination of the Irish Sea have decreased in recent years, probably reflecting reductions in the annual discharges from Sellafield since they were at their highest during the seventies.</P>
    <P>However, in spite of the relatively low levels of radioactivity, we are all aware that the Irish Sea has been labelled as <Col N="1041" />&ldquo;The most radioactive in the world&rdquo; by a British House of Commons Environment Committee.</P>
    <P>This committee recommended, <i>inter alia:</i></P>
    <P>(I)  That any disposal methods chosen should reduce the quantities of radioactive wastes discharged to the Environment &ldquo;to be as small as technically possible&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>(II)  Consideration of the abandonment of plans for extending reprocessing facilities (the Thorp Plant at Sellafield which is currently under construction);</P>
    <P>(III)  That radically lower discharge limits should be set;</P>
    <P>(IV)  That limits should be introduced for radioactive gaseous discharges to the atmosphere;</P>
    <P>(V)  That the nuclear industry should be more open with the Public.</P>
    <P>In general the conclusions and recommendations in the House of Commons report are to be welcomed, in particular those recommendations which I have just outlined.  However, it does not address the likelihood of effects of such accidents. It also fails to acknowledge the international nature of this problem.</P>
    <P>While I would stress again that the levels of radioactivity being discharged from Sellafield into the Irish Sea do not pose a significant hazard to the health of the Irish population, I would also emphasise that the objective of the Government has always been the complete elimination of such discharges.  I have said this in the House on many previous occasions.</P>
    <P>It must be said that British Nuclear Fuels Limited, the operators of the Sellafield plant, have commenced a programme which includes measures designed to effect significant reductions in radioactive discharges at Sellafield involving total expenditure of almost £900 million on additional safety measures. But it must also be said that the management of British Nuclear Fuels does not inspire any confidence whatsoever, as their recent record illustrates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1042" /> Incidents at Sellafield this year have given rise to more concern about the operation of that plant.  At meetings of the Ireland/UK Contact Group in February and October last, officials of my Department conveyed our grave anxiety at the incidents at Sellafield and our annoyance at the inadequate notification procedures.  The British authorities assured my officials in the course of those meetings that radiological emissions to the environment resulting from incidents at Sellafield were insignificant.  Nevertheless, a prompt notification procedure was agreed at the meeting and notification of incidents at Sellafield since then has been practically immediate.</P>
    <P>But however commendable a notification system may be, its worth is only in dealing with the after-effects of incidents. Our concern is more with prevention and, unfortunately, there has been a series of incidents at Sellafield this year.  None of these has been of major radiological significance, but their cumulative effect has been to justify the lack of public trust in the competence of the people who run the plant.</P>
    <P>The earliest of these incidents occurred this year on 24 January, 1986 when 458 kilograms of uranium were discharged into the Irish Sea.  On 18 February this year, a leak was discovered in a drainpipe from the magnox storage and decanning plant at Sellafield.  On 1 March monitors at Sellafield indicated a higher than normal aerial activity in a cubicle which handles mixed plutonium/uranium oxide, which resulted in the contamination of a number of workers.</P>
    <P>During May it was reported that wrongly labelled plutonium had been sent from Sellafield to a nuclear station at Dounreay some time in 1984 where it lay &ldquo;in a dissolver vat for 11 months without Dounreay management's knowledge&rdquo;. The Nuclear Energy Board here advised that a possibility existed that the material could have become critical and was capable of causing a serious incident.</P>
    <P>At Sellafield on 21 May 1986 two workers were contaminated following maintenance work on a valve.  On 29 <Col N="1043" /> May, at the Calder Hall Reactor at Sellafield, 2.6 tons of carbon dioxide and some radioactive dust escaped outside the building, but not off-site, during the annual overhaul.</P>
    <P>On 19 August, during routine sampling of the contents of the sea-tank at Sellafield, higher radioactivity levels than normal were discovered.  This would have breached the two day limit if the contents of the sea tank had been discharged. However, they were not discharged and were re-routed into the plant, which was closed until the cause of the incident was determined.  The latest incident occurred at Sellafield as recently as 27 November when the wrong tank of liquid was discharged into the sea &mdash; the level of radioactivity in this liquid had not been tested prior to discharge.</P>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board have assured us that none of these incidents has any significance for the Irish people, and the Government recognise that these incidents are, in themselves, of little radiological importance to Ireland. However, the frequency of these incidents establishes quite clearly how little trust we can have in the future operation of Sellafield.  The safety record at that plant has been appalling and the frequency of incidents poses the possibility that there will be an accident in the future which could have serious consequences for this country.</P>
    <P>I share very much the increasing public concern at the continued operation of the plant, a concern which is increasingly shared, I believe, by the British public. For this reason the Taoiseach, at his meeting with the British Prime Minister on 19 February 1986, urged that there be a review of safety procedures at the plant.</P>
    <P>As I said on many occasions, we are being exposed to a potential hazard from an operation outside our jurisdiction, and this makes the problem an international one.  The view of the Irish Government has been that this issue must be resolved by the European Commission under the provisions of the Euratom Treaty.</P>
    <P>This view was made known to the Commission as far back as 11 April 1986 <Col N="1044" /> when our Ambassador in Brussels, on behalf of the Government, formally requested the Commissioner to establish a Community Nuclear Installation Inspection Force to report to the Commission, and in turn to the member states, on existing or potential health or safety problems at individual nuclear installations in the Community.  Following Chernobyl we again wrote to the Commission repeating our call for closure.</P>
    <P>The question of whether the Commission had legal powers under the Euratom Treaty to set up an inspection force was examined by the Attorney General's office.  At a meeting on 6 June 1986 with the Attorney General's office, the legal service of the Commission agreed that they had competence under the Euratom Treaty to take the initiative to set up such a force.  The Commission, in a document dated 13 June 1986, undertook to submit to the EC Council by end July 1986 a comprehensive communication on the problems of implementing Chapter III of Euratom, which deals with health and safety, and on possible solutions to these problems.</P>
    <P>In a communication to the Council of Ministers dated 20 August 1986 the Commission stated, among other things, that if a system of Community checks were established it could operate selectively in order to ascertain the effects of national practices on safety standards and that by focusing on particular installations the Commission could be in a position to advise member states independently of the national inspectorates.  The Commission indicated that this would be one of the ideas they would be exploring. Ireland, therefore, pressed to have the matter of a Community Inspection Force put on the agenda of the recent Environment and Energy Councils.</P>
    <P>We are aware, of course &mdash; and I am sure most Members of this House are aware &mdash; that there are different positions within the Community on the use of nuclear power.  Up to now, energy policy in the Community has accepted a significant contribution from the nuclear <Col N="1045" /> industry.  However, Community involvement in nuclear safety has not kept pace with the expansion of nuclear capacity or with the growing concern of the public. The nuclear industry is a potential risk to human health and to the environment. It has transboundary effects, and public access to information on its operations has not always been available.</P>
    <P>At the Environment Council in Brussels on 24 November 1986, Deputy Boland, our Minister for the Environment, drew attention to the need for Environment Ministers to be concerned with nuclear safety, and he also stated that the Community had a duty to go much further than the Conventions of the International Atomic Energy Agency. He requested that the Commission bring forward specific proposals quickly, including the very important question of a Community inspection force.</P>
    <P>We repeated this call at the Energy Council on 26 November 1986, while expressing our anger that little real progress on a Community front had been achieved since Chernobyl.  Our argument at that meeting was that Energy Ministers must echo the conclusions of the Environment Council demanding that the Commission bring forward specific proposals in the area of nuclear safety which would address the fear and hostility in the Community regarding nuclear safety. Central to the Community policy, in our view, is the need for national inspectorates to be reinforced by the establishment of a parallel but independent Community inspection force.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government have stated, on many occasions, their firm opinion that it is in the interest of all concerned to support this inspection force at European level and to support any measure that might be adjudged necessary by an inspection force to improve the safety of any and all nuclear installations even if this transpires to mean suspension of operations or closure of the plants involved.</P>
    <P>Following the Council discussions, we are still in a situation where there is not full agreement within the Community on the need for an inspection force.  In spite <Col N="1046" /> of the number of incidents at Sellafield, in spite also of the increased fears about nuclear safety which followed in the wake of Chernobyl, we have tried at all times to take a reasonable approach regarding the rights of other countries where their own plants are concerned.  We now find ourselves in the position where, although many countries in the Community support our position on an inspection force, the idea has still not received complete acceptance.</P>
    <P>The latest incident at Sellafield does nothing to reassure us about the safety of the plant or the trustworthiness of its management. The incident occurred on 27 November, when the wrong tank of liquid was discharged into the Irish Sea.  The liquid had not been tested for radioactivity levels.  Subsequent investigation at BNFL established that the level of radioactivity in the liquid was well within the authorised limits, that it would have been discharged routinely anyway and that there were therefore no environmental or radiological consequences.  However, it is a matter of concern that this was established following the discharge.  This is the ninth incident at the Sellafield complex this year which has been reported to my Department.  As most Members of this House will know, incidents have been occurring in Sellafield from the fifties.</P>
    <P>It is increasingly obvious that the plant cannot be operated in a manner which gives us confidence about its safety.  This is due both to the fact that much of the plant is old, would seem to have reached the end of its useful life and also to the continuing incidence of human error at the plant and grossly ineffective management.</P>
    <P>There have been many calls for closure of the Sellafield plant.  The Government have refrained up to now from calling for closure of a plant located in another sovereign state.  Instead we wished to be assured that the plant could operate safely without posing any threat either to our population or to our environment. We in the Irish Government took every reasonable measure to encourage the <Col N="1047" /> establishment of an independent inspection force which could assure us that the plant was capable of operating safely and without any hazard to this country.</P>
    <P>The Government know that there is growing support in Europe for the inspection force idea, even if it is not yet unanimous. It is an idea we will continue to support.  It is an idea in which we firmly believe.  We are determined to take all possible measures in the future to convince all the member states of the Community that this is the right course of action with regard to the nuclear industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Government consider at this stage that we have made as much progress as possible through the reasonable negotiating stance we have adopted to date about Sellafield.  We continue to live in uncertainty about the possible dangers posed by the plant.  We have no assurance from the UK Government that there will be no further and perhaps more serious incidents at the plant.  That is why I called last Thursday might for international support for the closure of the plant at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The Chernobyl accident gave rise to increased concern in this country and indeed in the whole world regarding the safety of nuclear installations.  We in Ireland were fortunate in that we escaped the worst effects of the accident. However, although we were not exposed to significant levels of radiation, the cost in terms both of time and money was high.  The Nuclear Energy Board were obliged to engage in a substantial monitoring programme to determine the extent of the fall-out in Ireland and to assess its impact on the Irish public.  This included checking levels of radioactivity in foodstuffs, home-produced and imported, and in the environment.</P>
    <P>Additional resources had to be provided to the board following Chernobyl to enable the board to cope with monitoring demands.  In May, 1986, a sum of £383,000 was approved for office and laboratory facilities for the board.  In <Col N="1048" /> addition £60,000 was provided for equipment and provision was made for five extra staff.</P>
    <P>As monitoring demands continued to increase in the wake of Chernobyl, the Nuclear Energy Board sought and was granted an additional £167,000 for further monitoring equipment and four extra staff.</P>
    <P>Chernobyl has taught us all a valuable lesson, which is that there can be appalling and long term consequences from any accident at a nuclear power station. Chernobyl dramatically demonstrated that such accidents know no boundaries.</P>
    <P>Following Chernobyl a sub-committee of the interdepartmental committee which I set up has now completed its consideration of an emergency plan for dealing with nuclear accidents.  A report describing the plan has been prepared and is being considered by the full interdepartmental committee.  When this has been done the plan will be submitted to the Government for formal approval.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the emergency plan is to establish a structure which will provide a co-ordinated response to a nuclear accident from all responsible Departments and authorities.  The plan will identify the particular responsibilities of those involved.  The relevant Departments and statutory authorities will then be responsible for implementing any control measures within their respective areas which might be required following a nuclear accident.  There are trained personnel in the various organisations which would be called upon to participate in an emergency. For example, most staff at the Nuclear Energy Board are widely experienced and the recently recruited staff are undergoing appropriate training.</P>
    <P>It must of course be borne in mind that it is unrealistic to contemplate the possibility of the board being equipped to deal with every conceivable nuclear accident which might occur, bearing in mind, in particular, the fact that the installations and materials which could give rise to such accidents do not reside within our jurisdiction.  I submit that no country in the world is in a position to do this.  We are preparing emergency plans <Col N="1049" /> which are deemed to be appropriate to our circumstances and the resource to be allocated to the NEB will be determined accordingly.</P>
    <P>As a direct consequence of the Chernobyl accident, the International Atomic Energy Agency negotiated two conventions last summer, one on early notification in the event of a nuclear accident and the second on mutual assistance in the event of such an accident.  Ireland participated in the meetings and is a signatory to both conventions.  However, while the Government welcome these conventions as a step forward, we must bear in mind that these are measures which follow in the wake of an accident. They do nothing to prevent the accident from happening in the first place.</P>
    <P>At the Special Session of the General Conference of the IAEA in September last, Ireland stated that nuclear countries have an obligation to act as good neighbours, that nuclear programmes should be implemented in conformity with the highest possible levels of safety and that fulfilment of this obligation will require the establishment of an international nuclear safety inspectorate among whose functions would be to confirm the effectiveness of their regulations and the inspection of individual nuclear installations to determine whether they are safe.</P>
    <P>The London Dumping Convention provides for the restriction or prohibition of dumping of pollutants at sea.  At the ninth meeting of the Convention, in 1985, it was agreed that the 1982 moratorium be extended pending the completion of studies into the wider political, legal, economic and social aspects of radioactive waste dumping at sea.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by saying &mdash; notwithstanding some remarks made in this House earlier in relation to changes of policy, changes of course &mdash; that I believe this issue is way above and beyond normal day to day politics.  I take the issue very seriously on that basis.  I make no apology to anybody either in this House or in the country for the course of action I have pursued in which I was ably assisted by my former Minister of State, <Col N="1050" /> Deputy E. Collins, over recent years in regard to the fact that I was the first Minister of an Irish Government to take up this issue with the British Government.</P>
    <P>I reassure the House that the Government will continue at every possible opportunity to state their opposition to radioactive pollution of our seas.  I referred on a number of occasions to the fact that in the past we adopted a reasonable position with regard to the rights of other countries where their installations are concerned.  It must not be forgotten that we in this country have rights too.  The task of securing the objectives called for in these resolutions will not be an easy one.  We will have to mobilise every ounce of public opinion in this country and throughout Europe to achieve it.  The consensus in this House tonight is a rare one but on this vital issue it is a good start.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  As a member of the Science and Technology Committee I have campaigned in the Council of Europe since last March in regard to this very important matter.  I put down a motion calling for the support of 20 countries, including our own, for the closure of this plant.  I have not made the progress I would like to have made. At every meeting I attended I highlighted the issue.  I am glad to say that in January next year a meeting of all the countries involved in the Council of Europe will be held in Paris to discuss nuclear energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very prestigious committee of the House of Commons issued a report last March which stated that the Irish Sea is the most radioactive in the world.  A £1.4 billion plan to expand the plant at Sellafield should be abandoned unless an inquiry justifies the need for it.  The policy on disposing of radioactive waste was ill-managed, confused and secretive.  The report stated that the handling of the matter was haphazard.  Through neglect the management at the plant were the cause of a number of leaks at the plant. No matter what British Nuclear Fuels say in regard to the plant they are not <Col N="1051" /> believed or trusted any more.  <i>The Guardian</i> of Thursday, 22 May stated on the front page that a radioactive leak had taken place and had contaminated three of the workers at the plant.  British Nuclear Fuels would not have reported that if <i>The Guardian</i> had not already reported it.</P>
    <P>On 20 May at the request of the Council of Europe I prepared a memorandum on nuclear energy at that plant.  It was well received by other members of the Council of Europe.  We all know there is a vested interest in keeping this plant open.  It must be brought home to the British Government that the reactors at that plant are over 30 years in operation. Their lifespan and safety should be called into question.  I tried on a number of occasions to find out the position but I have been stonewalled on this issue. British Nuclear Fuels tried to cover up the position in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>We all know that days passed before the accident at Chernobyl was reported. It was the Swedish authorities who first realised something was wrong because of cloud and atmospheric conditions.  The Russians then notified other countries of the very serious accident which killed many people.  As we are aware, we are only 60 miles from Sellafield.  Any leakages, explosions or fallouts would have very serious consequences for agriculture and for our whole economy.  That should not be taken lightly.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government have come around to our way of thinking on this very important matter.  They realise that what we have been saying all along is correct.  I welcome the Government's response to the motion.  Everybody is open to human error and errors of judgment and I respect that.  I am glad this House is in agreement that this plant cannot remain open.  I will press the case in the Council of Europe.  I hope to get a debate on it in the Assembly and I am looking forward to that.  This plant is a great danger to our people and to the economic life of the country.  If a major accident occurs at that plant it will have serious consequences for us.</P>
    <Col N="1052" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the agreement of the Government in regard to this matter.  This issue transcends politics and it is accelerating at a pace that is not appreciated in the context of this debate this evening.  What is most important is the fact that while we are considering the lack of safety at the plant there is a proposal to expand it, the thermal oxide reprocessing programme, at a cost of between £3 billion and £4 billion over the next decade.  That programme has severe ramifications for Ireland.  I invite Members to consider the deadly nightmare it will involve.  That reprocessing plant in full operation will be carrying on a high risk industry that other countries are loath to get involved in.  It will involve five 3,000 tonne ships ferrying 100 tonne steel flasks of deadly nuclear waste along the Irish Sea.  At present the industry is a low key operation compared to what is envisaged by British Nuclear Fuels for the future.  A country that has shown scant regard for its own inhabitants could not be expected to show much regard for us.  In a nutshell, the policy of the industry is profits before people.</P>
      <P>The nuclear reprocessing industry is a highly profitable one.  It is almost a &ldquo;name your price&rdquo; industry and other countries as far away as Japan, India and so on who refuse to get involved in reprocessing their own nuclear waste have it reprocessed on our doorstep at the Sellafield nuclear dustbin.  The public relations campaign extolling the virtues of Sellafield as an acceptable industry within the Lake District in England is an insult to the intelligence of those subjected to watching it.  Those commercials are a complete fallacy about a deadly menace that can grow out of control so quickly. There is little doubt in mind that, if the Minister for Energy is to achieve anything in regard to that plant, he will have to move now and insist that the expansion plans earmarked for the plant are shelved.  The Government should make that call now because the damage is continuing at a dreadful pace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was shocked to hear that the Department of Energy were informed of nine incidents at the plant this year.  I accept <Col N="1053" /> that there has been a litany of incidents at the plant going back to 1947 but it is serious if nine incidents have occurred this year.  I believe we are at one in calling for the closure of this plant.  Employees working at that plant are at risk.  Reports in our newspapers to the effect that there is not any cluster of cancer sufferers living along the eastern sea board are quite erroneous because the closer one is to a nuclear reprocessing plant, or a reactor of this type, the higher the risk of cancer. The nearest village to Sellafield is at great risk.  It is difficult to monitor the extent of plutonium contamination without burning the corpse but it is accepted medically that there is no safe level of radiation.  Radiation leaks damage our fish stocks but the real issue in regard to Sellafield is the health of future generations. We are not only concerned about ourselves but also about the unknown risks of the cumulative effects of low dosage radiation on future generations on this planet.  We are obligated to maintain the planet in the condition we found it.</P>
    <P>Activities at Sellafield are shameful and we have to listen to insulting remarks by the British Minister for the Environment, Mr. Baker.  He described the fears expressed by people as being like those of medieval people who believed in witchcraft.  Margaret Thatcher accepts this as a safe industry and has said she is proud of it.  However, as soon as the holocaust of Chernobyl rivetted the minds of people into realising that there is no escape from this &ldquo;profits before people&rdquo; industry such as exists at Sellafield those people ran for cover.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that a report about the errors and defects in the construction of the reprocessing plant at what was then called Windscale about 50 years ago was suppressed before the <i>Daily Express</i> could publish it.  That report was suppressed under a &ldquo;D&rdquo; notice which restricted the press principally in relation to military matters but was extended to the nuclear energy industry. Sir Kelvin Spencer, former chief scientist to the British Ministry of Fuel Power, now known as the Department of <Col N="1054" /> Energy, said in an interview reported in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> on 3 June 1985 that in his opinion some spokesmen for the nuclear lobby misled the public to such an extent, particularly about the long term effects of plutonium radiation, that amounts to be lying.  Erroneous information was given to those responsible for preparing the Black report and as a result the report lapsed into disrepute.</P>
    <P>There is another side to this whole question of Sellafield which we, as an independent nation, must take cognisance of.  I am referring to the fact that that site will be a war target.  What future have we got if that plant is attacked?  It may be under threat of annihilation in the event of a limited nuclear war.  If it was attacked this country would be devastated.</P>
    <P>The amount of nuclear cargo in the Irish Sea will eventually write off that stretch of water and destroy our fish stocks.  I am not being alarmist because fishermen support that contention.  I never thought the European inspectorate force would succeed because those nations participating in such an inspection have a vested interest in the nuclear industry.  It was like the police examining themselves; there was nothing independent about that inspection whatever. The fact is that Sellafield, and the appalling amount of excessive radiation that escapes from it, would not be tolerated at other European installations.  I am sure the Minister for Energy will agree with that statement.  Cap La Hag is close to a sea that recycles itself a lot faster than the slow Irish Sea and the level of escape at Sellafield is far above the levels accepted in America.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a hazardously archaic system of nuclear reactors about which the chairman of the Nuclear Energy Board expressed concern and worry on medical grounds.  He also expressed concern about the possibility of a major accident or calamity taking place.  We should consider the litany of accidents that have taken place at Sellafield.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Control of Dogs Bill, 1986 [Seanad]:    Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="1055" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I finished speaking on the last occasion I had been saying that a further obstacle to effective enforcement of the existing control measures is the diffusion of responsibility between various Departments. The Bill, therefore, will entrust overall responsibility in the matter to the Minister for the Environment because of his involvement with local government, at which level the problems will be tackled on the ground.  The major local authorities, namely the 27 county councils and five county borough corporations together with Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation will administer the Act in their respective areas.</P>
      <P>This will involve licensing dogs appointing dog wardens and providing dog shelters.  The licence revenue which will accrue to the local authorities concerned in respect of dogs licensed in their respective areas is expected to be sufficient to cover the expenses incurred.  It is envisaged that local authority areas with small dog populations and consequently low revenue will make appropriate arrangements with adjoining authorities for the operation of joint schemes.  The intention is that the dog control measure will operate on a selffinancing basis.</P>
      <P>I think all genuine dog lovers will have no compunction about paying the licence fee when they will have tangible evidence that the money is being utilised for a proper system of dog control.  For some years the Department of the Environment have been encouraging local authorities to get involved in dog control and have been grant-aiding those who did get involved to the extent of 50 per cent of their costs.  For this year, a sum of £125,000 has been provided in the Department of the Environment Estimates for the purpose and it is estimated that sums of £175,000 in 1987 will also be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> At present 15 local authorities are involved actively in dog control and the powers which this Bill will give them will be of considerable help.  Most of these local authorities engage the services of the ISPCA, who operate on an agency basis for the authorities concerned.  It is proposed in the Bill to permit such arrangements to continue so that each local authority can decide to operate the scheme directly, or operate a joint scheme with another local authority, or have the scheme operated on their behalf by the ISPCA or other body concerned with animal welfare.</P>
    <P>While there are many owners who exercise proper care and control of their dogs and due consideration for their neighbours there are, unfortunately, some who let their dogs run wild.  This is the real problem and is the cause of sheep worrying, attacks on people, traffic accidents and so on.  Until we get the loose dogs off our lands and streets we will not solve the problem and accordingly the Bill proposes that a loose dog which is not accompanied by any person and is outside the confines of the land or premises where it is kept will be regarded as a stray dog and will be seized by a dog warden.  This is the core of the Bill and will give real teeth to those operating it.  While the aim of the dog wardens will be to encourage and advise on responsible dog ownership, I recognise that there are those who will ignore such advice and these people must be dealt with in a different way.</P>
    <P>In order to restrain impulsive buying of dogs, particularly as presents for children at Christmas and on other special occasions, I am providing in section 2 that a licence must be obtained in advance of the purchase of a dog.  The section accordingly will make it unlawful to purchase or sell a dog which is not covered by a licence.  We discussed this section at length in the Seanad where it was regarded as very important if the Act is to be effective.</P>
    <P>Section 8 specifies the licence fees which are unchanged at £5 for a dog licence and £100 for a general dog licence.  The Minister will have power to <Col N="1057" /> alter these rates by way of regulations or to specify different rates in respect of different classes of dogs.  While it is not intended to specify different rates in the immediate future, it is considered prudent to provide the necessary powers in case at some future date it is considered desirable to adjust licence fees to distinguish between different beeds or sizes of dogs or between sterilised and unsterilised dogs.</P>
    <P>Section 9 imposes an obligation on owners or other persons in charge of dogs to accompany them and keep them under effectual control when they are outside the confines of the premises where they are kept.  Therefore, persons who permit their dogs to wander around the streets or, in a rural area, to move off their land will commit an offence under the Act. The existing law, under the Dogs Order, 1966, provides for control of dogs between sunset and sunrise only.  The offence now being created is a new one, but it is essential that it be introduced if we are to have effective dog control. Wandering dogs, not under anybody's control, are a menace and are the cause of many serious incidents and their owners must be made accountable.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is aimed at providing effective powers for ridding our towns and countryside of stray dogs.  The existing law governing stray dogs is contained in the Dogs Act, 1906, and provides that a police officer who believes that a dog found in a highway or place of public resort is a stray dog may seize it.  As I have stated already, it is inappropriate that primary responsibility for enforcement of these provisions should rest with the Garda Síochána and the section accordingly provides that dog wardens shall take all reasonable steps to seize stray dogs.  This will impose an obligation on the warden to seize strays.  The Garda under this section will continue to be empowered to seize strays, but it is envisaged that with an effective dog warden service in operation the services of the Garda will be rarely required.  Section 15 imposes on each local authority the duty to employ at least one dog warden and to establish and maintain dog shelters.  A <Col N="1058" /> local authority will, however, be empowered to delegate the entire dog control function to the ISPCA or, with the consent of the Minister, to a body connected with animal welfare.  A local authority, again with the consent of the Minister, may delegate to any person the function of providing and running dog shelters and of dealing with the dogs therein.</P>
    <P>Section 17 authorises local authorities to make by-laws relating to the control of dogs within their functional areas. Depending on the situation locally, each authority will have its own priorities and may or may not wish to impose controls, additional to those in the Bill, within its own area or within particular locations. The section lists specific controls which an authority may introduce, namely, requiring a person to remove the faeces where a dog has fouled a public place, specifying areas where dogs must be kept on a leash or where dogs, other than guide dogs, would be prohibited altogether. The environmental and public health aspects of dog faeces in urban areas are of increasing public concern and some public authorities in other countries have taken action to tackle this problem. I conside it desirable, therefore, to provide this enabling power should any of our local authorities wish to take similar action.  I would like to emphasise that it is an enabling power and that the decisions in this area will rest with the elected representatives of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Opportunity is being taken in the Bill to increase the maximum fine for a conviction under the Protection of Animals Acts from £50 to £500 and this is provided for in section 20.  It is provided also that fines may be increased in future by way of regulations; such regulations would require the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>From an agricultural point of view, section 23 is important.  Under the law as it stands &mdash; Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act, 1960 &mdash; it is a good defence for shooting a dog if the defendant proves that the dog was shot when worrying livestock on agricultural land.  I now propose that this provision be widened to <Col N="1059" /> permit the shooting of dogs worrying or about to worry livestock no matter where they are and of stray dogs which had not left the vicinity where livestock had been injured or killed and which could not be seized or identified.</P>
    <P>Section 35 enables the Minister to extend the provisions of the Act relating to acceptance of unwanted dogs, the provision of shelters and the grant aiding of bodies providing shelters, to other pet animals.  The limited service operating in some local authorities at present for dog control is providing a very useful service by taking in large numbers of unwanted cats as well as dogs.  It is considered desirable, therefore, that the Bill should provide a statutory basis for that activity.  I wish to emphasise that there is no question of wardens being involved in the seizure of cats.  This provision is designed to facilitate the disposal of unwanted cats.</P>
    <P>These are the salient features of the Bill which I commend to the House and in so doing I would like to thank all those who have contributed in some way to the preparation of this Bill, particularly the National Action Committee on Dog Control, the ISPCA, the Irish Kennel Club and the Advisory Council on Animal Health.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I would like to compliment the Members of the other House on their helpful and constructive contributions and I hope we will have a similar type of debate in this House.  The Bill is long overdue.  There is a crying demand for it.  Each day as I open the paper I am terrified that I will see reports of this terrible saga that is happening year in and year out at about this time of the year of sheep being torn apart by ravaging dogs. I gave a commitment to the various groups of people, particularly those involved in sheep farming, to make a serious effort to conclude this Bill in time for the lambing season.  I will be putting pressure on the Whips &mdash; and I know I will have the co-operation of Deputy Noonan and those on the other side of the House &mdash; to get to Committee Stage <Col N="1060" /> hopefully next week and have the Bill concluded before the Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this legislation.  It is very detailed and wide-ranging and is badly needed in this area.  Everybody concerned in the drafting of this Bill is to be congratulated on some very fine work.</P>
      <P>I understand it was necessary to go back to Acts from the last century to ensure that the legislation before us takes into account all aspects of dog control and is not contrary to any Acts at present on the Statute Book.  The Bill brings together some very old legislation and makes some very important revisions and particularly provides for responsibility for the control of dogs to be put into the hands of local authorities.  This means that the Minister for the Environment will be responsible for overseeing the Act.  But it is to be noted also that the legislation is presented by the Minister for Agriculture. I suppose in other countries where agriculture is of far less importance than it is here a Bill of this kind would be promoted by a Minister other than the Minister for Agriculture.  It is a measure of our interest in dogs and their close and sometimes not very happy connection with agriculture that it is the Minister for Agriculture who is promoting this Bill and that I, as Opposition spokesperson on Agriculture, am welcoming it here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill goes a long way towards meeting the demands of this party.  I will be making some suggestions to the Minister and we will be putting down amendments on Committee Stage.  My first reaction when I saw the Bill was to think in terms of the need for continuing protection of livestock, particularly sheep, from the ravages of dogs.  Note that I do not say savage dogs but simply dogs because, as we all know, a dog or group of dogs can cause terrible destruction to lambs or any class of sheep and they are frequently dogs whose owners see them as doing no wrong.  There is need to control dogs in the interests of livestock farmers, particularly sheep farmers, and I know that is <Col N="1061" /> uppermost in the mind of the Minister. Sheep numbers have increased in the past number of years and I look forward to some further increase in their numbers in the years ahead.  I suppose there is now a need to branch into alternative or supplementary forms of farming especially because of the unfortunate restrictions which are being imposed and which I am sorry to say look as if they may be imposed further in the milk and beef sector.  Therefore, sheep can offer a good alternative use of farm land and farming skills.  If only for the sake of sheep, this legislation in regard to dogs is very necessary.</P>
    <P>However, even if these worries about sheep were not foremost in my mind, on reading the details about the number of dogs in the country and how few of them are licensed, I would recommend this Bill very strongly.  The Minister has stated in his contribution here to the House that something in the region of 300,000 dogs are estimated to be in the country and that of this huge number only approximately 80,000 had licences taken out in respect of them in 1985.  In this regard the existing law about dog licences is truly worrying and makes it all the more necessary that there be much stricter control than we have had up to now.</P>
    <P>I agree that the local authorities are the people to do the job and as a member of a local authority I have repeatedly advocated this as a very useful exercise for a local authority.  It is an exercise which certainly will demand control and, as the Minister pointed out in his contribution, will ensure that the elected members of those authorities will have certain powers within this legislation to introduce by-laws as the case may be. Some local authorities have already appointed dog wardens and from the information that I have been getting, the operation of these dog wardens by the local authorities is satisfactory.  Some fine work is being done.  Wicklow is a case in point.  I have been there and I have spoken to the members of the local authorities and the officials there and they told me that the operation of their dog <Col N="1062" /> warden service is welcomed by all concerned. I hope now with this legislation going through the House that the appointment of dog wardens and the construction of dogs' homes will be extended to all parts of the country.  Not only will proper enforcement of this Bill when it becomes law benefit livestock owners but it will benefit everybody.  I am thinking in terms of the general environment and the damage that can be done by stray dogs.  There have been very unfortunate cases.  In certain circumstances dogs can present a very serious health risk in addition to what has already been referred to, dogs worrying sheep.  Here is an added opportunity to ensure that stray dogs particularly, of which there are far too many, will not be causing a risk to health in humans and in animals.</P>
    <P>Of course, we must keep in mind that neglect of the law in regard to dogs or failure to bring that law up to date can be a cause of cruelty for the unfortunate dogs which stray or are allowed to stray without enough to eat or proper shelter. As every farmer knows, a properly trained, well controlled and well looked after dog can be of great help in the management of livestock and dogs can give companionship to all kinds of people, young and old.</P>
    <P>The key section in the Bill of the new controls is the appointment of dog wardens by the local authorities and the possibility for local authorities to put up shelters for dogs which are a necessary part of that control.  I agree also with the provision in the Bill for local authorities to make arrangements with other bodies to take over part of their functions in regard to the operation of the Bill.  Here I ask the Minister to spell out in a little more detail what exactly he has in mind. Will it be the decision of the local authority to hand over their function or part of their function to the other bodies as he has pointed out, or will it be necessary at all times to do that?  The purpose of the Bill is to enable the local authorities to appoint dog wardens.  If some of these functions are handed over to other bodies, who will operate the functions of the dog warden?  Who will control the <Col N="1063" /> dog warden?  What statutory power would those bodies have to carry out the functions as laid out in the Bill?</P>
    <P>While I welcome the fact that maybe there are opportunities for the powers to be delegated, I am concerned that the functions delegated under this Bill will not be carried out as they should be.  If the local authorities find that the delegated functions are not being carried out, can they stop the withdrawal of those functions and if they do, will it cause problems? These bodies to a large extent are voluntary bodies which can have either good or bad officer boards.  This is something that should be tightened up on Committee Stage.  I am glad the Garda Síochána will retain their powers in relation to dogs although, if the local authorities are doing their work as they should, the Garda will not have a lot of their time taken up in controlling dogs. It is a good idea that local authorities should make arrangements with other bodies and with other local authorities in relation to controlling dogs.  I welcome this, bearing in the mind the precautions I have just outlined.  The ISPCA and many other societies have done fine work in this area.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that the law is enforced and that concern is shown for animals.  I hope the local authorities will take their obligations under this Bill seriously as it is important to enforce the legislation.  In the early years the Exchequer will make grants to local authorities to enable them to operate the Act. There are a number of Acts empowering the local authorities to do certain things but more often than not we find that the local authorities are not provided with the necessary finance.  When replying will the Minister outline in more detail his intention with regard to grants under this legislation?  It might be necessary to include this in the Bill, but we can work that out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that eventually this legislation will be self-financing but it would be a pity if it fell now through lack of finance.  If the finance to be provided <Col N="1064" /> were written into the Bill, the Minister for Finance would have no alternative but to provide the necessary funding.  I hope the revenue from dog licensing will be collected to enable the legislation to become self-financing in a short time. People who wish to keep dogs should be responsible for the financing of the controls and people who have no interest in dogs should not be at a financial disadvantage. However, I accept that in the early years of the new controls the local authorities will have to be given sufficient funding to implement the controls.</P>
    <P>This is a valuable Bill which should be given the publicity it deserves.  One can have a very good product but unless it is marketed properly it will not sell.  The same could be said for this legislation.  It will not work unless it is properly publicised. The Minister should increase public awareness of the problems and of the new controls.  The production of an annual report would keep up the public awareness of the need for the controls. In about 12 months after this Bill is passed we should have a progress report from the local authorities relating to the appointment of dog wardens and the result of their work should be made known.  The local authorities should report to the Minister for the Environment and perhaps the Minister would publish once a year an account from each local authority on the basis of precise questions as to their activities under the Act.  I do not suggest that my point about publicity should be included in the Bill. Perhaps the Minister will consider putting in a new section providing for an annual report which we consider necessary to ensure that progress will be made under various local authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that a local authority may, with the consent of the Minister, enter into arrangements with any other person for the issue of licences on their behalf.  I am a little concerned about what is involved here.  I am not very keen on the idea that some undefined person or persons could be given the work of issuing and collecting fees on behalf of the local authorities.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the position in that regard.  I know <Col N="1065" /> there is a precedent in the system under which rates are collected by local authorities but this section raises some questions. Will there be a single type licence for the whole country?  Is there a risk that if the issue of licences is given to different classes of person there may be a certain amount of confusion about who has a licence or whether they are valid&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I am merely making a passing reference.  What about the ease with which people may take out licences?  The Minister should take all these questions into consideration when replying to the debate.</P>
      <P>One must also consider that only 80,000 of the 700,000 dogs in the country are licensed and, therefore, we should not create difficulties in connection with getting a dog licence.  Indeed we should do all we can to encourage people to license their dogs and such licences should still be available at post offices. Perhaps the Minister would consider a general arrangement whereby An Post would co-operate in this regard.  Will the practice of buying dog licences in post offices cease after the introduction of this legislation?  An Post should have a personal and keen interest in the enforcement of this legislation because unfortunate postmen have been the victims of dogs in the past&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Serious injuries have not been caused to postmen as a rule but, nevertheless, they have been attacked.  Deputy Byrne mentioned thick skinned politicians but I am lucky, as all dogs like me.  It was suggested to me recently that dogs do not like people in uniform and that is why they attack postmen.  I hope the Minister will make an approach to An Post to continue the <Col N="1066" /> arrangements in regard to buying dog licences at post offices.</P>
      <P>By law, dogs are required to wear collars and identification tags.  However, the law in this regard is not always observed and great stress should be placed on this aspect of owning a dog.  Anybody who has regard for a dog will provide a collar and so on which could save a lot of trouble &mdash; perhaps even the life of a dog &mdash; if it strays accidentally.  I hope that the dog wardens to be appointed by local authorities will ensure that people comply with the law.</P>
      <P>I am glad the existing provisions in the Bill regarding the liability of an owner whose dog damages livestock will still prevail.  I am also pleased that the provision first brought in under the Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act, 1960, regarding the shooting of dogs worrying livestock is also being continued.  One would wish to avoid shooting a dog, if possible, but it is unavoidable in certain circumstances.  I refer specifically to the terrible damage done to sheep by dogs.</P>
      <P>Another point worth mentioning is that regulations to control rabies are provided for under the diseases of animals legislation operated by the Minister for Agriculture. I am glad that these controls will continue.  Should the scourge of rabies ever come into this country this Bill will provide a very effective means of supplementing the controls in that other legislation.</P>
      <P>Before concluding there are a few other points I would like to refer to and I would ask the Minister to consider these very carefully.  There is a very worthwhile association who provide dogs for the blind.  The training of dogs is very necessary to enable blind people to get about. I am not saying that this should be written into the Bill but I am saying that some consideration might be given when legislation gets off the ground to ensuring that some of the revenue from the collection of the licence fee goes to that organisation who train dogs for the blind.  Perhaps grants could be made available to encourage them to expand their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume that the £100 licence fee mentioned by the Minister enables a <Col N="1067" /> licence holder to keep as many dogs as he considers necessary, including greyhounds. Can the Minister tell the House how long the grant aid will be in operation? Will it be in operation until such time as he or the Minister for the Environment is satisfied that the scheme as operated by the local authorities is self-financing? In addition to what I have already stated it is important that the necessary finance be made available initially in order to get the legislation off the ground.  The farming organisations generally welcome this legislation.  As the lambing season is now approaching it is necessary that the legislation be in operation in order to ensure that there be less ravaging and fewer killings of sheep.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister tell the House if the grant system to enable local authorities to erect dog shelters will continue?  There are very few dog shelters in the country. It is very difficult to procure a site for a dog shelter.  People either in a housing estate or elsewhere would not like to have dog kennels located beside them.  Dog shelters are necessary and I hope the necessary finance will be made available. Perhaps the Minister will outline in his reply the number of local authorities who have availed of the grants in recent years. The estimated figure for grants is in the region of £200,000.  This would suggest that there are very few shelters being erected and put into operation.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the present dog licence fee of £5 is being continued.  I think this is sufficient.  The provisions of the Bill might not be as effective if the licence fee was out of reach of many dog owners.  It is essential that every dog owner ensures that his dog is licensed.  I expect there will be a demand in certain instances that dogs belonging to the elderly, for instance, be exempt from the licence fee but that is something we might consider on Committee Stage.  Perhaps such a measure would be very difficult to implement but it should be considered.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister spell out in detail what the powers of the Garda Síochána will be in regard to the seizure of dogs? What will be their relationship with the <Col N="1068" /> dog wardens, who are to be appointed by the local authorities?  Will the Garda and the dog wardens work in tandem?  As I said, the Bill is a very good one.  This is a very necessary piece of legislation. There is an undoubted need in the interests of human health and of the environment to do something about the many stray dogs which are wandering the streets and countryside.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister and his colleagues in the various Departments who have assisted him in putting together this very fine piece of draft legislation.  I wish it a successful passage through the House.  We will be tabling a number of amendments on Committee Stage designed to strengthen the Bill and to make it more progressive. I know these amendments will be acceptable to the Minister and that together we can enact legislation which will be acceptable, effective and positive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on its introduction. It has already passed through the Seanad and we all hope it will have a speedy passage and soon become law. It is appropriate that this Bill is being introduced at this time and I hope it will be signed by the President before the next lambing season.  We can all recall harrowing tales and television pictures of marauding dogs worrying sheep every spring.  It is estimated that the loss to sheep farmers caused by stray dogs is in the region of £3,000 per annum.  That is a significant amount of money when one considers that the sheep sector of farming is worth well over £50 million to the economy each year and contributes significantly to our exports.  We have a duty to do everything we can to protect that sector.  At present dogs roaming around in packs are causing much damage and consequent expense to farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the measures incorporated in this Bill are taken from the report issued by the interdepartmental committee set up in 1983 under the chairmanship of the Department of Agriculture.  The Departments of Health, Finance and the Environment were also represented on the <Col N="1069" /> committee.  Recommendations have been made on many occasions by the national sheep committee of the IFA. Some of those recommendations were made when Conal Boyle from my county was chairman of that committee.  He is delighted that this Bill is at last going through the House.</P>
    <P>The number of dogs in the country at present is estimated to be in excess of 600,000 or 700,000, while only about 80,000 are licensed.  Obviously there is an urgent need for this Bill.  The entire revenue from dog licences in 1985 was £400,000.  Had licences been bought for all dogs the figure would have been in the region of £2.5 million.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill the control of dogs is being largely taken from the Garda and given to dog wardens.  The Bill states that local authorities may employ dog wardens to provide and maintain shelters. It is essential that dog wardens are provided with training and instruction and that their work be done under proper supervision.  I welcome the fact that these people will be responsible for this work because the Garda have quite enough to do in dealing with lawlessness and crime. Nevertheless it is proper that the Garda should have a say in the implementation of the law.  It is desirable that there should be close co-operation between the Garda and the dog wardens when appointed. The duplication of function with regard to keeping a register of stray dogs could cause confusion unless there is an exchange of information and co-operation between the wardens and the Garda.</P>
    <P>When the Bill is in operation the revenue will be used first of all to pay for the dog wardens appointed by the local authorities and the money will also go towards the provision of dog shelters in local authority areas.  A number of local authorities have already provided shelters and others are looking at sites which would be suitable for shelters when this Bill comes into operation.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals with the identification of dogs.  It is very important that dogs should always wear collars, not only for the protection of people but for the <Col N="1070" /> protection of the dog itself.  If a stray dog is wearing a collar efforts can be made to return it to its proper owner.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the damage that has been done to sheep but we should not forget that cattle can also be worried by stray dogs, especially when they are operating in packs.  This can cause premature births and abortions.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a definite step in the right direction and I hope it will be in force before the coming season.  I am sure the eyes of the farming community are upon us and they are hoping that this measure will be speedily implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I am delighted to see it before the House. All of us, particularly those in the agricultural scene, will be well aware of the scandal of the lack of control of dogs. Things have been getting worse over the past ten years.  The Minister admitted in his speech that we are not sure how many dogs there are in the country because as yet there has been no census of the dog population.  Perhaps we should commission the Minister's party to carry out such a census during the next election because I am fairly sure that every dog in the country will be put upon them.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing in this Bill.  Up to now my party as well as the other parties have probably hidden behind the fact that the matter concerned the Departments of Justice, of the Environment and of Agriculture.  I am delighted that it is now under the control of the Department of the Environment solely.  I hope that this Bill has a speedy passage through the House.  Enormous damage has been done throughout the years by marauding dogs.  There has been damage to humans, not alone in being bitten but, as mentioned by the Minister, in dogs being the cause of toxocara canis, an ailment from which I suffered very recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the infection came from dogs.  I have been bitten on many an occasion and I have <Col N="1071" /> had to suffer on.  Children, particularly, are very vulnerable.  They are vulnerable because of the people I would regard as rogue owners who keep dogs for no good reason and let them run loose without any regard for the safety of children or adults.</P>
      <P>The greatest cost to the State is in the loss of sheep.  Deputy McGinley mentioned a figure of £3,000 per annum.  I am sure he did not mean that to be a reference countrywide; perhaps he was speaking about Donegal.  That figure is far too low for the loss of income to farmers around the country.  I agree with him about the harrowing scenes we have seen on television and on films.  To see sheep mauled and killed in fields is an absolute disgrace.  This happens particularly in and around towns.  I am quite blunt in saying that some dog owners in towns apparently show scant regard for the sheep population.  They do not understand the agony and hardship caused to all concerned.  We have heard of sheep farmers in Wicklow and in my own county living close to towns who had to get out of that business because of the losses incurred by marauding dogs.  That is why I welcome the very strong statement of the Minister that an almost shoot-on-sight policy can be adopted.  The softly, softly approach is just not on.</P>
      <P>We must agree that a dog can be a man's best friend, but a dog can be one hell of an enemy, also.  If a farmer, seeing his sheep being mauled or killed, was not allowed to shoot on sight, this Bill would have no teeth.  I am glad that that is not the case and I support that aspect more strongly than any other in the Bill.  I am delighted that the Minister has had the courage to stand up to those who might be a little squeamish about that suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The licensing of dogs is very important. Only about 12 per cent of dogs are licensed at present and increasing the licence fee from £5 would have no bearing whatsoever on the control of dogs.  I am glad that the fee is being left as it is, but the provision being left in the Bill for a future increase is as it should be.  Those who are good enough to license their dogs <Col N="1072" /> probably look after their animals.  It is the other owners whom we want to get after.  I am interested to note that the county councils will be collecting the money.  I presume to use for their own funds.  I hope that this proposal will become self-financing.  As county councils are being run at present, they would not mind if it were a little better than self-financing.  There are a great many potholes in Wexford and if dog licence fees fill them, that is all to the good.  I should like to see money coming from somewhere.</P>
    <P>We all should compliment the ISPCA for their tremendous work down through the years.  This is mostly on a voluntary basis.  I was speaking to a dog warden in Wexford recently who does his work in his own time, completely voluntarily.  It is heartening that there are still people prepared to give their time and energy to such a deserving cause.  These people do absolutely excellent work and must be complimented.  Those who have done such work in the past must be considered for positions such as will be offered in the future.  On a voluntary basis they provide shelter and they collect the dogs.  The person to whom I was speaking told me that he collects about 100 dogs per week some of which are put down and some of which are given out to deserving owners. It is interesting to note the amount of work that these people put into the selection of those to whom dogs will be given. That is vitally important.  Dogs cannot be given out willy-nilly: that a person shows an interest in a dog as a present for a son or daughter at Christmas is not enough. I am not sure if from now on when purchasing a dog it will be necessary that the dog would have to be licensed.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to clarify subsection (2) of section 16 when replying. It is suggested there that the dog warden, in exercising a power of entry into any premises in pursuance of this Act, may bring with him into such premises such other persons as he believes to be necessary. I am sure it is not the Army that is being spoken of there.  What exactly has the Minister in mind?</P>
    <P>Rabies may not be the concern of the <Col N="1073" /> Bill, but it certainly is concerned with dogs.  I hope that this country will always remain free of that disease.  Whatever it takes to keep the country rabies-free will have the support of this side of the House. However stiff the penalties might be, we would agree with them.  We should do everything within our power to ensure that this disease does not enter the country.</P>
    <P>Finally, my greatest fear is that this Bill, having gone through the House with the support of every Member, will be put on the shelf and forgotten.  Let it be a success.  Whatever is needed to ensure its success must be done.  If it takes some extra money next year over what is being provided now, that extra money should be provided.  Let us not short change on the good work which has been done within the Bill.  I would regard that as penny wise and pound foolish.  I am delighted to see this Bill, which is long overdue. It certainly will have the support of everybody on this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill and welcome it.  While I have reservations about a few sections of it, it is true that dogs have caused havoc and many worried nights, not alone to sheep and cattle, but to the unfortunate farmers who have had to stay up all night on occasions to mind their stock.  In my county, as Deputy Noonan would agree, we have had sad experiences of terrible ravages on cattle and sheep.  This has caused great concern to all of us and great loss to the farming community.</P>
      <P>The roaming dog is always a danger to a child.  The child is more vulnerable because he does not understand the nature of the animal.  There is a tendency that the child will play with a dog with the result that the child could be bitten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dog was used to bring in cattle and to turn in sheep.  That was natural.  Dogs were pets, but now dogs are kept to defend not alone property but the lives of their owners.  I am not sure about the true definition of &ldquo;control&rdquo;.  I have in mind a coursing field where dogs are slipped. No matter how one looks at it, that coursing field is a public place because <Col N="1074" /> there can be anything from 1,200 to 2,000 people present.  I admit this is a technical point but I am worried that this law might be so rigid that it could result in dog owners being prosecuted for not keeping their dogs under control because when dogs are chasing a hare they are very excited.</P>
    <P>Unwanted dogs can be handed over to the local authority.  Their function is to have the dogs put down in humane manner but I wonder if the local authorities are equipped to carry out such duties.  The Minister has covered many of the areas I wished to raise, but there are just a few points I am not too happy about.  Section 4 reads:</P>
    <P>A local authority shall not issue a dog licence or a general dog licence to any person who&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  is under the age of sixteen years, or</P>
    <P>(b)  is disqualified, pursuant to section 18 of this Act, from keeping a dog.</P>
    <P>A number of dogs are raced in this country. The owner of this year's Derby winner comes from my area and is under 16 years of age.  Could a person under the age of 16 who is the registered owner of the dog be prosecuted, if the dog licence is taken out by his father?  I am not trying to make a case for or against this but I am raising this technical point.</P>
    <P>Section 10 (1) reads:</P>
    <P>A person shall not permit a greyhound to be in any public place unless such greyhound is being led by means of a sufficiently strong chain or leash.</P>
    <P>That rule could infringe the regulation dealing with dog title.  I am sure the Minister of State knows the answers to these queries, but I want to know exactly what this means in case I am asked about it at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Section 11 (7) reads:</P>
    <P>Five days following the making of an entry in the register pursuant to subsection (6) of this section, or following the giving of a notice pursuant <Col N="1075" /> to subsection (4) of this section, whichever is the later, the local authority, or the Superintendent of the Garda Síochána, as the case may be, if no person has been given the dog pursuant to subsection (5) of this section and paid all expenses relating to its seizure and detention, may, subject to subsection (8) of this section, dispose of the dog or arrange for its destruction in a humane manner.</P>
    <P>I am not happy that five days is an adequate period because a description of the dog should appear in the local papers, if not the national papers.  People become very attached to their pets.  I am very attached to dogs; I have three.  Dogs are not able to defend themselves and it is only right that the dog should have the right to survival if he is not guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 21 reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  The owner of a dog shall be liable in damages for damage caused in an attack on any person by the dog and for injury done by it to any livestock;</P>
    <P>I am not too sure that is right.  Say I am an old person living alone and I have my dog.  If an intruder comes in the door or window at night, or if he is outside the house when I let the dog out at 11 p.m. and the dog doing his duty as a watch dog and in defence of my life and property, bites the intruder, would it not be cruel if I were taken into court because the dog bit the intruder who was looking for an opportunity not alone to take my property but to take my life?  There should be a definite area where an unwelcome guest or intruder could be tackled by the dog without the owner being brought into court because the dog was doing his duty.  There should be some protection for the dog owner, and the dog.  There should be an area where the dog should be allowed to protect his owner.  This is an area which the Minister might take a look at.</P>
    <P>Section 26 reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  If a Justice of the District Court or a Peace Commissioner is satisfied by <Col N="1076" /> the information on oath of a member of the Garda Síochána that there were reasonable grounds for believing that &mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a dog has attacked a person or has worried livestock, and</P>
    <P>(b)  in consequence of the attack or the worrying, the owner of the dog has committed an offence under this Act, and</P>
    <P>(c)  a person is in possession in any premises of a dog which the member of the Garda Síochána has reasonable grounds for believing to be the dog involved in the said attack or the said worrying,</P>
    <P>I agree with that if the dog can be positively identified, but gardaí and chief superintendents at times find it very difficult to identify people, and I am sure it is much simpler to identify a person than a dog.  Many difficulties arise about the identification of dogs.  Many are the same colour and it could be the word of a garda against that of the owner of the dog because the owner of the dog could have it locked in at the time of investigation. I should like to know how any garda, garda superintendent or warden could identify any dog as the one he saw going through a field or the one that passed him.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because its provisions are absolutely essential.  I congratulate the Minister of State who has discussed its provisions on many occasions with many of us.  I am quite satisfied they will serve their purpose. Perhaps the Minister could reply to the few points I have made which are of concern to me.</P>

      <P>In welcoming its provisions Members reflected what would be regarded as a universal feeling throughout the country &mdash; this would go for urban as well as rural areas &mdash; that something had to be done about the menace of roaming or stray dogs.  The provisions of the Bill provide an effective course of action in a practical, common sense approach to the problem.  The goodwill towards its provisions must be capitalised on.  We must capitalise on the fact that we have introduced a Bill that people want.  The best way to do that, in compliance with the wishes of both sides of the House, is to implement its provisions as fully as possible and as quickly as possible.  As a society it can be said that undoubtedly we have allowed our standards to slip in our handling of man's best friend.  If as a result of the implementation of the provisions of the Bill we get quick results, the obvious merit of a properly controlled dog population should prevent any return to the existing low standards.  It is to be hoped that the impetus provided by the introduction of the Bill will be maintained.</P>
      <P>It would be remiss of me not to mention the wonderful work done on a voluntary basis by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in relation to dog control over the years.  Their approach to the problem has provided a model and pointed the way in which the Government should act.  Therefore, it is not surprising that, of the 15 local authorities who have already dog control schemes in operation, 13 have elected to operate those schemes through the agency of the ISPCA.  Society owes a debt of gratitude to that association for their work over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan asked a question about such schemes.  For example, a <Col N="1078" /> scheme is being operated in Dublin city and county, Wicklow, Carlow-Kilkenny, south Tipperary, Waterford city and county, Kerry, Cork city and county, Sligo, Louth and Longford and there are a number of other areas operating a limited service as well.</P>
    <P>The training of dog wardens was mentioned by a number of Deputies.  This is a matter that need not be included in the provisions of the Bill as training for the job will be part and parcel of a warden's conditions of employment and will be dealt with administratively.  It is the intention that wardens, in all cases, will be properly trained.  I understand also that the ISPCA, which will have an important role to play in the operation of the provisions of the Bill, will be providing a handbook for wardens when the Bill is passed which should prove to be a useful aid.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not something hypothetical; it is in place already and we can envisage its provisions in operation.  It is easily known that Deputy W. O'Brien comes from the Clounanna areas which has encountered some problems.  He mentioned ownership of a dog by a 16-year-old. We had a lengthy debate on this aspect in the Seanad.  I should say there is nothing to prevent a 16-year-old from owning a dog.  A 16-year-old may own and show a dog and take the dog abroad to shows, but it is vital that the licence be in the hands of an adult, the normal practice being in the hands of the parents. However, ownership is a different matter.</P>

      <P>Not the owner in the case of a junior.  Deputy W. O'Brien raised a <Col N="1079" /> point about a householder under section 3.  Of course a householder is not liable if his dog attacks an intruder.  He is liable only if he is negligent, allows the dog to wander around and bite somebody on the street.  If the dog is protecting the owner and his property he is fully entitled to his bite.</P>
      <P>Originally the Seanad proposed that seven days be allowed to arrange for the disposal of a dog but as a result of representations by, I think, Senator Hussey, we decided that in these modern days of communications five days were ample. Under the provisions of the 1906 Act it was seven days; now it has been brought down to five days.  I do not see any point in changing it back again.</P>
      <P>Again, Deputy W. O'Brien raised a point about a coursing field.  A coursing field is not a public place.  The public have no right to enter the field where the coursing is being carried on.  They are confined to the viewing area which is a public place.  Again, in response to a point made by Deputy W. O'Brien, I should say that local authorities, with their dog wardens and shelters, will be fully equipped to put down dogs humanely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy H. Byrne sought clarification of section 16 (2) where a dog warden in exercising a power of entry into any premises may bring a person with him. We envisage there a dog warden bringing a veterinary surgeon onto a property where dogs are kept.  That is what we had in mind there.  Again, remaining with Deputy H. Byrne, it was interesting to note that a part-time dog warden in Wexford was capable of collecting 100 dogs and that all told &mdash; even under a voluntary scheme &mdash; 30,000 were collected last year.  This shows the advantage of a proper scheme.  I agree with him in regard to rogue owners.  The basic problem is that these people have a total disregard for other people's rights.  The purpose of the Bill is to remedy that.  I take Deputy McGinley's point that cattle have been attacked.  It has caused a lot of problems with dairy heifers and dairy cows.  Sheep <Col N="1080" /> are also included in the Bill by definition of livestock.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan in regard to a publicity campaign.  We are already engaging in a publicity campaign.  Very shortly a very good television advertisement on dog control will be shown. Some dogs can be very friendly but at night when they join up with other dogs they become ferocious animals who do a lot of damage.  When they return home their manner changes again.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan that the position in regard to dog collars has been more honoured in the breach than in the observance.  With a good supply of dog wardens there should not be any problem in that regard in future.  Deputy Noonan also mentioned delegating to An Post the collection of dog licence fees.  That would be up to the local authorities.  We are trying to keep this Bill as simple and as tidy as possible to allow local authorities a certain amount of latitude as to how they will collect dog licences.  More than likely they will be collected through An Post because there is a post office in every village.  They would be the obvious people to carry out that sort of work. Deputy Noonan also expressed concern about the different types of licences.  The Bill proposes that the Minister for the Environment will lay down the format of the licence which will be uniform throughout the country no matter which local authority issues it.  For example, if a licence is taken out in Dún Laoghaire it will be valid throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been quite a lot of advertising. In regard to rabies, there are advertisements at all the points of entry. Even in small fishing ports there is an awareness of the danger of rabies and uncontrolled dogs.  Without making the Bill too leadránach we hope local authorities will set up small committees which will work in conjunction with the sheep <Col N="1081" /> dipping committees to deal specifically with dog control.  They would have their own local publicity campaigns.  On a county-by-county and a borough-by-borough basis they could issue their own reports which could be co-ordinated through the General Council of County Councils of Agriculture.  I do not think it is necessary that the issuing of an annual report be included in the Bill.  We are devolving the whole function of dog control to local authorities.  I would like to think that local representatives would be interested enough to insist that this is done properly and to the satisfaction of the public.</P>
    <P>The grants I referred to in my opening remarks are made by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, to local authorities for the provision of dog and cat pounds.  I am anxious that this financial support should continue for a limited period to ensure that the provision under section 33 can be brought into being quickly and effectively.  In certain areas the problems are comparatively small but in Dublin the problem is massive.  It will be up to each local authority to submit their requirements in that regard.  In regard to the powers being retained by the Garda, Deputy Noonan is correct when he says that in future the Garda Síochána will not be very involved in dog control.  The purpose of the legislation is to provide an alternative control system and not merely a back-up system for the Garda.  We are talking about a new system but on occasion it could be necessary for the Garda to become involved in some aspects of dog control, perhaps in connection with a crime.</P>
    <P>In regard to the point about local authorities exercising control over the bodies to which these functions are delegated, the provision in section 15 is that local authorities will make their own arrangements with such bodies.  In most cases it is the ISPCA that are involved.  If the local authorities are not satisfied with the position, they will have to rely on whatever arrangement they make to protect themselves and I am sure they will do so. It will be their duty to ensure that they <Col N="1082" /> will be able to correct matters if they go wrong.  I have no doubt they will do so.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank Members from both sides of the House for their very constructive remarks.  I look forward to Committee Stage.  It is the wish of everybody, certainly the sheep farmers, that this Bill will be in operation in time for the lambing season.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for giving me an opportunity to raise this very important matter that affects more than 200 people.  I feel strongly about this as I am sure other Members do.  At this stage most people are aware of the background to the virtual closure of Hospitals' Trust.  It is worth recording that at one time Hospitals' Trust employed more than 2,000 people. At that time there was not the same amount of competition in the form of <Col N="1083" /> pools, draws and lotteries.  Hospitals' Trust had the field to themselves in those days and as well as creating a lot of employment they gave in the region of £55 million to the hospital fund.  Obviously, that took a tremendous weight off the shoulders of taxpayers as many hospitals had projects funded by Hospitals' Trust.</P>
      <P>The announcement last year of the Government's intention to run a State lottery caused a lot of worry to the promoters of the Sweep.  Having considered the matter Hospitals' Trust decided to cancel their operations in January last. At that time the 200 permanent workers were laid off.  They were not made redundant and they have not been told if work will be available for them in the future. Since then those people have registered as unemployed persons but still harbour the hope that some day they will be re-employed by Hospitals' Trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that during the year a number of proposals were put to the Minister for Justice.  When I questioned the Minister about this in the House he gave me certain information but subsequently he saw fit to reject the proposals put forward by Hospitals' Trust.  He may have had good reasons for doing that and in my view the proposals submitted to him were not 100 per cent.  I can understand the Minister's reason for rejecting that application.  However, nothing was done to ease the lot of the employees laid off since January.  Those people did not receive any redundancy payments or information about their future.  Most of them are women who have given tremendous service to their employers.  Many of them worked with that concern for between 30 and 40 years.  It is worth noting that there was never a strike or trade dispute at Hospitals Trust and the employees have always been very loyal to the concern.  One can understand why those people feel betrayed by management. Many of the employees had planned their future and gone so far as to plan for their retirement.  It is sad that they should have been let go with one hour's notice without any hope for the <Col N="1084" /> future.  The position in regard to those people is urgent because as they have been unemployed for almost 12 months they will shortly find their unemployment benefits reduced substantially.  When that occurs they will face serious problems.  In fact, many of them will have to consider disposing of their homes.  This is unjust.</P>
    <P>I understand that the chief executive sought a meeting with the Minister on a number of occasions, according to information given to me by that individual.  I must add that it was four months after the closure before the chief executive had an opportunity to discuss the matter with the Minister.  The property occupied by Hospitals' Trust is owned by the State and is on a 14-year lease from the State.  It is estimated that the property could fetch in the region of £15 million on the open market and, being adjacent to the headquarters of Allied Irish Banks and the grounds of the Royal Dublin Society, it is in an attractive location.  I have no doubt that if it was put on the market there would be a big demand for it.  One puzzling aspect about this is that while a sweepstake has not been held since 1985 and 200 employees were let go in January last, 26 employees remain working with the concern.  I do not know what they are doing but, obviously, expenditure is still high.  The company are still running a number of cars and there are a number of large expense accounts.  However, the output is almost nil.  The only matter those employees seem to be involved in is preparing proposals to put to the Minister for the future.  Is the Minister able to throw some light on that?</P>
    <P>Can the Minister establish if Hospitals' Trust will function in the future?  If they do not what will be the position in regard to redundancy payments to the employees?  I understand that negotiations have been going on between the Minister, Hospitals' Trust and other parties for the sale of the lease on the property. Obviously that will result in the concern getting some money and I hope that is put aside for the benefit of those who have lost their jobs.  It is the responsibility of the Minister to ensure that justice is done in this case.  Those faithful <Col N="1085" /> employees have been dumped without any information as to where they go from here.  I had hoped that with the setting up of the national lottery employment could have been found for many of those employees but, unfortunately, that was not the case.  It is regrettable that no additional employment will be created by such a major project.  However, one effect of the national lottery will be to put hundreds of people who gave excellent service to Hospitals' Trust out of a job.</P>
    <P>I accept that to a large extent this is outside the control of the Minister but I presume he is in constant negotiation with the management of Hospitals Trust, I should like to refer to a letter I received from the chief executive of Hospitals' Trust on 15 October.  In the course of it he says that the position regarding the employees of Hospitals' Trust Ltd. who are at present laid off is a continuing cause of concern, particularly in regard to their unemployment benefits.  He said the company were endeavouring to ascertain from the Government what type of operation they would be willing to let the company pursue but so far the information had been largely contradictory except in so far as the company had been told that they could not operate a scheme that might be in competition with the national lottery.  I will refer to one more paragraph.  It states:</P>
    <P>Rumour has it that a Junior Minister indicated that we could continue to operate our traditional sweepstakes, but that suggestion can hardly be taken seriously as all our efforts have been to alter our traditional sweepstakes because they would no longer be viable with the National Lottery.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would comment on those paragraphs.  I am sure he will share my concern for the welfare of all those people who are being laid off and who have had no indication of where they will go from here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Brady's concern for employees and ex-employees of Hospitals' Trust.  I hope Deputy Brady <Col N="1086" /> will understand that I cannot comment on a letter I have not seen, and I do not intend to comment on rumours referred to in a letter that I have not seen.  I would have nothing useful or constructive to say on those points.</P>
      <P>However, it would be useful if I pointed out briefly some of the principal features in the history of the Hospitals' Sweepstakes to illustrate the background of the present position.  Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited have been running sweepstakes for the last 50 years or so in one guise or another.  The connection of the Minister for Justice with that operation arises from the fact that it is to him that the various sweepstake schemes, by law, have to be submitted for sanction.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to go into all the details, but over the years a number of changes have been made in the operation of sweepstakes, at the request of Hospitals' Trust, in order to adapt the schemes to what the company saw as being the changing market conditions. Changes in ticket prices were made on a number of occasions.  In 1976, the statutory limit on the proportion of the proceeds payable as expenses was increased from 30 per cent to 40 per cent.  The number of traditional type sweepstakes allowed per year was increased from four to six in 1978 &mdash; I am talking about the larger of the two types of sweepstakes. In 1980 the Shamrock Sweepstake was introduced.  The Minister for Justice at the relevant times was associated with the company because he had statutory responsibility to sanction the schemes.  In each case the changes were made in order to ensure the viability of the operations.</P>
      <P>In recent years the business came under pressure from increasing competition from abroad, particularly North America.  There has been acute competition since the introduction of state lotteries in a number of the US states and in Canada.  It seems to me that that development must have been a big factor in the decision of the IHT not to run any sweepstakes since the last traditional one on the Irish Sweeps Hurdle on 11 January last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Brady pointed out, there <Col N="1087" /> has been correspondence between the company and me during the course of this year and although I dislike publicising correspondence between me, on a reasonably confidential business basis, and other people, Deputy Brady's concern requires that I do so on this occasion. I will illustrate briefly the main features of that correspondence.</P>
    <P>Last January the company wrote to my predecessor outlining a scheme for sweepstakes to be run every two weeks. I replied on 19 March to the effect that the proposal had been examined in the context of the Government's decision to establish a national lottery and that it was considered that the operation of more than one lottery of the magnitude of the national lottery and the sweepstake they had proposed could result in wasteful duplication.  I stated that in the circumstances I was not prepared to sanction the proposal.  In June, the company submitted the outline of another scheme for sweepstakes to be run three or four times a year with a ticket price of £10 or £20.  I replied on 16 July to the effect that in regard to the proposed ticket price of £10 or £20 and the coming into operation of the proposed national lottery I was not prepared to sanction that sweepstake.</P>
    <P>The company wrote again on 18 July inquiring about the terms and conditions in which a proposal to run sweepstakes would be sanctioned.  I replied on 6 August stating that there would be no objection to a further sweepstake or mini-sweepstake on traditional lines based on horse racing, and I said that if proposals were submitted within those parameters I would consider them.  A letter dated 12 September from the company sought clarification on two specific points and I dealt with those in my reply of 10 October, stating that my overall position was that I could envisage sanctioning sweepstakes indefinitely provided that they did not become an alternative to the national lottery and provided, of course, that I could be satisfied that any proposed sweepstakes would be commercially viable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> The company wrote to me again on 31 October setting out a number of detailed arguments in favour of the proposal that had been made in June.  They made the point that it remained to be seen whether market research would support their viewpoint in relation to that proposal.  On 18 November I replied stating that in the light of the arguments put forward in their letter I was prepared to agree in principle to the proposals for sweepstakes set out in their letter of 5 June.  I added that I thought the company would appreciate that I would have to consider any detailed scheme with particular reference to commercial viability.  In that regard, the market research referred to in the company's letter of 31 October would be an important consideration in reaching a final decision on the detailed scheme.  The company acknowledged that letter on 20 November stating that they would be in touch with me &ldquo;at a future date when things have developed sufficiently to take the matter further&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The current position is that I have told HT that I am agreeable in principle to the running of further sweepstakes, and I have outlined the conditions in which a sweepstake scheme could be sanctioned by me.  When a detailed scheme has been submitted to me I will give the company my decision on it at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>In regard to the workers, I would refer Deputy Brady to the general conditions for eligibility for unemployment benefit. I am not aware that the workers who were let go last January are being placed in any peculiar position in relation to eligibility for unemployment benefit. They are not being put into a particularly disadvantaged category, nor are they being put in any specially advantaged position.  It is not in my power to say to workers or former workers of the company what their position will be.  It is a matter for the company to decide what operation they will run within the parameters that I have set out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady is aware that the company put forward proposals which they suggested should be considered when the Government were considering how the <Col N="1089" /> national lottery should be run.  That proposal was considered seriously with others and the Government decision, announced at the time, was that a subsidiary company of An Post should run the national lottery.  All of the company's proposals were given very careful consideration before the Government came to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>On the other points raised by Deputy Brady, in so far as they have to do with the internal affairs of the company I cannot comment.  It is a matter for the company to run its own internal affairs. The history of the year as I have outlined it shows very clearly that it has been my <Col N="1090" /> concern to ensure that any operation run by the company which could show itself to be commercially viable would not be of a nature to interfere or provide duplication with the national lottery.  It is on that basis that we have approached the matter.  I have said to the company what the parameters are within which schemes can be sanctioned and the House and the company can be assured that when a detailed scheme is put to me it will get my reaction at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> In October 1983, when the PMPA was placed under administration, the shortfall on provisions for claims was estimated by a firm of consultants appointed by the Minister at approximately £100 million as at 31 December 1982.  The consultants' estimate in respect of 31 December 1981 was £65 million.  The liabilities for claims as of 31 December 1982 were estimated at approximately £160 million, compared with a figure of £60 million shown in the former management's statutory returns for 1982 to my Department.</P>
      <P>The estimated figures mentioned were arrived at by the consultants on the basis of a limited examination of the company's outstanding claims provisions.  A London-based firm of actuaries carried out a similarly limited exercise and confirmed the existence of a substantial shortfall.  Both consultancy reports formed the basis for the Minister's petition to the High Court in October 1983 for the appointment of an administrator. It is relevant to point out that the findings of those reports were not contested by the former management when the appointment of the administrator was being confirmed by the High Court on 14 November 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimated liabilities in respect of claims at 31 December 1983 as shown in the administrator's accounts for 1983 were £221 million.  The cost of 1978 to 1983 claims paid in 1984 was £73.8 million and further reserves of £128.2 million <Col N="885" /> were held at end 1984 for claims remaining to be settled at that date.</P>
    <P>There is no prospect of the return of the company to the shareholders until it ceases to be dependent on support from the insurance compensation fund to pay off the backlog of outstanding claims, which will take a further period of years. Even then, shareholders cannot expect to recover any of their investment as, under the Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1983, any sum paid out of this fund to the company represents a debt of the company.</P>

Because of its nature, definitive figures are not available as to the extent of this trade but reputable organisations such as the OECD and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) estimate that countertrade &mdash; a general description given to various exchange arrangements other than deals based on cash and credit payments &mdash; accounts for 5 per cent-8 per cent of world trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such trade is against the spirit and purpose of the GATT.  The objective of the GATT is to maintain the free open international trading system.  It is the agreed rules of this system which facilitate the continuing development and dispersion of Irish exports, which are so critical to our economic progress.  Private entities <Col N="886" /> may, of course, engage, without Government participation, in any business exchanges which are acceptable to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> There is nothing radically new in the comment in the NESC report referred to.  The report itself recognises that this aspect of our export performance amongst other issues was addressed in the White Paper on Industrial Policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A more balanced export strategy is necessary.  The White Paper found that the lack of marketing skills was a particular problem inhibiting the development of exports of indigenous firms.  In recognition of this the Government has <Col N="887" /> committed significant extra resources to CTT to enable it to undertake a range of marketing initiatives with the emphasis on the indigenous sector.</P>
    <P>These new inititives commenced in 1985 and continued during 1986.  There are a range of schemes covering four main developmental areas <i>viz.</i> building marketing strengths in firms, market research, design and product development, and market entry and development proposals.</P>
    <P>These schemes in general apply across all product categories and sectors of industry.  They are designed to encourage exporters to increase exports in their current markets, to research and expand new markets and to develop new products. The issue raised by the Deputy is therefore being tackled, but of its nature the new emphasis will take time to achieve all the desired results.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am aware of various representations that have been made about the situation of the retail motor trade.  Such representations have been accompanied by demands for action in the taxation area which is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>In so far as manufacturing activity is concerned, I stated in my reply to Deputy Mervyn Taylor on 29 October 1986, Official Report, columns 727-730, volume 369, Question No. 8) that both the IDA and Córas Tráchtála have made substantial efforts to attract car manufacturers to Ireland with the dual purpose of establishing manufacturing operations and increasing their purchase of component parts made here.</P>
      <P>These efforts have resulted in the development and continued growth of a modern, high quality, automotive components industry which now employs more than the car assembly industry employed at its peak.  At present there are over 100 companies exporting components worth some IR£260 million a year and employing over 7,500 people. The development of this industry has come about as a result of the Government's efforts to establish a strong automotive industry and has been achieved despite the international recession and pressure on the larger European auto companies to buy locally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, through its policy of attracting industry to this country capable of producing products for export and through its policy of encouraging domestic industry to compete for export business through such initiatives as the <Col N="889" /> national linkage programme, will continue to target the automotive sector as a growth area.  I am confident that the years ahead will see further growth in the industry in terms of both jobs and exports.</P>

      <P>I will be making regulations shortly implementing Directive 85/3/EEC of 19 December 1984 on the weights (including axle weights), dimensions and related characteristics of certain goods vehicles circulating internationally.  Ireland has a derogation from the EC triaxle weight limit of 24 tonnes.  The length of the derogation will be decided by the EC Council of Transport Ministers in February 1987.</P>
      <P>The EC adopted a second directive &mdash; 86/360/EEC on 24 July 1986 &mdash; fixing the maximum weight of the sole drive axle of 5 and 6 axle combined vehicles at 11.5 tonnes with effect from 1 January 1992. Ireland has a derogation from the drive axle weight limit of 11.5 tonnes.  The duration of Ireland's derogation will be determined by the EC Council of Transport Ministers by 30 June 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the derogations from Directives 85/3/EEC and 86/360/EEC is <Col N="896" /> to allow Irish bridges and roads to be strengthened to carry the heavier axle weights laid down by the EC.</P>

    <P>Galway County Council were allocated a sum of £3,650,000 to meet existing commitments on their local authority housing programme in 1986.  These included 31 rural cottages in progress and eight new demountables provided at 31 May 1986. A further allocation of £500,000 has now been made available to the council for this year's housing programme which now includes a total of 53 rural cottages. I understand that the demand for demountable dwellings can be met by relocation of existing stock.  A final <Col N="907" /> review of the capital requirements of all authorities is now under way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>In January 1985 Dublin County Council submitted to my Department an outline scheme for the improvement of the Malahide Road.  This proposal was approved in November 1985 without prejudice to any statutory procedures that may arise.</P>
      <P>The improvement of this road is an objective in the 1983 Dublin County Development Plan.  The scheme is also one of the 54 major roads projects scheduled in the 1985 Road Plan to be commenced-substantially completed in the period 1985 to 1987.  The construction costs involved will be determined by competitive tenders.</P>
      <P>Dublin County Council have indicated that the existing Malahide Road is substandard in alignment, width and sight distance.  Present traffic volumes on the route are in the region of 11,000 vehicles per day of which 8 per cent are heavy goods vehicles.</P>
      <P>While a formal cost-benefit analysis was not undertaken in this instance, I am satisfied, having regard to the existing and projected traffic data and the unsatisfactory condition of the road, that the improvement of the road is necessary to provide a roadway which would be adequate from safety and capacity viewpoints.</P>

      <P>I presume that the question relates to the monthly reports on atmospheric pollution which have been published by Dublin Corporation since the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>The most important indication arising from these, and from the detailed monitoring of air quality carried out in Dublin, is that exceedances of EC limit values for smoke have again occurred at several locations during the 1985-86 winter. Under the relevant EC directive, this situation will have to be remedied definitively by 1993.  The Air Pollution Bill, 1986, will provide a framework within which this can be achieved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the details supplied by the Deputy with his question I would like <Col N="915" /> to explain that two aspects of the VAT system, which are distinct and separate in their operation, are involved.  VAT at point of entry is a special feature of the VAT system applying to importers.  It becomes payable by virtue of the physical act of importation and without reference to whether or not a deposit has been paid. The importer is placed under no greater disability in such instance than if a deposit had not been paid.  The VAT treatment of deposits is part of the normal rules which apply to sales of goods by traders. Thus a company receiving a prepayment is obliged under law to account to the Revenue Commissioners for the VAT due thereon and is in a position to charge this VAT to the customer.  It would be impracticable to amend the existing arrangements in the manner requested.</P>

An underpayment amounting to £676.98 emerged and an assessment was made on the taxpayer to enable the tax due to be collected.

      <P>Exchange rate guarantees essentially involve the taxpayer bearing risks that enable business to borrow at lower rates. While there may be short term conditions in which this is justified, it should not be systematic policy.  Under a number of schemes, the Exchequer has guaranteed the exchange risk in respect of borrowings in foreign currencies by Irish manufacturing firms.  The amount outstanding at end-September 1986 was some £220 million.  Realised and unrealised exchange rate losses amounting to some £63 million have occurred in the operation of these schemes, the cost of which has to be met by the Exchequer. The position relating to the Exchange rate guarantee schemes is being kept under review in the light of ongoing circumstances.</P>

Notwithstanding this, the Government are in sympathy with the commission's preference for a simpler and more efficient <Col N="919" /> tax system on a wider base.  The rationalisation of both the income tax and VAT systems were consistent with the Commission's recommendation for a simpler tax system.</P>

The current approved level of overdraft sanctioned by me for the South Eastern Health Board is £4 million and this will be adjusted as appropriate between now and the end of the year.  Overdraft interest is a charge which must be borne by each health board within its approved allocation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the hardship suffered by asthmatics; if he is aware of the great expense that asthmatic sufferers are under; if he will provide them with medical cards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 40 per cent of asthma patients are covered by medical cards and, therefore, receive all of their prescribed drugs, as well as general practitioner services, entirely free of charge.  Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses due to a long term medical condition, these expenses are reckoned in determining eligibility for medical card cover.  In the case of a family, a medical card can be issued to one member of the family only, where appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons who could not be regarded as eligible for a medical card can avail themselves of the refund of cost of drugs scheme, which ensures that their net unrefunded exenditure on prescribed drugs and medicines does not exceed £28 per month.  This assumes that they have no VHI cover.  Substantial income tax relief on net unrefunded medical <Col N="926" /> expenses is available under the income tax code.</P>
    <P>Medical cards can only be issued to persons who satisfy the criterion of hardship, in that they cannot provide general practitioner medical services for themselves and their dependants, from their own resources, without incurring an undue degree of hardship.  The issue of medical cards is a statutory responsibility of the chief executive officer of the relevant health board.</P>
    <P>The universal provision of medical cards to a particular group of persons, solely on the grounds of a diagnosed medical condition and without any reference to the financial means of such persons, would be <i>ultra vires</i> the Health Act, 1970.  Such a departure from long established policy would also be socially inequitable and indefensible and would give rise to demands that medical cards be made available, <i>en masse</i>, to sufferers of numerous other conditions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the South Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for the provision of health services in County Wexford, that the average waiting periods for ophthalmic services for that county are four to five months for out-patient clinics, and eight months for routine non-urgent in-patient admission to the regional ophthalmology unit at Ardkeen General Hospital, Waterford.  In relation to hip replacement operation in the regional orthopaedic unit at Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital, the average waiting period for Wexford patients is seven months.  These figures compare favourably with other health board areas. <Col N="927" /> I am aware that within this average figure for hip replacements there are a small number of patients waiting as long as 15 months.  The decision to call these patients for surgery is a clinical matter.</P>
      <P>The developments approved for Ardkeen General Hospital Waterford and Wexford, and planned for St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, will lead to an improvement in orthopaedic services for the South Eastern Health Board area as a whole.</P>

      <P>The person in question became eligible for a supply of free milk on 24 September 1986 and her daily supply was ordered by the Eastern Health Board from the dairy under contract.</P>
      <P>In this instance there is a long standing arrangement by the dairies for eligible residents of the area to collect their milk supply from a particular local shop, and the dairy notifies the residents of the arrangement.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, the person in question was not notified by the dairy until 27 November 1986.  Her milk supply commenced on 28 November 1986.  In order to compensate the person for the delay, milk will be supplied beyond her entitlement period.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 12 December 1983, and was paid at the weekly rate of £67.70 up to 15 November 1986.  Under the EC directive my Department is required to provide for the implementation of equal treatment between men and women in matters of social security.</P>
      <P>As a result of the above directive, the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, was passed, giving men and women the same entitlement when claiming social welfare benefits.  The first phase was introduced in May 1986.  This ensured that married women were entitled to the same personal rate as other claimants.  The second phase was implemented on 17 November 1986.  From this date men and women have similar entitlement when claiming increases of benefit in respect of an adult and-or child dependants.</P>
      <P>In the case of the person concerned, this has meant that from 17 November 1986, he is no longer entitled to an increase of benefit in respect of his wife, as she is in receipt of a social welfare pension in her own right.</P>
      <P>His weekly rate of benefit was, therefore, reduced to the personal rate of £41.10 per week, with effect from 17 November 1986.  In order to avoid hardship a special transitional payment of £10 per week, was made to the person concerned. Under measures recently announced, a further transitional payment of £10 a week will also be made with effect from 17 November 1986.</P>
      <P>Payment is issued at regular weekly intervals on receipt of monthly medical evidence and all benefit payable has been issued to date.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment benefit up to 28 August 1986, when he had drawn his maximum entitlement of 390 days benefit. He claimed unemployment assistance from 29 August 1986.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is dependent on an applicant being the holder of a qualification certificate and, to obtain such a certificate, an applicant must satisfy certain conditions, including an assessment of means.</P>
      <P>Following investigation, his unemployment assistance claim was disallowed on the grounds that, by failing to furnish details of his means, he failed to show that his means did not exceed the statutory limit.  In particular he failed to show that he is not benefiting from his family's holding, on which he lives.  He appealed against the decision and an appeals officer, on 13 October 1986, also disallowed his claim.</P>
      <P>The person concerned again claimed unemployment assistance from 18 November 1986 and his papers have been referred to a social welfare officer for investigation.  These inquiries will be completed as soon as possible and his case will then be submitted to a deciding officer for assessment of means.

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, provides for equal treatment for men and women in matters of social welfare. It includes a revised definition of the term &ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo; and gives men and women an equal right to claim increases for child dependants.  Under the Act a claimant's spouse who is in receipt of disability benefit may not be admitted as a dependant of the claimant and the increase in respect of child dependants is payable at half the appropriate rate to each of the couple.</P>
      <P>The Act also provides, at section 12 (4), that where a spouse is entitled to one of a number of contributory social welfare benefits (including disability benefit) and the other spouse is entitled to unemployment assistance, the total amount payable to them by way of benefit and assistance shall not exceed the total amount which would be payable to the family if the spouse on disability benefit were receiving an increase of that benefit in respect of the other spouse.  The section provides that where this limit is exceeded, the rate of unemployment assistance is to be reduced accordingly.</P>
      <P>The wife of the person concerned is in receipt of disability benefit of £51.05 weekly, which includes half the appropriate rate for two child dependants.  The flat rate amount to which his wife would be entitled if her husband were her adult dependant is £87.60.  Therefore, the maximum amount of unemployment assistance payable is £36.55 weekly, being the difference between £87.60 and £51.05.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Her husband is currently in receipt of this amount, plus the special transitional payment of £10 which was awarded to alleviate the loss of an increase in respect of his wife brought about by the equal treatment provisions.  In accordance with <Col N="935" /> the recent Government decision to provide additional relief in cases such as this, the person concerned will now qualify for a further transitional payment of £10 with effect from 19 November 1986, thus increasing his weekly rate to £56.55. Arrangements have been made to pay all arrears due to him as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 6 August 1985 and payment of benefit was issued to 1 November 1986.  The claimant was in legal custody from 10 October 1986, however, and consequently he incurred an overpayment in respect of the period from 10 October 1986 to 1 November 1986.  Payment was accordingly suspended from 3 November 1986 following this discovery.  The claimant was granted a temporary release from 5 November 1986 and is eligible for payment of disability benefit as he is not now in legal custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, he submitted only one medical certificate dated 7 November 1986 indicating that he was incapable of work.

Where a person has less than 156 contributions paid since entry into insurable employment, entitlement to disability benefit is limited to 52 weeks.  According to the records of the Department the person concerned had less than 156 contributions paid and payment of disability benefit was suspended from 5 March 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been discovered that the claimant has two insurance numbers, however, and that he has in excess of 156 contributions paid since entry into insurable employment and consequently he qualifies for continuous payment of disability benefit.  The person concerned was not entitled to payment of benefit from 26 February 1982 to 1 January 1983 as he was awarded pre-entry credits on the basis that he was not previously insurably employed.  He has 25 paid contributions and no credited contributions in the 1980-81 governing contribution year and <Col N="938" /> consequently he incurred an over-payment of £2,442.04 in respect of this period.</P>

      <P>Since dual purpose cows comprise 80 per cent of the national breeding herd with beef cows comprising the remaining 20 per cent, the Department of Agriculture's approach to improving the beefing quality of the herd is twofold &mdash; to improve beef merit in beef cows and to maintain the beef merit of the Friesian, cow breed while at the same time improving dairy merit.</P>
      <P>Specific steps taken to improve beefing qualities include selective importations of superior breeds and strains of existing breeds and the operation of an integrated testing and selection programme designed to enhance the economically important traits &mdash; viz. growth rate, feed efficiency, ease of calving and carcase merit.</P>
      <P>The national testing and selection programme is operated in co-operation with breed societies and AI organisations.  The programme involves:</P>
      <P>&mdash; on farm weight recording in pedigree herds for weight gain to enable selection of breeding females and males for future pedigree breeding,</P>
      <P>&mdash; central performance testing of beef breed and Friesian bulls for growth rate, feed efficiency, body measurement and carcase merit which is assessed by ultrasonic for identification of superior sires for use in the AI service and by breeders as sires in pedigree herds, and</P>

This clinic would also serve as the centre for Garda patrolling of the area.

It is not possible at this stage to indicate when the school in question will be provided with a hall as the extent and timing of future phases of the programme depend on the availability of capital and on my Department's other commitments and priorities.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any incorrect information regarding the projects in question being supplied to my Department by the Youth Employment Agency.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, projects which are in receipt of Teamwork funding do not qualify for concurrent YEA community enterprise programme planning grants.  It would take an inordinate amount of time to identify those projects, if any, which have received assistance under both schemes.</P>
      <P>An application for assistance under the Teamwork scheme was submitted by the organisation, Network for Jobs, on 3 April 1986.  Because of the restrictions on Teamwork funds at the time, it was not possible to consider this application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a meeting between representatives of the organisation and the Minister of State at my Department on 28 May 1986 a further application was received from Network for Jobs on 18 June 1986.  After consideration of the application by the Teamwork monitoring committee on 24 June 1986 discussions took place between the sponsoring group and officials of my Department on 7 July 1986.  In the course of these discussions further information on the application, including data on the five separate projects encompassed by it, was requested. This was received on 7 August 1986. From an examination of the five proposals it appeared that four of these were essentially commercial in character and <Col N="963" /> would not, therefore, be eligible for consideration under Teamwork.  Further evidence of the commercial nature of these four projects was evidenced by the fact that they were approved for planning grants under the Youth Employment Agency's community enterprise programme. This programme is designed to assist projects which may be sustainable on a commercial basis.  The applicants were notified accordingly on 10 September, 1986.  The fifth application submitted was examined but it did not meet the criteria for Teamwork and the applicants were notified accordingly on 17 September, 1986.</P>
