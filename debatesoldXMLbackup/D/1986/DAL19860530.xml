    <Title>Estimates, 1986. - Vote 41: Labour (Revised Estimate).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £171,498,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1986, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Labour, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The responsibilities assigned to my Department constitute a critical element in the formulation and promotion of social policies in line with our economic objectives as a nation.  In implementing their economic policies the Government must seek to ensure a proper balance between equity and efficiency.  Looking after the interests of disadvantaged groups in the labour market and establishing broad equality of opportunity constitute social policy objectives which, in my view, must remain central to <Col N="708" /> economic recovery and to improvements in the working of the labour market.</P>
    <P>While the administrative scope of labour affairs has been greatly diversified, the key role of the Department of Labour still lies in promoting the welfare of workers and in ensuring equity and efficiency in the labour market.  The competence of this Department and their scope for initiative are not restricted to the limited range of regulative functions prescribed in our code of worker protection. My Department are engaged in a continuous process of reform to ensure that they remain an effective instrument of Government policy.</P>
    <P>Across the range of programmes and activities for which I am responsible as Minister, four priorities determine my Department's approach to achieving their objectives.  These priorities are: the promotion of the State's commitment to the right to work and social justice for all; the development of our human resources; keeping open channels of communication between employers and workers; the investigation of the links between economic growth and social progress.</P>
    <P>Throughout the industrialised countries the current high level of unemployment represents the major challenge to our societies and has called for a questioning of the development of employment services and the scope for more effective instruments of intervention.</P>
    <P>In moving the Estimates for my Department last year, I drew particular attention to the needs of the long term unemployed.  I observed how the centre of gravity of manpower policy in all European Community States had shifted from the transition from school to work to the continuing growth of the long term unemployed.  In October 1985 there were 98,813 long term unemployed or 43 per cent of those unemployed; as against 34,658 in the same category five years ago.  Long term unemployment in other countries, has also increased steadily &mdash; more than the general level of unemployment, particularly because of the problems faced by young people without <Col N="709" /> qualifications and by older unskilled and semi-skilled workers.</P>
    <P>Many of those affected have family responsibilities.  Even in favourable employment conditions the long term unemployed have always been seriously disadvantaged in access to jobs and in the range of career opportunities open to them.  Their situation will continue to deteriorate unless special measures are adopted to alleviate their position.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable to me that a growing segment of the labour force should be condemned to a life of enforced idleness and deprivation.  People deteriorate physically and psychologically when they cannot escape from long term unemployment. The State and the community at large have a duty to try to reintegrate them into the labour market.  This Government has sought to harness the energy and drive of those who are currently unemployed by providing opportunities for socially useful work.  It comes as no surprise to me that those who reject a major role for the State in taking direct action to tackle unemployment also reject the idea of socially useful work. These are the advocates of a narrow commercialism who insist on &ldquo;real work and real things&rdquo; implying that only that which is commercial is worth while.  Their idea is that only private industry creates wealth and that only those goods and services sold on the market count as wealth.  They are now putting over their message in revivalist terms and with revivalist vigour on occasions.  We are told that wealth is created in the private sector, spent in the public sector; or created in manufacturing, spent in services.  I am convinced that this kind of Gladstonian moralism has to be challenged if the potentially dynamic role of community-based projects for the disadvantaged is to be developed.</P>
    <P>The challenge of unemployment calls for a contribution from all sectors of the community, even where that means accommodation to a change in expectations not least for the majority who now have jobs.  Even the scope for Government intervention in support of training and job creation is being dismissed by the <Col N="710" /> new advocates of a return to a &ldquo;night watchman&rdquo; role for the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They claim that their policies would give rise to &ldquo;a climate in which enterprise can flourish&rdquo;.  What this means can be seen from the lessons of what has happened elsewhere.  Nobody should be fooled &mdash; looking after number one means an abdication of responsibility for the unemployed.</P>
      <P>The development of special intervention measures can be justified both on grounds of equity and because they make better use of economic resources.  The implementation of the social employment scheme over the last 12 months has shown how it is possible to break the vicious circle in which the long term unemployed get trapped at the bottom of the jobs queue simply because they are long term unemployed.</P>
      <P>The social employment scheme has made a marked contribution to growth in employment in the over 25 age group. There has been a slowing down in the increase in unemployment among older workers over the past 12 months.  At present 9,500 persons are employed on more than 2,200 projects.  We will attain our target of 10,000 persons on the scheme by the middle of the year, in fact, by the end of June.</P>
      <P>Approximately a third of the projects now in operation are sponsored by voluntary organisations.  These organisations cover a wide variety of activities from community welfare work, sport groups to arts and theatre projects of various kinds. The remaining 70 per cent of projects are sponsored by public sector bodies.  These include local authorities, schools and health boards.  I would like to acknowledge the debt which we owe to all the sponsors who are helping us help unemployed people.  The high standard of the projects is impressive and the scheme has already been credited in many communities with counteracting many of the adverse effects associated with long term unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern had been expressed in some <Col N="711" /> quarters about the possible non-availability of prospective participants for certain projects.  I recently secured Government approval for a number of changes in the eligibility criteria with a view to increasing the number of potential beneficiaries. These changes ensure:</P>
    <P>(1)  that all over 25s on unemployment assistance can participate; previously a 12 month period on the live register was also required;</P>
    <P>(2)  that people over 25 on unemployment benefit for at least 12 months can participate; previously the scheme applied only to those on unemployment assistance; and</P>
    <P>(3)  that an extra £15 a week will be provided for those who had previously been receiving an allowance for an adult dependant as part of the social welfare payment.</P>
    <P>The relaxation of the eligibility criteria should increase the participation of married women, whose difficulties in qualifying for the scheme delayed the implementation of some projects.  The payment of the new allowance will ensure that participation in the scheme is financially attractive to the married person with up to three child dependants and will ensure that more people can take part.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that my intention is to ensure that information on model projects is widely disseminated. This should enable worthwhile projects to be developed on a flexible and sensitive basis and avoid an uneven response in different areas of the country.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the full potential of the scheme has not as yet been tapped.  The sponsorship role for local authorities should ensure that the scope for intervention to meet the needs of the long term unemployed is not dependent on the expectation of a spontaneous response from voluntary bodies at local level.  Outside of the Dublin area, local authorities now have over 5,000 people working on the scheme.  Urban unemployment is most keenly felt and Dublin has the highest concentration of the older long <Col N="712" /> term unemployed workers.  The social employment scheme is working in local authorities all over the country.  It can work in Dublin.  I again appeal to all concerned not to delay its implementation further.  We owe it to the unemployed to make it work.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general unemployment situation the most recent live register figure for the numbers unemployed is 232,256 people.  This figure is unacceptably high.  It is attributable to the major upheaval being experienced in international markets, redundancies arising from increased automation and the increase in the Irish labour force.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to investment in training. The State's role in manpower training is one of the prime targets of the advocates of &ldquo;free market&rdquo; doctrines.  What they seem to disregard is that investment in the skills and knowledge of our people is no less important than investment in new industrial processes.  The State's involvement in the provision of training arises from one simple fact: left to their own devices employers would not supply sufficient quality or quantity of training to meet either their own requirements or those of the economy generally.</P>
    <P>Continuing high levels of unemployment presents a particular challenge to AnCO.  The building on experience programme has been specially tailored to the needs of the adult long term unemployed. Its combination of formal training and practical experience in a work environment enables participants to reassess their career potential and employment opportunities.  The programme is now fully operational in most of AnCO's training centres and external training agencies.  It is expected that 3,000 will participate in 1986, and the placement rate to date has been 57 per cent.</P>
    <P>I regret that the level of training for the over 25s will fall below the 1985 level. This is primarily due to the revised guidelines for the European Social Fund which removed support for the over 25s who are less than one year unemployed. Nevertheless, I have, with the Government's agreement, directed <Col N="713" /> AnCO to carry out £1 million of enterprise training for those over 25 who have been unemployed for less than one year without matching ESF contributions.  I am examining the position of such training in the future.</P>
    <P>The overall strategy of the AnCO enterprise training programme is supportive of small business with its emphasis on identifying, encouraging and training potential entrepreneurs.  Trainees are assisted to develop prototypes, test product ideas, marketing potential and similar activities.  Research and development on open learning systems for entrepreneurs are being intensified.  Up to 3,500 will avail of enterprise training in 1986. Enterprise training programmes result in a high rate of job creation, particularly through multiplier effects.</P>
    <P>The technical assistance grants scheme is being reviewed by my Department and the Department of Finance in order to ensure that its increased Exchequer allocation is utilised in the most effective manner.  The technical assistance grants scheme was one of the first casualties of the new guideline for the European Social Fund.  The review is nearly complete and will help to ensure that grants available under the scheme will be devoted to priority areas.  AnCO, working in conjunction with the Youth Employment Agency, continued the expansion of community training workshops in 1985.  There are now 75 workshops countrywide including 24 specially designed for young travellers.  The priority status of youth training has ensured that activity levels in 1986 will be maintained at the 1985 level.</P>
    <P>During the year, AnCO participated actively in the development of the social guarantee for young people and introduced the skills foundation programme as their special contribution to the transition from school to work of those leaving school at the end of junior cycle.  Over 2,000 early school-leavers will be accommodated on the programme in 1986.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to two other youth programmes for which AnCO is responsible.  First, AnCO will introduce this year a programme of structured <Col N="714" /> training linked with employment to aid young people in jobs which offer little or no training or career prospects.  The youth traineeship initiative is being introduced on a pilot basis.  Second, I would also like to refer to the work carried out by AnCO apprentices on St. Anthony's Franciscan Monastry in Louvain.  Ireland can feel justly proud of the renovation that has been carried out to this old building, parts of which date back to the early 1600s.</P>
    <P>CERT Limited will continue to provide training opportunities for young people wishing to enter the hotel and catering industry and an in-company training and advisory service to the industry itself.</P>
    <P>In 1986, over 1,400 young people will pursue craft training under CERT programmes in designated colleges throughout the country.  In addition, over 600 young persons will be given short 13 week basic skills training courses facilitating their entry into the industry.  CERT have also established a training centre which will operate for two years in the inner city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>In 1985, CERT achieved a placement rate of 100 per cent for trainees completing craft courses while 84 per cent of those completing the short courses were placed in employment immediately on completion.  There is every reason to believe that this type of placement rate will continue to be achieved in 1986.</P>
    <P>Local community based responses have an important role to play in alleviating unemployment and contributing to job creation.  There is a growing realisation of the importance of local communities and their potential for stimulating viable self-sustaining employment to supplement mainstream job creation measures.</P>
    <P>During 1986, the Youth Employment Agency will be focussing greater attention on the area of job creation, particularly community enterprise.  The community enterprise programme is being developed as the agency's main job creation programme and efforts will be made to improve the quality of training <Col N="715" /> and advice available to the young self-employed, co-operative and community business ventures.</P>
    <P>Issues of quality and survival are critical to the ultimate success of job creation programmes including the youth self employment programme, the community enterprise programme and also the enterprise allowance scheme.  The agency plan to take a number of initiatives in 1986 to try and improve the quality and survival of projects including improved training and advice supports for young self-employment and community groups.</P>
    <P>The most recent school-leavers survey study conducted by my Department has again highlighted the importance of educational qualifications in determining employment prospects, as well as the difficulties which unqualified school-leavers face on entering the labour market.  A recent survey by the Youth Employment Agency shows that the employment experience of low achievers in the educational system does not improve over time.  In fact, the gap between low and high achievers widens.</P>
    <P>The social guarantee commits the EC member states to do their utmost to ensure that all young people leaving compulsory education can benefit from a period of full time training and/or initial work experience of at least six months' duration, and is clearly designed to lessen the disadvantages which, at present, confront those present, confront those leaving the educational system without any formal qualifications.  The Youth Employment Agency are entrusted with responsibility for implementing the guarantee and priority attention is being given to early school-leavers who experience particular difficulty in obtaining and maintaining employment.  The agency will be presenting their first report on the implementation of the guarantee later this year.  The significant progress which has been made already is largely due to the degree of linkage and co-operation in the activities of the manpower agencies.</P>
    <P>I now propose to deal with some of the special measures for temporary employment, work experience, self employment <Col N="716" /> and job creation which are administered by the National Manpower Service.</P>
    <P>The Teamwork scheme offers valuable work experience to a category of the unemployed &mdash; the registered unemployed aged 20 to 24 years who now account for 70 per cent of youth unemployment. Because of this factor and of the significant improvements-achieved in the operation of the scheme, the Government recently agreed to allocate a further £2 million to the scheme.</P>
    <P>The sum of £7 million now available this year will enable the provision of 1,547 man years of employment and the involvement of approximately 2,500 young people in the scheme.  Approximately 80 per cent of young persons recruited for Teamwork are taken from the live register.</P>
    <P>The enterprise allowance scheme is designed for unemployed people with a worthwhile idea for self-employment.  In lieu of their social welfare payments, they may opt for a special weekly payment while setting up their own enterprises.  In some circumstances, they may qualify for a lump sum payment to acquire assets. The scheme provides for a weekly payment of £30 for a single person and £50 for a married person.</P>
    <P>More than 12,000 people have availed of the scheme to date to establish small enterprises.  Almost one quarter of participants on the scheme are under 25 years of age illustrating the enthusiasm of our young people to grasp an opportunity to take their place in the economy.  The youth employment levy plays a major role in the funding of this scheme.  Payments in respect of the under 25 year olds are funded from the levy.</P>
    <P>In 1986, we are budgeting for 5,150 man years of activity under the scheme at a cost of £11.1 million.</P>
    <P>The employment incentive scheme has been in operation since 1977 and since then notified recruitments under the scheme have reached 55,250.  Expenditure on the scheme in the first four months of 1986 amounts to £1,368,000 which represents payment for 1,712 recruitments.</P>
    <P>About 79 per cent of recruitments <Col N="717" /> under the scheme are young people and the remaining 21 per cent are over 25 years of age.  Approximately 50 per cent of the over 25s are long term unemployed. Recruitments under the scheme in general average about 57 per cent male and 43 per cent female.  The main areas of employment are services and manufacturing with 64 per cent and 21 per cent of recruitment respectively.  Recruitments in construction total 9 per cent; hotel and catering total 3 per cent; and others, including agriculture and horticulture, total 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Government's announcement last October of a series of measures to combat unemployment, the scheme was extended to increase to four the number of jobs which an employer may have assisted under the scheme.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase of approximately 34 per cent notified recruitment in the first three months of 1986 over the same period in 1985.</P>
    <P>Assistance to self employment and the employment by firms of graduates is also provided by the Youth Employment Agency's youth self employment programme, scientists and technologists employment programme and marketplace.</P>
    <P>The work experience programme continues to be an effective measure in assisting the young people to overcome the &ldquo;catch 22&rdquo; situation of &ldquo;no experience &mdash; no jobs&rdquo; and in alleviating the youth unemployment situation.</P>
    <P>In 1985, 65 per cent of the participants succeeded in securing employment on completing the programme and this pattern is continuing during 1986.  As well as being an effective employment intervention tool, it is also a popular programme with young people who have come to regard it as the best avenue to gaining a foothold in the world of work.  A provision of £4.550 million, which is funded from the youth employment levy, is allocated for activities in 1986.</P>
    <P>The National Manpower Service now provide the gateway for the unemployed to the wide range of training courses, <Col N="718" /> work experience places, special employment schemes and opportunities for enterprise development.</P>
    <P>The service is also actively engaged in helping to implement the social guarantee. Staff are being redeployed to those areas where there is greatest need for their services.</P>
    <P>A further stage in the process of steamlining manpower office activities and improving efficiency will be achieved with the computerisation of all offices within two and a half years.  The records in the Dublin area are already computerised. An extensive retraining programme has been developed for NMS staff to help them adjust and to keep up with the changing role of the service in the mid-eighties.</P>
    <P>I have dealt in depth with the employment and training schemes administered by my Department and their associated agencies because I believe that the extent to which Government's intervention measures are contributing to economic and social development is not appreciated. On average, 45,000 people will participate in employment and training schemes on any one day in 1986.  The skills of many of these participants are being improved and their career prospects enhanced.  Many people have been assisted to start their own businesses or to become self-employed.  Many others, through the marginal wage subsidy scheme, are now in jobs which they would not otherwise have.  Community facilities have, in many cases, been improved and this can be readily seen in towns and villages in Ireland.  A start has been made with getting the community involved in its own development through job creation programmes.  The State investment has been substantial.  When account is taken, however, of European Social Fund receipts and what would otherwise be paid in unemployment compensation, I believe that the State and the community get good value for money.  Nevertheless I accept that our policies, programmes and institutional arrangments which have grown up piecemeal in the last 20 years need to be stated in a more coherent fashion and this will be <Col N="719" /> done in the White Paper on Manpower Policy.</P>
    <P>When introducing the Estimate last year I said that I could see certain danger signs that could affect our income from the ESF in the years ahead.  I pointed to the increasing competition for limited resources, the impact of the accession of Spain and Portugal and said that organisations which benefit from the fund would have to take account of these changed circumstances.  The fund has always been of great importance to Ireland and we have managed to obtain a far higher percentage share of the fund than we would be entitled to on a strict <i>per capita</i> population basis.</P>
    <P>To an extent the fears I expressed have been realised.  The general EC budgetary problem has resulted in a shortage of money for the social fund.  The demands of Spain and Portugal on the fund in 1986 have turned out to be greater than anticipated with the result that our share and the shares of the other member states have been reduced.  Our share has declined from 12.2 per cent, or £192 millions, in a Community of 10 to approximately 9.5 per or £169 millions in a Community of 12.  I consider our 1986 share to be very satisfactory in the circumstances but the way the new criteria have been applied by the EC Commission has created some problems.</P>
    <P>The shortage of money in the ESF has obliged the Commission to enforce strict criteria and limits on the types of programmes and the categories of persons who may benefit from the fund.  The emphasis is now on programmes which lead directly to employment and, in the case of unemployed persons over 25, these must be unemployed for at least a year to qualify the ESF assistance.  The introduction of these stricter rules and criteria may mean that certain training programmes which have been assisted by the ESF in the past may not qualify in the future.</P>
    <P>The whole of Ireland including Northern Ireland along with Portugal, Greece, the Mezzogiorno of Italy, certain regions <Col N="720" /> of Spain and the French overseas departments, are designated as a region of absolute priority in the special fund.  The regions of absolute priority benefit from a higher rate of assistance than other regions and a minimum percentage of the fund budget is reserved for them.  This minimum percentage was fixed by the Council at 44.2 per cent on the accession of Spain and Portugal but, in my view &mdash; I expressed this forcibly at the meeting &mdash; it is not enough in view of the needs and the unemployment problems in the priority regions.  I intend to press within the Council of Ministers for an upward revision of this percentage figure.  Our present position within the EC has been the subject of discussion, in this House and elsewhere, in recent months.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that we carry out a stocktaking of our benefits and disappointments in the Community with a view to pressing the rest of the Community to take account of our legitimate cause for concern.  I want to see employment creation placed at the forefront of all EC agendas and to see a recognition of the problems of those member states and regions on the periphery of the Community. The recent fall in inflation levels and in oil prices has stimulated hopes of economic growth.  It has also spurred member states to accelerate the completion of the internal market.  While Ireland supports progress towards achieving the completion of the internal market we must bear in mind that the internal market with its implicit reduction in the protective tariff barriers and custom barriers that exist will not bring uniform or equal benefits to all member states.  The strong industrialised countries in the centre of the Community stand to gain far more than the less developed countries. Some of those stronger countries are among those who wish to restrict spending on the Community funds.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe that Community solidarity requires that the stronger economies should transfer resources to the weaker regions.  If this cannot be done with the existing structural funds I consider that a completely new community facility should be developed to assist <Col N="721" /> measures to stimulate employment.  It is my intention to pursue this possibility vigorously in the Council of Ministers. These objectives are dependent on Community finances being put on a proper footing and this in turn requires that the own resources of the Community be increased in the near future.  At present the own resources level is at 1.4 per cent of VAT revenue and related receipts.  That will have to move closer to 2 per cent if we are to have the level of Community resources required to make the impact which I believe would be necessary if the internal market is to be completed.</P>
    <P>The board of Ostlanna Iompair Éireann have made significant strides in returning the company to profitability and the hotels succeeded more or less in reaching break even point in 1985.  This success confirms the Government's confidence in a vibrant public sector enterprise. The trade unions have made their contribution to the improved trading performance. They have demonstrated commitment to their members' jobs and flexibility in co-operating with management to secure the company's future.  Their example could usefully be followed by other unions in other sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>The provision of over £3 million in 1986 represents the balance of a State commitment to ensure the future of a valuable State resource and an important part of our tourist infrastructure.  With a trading profit of some £500,000 forecast for 1986, OIE have indeed come a long way in the last few years.</P>
    <P>Our industrial relations performance in 1985, as measured by statistics for strikes and work days lost as a result of strikes, was reasonably satisfactory over much of the economy.  There was a substantial reduction in the number of strikes compared with the previous year; the total was in fact the lowest recorded since 1967.  In the private sector, the number of days lost due to strikes was the lowest since the compilation of separate statistics for private and public sectors began in 1976.  The figure for the public sector, however, was significantly higher than in <Col N="722" /> previous years due to the one-day stoppage of public service employees in October and stoppages by teachers.</P>
    <P>Last year also saw a continuation of the steady downward trend in the incidence of unofficial strikes, the number of such strikes was the lowest since the compilation of separate statistics for official and unofficial strikes began in 1976.  The number of days lost through official strikes was also the lowest recorded over the period.  In recent years, we have seen a turn-around from a situation where about two thirds of all strikes were unofficial to a situation where little more than a third are unofficial.  While, there is no cause for complacency, this is a clear reversal of a pattern that appeared for a long period to be firmly established.</P>
    <P>The steady reduction in inflation throughout 1985 may have made the peaceful conclusion of wage round agreements somewhat easier.  The continued decline in inflation to what are unprecedently low levels by the standards of the past two decades will clearly have a big impact on the course of wage bargaining in the coming year.  We have lived with relatively high inflation for so long that our response to levels of price increase as low as 2 to 3 per cent is difficult to predict.  If we ignore the fact that we are entering a new period of relative price stability and refuse to modify habits learned during periods of high inflation, the potential benefit of the improvement in competitiveness and employment will soon be dissipated.</P>
    <P>Clearly, a new approach on the part of employers and trade unions is required in order to adjust to this new situation.  A good deal of discussion and explanation is called for on the part of all involved in industrial relations, particularly those in positions of influence.  We should be careful to avoid a repetition of slogans and generalisations from the past, since these often mask a refusal to assess realistically the facts of the present.  The foremost consideration, of course, must be the need to take full advantage of improved economic conditions to maintain and expand employment.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to industrial relations <Col N="723" /> reform.  Welcome as the improvement in aspects of our strike record is, we should not make too much of developments over the course of a single year.  The general reduction in the number of strikes and days lost in the past few years is, without doubt, largely a consequence of the deep economic recession during that time.  A similar trend has occurred in many other countries and in some of the cases the drop in conflict levels has been of a significantly greater magnitude than that experienced here.</P>
    <P>The association of the decline in conflict with the economic recession raises the possibility that an improvement in economic performance could lead to increased industrial relations difficulties. This seems to me to be something of an unhappy reflection on our industrial relations.  It involves a tacit admission that it is only the present levels of joblessness, closures and redundancies that are preventing a return to the high levels of industrial conflict we saw in the latter half of the seventies.  That would be unacceptable. Our industrial relations need to be improved and the weaknesses in our system need to be corrected.  This must be achieved by the patient and determined reform of structures and practices and not by depending on the continuance of recession.</P>
    <P>I arranged for a copy of the proposals on industrial relations reform published by my Department in January of this year to be sent to all Deputies.  The proposals comprise an integrated set of reforms dealing with trade dispute law, the official dispute-settling institutions, codes of practice, trade union rationalisation and the minimum wage-fixing machinery.  I am proposing the replacement of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, the cornerstone of existing trade disputes law, by a new Act which would recognise in a positive way the right of workers to strike and take industrial action.  The Act would carefully delineate the circumstances in which the right to strike would apply and in doing so would seek to ensure that the rights and responsibilities of the parties to the industrial relations process were <Col N="724" /> recognised.  I am also proposing the establishment of a new labour relations commission which would be given general responsibility for the promotion of good industrial relations as well as for the provision of conciliation advisory and other services.  I believe that such a body could do much to encourage and assist the many modest and gradual changes in individual employments from which any more general overall reform of our industrial relations must ultimately spring.</P>
    <P>The proposals are currently under consideration by the FUE and ICTU.  While further consultations are necessary and will be held, it is my intention to introduce the necessary legislation this year.</P>
    <P>I turn now to trade union education.  I consider it essential that we should have a well organised and well educated trade union movement.  Towards this end it is important that trade union officials and representatives are given the necessary training to enable them effectively to carry out their functions.  The provision of such training makes an important contribution to good industrial relations. With this in mind my Department provide an annual grant to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions towards the cost of its education, training and advisory services. The allocation for 1986 is £677,000.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the restructuring of the trade union movement.  Trade union rationalisation can make an important contribution towards improvements in our system of industrial relations at both plant and national level.  The present situation where a large number of trade unions represent a relatively small workforce and where multi-union employments are commonplace exacerbates our industrial relations problems.  While responsibility for rationalisation of the trade union movement rests largely with the movement itself, there is nevertheless, a role for Government.  The Trade Union Act, 1975, is the vehicle by which this role is effected.  Its purpose is to facilitate amalgamations between unions by simplifying procedures and making grants available towards the costs involved. Grants are payable under the Act by my Department towards amalgamation <Col N="725" /> expenses and I would like to see more trade unions availing of them.</P>
    <P>In regard to worker participation, the legislation I am proposing for the extension of worker participation in State enterprise involves two separate initiatives. The first will extend the arrangements for the direct election of worker representatives to the boards of an additional range of State enterprise, on a basis similar to that provided for in the Worker Participation [State Enterprises] Act, 1977.  The second initiative will give legislative support to the development of worker participation below the level of the board and will apply in State enterprises generally.  This is a new development which will provide a vehicle for information exchange and consultation involving the workforce, middle management and boards of directors.  It is intended to ensure that employees receive information about the enterprise for which they work as well as an active voice and an opportunity for influence in the affairs of the enterprise.  I expect to be in a position shortly to circulate this legislation.</P>
    <P>Regarding flexibility and the change process since I came into office, I have taken a clearcut stance on the role of legislation in the employment field. Undoubtedly the relevance or reasonableness of some forms of regulation can be questioned on the ground that the concerns which originally inspired them are no longer well founded.  At my request an independent survey of employers' attitudes towards protective legislation and related procedures was undertaken in recent months.  Hitherto there has been a lack of systematic study in this area.  I propose to publish the results of this survey when it is completed and I look forward to a more informed debate on the merits of regulatory measures.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the improvement of working conditions and the better management of the production apparatus need not rely entirely upon detailed regulation, but certainly requires a <Col N="726" /> pragmatic and flexible approach to current problems.  In fact in many employments the difficulties experienced in the current recession have highlighted the need to secure co-operative attitudes and some degree of common purpose and commitment from employees.  Some managements have found that substantial gains in terms of industrial relations and improvements in morale can be achieved by securing acceptance for changes in the host of subtle distinctions which have grown up around the different categories of employees within the firm.  Trade union interest in non-pay issues is increasing and can, with adequate planning and consultation, be tapped to boost the ability of a firm to react quickly and flexibly to new technology.</P>
    <P>I turn to equal opportunity now.  One mistaken notion which has apparently taken root in the private sector is the idea that equal opportunity in employment as a social policy objective is no longer an issue, since most forms of overt sex discrimination have been effectively removed. Indirect discrimination is a much more intractable problem, however, which employers will need to take into account in order to tackle practices based on requirements which, while applied equally to both sexes, have an unfavourable impact upon women.</P>
    <P>In the proposals for amending legislation on employment equality which I intend to bring forward this year, I hope to remove some of the obstacles which have limited the progressive development of the twin concepts of equal pay for work of equal value and indirect discrimination in our equality case law.</P>
    <P>The existence of the anti-discrimination legislation, however, is not enough in itself to achieve equal opportunity in employment.  I fully endorse the need to take positive steps to redress the effect of past discrimination.  Outdated attitudes still influence decisions about recruitment, selection, training, promotion, work organisation etc.</P>
    <P>I have established a working party drawing upon Government Departments and the Employment Equality Agency to monitor progress in the application of <Col N="727" /> equal opportunity initiatives in line with the Government guidelines conveyed to all public sector bodies in November of 1984.</P>
    <P>In the coming year I propose to reinforce Government policy on the adoption and implementation of equal opportunity standards by asking public sector bodies to consider taking advantage of the positive action provisions in the equality legislation and to develop special training courses for women who require more motivation and career objective in order to progress.  AnCO have already established expertise in operating career development programmes within their organisation and can be contracted by other public and private sector companies to undertake similar programmes.</P>
    <P>I turn now to work safety and health system.  Earlier this year I announced that the Government had approved the drafting of a framework Bill concerning safety, health and welfare in all workplaces to give effect to the main recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry chaired by Mr. Justice Barrington.  I hope to be in a position to introduce the legislation in the Oireachtas in the autumn of this year.</P>
    <P>In contrast with the limited scope of existing safety measures, the proposed legislation will apply to all employers, employees and the self-employed and to both the public and private sectors.  The overall objective will be to provide for the best possible standards of occupational safety and health in all workplaces.  The legislation will set out general duties of care for employers, employees and the self-employed as well as for manufacturers, suppliers and designers of plant and equipment for use at work.</P>
    <P>I believe that my Department can play a positive role in redressing some of the serious deficiencies in our health and safety system.  In the interests of pressing forward with the implementation of the Barrington Commission's recommendations I established an Interim Board for Safety and Health.  They will consider and report on the rationalisation of the existing system of occupational safety <Col N="728" /> and health and the transitional arrangements which may be necessary for change over to the new system proposed by the commission.</P>
    <P>With regard to employment protection, the Redundancy Payments and the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Schemes are the responsibility of my Department.  The large number of redundancies during the last two years has made a heavy demand on the resources of the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund.  The Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, continues to create a drain on the fund.  Accordingly, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, I increased the employers' contribution rate to 0.6 per cent of PRSI with effect from 6 April 1986.</P>
    <P>In the course of 1985 a total of £4.06 million was paid from the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund to approximately 4,000 employees whose employers were insolvent under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act.</P>
    <P>While the Act deals with situations where employers may be regarded as &ldquo;formally&rdquo; insolvent, for example, a company in liquidation or receivership, there are other situations where in many instances an employer ceases business and no formal winding up or termination process takes place.  In many of these situations employees are left with outstanding entitlements due to them.  I am particularly anxious to avail of provisions in the Act whereby regulations may be made to declare such employers insolvent for the purposes of the Act, so that the employees concerned may be paid their outstanding entitlements from the fund. My Department have been examining this problem in consultation with the Attorney General and I hope to be in a position in the near future to make the appropriate regulations under the Act.</P>
    <P>A review of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, has been completed and I hope to be in a position to introduce amending proposals in the near future.  In developing these proposals, I have been mindful of the need to ensure that while workers <Col N="729" /> are given full protection in their employment, the Act will not operate in such a way as to discourage new recruitment.</P>
    <P>The aim of the amending legislation will be to facilitate continued improvement in the standards of personnel management in this area, by ironing out some operational difficulties which have come to attention.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to the question of information.  I am convinced that not only the representative organisations of employers and workers, but also the wide range of groups concerned with remedying the effects of unemployment at community level, have a decisive role to play in the shaping and execution of labour administration policy and in my Department's efforts to improve their own contribution generally.  Our sensitivity to any defects, difficulties or abuses encountered in working conditions, or in gaining access to employment, is dependent on the qualify of these relations.  The dissemination of information is a crucial factor in developing these contacts.  That is why I think it is important that the Department charged with the central role in policy-making for the wide range of labour affairs should report regularly on their own direct responsibilities. Accordingly, a copy of the second annual report on my Department's activities is being made available to all Deputies.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not an Estimate which our party oppose.  As I have done in the past I should like to congratulate the officials of the Department and of the various agencies for their work throughout the year.  I also thank the Department for issuing an annual report, which every Department and agency should do.  This week, the Department of Justice sent out two reports, one for 1981 and a second for 1983.  They are irrelevant and only add to the congestion in the Library.  The Department of Labour this week sent out their 1985 report and they are to be commended for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of very important issues are involved here.  I wish to raise again the <Col N="730" /> matter of the dispute which concerns me in a number of ways because of my involvement with Dublin Corporation and the major industrial relations problems affecting this city.  I ask the Minister if he will instruct or request the Chairman of the Labour Court to intervene directly in the dispute.  There is much merit in trying to bring both sides back over the weekend to the Labour Court &mdash; the trade unions involved and the management of Dublin Corporation.  Anybody who has been around our city recently or in our parks, or who has experienced reduced services to the public libraries, other agencies and organisations involved with the municipal authority or Dublin Corporation will know the chaos which has been created.</P>
    <P>On the other side, the vast majority of the over 4,000 workers in Dublin Corporation come within the lowly paid bracket in our society.  They can ill afford to do without a week's wage.  It will bite very hard into their resources.  It is easy to ask why people do not think about these things before they strike and why negotiators let these things happen, but I have not the answer to that.  I am sadly amazed by it.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the constructive attitude of the Minister towards industrial relations, both with regard to Labour and the Public Service &mdash; unlike his predecessor, Deputy Boland, who was a disaster in those areas &mdash; he could perhaps use his good offices today to instruct Mr. Horan to bring both sides back into the Labour Court and achieve what I think will not be too difficult a settlement.  Certain arrangements can be made, as the Minister will be aware, which will not break the State or seem to give victory to either side.</P>
    <P>The Minister raised a number of issues which, unfortunately, I cannot cover in detail.  He mentioned the White Paper and some of the major issues which affect his Department.  I have always said I do not believe the Department of Labour to be one of the economic Ministries.  It can change the national employment position. I always stand over that opinion. Every time I ask a supplementary question during Question Time the officials <Col N="731" /> always advise of the first time I said this and it is read out to me; there is no chance of my changing my mind.  Agriculture, Industry, and Energy in certain areas, are the Departments which can change the employment position and create the environment to control and reverse unemployment.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, our economic Ministers have failed abysmally and I do not think we are likely to have any change because the Minister, Deputy Bruton, did not do anything when he was responsible for the Department of Industry and Commerce to stimulate interest by investors. I expect that in the Department of Finance he will continue with his conservative attitude.  The line adopted by the Minister, Deputy Dukes, was: &ldquo;Where is the money?&rdquo; I accept that a certain amount of money has to be paid out in social welfare benefits, but thousands of people would be glad to work for a little more than they receive in unemployment benefit.  It must be soul destroying for those who are on the dole.  I have pity for the long term unemployed in this city who cannot get an opportunity to get any type of work.</P>
    <P>It is a pity those responsible for the economic Ministries cannot see the benefits to be gained by giving investors opportunities to make profits.  If those people are given the opportunity they will create many jobs and I do not think, at the end of the day, that will cost the State any more money than it is costing to pay unemployment benefits.  The combined resources of Bruton, Deasy and Dukes fail to see that, and that is a pity.  I accept that the economic recession is world-wide but, in the past 18 months or so, it has lifted in most other countries.  There has not been a lift in the recession here because the Government have failed to give investors an opportunity to get a better return than they would get on Government gilts.  There is no incentive for those who are prepared to invest their money or take risks.  That is why Irish people have invested their money in Geneva and the Isle of Man and are not prepared to invest at home.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" /> I do not believe it is the function of the Department of Labour to do those things &mdash; they are matters for other Ministries. It is because of the unemployment position created as a result of the policies pursued by other Departments that many agencies of the Department of Labour are carrying a workload they were never meant to have.  I am referring to AnCO, CERT and the Youth Employment Agency.  I refer to those agencies so often that officials in them have got the impression that I have something against them, but that is not true.  I do not have anything against those agencies and I do not think any Member has gone to the same amount of trouble as I have in examining the policies of those agencies.  I should like to thank those agencies for agreeing to meet Fianna Fáil Deputies and being so open and frank with us when debating the policies they are pursuing.  We had many long debates with those officials in the Fianna Fáil Party rooms.  Those officials explained in great detail all their policies and I commend them for that.  It is useful if the Opposition are fully aware of the policies of such agencies.</P>
    <P>However, none of the officials has convinced me, or my colleagues.  We badly need a manpower authority.  I have put forward a plan to consolidate the training agencies under the aegis of one semi-State board to be called the manpower authority.  That plan was given the support of the House in as much as a debate on the matter did not result in a division. The need for such an authority is so obvious that great support for that proposal came not only from those involved in providing the services but from many Government spokesmen.  They put on record that they agree with the need to streamline the agencies in the way I suggested.</P>
    <P>I am aware it is a source of embarrassment to the Minister that the White Paper that was to be produced last year has not seen the light of day.  I do not intend to make a political point about that, but I am aware that the Minister's colleagues in Cabinet do not have any interest in establishing a manpower authority and that is the reason why the White Paper <Col N="733" /> has been left lying for four or five months. There is little point in attacking the Minister for Labour about this issue.  However, it is interesting to note that the Taoiseach, and others, have more interest in coffee in the city than they have in a manpower service.  While I do not have anything against Victor Bewley, and others, the priorities of the Taoiseach and others are amazing.  It would be amusing if it were not so tragic.</P>
    <P>School leavers today face a bewildering choice if working in the training or work experience field.  It is no wonder most young people have little or no idea of the differences in the overlapping agencies. AnCO, the Youth Employment Agency, the work experience programme, CERT, Manpower and the other schemes operated by those agencies all form a related but not tightly knit co-ordinated approach to training for employment. Those agencies should be co-ordinated under the control of a semi-State board to be called the manpower authority.  Under that authority the agencies could maintain their independence &mdash; they all fall off their chairs any time one mentions something like that &mdash; and work in a more streamlined and efficient fashion providing one-stop services for all those seeking training or employment.</P>
    <P>A manpower authority should be geared to be completely aware of market opportunities, consumer trends and successful ventures.  Young people should be trained for real as opposed to notional jobs and, obviously, that is what the European Social Fund is trying to do. Those people should be passed on to the small industry section of the IDA for advice and encouragement about capital to set up their own small concerns.</P>
    <P>The manpower authority I envisage should be the focus in providing the jobs and training the market place wants, should encourage inventiveness and adaptability.  It should be a clearing house for new ideas and provide an efficient network of streamlined services countrywide. It should give quality training opportunities to all those seeking training or retraining without discrimination because of age.  In other words, it should <Col N="734" /> begin the long slow process of providing real employment opportunities for the youth and the unemployed of the country, begin the process of restoring a sense of purpose to our training agencies and lay the foundation stone for a new drive for employment in the wasteland and economic no man's land created by the Government.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of the debate I should like to refer to a county like Leitrim rather than the north of Dublin, the area I usually refer to.  The officials involved in that county on behalf of the State &mdash; those working for ACOT, the IDA, AnCO, Manpower and the Department of Social Welfare &mdash; rarely meet except socially, at the official opening of a factory or when a crisis arises.  While I do not agree with centralising everything, I believe those who are paid by the taxpayers and are involved in trying to solve the unemployment problem should be appointed to one committee, a manpower committee, in that county to consider unemployment there.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Youth Employment Agency have attempted such a process, but the problem is that those involved all report back to different organisations.  I could give several examples of that or, in the course of a debate in the House, attack the organisation involved, but that is not my style.  However, there is an obvious conflict in that those officials report back to different boards who have their own views on how the problem should be tackled.  The State cannot afford that.  There is no reason why one semi-State authority, or committee, should not represent those involved and decide on the policy to be followed by all organisations that are costing taxpayers a considerable amount of money.  I am not saying that money is wasted, but there should be better coordination.</P>
    <P>As I have said to these people, face to face, it is nothing personal and it is not to try to do away with jobs.  There is no doubt, in my mind, that if there was a single authority properly organised using modern technology it would be cheaper and far more efficient.  As a result, the <Col N="735" /> unemployed would be less disillusioned or baffled in regard to these various services. There is much stress and strain in the matter of getting money from Europe or from the Exchequer for the various schemes but this problem could be lessened by the more efficient operation of the services.  There is a point in trying to defend what they are doing by saying they are doing a good job, that everyone understands what they are doing and that the message has got through to the unemployed because we all know from dealing with the unemployed that that is not the case.  We have to stop the proliferation of colour magazines and data which is bashed out to schools and often dumped in rubbish bins.  The position we want to get into is that of trained people explaining to the unemployed the full range of services which are available on behalf of the State.  We do not want to see an unemployed person going to eight offices in the city in order to find out what the taxpayer is paying for.  Why we cannot achieve this, I do not know.</P>
    <P>The Government try to convince us that the services are becoming more tightly knit and co-ordinated.  That is not the case.  Dublin Corporation will not agree to open a one stop shop in Sackville Street where information on all the services could be available.  They say: &ldquo;we have it this way, that way or the other way&rdquo;.  They are not serving in the most efficient way the interests of the people whom the taxpayers are giving them the money to serve.  If the White Paper ever sees the light of day it will probably be so watered down as to be meaningless.  It will join the hundreds of other White Papers which have come out in the past three and a half years or the past 33½ years for that matter and in respect of which nothing has been done.  This is regrettable.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to industrial relations. The main statute governing trade disputes is, as the Minister said this morning, 80 years on the Statute Book, that is, the Trade Disputes Act, 1906.  At the time of its enactment the balance of power weighed heavily in favour of the <Col N="736" /> employer.  The Act provided the legal framework under which unions grew and developed.  The Act has served trade unions and has contributed to the development of collective bargaining between trade unions and employers.  The operation of the Act, however, has given rise to concern as to where exactly the protection of the Act applies.  The Minister for Labour has recently published his proposals, and I thank him for providing me with the various details, for the reform of the law relating to trade disputes and industrial relations.</P>
    <P>In setting out his proposals the Minister has only had limited regard to the proposals in the Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Industrial Relations published in July 1981.  Any changes in the law in this area must be directed towards greater industrial peace and must be seen in the context of overall policy towards encouraging increased investment in industry without which it will not be possible to overcome the severe economic depression and the massive problem of unemployment now being experienced in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The situation in Ireland continues to be one in which there is an excessive number of trade unions.  This factor has often made collective bargaining a most difficult task and as a result the achievement of industrial peace has often been extremely difficult to attain.  I congratulate the Minister for acknowledging the point that the main reason things are quiet at present is the economic recession. If there was a boom tomorrow and high growth rates we would be back to where we were.  I am glad that has been acknowledged because it is quite clear from talking to trade unions that the pressure which is on them is the reason for the quietness.  There is a reality in the workplace.  People are glad to have jobs. Because there are so many unemployed those who have jobs cannot afford to lose them.  That is why strikes such as the one in Dublin Corporation are sad.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that regulation in the formation of trade unions only began, in effect, in 1941, the task facing those involved in the field of industrial relations <Col N="737" /> in Ireland has been more difficult than in competing economies.  Recent legislation both in the formation and amalgamation of trade unions has enabled the slow process of reducing the overall number of trade unions to begin thereby enabling some improvement in industrial relations and enabling a better service and approach on the part of trade unions.</P>
    <P>Reform in the law must be directed towards enhancing the process of negotiation, conciliation and arbitration and must also encourage active involvement in trade unions which meet the needs of a modern industrial society free from protectionism and open to competition from industry throughout the European Community as well as increased competitiveness from developed economies outside the Community.</P>
    <P>The Report of the Commission of Inquiry shows that in 1979, 38 trade unions in the craft and white collar areas represented a mere 96,800 workers while approximately 246,000 workers were in membership of the five largest trade unions.  A more striking example of fragmentation is revealed by the fact that at the same time the 43 smallest unions, representing over 50 per cent of the total number of unions represented a mere 23,400 members, that is about 3.5 per cent of trade union membership.  It is clear that by pooling resources unions can give a more professional service to their members and ensure a more effective realisation of the aims of their members.  This is achieved by a more professional approach to negotiation rather than by a sterile process of confrontation represented by picketing and other forms of industrial action.  Future change in the area of trade union organisation and industrial relations must be geared towards a reduction in strikes and other forms of industrial action.  This can be achieved by way of an improvement in the machinery available for negotiation, conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    <P>An examination of the Minister for Labour's recent proposals may lead one to conclude that in some areas they are directed towards encouraging strike action and thereby allowing might and <Col N="738" /> not right to dominate.  In general, the Minister proposes to give an enhanced status to strike action by increasing immunity from civil or criminal action. This is done by means of what the Minister describes as the &ldquo;complete defence&rdquo;. Unfortunately, what the Minister has failed to do is to show why such an overall degree of protection from criminal or civil liability is necessary in the development of a sound industrial relations climate in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The law has operated generally to afford legal protection to strike action.  If it were otherwise, and a reading of the Minister's proposals might lead to that impression, Ireland would not have had the distinction so often in the past of appearing towards the top of international strike tables.  Fortunately, in the past few years and in the climate of economic recession, the value of having a job and an appreciation of the need for consultation and negotiation rather than outright confrontation has led to a reduction in the number of strikes in Ireland and an appreciation that better results can be achieved, without having to go to the lengths of strike action, by a more professional approach by trade unions and their officials.</P>
    <P>When one reads the Minister's proposals one can see that they are confused and that the proposals, while giving an illusion of meaningful reform, when examined closely are of little or no value.</P>
    <P>For example, the requirement to hold secret ballots might be considered to be a positive step, but when seen in the context of the statement that failure to hold a secret ballot will not give either an employer or any other party grounds for legal action against a union or workers or lead to a loss of the so called &ldquo;complete defence&rdquo;, the requirement is seen as virtually meaningless.  The conferring of a right to workers to have secret ballots must be watched by a commensurate duty to hold such secret ballots.  In the absence of any section, such a duty is illusory.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that: &ldquo;...many of the problems and much of the dissatisfaction with the existing legal position has <Col N="739" /> centred around the question of enforcement&rdquo;. The Minister in fact rejects enforcement and regulation.  It may well be argued that the problems which have often manifested themselves in the past have resulted from a lack of enforcement at trade union level rather than through an excess of legal enforcement.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister proposes to debar applications for <i>ex parte</i> injunctions.  He states that, &ldquo;at present, employers can freely obtain injunctions on an <i>ex parte</i> basis in cases involving trade disputes.&rdquo; In reality, applications today to the courts for such relief is quite rare and this has resulted from an appreciation that, except in exceptional circumstances, recourse to such action, rather than resolving disputes, makes the resolution of trade disputes more difficult.  This fact is reflected in the Report of the Commission of Inquiry which also comes out against such applications been made to the courts as part of the normal process of resolving disputes.</P>
    <P>In the field of the proposed reform of the institutions such as the Labour Court the Minister's proposals defy logic.  The suggestion that the Labour Court will be involved in &ldquo;interpretation&rdquo; but not in the enforcement of trade disputes law is a clear case in point.  It is nonsense to propose that a court applying law and enforcing it will have to rely on the interpretation of that same law by a body free from the responsibility of its application and enforcement.</P>
    <P>Most alarming of the proposals contained in the Minister's document is the suggestion that secondary picketing should be permitted in future.  Events across the Irish Sea in the past couple of years have illustrated the damage that can be caused by such action.  How can the Minister suggest that his proposals enhance democracy for workers when, rather than being given freedom to decide matters for themselves, workers will be subject to bullying?  The Minister will give further legal protection to those who induce and incite others to strike or take other industrial action.  He is proposing to come up with proposals which will <Col N="740" /> encourage secondary action which can only result in damage to Irish industrial relations, further loss of employment, and above all give rise to fears in the minds of foreign investors who might otherwise be happy to invest in Ireland in the future and thereby create increased prosperity for the future and reverse the continuing trend of increased unemployment.</P>
    <P>There are other points in the Government's Discussion Document on Industrial Relations which I should like to deal with.  I do not share the view that legislation has no place in industrial relations.  In certain instances, limited extension of the law are both necessary and feasible.  The main objective of the law, and therefore of the legislators who enact it, is to support and, where necessary, to restrain the power of management and the power of unionised labour in the public interest.</P>
    <P>The main statute governing trade disputes is now 80 years on the Statute Books, i.e., the Trades Dispute Act, 1906.  At the time of its enactment, the balance of power weighed heavily in favour of the employer.  The Act provided a legal framework under which unions grew and developed.  The Act has served trade unions well and has contributed to the development of collective bargaining between trade unions and employers.  The operation of the Act has, however, given rise to concern.  It would seem there is confusion on where exactly the protections of the Act apply or do not apply.</P>
    <P>While I consider that the law has only a secondary role in industrial relations, it could be usefully employed in a number of areas including that of secret ballots. While most trade union rule books require a secret ballot before a strike or other industrial action and most trade unions in fact conduct such secret ballots, I believe that all trade unions should be required in law to have a secret ballot provision in their rule books and all trade unions should hold secret ballots in all cases before any strike or other industrial action is undertaken.</P>
    <P>I support this approach because, in <Col N="741" /> democratic terms, it is important to remove the moral pressure that can be put on a trade union member in voting by a show of hands.  Secret ballots should result in a genuinely representative view of worker attitudes to disputes.  Consideration might be given by the State to covering the proposal costs of secret ballots.</P>
    <P>Depending on the seriousness of the issue, and in normal circumstances after a secret ballot discretion would rest with the executive committees of trade unions to call, or not to call, a strike or other industrial action.  The executive committee of a union is obviously a key decision making body.  I consider that the election of members to union executive committees should also be by secret ballot.  This approach should lead to a genuinely representative expression by the union membership on whom they wish to elect the executive committees. The secret ballot requirement in this instance should also be provided for in union rule books.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the job of the Legislature is to maintain the balance of power between the collective strength of employers and unionised labour.  Abuses of power, therefore, are a legitimate concern to the Legislature.  The small groups of unofficial pickets, or for that matter a one-man picket, which other workers will not pass, are examples of the abuse of power.  There is some evidence that workers are showing a more discriminating attitude towards picket lines but there is a type of blind unthinking observance of pickets which has been peculiar to this country for many decades.</P>
    <P>I feel that the protection of the law should not apply to one-man pickets except when all procedures for the resolution of conflict in the employment concerned have been exhausted.  These procedures would normally include direct discussions within the individual employer as well as reference to a third party, for example, the Labour Court or rights commissioners.</P>
    <P>The fragmented trade union structure gives rise to many problems for trade unions themselves and the conduct of <Col N="742" /> industrial relations generally.  The rationalisation of the trade union structure is a task primarily for the trade unions themselves. One way in which the Legislature can help to control the multiplicity of unions relates to the granting of a negotiation licence to a trade union.  The Trade Union Act, 1971, sets a minimum membership of 500 and a financial deposit of £5,000 as the normal requirements for the grant of a negotiation licence in the case of new trade unions.  Fifteen years have now passed since these requirements were enacted.  I believe that, in the case of a new trade union, the minimum membership level should be increased substantially from the figure of 500, and the financial deposit should be increased from the figure of £5,000.</P>
    <P>Another way the State can assist the trade union movement in rationalising is by updating and improving the costs of amalgamation and, in particular, amending the regulation that no costs are paid until the successful completion of the amalgamation.  The joining of two or more trade unions is by its nature a long, costly process and costs in everyone's interest should be paid on a phased basis, assisting in a positive way towards a successful outcome.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to the Labour Court, a major national industrial relations institution. While the hopes placed in the court at the time of its establishment in 1946 have not been fully realised, it has, nonetheless, an impressive record in dispute settlement.  As in the case of the law governing industrial relations, the Labour Court, too, is in need of review. The increased recourse in recent years to third party intervention in industrial disputes is a source of concern.  The intention of the Oireachtas in 1946 was that the Labour Court would be used as a court of last resort.  However, we now find, particularly in the recent past &mdash; and I will quote the Chairman of the Labour Court, Mr. John Horgan, who said: &ldquo;Matters of quite a trivial character are constantly referred to the court for a full hearing despite the best efforts of the industrial relations officers of the court&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Any change in the institutional <Col N="743" /> arrangements which would help to reduce the number of trivial cases coming before the court and allow it to investigate the more serious cases only must be given serious consideration.  The proposed Labour Relations Commission may well be a step in the right direction.  The additional functions envisaged for the commission, for example the development of codes of practice and a more active approach to dispute prevention and resolution, are deserving of careful examination by all concerned.</P>
    <P>On the whole, the pace of reform following the publication of the Report of the Commission on Industrial Relations, 1981, has been disappointing.  I share the view that the role of the law in industrial relations is a limited one.  However, there is a compelling case for legal change in some respects, especially in the area of secret ballot before strike or any industrial action is taken and also secret ballots for the election of members to union executive committees.</P>
    <P>Because of the public perception, we could be forgiven for thinking that industrial relations are about disputes, late night conciliation conferences, Labour Court hearings, etc.  But we know that this is only a small proportion of industrial relations, and particularly it is that part where trust and relationships have broken down and issues have spilled over into destructive conflict.  The far greater part of industrial relations is the everyday working out of the thousands of issues which crop up in the many different organisations.  Real industrial relations involve the patient work of managers, supervisers and union representatives, never reported by the media, and yet vital to the everyday working of every company or business.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations are about relationships as in a marriage.  It is not an institutional gladiators' contest between the ICTU and the FUE, in which managers are mere helpless spectators.  The current debate about the legal framework for industrial relations diverts attention away from the real issue, the performance of <Col N="744" /> management in the day-to-day conduct of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The 1985 Report of the European Management Forum on International Industrial Competitiveness ranks Ireland 22nd out of 28 OECD countries in industrial relations and 23rd in labour absenteeism. Whether we accept the figures, I think we would all agree that there is considerable scope for improving management performance in many areas of industrial relations.  There is a regrettable tendency for managers to shift the blame onto the trade union movement in general, and to call for legal sanctions to &ldquo;control&rdquo; them.  Even if a legal approach in a voluntary system of industrial relations would work, and I very much doubt it would, managers have to set their own house in order before pointing the finger at someone else.</P>
    <P>I would give no support to those who seek that type of policy because what they are trying to do is attain a position where people would be forced to have two or three part time jobs rather than one permanent job, and to destabilise further the future of our young people. The way they are arguing is doing their case much damage.  It would be better if the FUE were to turn their attention to the Minister's proposals and to try to make them work.  What they are doing is trying to force the Minister, and me in the Opposition, to believe their case.  That is sad.  To put it bluntly, they should cop on.</P>
    <P>I referred last week to emigration.  I do not wish to go back on the points I made then, but while we are on this Estimate I will suggest that more money should be put towards assisting our people who wish to go abroad or those who have gone abroad.  There is a major problem because of the number of young people who have gone away without proper advice and assistance.  Many of them think that to be on the dole is the worst option but that is not always the case.  I was in London on two occasions recently and I met people who have emigrated in the past 18 months and they have a very different attitude now.  When I speak <Col N="745" /> about emigration I am not talking about well educated people but rather I am talking of those who come from areas suffering a high level of deprivation. These people need assistance when they are abroad.  However, the Irish agencies in London &mdash; in Kilburn, Camden Town and other places &mdash; have not the resources to cope with what is a major problem. I was glad to hear the Minister's commitment that the Department will concern themselves about this matter.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the Barrington report.  The up-dating of health and safety regulations and the amendment of legislation dealing with factories and offices as well as legislation dealing with off-shore safety is to be welcomed.  The sooner we carry out that task the better. Many accidents occur in factories and offices and people encounter major problems when they have to work in unsuitable conditions.  It should not be necessary for trade unions to fight for proper conditions: they should be written into legislation.  Whether it be in offices, hospitals or factories, it is wrong that people should have to work in adverse conditions, particularly with regard to hygiene.</P>
    <P>Recently I asked a question in the House regarding implementation of various EC directives.  There are regulations dealing with dangerous inflammable liquids, with transport, with safety regulations in mines and also with regard to ionizing radiation and so on.  I understand why EC regulations are not always implemented, namely, where there could be additional costs involved that could put industries under stress and strain, but there are other regulations that could be implemented.  It would be helpful if that were done in the case of the latter and in the case of those regulating that will not be implemented we should be told the reason.  This is preferable to waiting for pressure to be applied from the EC.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister told us that cuts in the European Social Fund could create major difficulties here.  We have a young population and we have a very high level of unemployment.  I accept it is better for the 45,000 young people on training <Col N="746" /> courses to be involved in such work instead of doing nothing, but we must remember that the courses are of short-term duration and in the vast majority of cases they will not lead to a great future for the young people.  However, I accept that in the event of an economic recovery some young people could benefit from them.</P>
    <P>If the European Social Fund is cut as the Minister has predicted, it is obvious that 1987 and 1988 could be a disastrous period for some of the agencies.  The Government should tell us if money will come from the Exchequer to compensate for that lost from the Social Fund. Obviously, the EC will not continue the fund at the same level as in previous years and that could cause major problems. The selective cuts advocated by Brussels may not suit us and it is a matter I shall take up with Fianna Fáil MEPs.  From what the Minister has said this morning, it appears the EC will decide the criteria and the priorities to be set and that is not acceptable.  We shout loudly in Brussels about farming and other issues and perhaps we should do the same about this matter.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to unofficial strikes and the difficulties experienced as a result in the past few years.  The Minister will be aware of their effect on the morale of investors.  He will have to clamp down on unofficial strikes and will have to enact the necessary legislation. Members of Fianna Fáil recently met a number of large investors and representatives of major firms and they quoted examples of incidents that cannot be ignored.  All the time we hear large companies say they will pull out of this country because of trade union law &mdash; I am thankful they have not done this so far but they have pointed out their concern in the matter.  The trade union movement in the United States has many Irish people in the forefront and the leaders have a close affiliation with trade unions here.  They will tell one exactly what they think of unofficial strikes.  People like Teddy Gleeson, who has a strong Irish background, and the other mighty unions in the United States will expel a union <Col N="747" /> member or a branch for involvement in unofficial strikes, although I accept that is a matter for the trade unions themselves. However, the Minister in dealing with reform of industrial relations and trade union law will have to take strong action. I accept that in some areas there has to be a certain amount of give and take but there is no argument to make in respect of wildcat strikes or one-man picketing. This country has continued to build fairly good legislation to enable disputes to be settled by negotiation and peacefully.  If all those processes fail the unions have the right to go on strike, but unofficial strikes and one-man picketing are making more difficult the revival of the economy.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter now because I have been asked by many of my colleagues to point out the facts.  The concern that has been expressed in this matter has been voiced by people who have served the country well, who do not make statements rashly and who are not involved in right-wing capitalist managements, for whom I have no time.  The people I am talking about have endeavoured to have good industrial relations with their own workforce and their views must be considered. Our attitude has to change if we want to revive the economy in the way we wish.  It requires the urgent attention of the Minister.  It cannot be something that must wait until we have economic recovery.</P>
    <P>We are supporting this Estimate.  I appreciate the work the Minister has done personally and that of his senior officials.  The difficulties encountered by the Department of Labour in recent years have been caused by the mismanagement of other Ministers and their lack of ability to cope.  It is nice to be spokesman to a Department who are attempting to do something useful and if the other Departments could use the tactics used by the Department of Labour we would not have so many major problems.</P>
    <P>I may not be here when the Minister replies, and this is not meant to be a sign of disrespect; I have to go to the west because it is an important day there.  Perhaps the Minister would mention the <Col N="748" /> Dublin strike and tell us if anything might happen over the weekend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's speech was very wide-ranging and showed the links and the inter-independency not just in the area of work but in the social area as well.  The Minister laid down a list of priorities but even this list showed that we cannot separate work from the human condition.  His fourth priority was the investigation of links between economic growth and social progress and showed that without social progress and social justice economic growth cannot be the answer to our problems.  I also welcome the prompt delivery of the annual report for 1985, as well as the other reports, because these are markers to which we can respond.</P>
      <P>The Minister drew attention to the greatest challenge facing us today, that is, redefining labour and employment because of the technology and social changes, the large numbers coming into the workforce for the first time, particularly women, and our young, educated, skilled population.  Our greatest challenge is to redefine the work ethic, unemployment, employment as we knew it, and the effects, physically and psychologically, they are having on our people. The Department of Labour have the staff competent to carry out this work.  They should take the initiative to help solve the problem of people who are made redundant, and who are sometimes within the community made to feel redundant, as human beeings.  We need to have a breakdown of the boundaries between what was known as formal work, gainful employment, and informal work, the valued work done in the home and voluntarily in the community.  This will become much more important and will give a great deal of satisfaction in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a book on the future of work the author gives the percentage of work done in the community.  In Britain &mdash; and I am sure the figure is at least as high here &mdash; 40 per cent of work done in the community is termed informal work.  At present this work is done without financial reward, <Col N="749" /> yet it gives tremendous job satisfaction. This is some of the most valuable work being done.  Until we put different values on this type of informal work, and on work in the service area &mdash; which is the only area that is expanding &mdash; we will not reach the fundamental cause of people's dissatisfaction, unhappiness and sometimes total disintegration because they are excluded from what is known as formal employment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the eligibility criteria for benefit under the social welfare scheme has been amended to include married women.  We must aim at encouraging more people to work in the community either through training schemes or carrying out projects.  I wish to refer to the work carried out by AnCO apprentices on St. Anthony's Franciscan Monastery at Louvain.  We saw a very inspiring programme on RTE which showed the generosity of the Franciscan Brothers at Louvain.  As Deputy Ahern said, emigration at a certain level can be seen as one of the best learning opportunities we can give our children.  Louvain is a shining example of that.  That programme highlighted what we need to do to help our young people cross existing boundaries &mdash; language and territorial.  By working in Europe our young people can make a most significant contribution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern also referred to the less exciting area of emigration, the forced emigration of our young people who leave Ireland without adequate information, skills or qualifications, and find themselves lonely, isolated and poverty stricken, particularly in cities around Britain.  The facts of life should be spelled out for these young people before they embark on such a trip.  They should be told that unlike the fifties, the quick trip to Britain in the eighties is just not on, and they should make more preparation before they emigrate.  We must all share the responsibility for not allowing our young people to find themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Deputy Ahern referred to the European Social Fund. The Minister is right to voice his fears about the restriction and the greater distribution now because of the accession <Col N="750" /> of Spain and Portugal whose rightful demand on the funds must be met.  I support the Minister's insistence that the whole concept and ideal of the Treaty of Rome upon which the EC is based &mdash; and the Irish people voted in large numbers with tremendous enthusiasm to enter the EC because they saw the Treaty as not alone inspiring but potentially practical &mdash; are that the weaker, less industrialised countries were promised that the objective would be to remove the inequalities and to restrain the stronger industrialised countries from taking advantage of the weaker countries and to build up the smaller countries.  The EC member states like Ireland must remind those stronger, more powerful countries that the whole concept of Community in Europe is being put at risk if they do not recognise that fact in bad times as well as in good times. I hope that the increase from 1.4 per cent to closer to 2 per cent will be achieved, and we should all support the Minister on that through lobbying or by any other means that we can.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern spent much of his allotted time on industrial relations and the role of the trade unions and particularly &mdash; here I support him &mdash; on the role of management.  Very often the whole responsibility for industrial relations, particularly when they fall down, is put on the heads of the workers while too often it is the responsibility of industrial management, and industrial relations are not taken into consideration.  I welcome the Minister's establishment of a new labour relations commission for the promotion of good industrial relations as well as for the provision of conciliation, advisory and other services.  Many times strikes and breakdowns occur not for what are seen as surface reasons but for more subtle reasons, as the Minister pointed out.  Very often the devaluing of the workers and the work, lack of communication or even refusal to take seriously what the work force are saying lead to the breakdown.  For instance, the Minister says, rightly, that frequently improvements in morale and recognition of the dignity and value of the worker are being sought rather than clear pay rises <Col N="751" /> but because workers feel that that negotiating power is the only recognition given to them, that leads to the breakdown.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's allotment of funds for training.  One area on which I would ask management, the trade unions and other training agencies to concentrate is the skill and training that are operating successfully in other areas, of conflict resolution, of giving skills to people to resolve the conflict before breakdown occurs.  There are several models of conflict resolution by trained and skilled conciliators which should give us hope that we can continue productively and skilfully in human relations.</P>
    <P>I note with a certain sadness the Minister's emphasis that a mistaken notion had taken root that because we have certain legislation with regard to equal pay and equal opportunity in employment, a social policy objective is no longer an issue.  Some people even believe that discrimination against women at work has been removed.  All evidence, written and informal, is to the contrary.  As the annual report of the Department of Labour for 1984 pointed out, the differential between male and female continues, and I understand that women get only 59 per cent of what men get in the same areas, particularly in the industrial area.  That is ten years after the introduction of the Equal Pay Act and nine years after the introduction of the Employment Equality Act.</P>
    <P>I press the Minister to take positive steps to redress the situation and, more important, to dispel the myth abroad that it is not necessary to do so.  A certain feeling obtains that we would much prefer all this area of equality and employment opportunity to go away, particularly in bad times when we have enough problems without having to ensure through employment opportunity that we include women and so increase our problems.  As the Minister said in his introduction, we have a duty to ensure that we have social justice, and social justice is for women as well as for men, and in order to achieve that we need positive, affirmative action.  I welcome <Col N="752" /> the moves being made in that direction in the Department of Labour and I am looking forward to seeing the effects.</P>
    <P>For instance, I ask the Minister what progress has been made with an initiative to creat a pilot scheme for a creche for the Department of Labour supported by AnCO.  The Minister says that AnCO have already established expertise in operating career development programmes as part of the programme for the training of women within organisations. I ask the Minister how many special courses AnCO are running for women towards that end, taking into consideration the cut-backs and so on this year.  I know that certain initiatives have been taken by semi-State bodies such as the IDA and Aer Rianta with regard to creche facilities.  I hope that with the thrust and energy of the Minister for Labour we can exact from the State Departments and the semi-State bodies a much more positive programme.  Some of the organisations who have made that kind of progress will see no encouragement to continue it and feel that they are in isolation.  Therefore we need to encourage existing models and increase the number.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I welcome the Minister's emphasis on information.  Deputy Ahern talked about the co-ordination of information. In this regard I ask the Minister to concentrate on a special campaign in respect of part time workers.  The whole area of potential of part time working is welcomed as long as we have the regulations and controls and that proper value is given to part time work.  I would like the Minister to initiate a special campaign of information within his Department with a concise programme to ensure that part time workers are made aware of the rights they have and the rights they have not got.  About 70 per cent of part time workers in Ireland are women.  Perhaps that is why that whole area has not been as protected and secure as it should have been.  I should like to think that during the coming year we will make progress in the areas to which he referred today and that the priorities in his speech will be <Col N="753" /> achieved.  I commend all the people involved in the Department of Labour for their efforts and urge them to build on their efforts so that we may progress even faster in these areas.</P>

      <P>Ag cuidiú leis an Meastachán seo is dócha go bhfuil an ceart agam a rá gur Roinn an-tábhachtach an Roinn seo.  The importance of the Department of Labour in the present economic circumstances cannot be over-emphasised. In the short time available, I hope to indicate some of those emphases.</P>
      <P>Last year, in contributing to this debate, I indicated that the Department of Labour should be to the forefront in eliminating the most serious problem facing us, unemployment.  In the 12 months since then I have not been convinced that the Department or the Minister have made the impact which should have been made in this area.  Indeed, the Department of Labour seem to be out in the cold.  Their capacity to influence policy seems to have been eroded.</P>
      <P>The NESC report on manpower policy pointed out that the Department of Labour had not evolved into a central force with the authority and drive to co-ordinate, develop and review manpower policies.  The remarks of NESC are merely an extension of the mind, mood and attitude in my contribution to this Estimate 12 months ago.  The NESC said that a Cabinet sub-committee should be set up with statutory powers to deal with manpower and training which would help to ensure that the skills needed in industry and the economy would be fostered. They noted with concern the reduction in the number of apprentices over the past number of years and called for a national examination of conscience in this whole area.  They warned that the quality of apprenticeship training must continue to be of the highest order if we are to compete internationally because efficiency is one of the key words in competing in this area.</P>

    <P>At present, 18 per cent of the workforce are without jobs.  One in five of the workforce is registered as unemployed but we all know that registered figures do <Col N="754" /> not convey the true picture of the dearth of employment at present.</P>
    <P>For example, 45,000 people are taking part in the various courses under the aegis of the Department of Labour.  These are worthwhile in retraining people to cope with changes in technology, but many of them have no sustainable jobs when they complete these courses.  However, these courses give a false figure in regard to the total number unemployed.  The number of second level pupils who stay on at school is not taken into consideration either.  There are no statistics in this regard but we all know that many pupils stay on after they do their intermediate certificate.  Some years ago these people would have got jobs but, because there is no prospect of employment, they stay on to do their leaving certificate.  At one time the leaving certificate would have ensured that they would have got a job but that is not the case now, and they stay on to do commercial and other courses.  This adds to the numbers seeking employment.</P>
    <P>Our economic forecasters warn that, despite the economic upturn, unemployment will not decrease which adds to the sense of defeatism in regard to jobs.  We must also remember that economic forecasting is a very inexact science.  Last summer, for example, the Department of Finance, the Central Bank, the OECD and even the ESRI expected a growth of more than 2 per cent in gross domestic product for 1985.  This was expounded by Government Ministers and TDs all over the country but it eventually emerged that the growth, if any, was less than 1 per cent.  The lesson is that experts are not always right.  We must leave aside defeatist establishment thinking if we are to deal with the challenges posed to society by our growing labour market. Our population and labour market are increasing at a faster rate than anywhere else in the industrialised world.  By 1991 it is estimated that we will have three times as many people entering the labour market as retiring.</P>
    <P>In 1979, approximately one in every 14 members of the labour force was without a job.  By the end of 1985, the proportion <Col N="755" /> had risen to about one in five.  In 1979, about 225,000 people worked in the manufacturing industry but, by 1985, that workforce had shrunk to 187,000.  Average unemployment rose by about 50 per cent between 1982 and 1985.  Pointing to the enormous unemployment levels North and South, Dr. Finola Kennedy said there are few enough signs of a creative impulse in overcoming unemployment, rather that there are indications both North and South that the whole debate is being hijacked by public sector versus private sector extremists.  Unemployment poses the greatest challenge to our society and Government.  We need to gear our resources towards productive, job-creating economic activity on a scale hitherto unseen in this country.  This will involve an imaginative flight beyond conventional thinking, an expansion outside our familiar approach to the economy.</P>
    <P>The experience of other small nations must provide us with food for thought. The research of Professor Wrigley in Cork University and other economists indicates that in devising a productive employment strategy in the last decade of the 20th century we should look to successful examples provided by other small nations such as Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Switzerland.  All these countries have highly productive economies with unemployment rates averaging between 3 per cent and 4 per cent while ours is at 18 per cent.</P>
    <P>If we are to achieve the growth rates and employment levels of these countries we must prepare the ground work by appropriate measures to encourage enterprise.  In the context of devising strategy for job creating economic activity, productive investment in education, strengthening our intellectual resources and capacity for new ideas will be vital components.  Manpower training and educational policy will play a central role in such a strategy within the overall industrial and economic framework.</P>
    <P>I wish only to be positive and constructive in this debate.  I must point out, however, that in the absence of a productive, job-creating economic strategy, <Col N="756" /> the Cabinet task force is doomed to failure. Youth training and employment schemes cannot of themselves be expected to create a dynamic labour market.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet task force on employment has signally failed since its inception over three years ago to bring a co-ordinated and integrated approach to the problem of joblessness.</P>

      <P>The establishment of a new ministerial task-force to spearhead job creation at the beginning of March is a futile measure, unless it is accompanied by measures to generate investment and enterprise.</P>
      <P>We were told that the task force on employment &mdash; comprised of the Ministers for Finance, Industry and Commerce, Labour and Social Welfare &mdash; would co-ordinate departmental ideas on how the country can best take advantage of the turn around in the economy. It was indicated that the Government would avail of the international economic upswing to devise new and imaginative schemes to boost job numbers.  I have not seen any evidence of that.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 2.1. of <i>Building on Reality</i> states that the central economic and social priority in the period of the plan is to tackle the unemployment crisis.  It is, therefore, deeply disappointing that this Government have done so extraordinarily little to tackle unemployment since they took office despite the existence during that period of a Cabinet sub-committee whose brief was to create jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is particularly disturbing that so little has been done to fulfil the Coalition pledge that the environment created by their tax and incentive policies would be conductive to the creation of employment. I urge the Government to take action to boost investment and job creation. Appropriate policy measures taken in small business could help to reduce our appallingly high unemployment figures. Small industry is a critical force in job creation and central to the Government's <Col N="757" /> avowed strategy to boost indigenous Irish industries.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting we devote all our activities to small industries.  I agree with the suggestion by the Government that small industries are a critical force in job creation.  According to the CII's small firms association it will be possible to create between 60,000 and 70,000 additional jobs in the small business sector by 1990 if the right climate is created.  It is the responsibility of the Government to create that employment.  For every one job created in manufacturing industry it is well known that six or seven additional jobs are created elsewhere.  Therefore 12,000 manufacturing jobs would generate additional employment rendering achievable the 60,000 to 70,000 jobs target.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to set myself up as being better than the economists, advisers or task forces that this Government are adept at setting up.  They have set up many task forces since they came to power and I will deal with one in relation to my city later.</P>

      <P>I understand that, but I only made these passing references to encourage the Government to do something about unemployment.  If the Government did this they may contribute to a downward trend in unemployment.</P>
      <P>Almost £300 million has now been collected under the Youth Employment Levy.  According to the Department of Labour it has been used to fund AnCO, CERT, ACOT, the Youth Employment Agency and both the enterprise allowance scheme and the employment incentive scheme where the beneficiaries are below 25 years.  The sum collected may seem large but is quite small in relation to the overall cost of unemployment, now put at up to £700 million a year.  Unemployment assistance alone will cost £370 million in 1986 while unemployment benefit is currently being paid out at a rate of up to £25 million a month.</P>
      <P>A Government document called &ldquo;Comprehensive Public Expenditure Programmes&rdquo; puts the cost of industrial training and job creation at around £465 million gross in 1984.  Despite huge spending the level of unemployment has risen from 90,000 in 1979 to 232,000 at present.  These figures relate to the numbers on the live register only and do not take account of special schemes which mask the real extent of the problem.</P>

      <P>I was glad to learn of the Taoiseach's sudden interest in and conversion to the securing of jobs.  It is very welcome even if it is only for sentimental reasons.  What about all the other closures we have had over recent years and which have continued unabated up to the present day?  At the first sign of any difficulty they call in the liquidator and <Col N="759" /> close down the enterprise.  Let me list a few examples.  Cork Dockyard was closed and boats are being built in other dockyards around the world.  The State owned 49 per cent of this dockyard but the Government closed it down.  Where was the sentimentality when Irish Shipping was scuttled and our flag hauled down?</P>
      <P>In Cork we have the dubious distinction of being the initial black spot, followed by the Border regions, County Wexford, Castlebar and the west.  If some people in this House had their way SFADCo. would be in the same position as Cork.  There was further bad news for Cork yesterday when a major computer plant, CPT, announced that it would close next month with the loss of 30 jobs. The future of 102 more jobs in the research and development wing hinges on a further IDA grant.  A recent survey by Cork Corporation indicates that the city's unemployment figures are now running ahead of the national average.  At the peak of the job crisis in Cork two years ago a national task force was established and, according to all the publicity, this was going to be the greatest thing since sliced bread with promises of it being the answer to unemployment.  The recommendations of this task force were never published.  I would like to know why.  There is no evidence, a year after, that the task force has achieved anything in Cork on the jobs front.  The time has come for the findings of that task force to be made public and for the Government to act.  In conclusion, I acknowledge the increase in the Estimates of £36,137,000 over the 1985 figure to £171,490,000.  But what value will we get for that in terms of permanent job creation?</P>

      <P>Apart from the friendship that I have with the man, I share little else.  He has treated us to a fantasy <Col N="760" /> here today.  He has not referred to the 1977 manifesto which is undoubtedly the root cause of Ireland's problems.  It is because of that that we have no money. It was an appalling bribe to the Irish nation who accepted it.  Another Fianna Fáil friend recently told me that while it was a sin to conceive the 1977 manifesto, the real sin was in implementing it.  The other Fianna Fáil Deputy in exile, Deputy Neil Blaney, described it last night on television as an election auction conducted by Fianna Fáil in 1977.  That is the root cause of the problems.</P>

      <P>It will continue to be the underlying problem well into the next century.  It is a wonder that Fianna Fáil, although split, have survived at all, nine years down the road.  That manifesto will be an albatross around their necks and that of the country for many years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having got that off my chest, I would like to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Quinn, who has, over the last four years, earned his corn.  He has been one of the outstanding successes in the Government. I would like to congratulate him on the wide range and variety of schemes that he has initiated.  I have certain reservations about some of them which are merely twentieth century relief schemes. Nevertheless they are very much needed at this time and I urge him to continue with them, particularly the very worthwhile social employment scheme which has given hope to many people in the no hope region and has enabled them to go to work with a certain amount of dignity. It has been tremendously successful, particularly in my own sadly deprived and neglected area of Dundalk which has suffered over the last 20 years because of the emphasis placed on the Cork region which, due to political expediency, was stuffed full of industry until a year or two ago.  The Border region has been sadly neglected, particularly by Fianna Fáil who at one time had three Deputies in County Louth and failed to stem the <Col N="761" /> growing loss of manufacturing jobs which was the highest in Ireland.  Over the last nine years we have lost 7,000 jobs in the Border region and that, outside Dublin, is the highest loss in the country.</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme has been a great help to the Border region.  I congratulate the Minister for his recent help in giving a fairly substantial sum of money to the Dundalk Combined Residents' Association thereby enabling 21 young people to become employed. These young people have set about their work with tremendous resolution and dedication.  I hope the Minister will continue that scheme.  I would also like to pay tribute to the efforts of the National Manpower Service who are very fair in allocating jobs in my region and are performing a very useful service.  I would also congratulate the AnCO group.  They are performing a tremendous job in Dundalk. They recently gave great help to a group of 12 people who lost their jobs when Clarks collapsed and who made a submission to the IDA as a result of which they were retrained by AnCO. There are 16 people now employed with the prospect of another six being taken on in the coming week.  It is refreshing to note that during the six months training not one hour was lost through alcoholism or absenteeism or &ldquo;sickness&rdquo; because these people have a vested interest in turning up for work every day.  This underlines the desirability of young people having a direct stake in a business. Efforts such as theirs should be promoted and encouraged by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the trade unions.  This is where I would part company with the Minister.  Having been abroad on several trips recently I feel that one of our great problems is the lack of responsibility on the part of trade unions. It is a burden that is not helpful to the nation or to the economy.  Certainly it does not help in attracting industrialists from abroad.</P>
    <P>We have a trade union problem which was exemplified recently by the prolonged and irrational teachers' dispute.  Is it any wonder that the Dublin binmen are looking for their pound of flesh &mdash; and <Col N="762" /> who will be after them?  Is it not fair to accept that everybody who is working, particularly for low wages, will be demanding a slice of a cake which is rapidly diminishing?  The role of trade unions needs to be revised &mdash; and that is putting it mildly &mdash; if we are to attract industrialists to invest money here.</P>
    <P>I point to the recent closure of VEHA in Wicklow as an appalling indictment of very bad labour relations.  Another problem can be appended here, which is absenteeism. It is way above the European level and abseentism on Mondays has reached chronic proportions.  Any chronic offender who has a persistently bad record of absenteeism on Mondays and Fridays should not be allowed to remain in that job.  There are too many others queuing up for work.  Whether one or ten doctors' certificates are produced, a known offender should be shown the door and that job given to somebody who would appreciate it.</P>
    <P>I come back to the hoary chestnut which nevertheless must be adverted to again.  There is a section of the population who will not thank me for saying it, but the whole concept of job sharing must be considered in an automated world, because automation and technology will continue to make frightening inroads into employment.  Glib comments by politicians about job creation are only waffle.  No matter what Government are in power, I see a worsening scenario on job creation because of the advances and development of modern technology and automation. The concept of job sharing will have to be considered in the next decade, as will the removal of overtime, by trade unions and Government alike, if we are sincere in our belief in the creation of jobs for the tens of thousands of young people leaving school every year.</P>
    <P>As I have said previously in budget debates, the Government should introduce attractive tax-free incentives for people to leave their jobs at as early an age as 55 years, to allow young people to get jobs in the public service.  There is a large proportion of women working who do not need to work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few observations on the Minister's speech this morning.  I want, first, to say that I commend a great deal the initiative and effort which this Minister has applied to his task and to previous tasks which he has set himself.  We all know that he is, by any standard, a very serious, diligent and committed politician.  However, when any Member stands up in the House and says things like that there is always a &ldquo;but&rdquo;.  I was disappointed with one of his earlier remarks, which either deliberately or otherwise &mdash; and I suspect that it was otherwise &mdash; misrepresented the position of a number of people who have asked that certain new approaches be considered to aspects of the unemployment situation.  I refer specifically to his remarks that &ldquo;It comes as no surprise to me that those who reject a major role for the State in taking direct action to tackle unemployment also reject the idea of socially useful work&rdquo;.  He went on to talk about &ldquo;that group&rdquo;&mdash; which is a fairly thinly disguised attack on a new political party which I happen to represent at present &mdash; advocating &ldquo;a narrow commercialism&rdquo; and so on.  I put it to him candidly that he is either misinformed, or being deliberately mischievous.  Because I do not believe it is the latter, I presume that he is misinformed.  On the contrary, the facts are that the so-called advocates of the new idea, which I note he has consistently attacked, inside and outside this House since it has come to be voiced, have simply been telling people the truth about basic problems affecting unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He talks about being convinced &ldquo;that this kind of Gladstonian moralism has to be challenged if the potentially dynamic role of community-based projects for the <Col N="765" /> disadvantaged is to be developed.&rdquo;  The most effective way in which to challenge it would be simply to do what the Government said they would do when they came to office.  Nobody is questioning the potentially dynamic role of community-based projects for the disadvantaged, but that is not the issue.  The issue is not these schemes which have a net contribution to make to the economic wellbeing of the individuals participating and the social fabric of our society, but the more fundamental question of how to get almost a quarter of a million people back to work, or as many of them as is possible.</P>
    <P>Later the Minister spoke about the general employment situation in a paragraph which was symbolically very brief. He spoke about the figure of over 230,000 being unacceptably high.  He said: &ldquo;It is attributable to the major upheaval being experienced in international markets, redundancies arising from increased automation and the increase in the Irish labour force.&rdquo;  With respect, that is a lot of nonsense.  The figure is unacceptably high and is attributable in part to those factors, but is not fundamentally attributable to the major upheaval being experienced in international markets, or automation, or the increase in the Irish labour force.  It is essentially attributable to the mismanagement of the economy over the past ten years.</P>
    <P>The Irish economy represents approximately 0.6 of the EC market.  There could be an international hurricane blowing economically but it need not affect this country if it was properly managed. Automation has not made the kind of contribution implied here if the Minister's three-pronged rationale for the unacceptably high level of unemployment is to be accepted.  The reasons are much more fundamental and much more obvious.</P>
    <P>The way to challenge what is being said by the new political party is to deal with that issue, to deal with the question of an unacceptably high degree of State expenditure, an unacceptably high level of tax which is depressing enterprise and to do something about them.  That is not to say <Col N="766" /> that there is not room for State involvement, State equity, joint venture or partnership between the State and private sector.  Only a fool would suggest that it should be one or the other.  The question is one of balance, not of ideology.  The State does not have the right to assume that it, and it alone, has a monopoly in this area, either a monopoly of wisdom, experience or ability.  Many Members who work on committees of the House have seen that under a number of those heads the State falls far short in terms of what Deputy McGahon has called the real world.</P>
    <P>It is incredible to find this attack coming from a Minister who represents a Government who in the last three and a half years have brought about a situation where there are almost 250,000 people unemployed.  I admit that it is not the Government's fault totally, but the very least that should happen in those circumstances is that there should be a certain degree of charitable silence, or cautious questioning, about new approaches rather than a heated, angry and, on occasions, hysterical attack.  I should like the Minister to comment on what he implies is a Gladstonian moralism in this new approach.  The facts are that in his tenure of office the tax take on a worker with taxable income of £8,000 rose by 30 per cent while the tax take on a worker with taxable income of £30,000 rose by 4 per cent.  That is hardly epitomising a care for the disadvantaged or the deprived in our community.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain how there has been an increase in the jobless total of more than 50,000 since the Government took office and how there has been a rise in income tax of twice the level of inflation during that period?  Will the Minister say how that helps anybody, whether they are in a job or unemployed? Will the Minister explain, not just because of its symbolism in terms of this Left/Right axis that apparently obsesses Members in some parts of the House but also because of its economic hardship, the Government's attitude to the arbitrary cuts in the health services and not the need to curb overall expenditure?</P>

      <P>I suggest that there are <Col N="768" /> many ways in which the full potential of the public service can be brought to its maximum, where people can have dignity and respect and where they can be given employment in the part time schemes which help the long term unemployed.  I should like to ask the Minister, with great respect for him, to address the fundamental issues.  Otherwise this will become the classic situation of people moving around the furniture on the <i>Titanic.</i> The schemes will not solve the fundamental problems, and that is what we should be concerned about, not raising ideological hares on the basis of misinformation or for the sake of political mischief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Members for their time, their contributions and the compliments they paid to the Department of Labour.  It is not often Members get an opportunity to thank officials of that Department for their work and dedication. I should like to express my appreciation of the enormous output of the Department, notwithstanding the embargo and having due regard to the number of increased tasks I have asked them to undertake in my term of office.</P>
      <P>In his wide-ranging contribution Deputy Ahern raised the question of industrial relations and the Dublin Corporation dispute.  I understand why, in his capacity as deputy Lord Mayor, he has to leave the House.  I should like to express my concern at the dispute. I welcome the intervention of Deputy McGahon in regard to it and I hope there will be moves soon by the various parties that will result in a resumption of negotiations. There is a need for a new realism in our economy with regard to the level of settlements that are available, particularly having regard to the level of taxation, which is unacceptably high.  The realism that is required should come sooner rather than later and I hope negotiations resume soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the Department of Labour, as Deputy Ahern pointed out, essentially is concerned with the labour market and the labour force in our economy.  We have an obligation to ensure that the <Col N="769" /> people who come into the labour market are well equipped, well trained and well educated.  I was amazed at the apparent complaint by Deputy Lyons that some people are staying on in school because they cannot get a job.  Many of the jobs that young people of group and intermediate certificate level used to get do not exist any longer and where they do they do not represent a reasonable future for the people involved.  I do not think an investment in education or in training is a substitute for employment.  It is a guarantee in regard to the kind of work a person is capable of doing.</P>
    <P>The role of the Department relates to ensuring that people are adequately and properly trained, that the whole area of industrial relations is properly monitored and that in the area of occupational safety and health there is an improvement in standards.  It is not readily understood that we have an unacceptably high level of accidents in our workplaces and we do not have an adequate range of protective legislation to ensure the workers and management take responsibility to reduce to the lowest possible level the number of accidents, fatal and otherwise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern ranged over a wide area.  He referred to his proposal regarding an integrated single manpower authority. I regret that the White Paper on manpower policy has been delayed but I hope to bring it forward fairly soon. When it is published it will not be a watered down document but one which will adequately represent the consensus that is emerging in relation to this area. It will be a very useful and effective instrument in getting an integration of the wide range of services that exist to help people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern referred to trade union reform and I should like to thank him for his support in that regard.  He was critical about some aspects of the legislation but, because I do not have time, I will not deal with them today.  I do not think he was correct in what he said in relation to the impact the proposals will have with regard to trade dispute law.  I share his view that we have far too many trade unions, that the trade union movement <Col N="770" /> is badly served as a result and, as a consequence, the workforce do not get the kind of service they either deserve or require.  In some cases, as Deputy McGahon said earlier, there is internal conflict within the trade union movement which manifests itself in such a manner that the genuine interests of working people instead of being advanced are being retarded.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy Ahern, speaking on behalf of the main Opposition party, recognised that the claim by certain management groups, including the FUE which he named specifically, that the deregulation of protective legislation was a necessary prerequisite to providing employment in this country, was something he would not support and the legitimacy of which he did not recognise.  I share his analysis and I welcome the position he is adopting on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  There is a need for all of us to stop blaming factors other than the ones we control ourselves particularly in relation to industrial management and the management of human resources. Rather than blaming legislation for failures in certain areas and suggesting that if that legislation was removed the problems would be resolved, we should be looking at how we run our own affairs.</P>
    <P>To that extent, Deputy Barnes put her finger very much on a new area of growth in terms of the management of the Irish economy, including the labour market and the human resource it represents.  I share the Deputy's concern.  There is an extraordinary need for human development training in the area of how to actually manage in a modern developed society which recognises fundamental democratic rights and the integrity of the individual, and the rights of individuals to assert themselves in a manner which underlines and underpins their position as human beings.</P>
    <P>We are taking into the end of this century and perhaps into the beginning of the next century, Victorian attitudes about authority and responsibility which will not travel on the ground any more, particularly with young people.  We have not yet transferred that to our economic <Col N="771" /> system in a manner which reduces conflicts and difficulties.  As Deputy Barnes rightly said, the only way one can assert one's position or attempt to define one's value as a human being in a particular enterprise is to ask for more money when frequently what one might be really asking for is more recognition, responsibility and a place in the decision making process.  The trade unions are increasingly getting involved in areas other than specifically money matters.  They recognise that this is an important factor. There is a need for training in that area and I would hope we would develop into it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern raised specifically some questions about safety directives and regulations. Lest it be left hanging on the record of the House that we were somehow or other deliberately, either covertly or overtly, failing to implement directives we have undertaken at Council level, the regulations which are being prepared in relation to some of the safety directives he referred to are being prepared slowly because they involve legal and complex problems which require resolution. There is no suggestion that they are not being implemented for some reason related to a reluctance on our parts to comply with our obligations.  We are particularly communauttaire in observing and complying with the obligations we undertake within the EC.  It is for that reason we are slow to undertake and support EC directives until we are satisfied we are in a position to implement them. I have to say that, tragically, that is not the position some other member states find themselves in.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes referred to the questions of migration and emigration and referred to the point Deputy Ahern made in relation to the levels of emigration.  I think she is right.  We have got to recognise that, if we want to live on this island at the standard of living our current budget decifit suggests we aspire to, we will have to earn that living off this island. In order to do that, we have got to learn how to sell what we can produce on this island abroad.  It is a lesson which every <Col N="772" /> other north European country has already learned.  The Belgians, the Dutch and the Danes do not regard the large numbers of people they have working and living in different parts of the world either for short or protracted periods of time as people who are failed citizens. Simply, the contrary is the case.  They regard them as people out in the market place earning a living and in the process earning a living for their families back home.</P>
    <P>This country is trapped by the history of emigration in the last century and still thinks of it as some kind of American wake symbolised by the cardboard box, the piece of string and the John B. Keane play &ldquo;Many Young Men of Twenty&rdquo; and that whole wretched sad scene.  That is no longer the reality in many cases.  People leave to go to a better job abroad and in many cases return with enhanced skills to work on this island.  The Louvain project, which was shown recently on television, the idea of trying to train people in how to break into a continental market which has 320 million people and to which we have an automatic right of access &mdash; it is the biggest single integrated purchasing market, and I use that phrase advisedly, in the world &mdash; is a Heaven sent opportunity for this country.  The measures which have been taken by my Department, to take the economic point made by Deputy Lyons, are specifically designed to ensure that the labour force we possess at every level does not lack the skills necessary to exploit that market, be they skills of marketing, language or communication.  Therefore, I make no apology for having obtained and diverted large resources of taxpayers' money into that area.  Quite frankly, that is the area where the future of this country now lies.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Barnes referred to the question of equality and the general position of positive action.  I can understand the sentiments which motivated Deputy McGahon to make the points he did, and I do not genuinely think that he himself is necessarily conservative or <Col N="773" /> sexist.  I know him personally to have a great regard for women.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>He mentioned job sharing and proposed that we should look at the available amount of work and see do people need to hold down an economic job.  There is no necessary conflict between that position and the position which Deputy Barnes put forward, which I would support, that someone who has a contribution to make should be allowed to make it irrespective of his or her economic circumstances.  We have educated people to a level where they have a contribution to make and where their own need requires them to make that contribution.  We have to strike a balance between the level of remuneration for everyone in society and the capability of people to make that contribution.</P>
      <P>I will return to the points made by the Deputy Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Keating.  I am critical of some of the points which have been reported in the newspapers as having come from the Leader of that Party with particular reference to his perception &mdash; if I have it correctly and I am open to be corrected &mdash; of the economic role of AnCO and his public statement as recently as last week that many of the AnCO programmes were useless, or not of any real economic value.  I dispute that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not remember him saying that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can get the references. He has expressed a strong scepticism about the potential value of many of these programmes.  Having seen AnCO in <Col N="774" /> operation &mdash; and it is not an organisation without fault &mdash; my experience is that of the 45,000 people in all of the various programmes &mdash; some Deputies suggest they are a substitute for unemployment &mdash; the reality is in so far as we can be accurate about these figures, and I would like to be more accurate, more than 50 per cent of them will get placed in employment.  They may not necessarily get the job they would like or prefer, and they may not get it at a level of remuneration they either need or aspire to, but they get that employment and that level of placement.</P>
      <P>Quite frankly, our record in this area in comparison with other countries with a similar level of economic development is second to none.  It is no great personal credit to myself because I happen to have the honour of being in the position I hold at present, rather than being directly responsible for putting together a large infrastructural organisation such as CERT and AnCO etc.  It is recognised within the EC as being the best integrated industrial training organisation.  That has not come about by accident.  It has come about by the dedication of many people who make up their composition, not just in AnCO but in CERT and others.</P>
      <P>It is as a consequence of that kind of professionalism and activity we have managed to secure unprecedented high levels of ESF funding which, on balance, as we learn from the mistakes which have been made in the past and continually review the programmes, is put to very good use.  I thank the House for its support and I am sorry I have not covered all of the points which were raised.  I thank the House for its support for the Estimate and for giving me the responsibility of disbursing an enormous amount of taxpayers' money, over £171 million. I give the assurance that it will be done carefully and with concern for the priorities which were set out in my speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £24,005,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1986, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and of certain services administered by that Office, including certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>I propose that the Vote for Foreign Affairs and the Vote for International Co-operation be debated together, as is customary.</P>
      <P>The sum proposed for the Vote for Foreign Affairs is £24,005,000.  Most of this provision is required for the salaries of staff at headquarters and at our 40 missions and offices.  Provision is also included for travelling expenses and communications and Post Office services, for repatriation and maintenance of Irish citizens who get into difficulties abroad, for cultural and information services and for North-South and Anglo-Irish co-operation. In the course of my remarks I shall concentrate on five main areas of my Department's activities.  I want to begin, however, by saying something about the concept of interdependence in international relations.</P>
      <P>Interdependence, political and economic, is not just an academic theory, but an essential and unavoidable fact of life which has in many cases a direct and real impact on our lives.  Some examples will illustrate this point:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major outbreak of regional conflict in the Middle East could well have global repercussions of both a political and economic kind.  On the political level, it could draw great powers into a direct and dangerous confrontation.  In economic terms it could put at risk markets which are <Col N="776" /> important for many countries, including this country, in an area which is the major source of the world's oil supply;</P>
    <P>Every increase in East-West tensions tends to diminish the prospects for successful negotiations to control and reduce armaments.  The accumulation and perfecting of modern weaponry diverts attention and resources from desperately needed efforts in the field of development.  Essential development goals are neglected in favour of the acquisition of the latest and most sophisticated hardware.  As well as this, the piling up of armaments makes our globe more insecure;</P>
    <P>The failure of the South African authorities to tackle the evil of apartheid has repercussions which extend well beyond South Africa's frontiers &mdash; indeed, well beyond the African continent.</P>
    <P>Like other smaller countries, be they neutral or members of military alliances, our interests can be directly affected by events happening very far from our shores, just as by events nearer home. It is out of no mere academic interest, therefore, that we join with our partners in European political co-operation in contributing to the search for a durable peace in the Middle East.  Nor is there anything academic about our interest in seeing relations between the super powers conducted on a stable, predictable and co-operative basis, or about our interest in seeing the apartheid system dismantled in South Africa.  It is in our direct national interest to work together with our European partners for a more stable and more secure order of international relations, for a safer and a saner world.</P>
    <P>The second main area of my Department's work, which I shall be discussing in detail later, is our contribution to the work of the European Economic Community, itself the outstanding example of interdependence in play in international relations.  The Community brings together States with very different levels of economic development, some among <Col N="777" /> them net contributors to its budget, others, like Ireland, substantial net beneficiaries, but all of them benefit economically and politically from their participation in a common enterprise which is also a force for peace in the world.</P>
    <P>In the third and fourth areas which I propose to deal with in more detail later, those of our foreign earnings and of our development assistance programme, the interdependence factor is also in play. We all know that a threat to oil supplies or a big drop in oil prices can have significant repercussions throughout the international economy.  We know, too, that a secure and stable international environment is necessary if foreign trade is to flourish.  We realise, moreover, a direct relationship between the efforts of industrialised countries to assist developing countries in raising their levels of economic development, and the possibilities for industrialised countries, including our own, to find new and enlarged markets in the Third World.</P>
    <P>Earlier I made the point that our foreign policy is not developed in a vacuum unrelated to this country's political security. Neither is it pursued in a vacuum unrelated to the requirements of Irish industry and commerce.  Our efforts to contribute to bringing about a more secure world are conducted in a recognition of the open nature of our economy, of our heavy independence on exports, and of the fact that trade requires a stable and secure international environment, for the economic interests of this small country are now far-flung.  In 1970 over 60 per cent of our exports went to the United Kingdom.  We now send almost 70 per cent of our exports to destinations other than the UK.  In 1970 our exports to the Middle East were negligible.  In 1985 our exports to that region were almost £400 million.  In 1970 Ireland had no bilateral aid programme for developing countries.  This year we shall spend almost £44 million on official development assistance.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement, the fifth area I propose to deal with in greater detail later, is also about interdependent <Col N="778" /> relations, the relations between Britain and Ireland, the relations between the two parts of this island, and the relations between the two major Irish traditions. The agreement is designed to do more than facilitate the accommodation of the rights and identities of the two traditions in Northern Ireland.  It also addresses the interdependent relationship between political security and economic security. For in seeking to promote peace and stability in Northern Ireland, in establishing new bonds of friendship and co-operation between Britain and Ireland, and in seeking to defeat the common scourge of terrorism through political means, the agreement is aimed at creating a climate in which business, investment, and tourism can again thrive in both parts of this island.</P>
    <P>In the five areas I have mentioned, the real exercise of sovereignty and the real pursuit of our national interests require a realistic appreciation of the international environment in which we live.  They require an awareness of the interdependence factor, a realisation that it is where we are successfully operating in concert with others that our foreign policy will best succeed in protecting and promoting our interests.</P>
    <P>Having touched on the weight which we give to the factor of interdependence in our foreign policy, I now turn to details of five main areas of our foreign policy activity.  The first of these is our participation in the work of European political co-operation, including our contribution to the work of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The phenomenon of international terrorism has been particularly marked during the past year, with frequent outrages being perpertrated especially against civilian aircraft and at international airports. Together with our partners in the Twelve we have been examining the political and operational possibilities of combating the scourge of terrorism with particular emphasis on State-sponsored terrorism.  After an intensive round of meetings last month engendered by the crisis with Libya, the Twelve agreed on a range of political measures, including <Col N="779" /> restrictions on the numbers and movements of Libyan diplomats.  We also agreed to reinforce our security arrangments and initiate consultations with third countries so as to see how we can all co-operate in combating State-sponsored international terrorism in particular.  We are nonetheless conscious that political solutions are necessary for political problems, some of them long standing.  The Twelve are continuing their efforts to find possible avenues of progress towards a settlement in the Middle East, particularly as regards the Palestinian question.</P>
    <P>We and our European partners remain concerned that the tragic divisions and persistent instabilities of the Middle East, whose tensions have radiated far beyond the immediate region, may yet have the capacity to draw others into a direct and dangerous confrontation.</P>
    <P>Our concern and attention have also been focused sharply on the Middle East because of the disappearance and presumed kiddnapping in the Lebanon in April of an Irish citizen, Mr. Brendan Keenan. Following Mr. Keenan's failure to turn up for his work at the American University of Beirut on 11 April last, our Embassy began a long and detailed series of contacts with local representatives and others who might be able to help.  Despite all our endeavours and the active assistance and goodwill of a number of parties in the Lebanon we have not so far been successful in securing Mr. Keenan's safe return.  We continue to make every effort to do so.  The Minister for Defence has, of course, availed of his recent visit to the Lebanon to raise our concerns about this case and to stress the importance we attach to Mr. Keenan's early release.</P>
    <P>In the turmoil and the agony of the Lebanon, we see all too clearly and all too painfully the futility and folly and the desperate toll of violence and terrorism which have confounded the efforts of political leaders to rebuild their nation and to promote communal harmony.  Ireland and its partners in the Community have encouraged the search for unity and reconciliation in that divided nation.  We have supported calls for the restoration <Col N="780" /> in full of the territorial integrity of the Lebanon.  We have urged, and continue to urge, restraint on all concerned so that a peaceful solution and an end to the tragedy can be achieved.</P>
    <P>In recent months, we also followed with concern the worsening crisis in US-Libyan relations which culminated on 15 April in the attack on Libya by the armed forces of the United States. Throughout that crisis we urged the need for restraint and emphasised the importance we in Ireland attach to the role of the United Nations and in particular the peaceful resolution of crises of this kind. I have made it clear that I very much regret that this attack took place and that civilians were killed; I regret also the terrorism that made the US Government believe it was necessary to launch this attack.  For our part, we hold strongly to the view that terrorism, abroad or closer to home, can be defeated by political means.</P>
    <P>The impact of recent events notwithstanding, the central issue in the Middle East region remains the unresolved conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbours.  Underlying this central issue there exists a tragic conflict of rights; the right of Israel to live in peace within secure and recognised boundaries and the right of the Palestinian people to full self-determination. In accord with the Venice Declaration of 1980, we and our European Community partners have strongly supported a just, comprehensive and enduring settlement and have been active in encouraging this peaceful resolution. It is an undoubted disappointment that the hopes of progress towards a peaceful settlement which were raised by the Jordanian-Palestinian accord in February 1985 have not been fulfilled.  It remains important that all concerned maintain their efforts to build on the beginning that was made over the past year, and that they seek to overcome the difficulties that have arisen.</P>
    <P>In the case of the war between Iran and Iraq, now nearly six years old, the efforts of the UN to promote an agreed basis for a settlement, which have been supported by the Twelve, have so far <Col N="781" /> proved unavailing.  To restore peace and security in the region, it is important that both sides take advantage of the opportunities available to them to reach a settlement and that they co-operate with the efforts being made through the United Nations to achieve a just and honourable peace.</P>
    <P>I have in the past drawn attention to the inadequacies of the UN system faced with a world dominated by superpower rivalries.  This has had particular consequences for the ability of the Security Council, the body mandated by the Charter with primary responsibility for the preservation of international peace and security, to respond effectively to situations of crisis.  If, as I hope, the period ahead sees a continuation and perhaps even a deepening of the superpower dialogue, I would strongly urge that the participants give attention to the possibilities of co-operating together to improve the functioning of this vital institution.</P>
    <P>Our concern for the well-being of the UN system has been increased in recent months by the financial crisis which has engulfed the organisation.  The origins of this crisis are quite simply the refusal of member states to pay their assessed contributions.  In our view, the problems confronting the UN in the future cannot be adequately addressed until all those now withholding their contributions cease to do so.</P>
    <P>Over the past year we maintained our involvement with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation, the UN Inspection Teams in Iran and Iraq, the United Nations Force in Cyprus and, of course, we continued our sizeable commitment to UNIFIL.  In addition to expressing appreciation to the members of the Defence Forces for the discharge of their tasks in a manner which brought great credit to their country, I want to pay a particular tribute to Lieutenant-General Callaghan, who has recently relinquished his post as Force Commander of UNIFIL after a long and distinguished period of service in that taxing position.  We wish him well in his new <Col N="782" /> appointment as Chief of Staff of the Truce Supervision Organisation.</P>
    <P>The conditions in which our UNIFIL contingent in southern Lebanon operate continue to be far from ideal.  Unless there is a rapid improvement in the level of contributions to the UNIFIL fund the situation of troop contributors will become even more difficult than it is at present.  The Government are actively pursuing with those concerned a resolution to the financial difficulties facing the force.</P>
    <P>A necessary requirement for the success of a peace-keeping mission is the co-operation of the parties to the conflict. That co-operation continues to be withheld, particularly by those forces active in the area which depend on Israeli provisions and support.  We have registered through the appropriate channels our concern at incidents of harassment which occurred during the year.  The Government will continue to accord the highest priority to the safety of our personnel in this difficult and often dangerous situation.  We will maintain our efforts both through the Secretary-General and in bilateral contacts to secure the full implementation of UNIFIL's mandate.  We will also continue to highlight the need for the Security Council, as the authors of the mandate, actively to involve itself in this difficult issue.  In considering our position on continued participation in the force beyond the expiry of the present three-month mandate in July, the Government will be giving very careful thought to developments in these areas as well as to the views of other troop contributors and of the Secretary-General.</P>
    <P>An intense international spotlight has been directed to the many hundreds who have died in continuing civil unrest since the introduction of a new Constitution in South Africa in 1984.  The origins of the problem, however, go much further back.  They are rooted firmly in the odious system of apartheid under which the majority black community are systematically oppressed and denied any political outlet for their frustrations.  The Government in South Africa, though promising <Col N="783" /> reform have yet to demonstrate their will to make a fundamental alteration in the basic structure of the apartheid system. They still refuse to engage in any genuine political dialogue with the leaders of the black community.</P>
    <P>South Africa continues to defy the United Nations by maintaining its control of Namibia.  Elsewhere in the region, South Africa continues its policy of aggression and destabilisation of its neighbours.  Last week its forces attacked targets in Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe. It intervenes militarily in Angola and supports the UNITA movement which is in arms against the Government there.  In Mozambique the activities of anti-government forces continue with South African support to generate a serious situation despite the 1984 Nkomati accord under which South Africa undertook to curb its support for the rebel MNR movement.  Other countries of the region, including Lesotho, have been the object of threats and pressures from South Africa.  All of these events have led to a hardening of international opinion against South Africa and have prompted different countries and groups of countries including the Twelve to take stronger measures against South Africa. We welcome this.  We have long advocated a stronger international line against South Africa.</P>
    <P>The Government decided in March to impose restrictions on imports of South African fruit and vegetables.  The Government will continue to work at the United Nations for the adoption of further mandatory measures against South Africa to supplement that already in force on the export of arms.  Within the framework of European Political Co-operation, we shall continue to work for the adoption by the Twelve of a stronger policy towards South Africa.</P>
    <P>In view of their role and responsibilities in preserving international peace and stability, it is essential that the two superpowers maintain a dialogue at all times. The Summit meeting between President Reagan and Secretary General Gorbachev in November gave new hope for <Col N="784" /> an improvement in the conduct of East-West relations.  I hope that the optimistic climate which prevailed during 1985 will in 1986 permit definite progress on outstanding issues, both in bilateral relations between the major powers and in the broader areas of East-West relations and disarmament.  We take encouragement from the fact that the arms control talks on nuclear and space weapons between the United States and the Soviet Union are continuing at Geneva.  Although we obviously do not take a stand on the negotiating positions of either party, we hope that it will be possible to build on aspects of the proposals put forward there so that much-needed arms control measures in these important areas can be adopted at an early date.</P>
    <P>In those East-West negotiations in which Ireland is a participant, such as the CSCE, we continue to work with our partners in the Twelve for positive results which would help to foster understanding and co-operation with the countries of Eastern Europe and which would at the same time reflect the importance we attach to ensuring respect for all the principles of the Helsinki Final Act.  We continue to contribute to the work of the CDE Conference at Stockholm which is aiming at agreement by this autumn on a set of confidence and security building measures to reduce the risk of military confrontation in Europe.  At the third CSCE follow-up meeting which is due to open in Vienna this November, we look forward to a thorough review of progress in implementing the Helsinki Final Act provisions and we hope for agreement on a balanced set of new provisions concerning all aspects of the Final Act.</P>
    <P>As strong advocates of arms control and disarmament in the nuclear field we are happy that the Irish delegation was able to make a significant contribution to a final document which the Third Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference succeeded in adopting by consensus last September.</P>
    <P>There has been a general improvement in the political situation in Latin America in recent years.  In several Latin American countries civilian governments have <Col N="785" /> been restored.  The civilian Governments of Argentina, Peru, Brazil and Uruguay come to mind.  We express our support for them in their continuing efforts to improve the lot of their peoples.</P>
    <P>A notable exception to this trend is Chile, where a form of government continues to operate which systematically violates human rights and basic civil liberties. The Twelve have publicly welcomed the September 1985 &ldquo;National Accord for the Return to Democracy&rdquo; which was subscribed to by a broad spectrum of Chilean opposition political opinion.</P>
    <P>The situation in the Central American isthmus continues to be characterised by economic deprivation, human rights abuses, and armed conflict between Government forces and insurgents.  Our policy and that of our European partners is that a lasting solution to the conflict in Central America can only emerge from within the region itself.  Consequently, since its inception in 1983, the Twelve have fully supported the peace initiative of the Contadora Group of countries which comprises Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela, and with which a Support Group composed of Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay is now associated. Based on the principles of self-determination and the right of each country in the region to determine its own destiny free from outside interference, the Contadora process represents the best chance of a peaceful, global and verifiable solution.  This applies, of course, to the specific case of Nicaragua, with whose Foreign Minister I had discussions in Dublin on 29 April.</P>
    <P>I very much hope that the countries concerned can without undue delay reach agreement on the signing of a comprehensive peace agreement for the region.  The Twelve have declared their willingness, if required, to furnish the appropriate aid in support of the Contadora process.</P>
    <P>A heartening development in Asia in the last year has been the formation of a new Government in the Philippines by President Aquino.  We wish President Aquino well in her task of promoting national reconciliation.  Elsewhere in the <Col N="786" /> region we support the continuing efforts of the UN Secretary-General to bring about a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan; we also support the efforts of ASEAN to resolve the conflict in Kampuchea.</P>
    <P>There is an aspect of the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs which I deem it right to bring to the attention of Dáil Éireann on this the major annual occasion when I report on the activities of the Department.</P>
    <P>I have, since the Estimates for the Department were last debated in this House, become aware that there have been for a number of years, probably since 1952, a substantial number of high-level military overflights of our sovereign air space which, although they have complied with our air traffic control requirements, have not complied with the diplomatic clearance procedures laid down in the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952, which provides that no foreign military aircraft shall fly over or land in the State save on the express invitation or with the express permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The unauthorised high-level overflights involved military aircraft mainly from the US but also from Canada.  They were assumed by the relevant foreign authorities, and indeed by our own air traffic control authorities, not to require diplomatic clearance.  Lowlevel overflying of our airspace or landings at our airports by foreign military aircraft appear to have complied fully with both our air traffic control and diplomatic procedures. The precise number of unauthorised high level overflights over the past 34 years is not possible to determine with accuracy at this stage but in 1985 it is estimated that about 3,000 such overflights may have taken place.  I should emphasise that there was no attempt to conceal the flights from Irish air traffic controllers.</P>
    <P>I should also emphasise that in the case of most of our international partners the requirements of our legislators has been punctiliously observed.  The House will agree, however, that the neglect of compliance with these requirements by any <Col N="787" /> country for whatever reason is clearly a state of affairs which could not be allowed to continue and the House will, I hope, also agree that it is appropriate that I should bring the matter to its attention at this stage and in this way.  I have reminded all diplomatic missions in Dublin of the need to comply with the provisions of international and of domestic law regarding diplomatic clearance of military aircraft and I have now instituted new procedures to ensure in the case of those countries which overfly Ireland most frequently that they are fully alert to these requirements.  I am satisfied that the arrangements now in force are such as to ensure full compliance with our legislation.</P>
    <P>In investigating the authorised high-level overflights, informal consultations took place, <i>inter alia,</i> with the US authorities. In the course of these consultations it came to attention that among the recent unauthorised high-level overflights of Irish airspace were a small number involving US tanker aircraft in the days immediately preceding the recent US action against Libya.  These were at the time bound for destinations in Europe and were not scheduled for the operation against Libya.  I am satisfied that during this operation, there was no overflight of Ireland by aircraft involved in the US action.</P>
    <P>The second area I wish to discuss today is the European Community.  The past year has been an important one for the development of the European Community. Since the adoption of the Solemn Declaration on European Union at the Stuttgart Summit in June 1983, the member states had been committed to a relaunching of the Community.  The report of the Dooge Committee, which identified a number of priority objectives for the Community and the means to their achievement, constituted the principal basis of discussions at the European Council in Milan.  The European Parliament, inspired by the tireless work and imagination of the late Altiero Spinelli, adopted its own Draft Treaty on European Union and thereby clearly signalled <Col N="788" /> its strong support for advancing the integration process.  Furthermore, several budgetary and other problems which had for some time been preventing progress in the Community had in recent years been successfully confronted; and the enlargement negotiations with Spain and Portugal had been successfully completed. The European Council at Milan was therefore able, for the first time in many years, to devote its full attention to the functioning and future of the Community.</P>
    <P>The Milan European Council decision to convene the intergovernmental conference came against the background of the increasingly urgent and widely recognised need for the Community to ensure that its industry was placed on a footing to compete effectively internationally, notably in the development of advanced technology.  The clearly related need to improve the decision-making mechanisms of the Community in order to enable it to function effectively was also widely accepted.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that Ireland, alone among the more recent member states, joined the original six Community partners in calling for the intergovernmental conference to be convened.  Against the background which I have described, and especially in the light of the successful and unanimous outcome to the conference, I have no doubt that we were right to have supported the convening of the conference.</P>
    <P>As far as the conduct of the conference is concerned, Ireland played a very active and, I think it is fair to say, constructive role.  We broadly supported progress in all of the many areas under discussion. We sought, while ensuring that our own particular interests and concerns were met, to achieve substantial progress in the direction of European integration. We put forward specific proposals of our own, notably with a view to incorporating provisions on economic and social cohesion in the EC Treaty; and we supported as appropriate the proposals of others.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the conference can be regarded as broadly satisfactory from Ireland's point of view and signifies some <Col N="789" /> progress towards the goal of European Union.  The Single European Act, which resulted from the conference, brings together in one document amendments to the European Community Treaties and provisions on co-operation in the sphere of foreign policy.  The Act has been signed by all member states and is now subject to ratification by them in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.  The necessary legislation to permit ratification of the Act will be brought before the Oireachtas in the coming months.  This will provide the opportunity for a full debate on the Single European Act and its implications.  I would, however, like to avail myself of this opportunity to reiterate and expand on some points relating to the Act which the Taoiseach and myself have already made in this House.</P>
    <P>No one would claim that the Single European Act represents the major leap forward towards European intergration which the European Parliament, among others, had called for.  One the other hand, it represents a significant advance; it is a realistic blueprint for the next stage of the Community's development.  Essentially it amounts to a compromise which is both imaginative and realistic, given the different points of view of the individual member states.</P>
    <P>As far as the Treaties establishing the European Communities are concerned the Single European Act represents an advance on three fronts.  First, it offers scope for significantly improving the functioning of the Community's institutions. It does this by considerably enhancing the role of the European Parliament in the Community decision-making process, by strengthening the Commission's management and implementing powers, by providing for increased recourse to voting by qualified majority in the Council, and by making minor treaty amendments to improve the functioning of the Court of Justice.  These provisions, taken together, should contribute to a more efficient execution of Community business as well as to an important enhancement of the role and stature of the European Parliament.  At <Col N="790" /> the same time the existing inter-institutional balance is being broadly preserved.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Single European Act includes treaty provisions which will assist the achievement of two complementary goals which are fundamental to the nature of the Community and essential for its long term success.  These goals are the completion of the internal market by a target date of 31 December 1992, which will be facilitated by the new provisions for qualified majority voting in the Council; and the reduction of the economic disparities between the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions, which will be facilitated by the new treaty provisions on economic and social cohesion.  Ireland has a considerable economic interest, as an export-dependent country, in the early achievement of a single internal market throughout the Community.  The provisions on economic and social cohesion, representing as they do a greater Community commitment to reducing regional disparities, are obviously very much in Ireland's interests.</P>
    <P>Lest any misunderstanding may persist about the implications of the new provisions for qualified majority voting, I would like to assure the House there is no question of the operation of the so-called &ldquo;Luxembourg Compromise&rdquo;&mdash; that is the entitlement of a member state to invoke a vital national interest and to veto a proposal in the Council &mdash; being affected by the provisions of the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the Single European Act includes specific Treaty provisions in a number of new areas which had not formerly been explicitly provided for in the Community Treaties.  The monetary capacity of the Community is given Treaty status.  New Treaty provisions on research and technological development should provide a boost to much greater Community activity in this area, thereby helping the Community to become more competitive <i>vis-à-vis</i> the United States and Japan.  There should be corresponding opportunities here for small and medium sized Irish enterprises.  A Community policy on protection of the <Col N="791" /> environment is brought expressly within the Treaty, as is a provision for the adoption of minimum standards in respect of the working environment.</P>
    <P>Title III of the Single European Act deals with Co-operation in the Sphere of Foreign Policy.  The principal effect of these provisions will be to formalise existing practices and procedures in European Political Co-operation (EPC).  This is the process which has been evolving gradually in the past 16 years, by which member states, operating on the basis of consensus, agree to adopt as far as possible common policy stances on issues of foreign policy which are of general concern.</P>
    <P>Ill-founded claims have been made that the provisions on foreign policy somehow undermine our neutrality or compromise our sovereignty.  I have made it abundantly clear on a number of occasions in this House and elsewhere that this is simply not the case.  I would emphasise again that the foreign policy provisions of the Single European Act pose no threat to this country's sovereignty, to our neutrality or to our ability to take independent decisions on foreign policy matters.  Provision is made in Title III for closer co-ordination on the political and economic aspects of security.  This confirms the limits of what is appropriate to European Political Co-operation.  It applies equally to another provision in Title III which speaks of maintaining the technological and industrial conditions necessary for security.  These provisions do not involve us in questions of a military or defence nature.  In order to take account of the fact that Ireland is not a member of any military alliance, it is specifically provided that those member states who wish to go further in their security co-operation, into military and defence questions, may do so in NATO and the Western European Union, organisations to which Ireland does not, of course, belong.  Clearly, Ireland has no intention of participating in this further co-operation.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act provides the <Col N="792" /> Community, at least to an extent, with the institutional means with which to function effectively and to confront the challenges which face it.  The Community, equally, requires the necessary financial means.  There is as ever a need to provide the Community with adequate resources to function effectively and to develop its policies in future years.  The demands on the structural funds are increasing as a result of the admission of Spain and Portugal and of the increased emphasis on economic and social cohesion. Furthermore, the Single European Act provides for the development of new policies in areas such as research and technological development and the environment.  The budgetary problems facing the Community in the coming years are, moreover, exacerbated by the restrictive attitude of several of our partners towards Community expenditure. The Government are convinced that progress towards European union requires adequate financing.  We shall continue to press with determination for the provision of adequate financing to permit both the development of existing Community policies and the implementation of new policies provided for in the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>There are two major problems in relation to the Community budget which arise this year.  First, the fall in the value of the US dollar against the ECU and other currencies has, in effect, meant cheaper US agricultural exports on the world market.  This situation has resulted in increased demands on the Community budget to meet the cost of subsidies on exports of agricultural products to the world market.  Latest estimates indicate that extra funding of well over a billion ECU will be required to cope with the effects of the fall in the dollar.  Secondly, as regards the structural funds &mdash; that is the Regional and Social Funds and FEOGA Guidance &mdash; there is the problem of the so-called &ldquo;cost of the past&rdquo;.  Commitments entered into in previous years now have to be paid and the budget as it now stands is insufficient to meet these commitments.  To meet these problems the Commission has indicated <Col N="793" /> that a supplementary and amending budget of the order of 2,500 million ECU will be necessary.  In conjunction with other member states we shall press to ensure that these budgetary problems are firmly tackled now and are not simply postponed until next year or later years.</P>
    <P>The future development of the Common Agricultural Policy and the recently negotiated farm price package must also be seen against the background of the restrictive budgetary situation which I have described.  Given the budgetary, production and market problems which exist at present, and the restrictive attitude towards Community expenditure of several of our partners, the recently agreed farm price package was, without doubt, the best which we could have achieved.  The package has already been debated at some length by Dáil Éireann and I would not propose to enter on its details now.  I would however recall that an outstanding issue of considerable importance from Ireland's viewpoint is the future operation of the beef intervention system.  A decision on this matter is to be taken by 31 December 1986.  The agreement to postpone discussion of the operation of intervention will allow discussion to take place more fruitfully when detached from the other issues in this year's package.  Our immediate objective remains that the operation of the system should be guaranteed for the late summer-early autumn period when the bulk of Irish beef production comes on stream.</P>
    <P>As one of the less prosperous member states of the Community, Ireland benefits substantially from the three structural funds &mdash; the Regional Fund, the Social Fund and the FEOGA Guidance Section.  In 1985 we received some £273 million, as compared with £198 million in 1984.  However, there is no room for complacency in relation to future developments, especially given the increasing demands on the funds' resources since the accession of Spain and Portugal and the difficult budgetary situation which I have described.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the Regional Fund we have received an assurance from the Commission that the level of aid received by the less prosperous member states in 1986 will at least equal their guaranteed share for 1985. However, the position in regard to the Social Fund is that member states have no guaranteed shares of the fund.  We shall have to work very hard to maintain our excellent record of securing assistance from it.  Our share of the Social Fund has steadily increased from 6.6 per cent in 1974 to 12.5 per cent in 1985.  In money terms our receipts in 1985 were £141 million which was an increase of almost £57 million on the previous year.  Quite frankly, it will be difficult for us to sustain this level of receipts without substantial increases in the real level of the resources available to the funds.  Such increases will be necessary to allow the funds to become really effective instruments for the reduction of economic disparities within the Community, as they are intended to be. Only in this way can the less-developed countries of the Community be confident that their vital national programmes of regional development, dependent as they are on Community aid, can be maintained and indeed expanded.</P>
      <P>Present and anticipated future demands on the resources of the structural funds point up the need for an early increase in the own resources of the Community. This is the system by which the Community is financed through VAT receipts, customs duties and agricultural levies made over by the member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Council at Fontainebleau in June 1984 envisaged a further increase in the own resources ceiling from 1.4 per cent to 1.6 per cent from 1 January 1988.  We and others are pressing for the <Col N="795" /> necessary preparatory work to be put in hand now so that procedures can be completed in time to permit this increase in own resources to take effect from January 1988.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to say that this country has benefited enormously from its membership of the Community.  We benefit, for example, from access for our exports to a market of 320 million people, from the Common Agricultural Policy, from the structural funds and from the right to have our voice fully heard and our interests taken into account in the decisions which affect us.  It is clear that, in order to protect our interests, there is no alternative for us to active and positive membership of the Community.  The continued success of the Community itself is an important national interest for this country.  This said, the Government will continue to negotiate firmly to ensure that this country's interests are protected and promoted within the Community. But, in the undoubtedly changing situation in the Community, there is a need, for us to review our whole approach and strategy.  This is an exercise which the Government have undertaken.</P>
    <P>I turn now to my third topic, our national export performance.  Despite the constraints imposed by the difficult economic situation in 1985, our exports registered a 7 per cent increase in volume last year.  We achieved an overall trade surplus of £312 million, the first such surplus in 40 years.  My Department, in particular through their diplomatic and consular missions abroad, will continue their work of representing and promoting Ireland's economic interests abroad.  Missions will, in conjunction with CTT and the other agencies involved in export promotion, continue to assist the Irish exporter on the ground in every way possible. Officials of my Department are available at all times at home and abroad to help Irish business obtain the maximum advantage from the international economy.</P>
    <P>I would remind Deputies that Ireland has economic co-operation agreements with a number of Eastern European <Col N="796" /> countries and with certain oil-rich states in the Middle East.  These co-operation agreements, which are co-ordinated by my Department, are a virtual requirement if trade is to develop satisfactorily with the countries in question.  One of the most important features of the co-operation agreements is the provision for regular meetings of joint commissions, that is, officials from the two sides, with the aim of reviewing progress, solving trade problems and identifying new forms of economic co-operation.  Meetings of joint commissions are also used in a number of cases to facilitate the promotion by Irish businessmen of their goods and services in the context of trade missions organised by CTT.</P>
    <P>Ireland has concluded co-operation agreements with the USSR, Poland, Saudi Arabia and Iraq and has a joint commission with Libya.  Earlier this month, my colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce signed a co-operation agreement with the People's Republic of China.  Trade in goods and services between Ireland the China is expanding significantly and there is enormous potential for development.  Last April the first meeting of the Irish-Saudi Joint Commission was held in Riyadh. At this meeting the Irish side was able to highlight the wide range of goods and services which Ireland is already exporting to Saudi Arabia and to propose a number of projects in which Irish enterprises are actively interested.</P>
    <P>The task of maintaining our performance in exports, the main contributor to growth in the economy, is not an easy one.  The sharp drop in oil prices may help the economy in some respects but it could also have some adverse effects.  For example, the revenue of a number of oil-rich states will decline.  It is important to remember, too, that our competitors will also be benefitting from the drop in oil prices.  For these reasons it will be necessary to redouble our efforts to increase exports in the coming years and my Department will play their full part in this regard.</P>
    <P>The fourth area I wish to deal with is our programme of official development <Col N="797" /> assistance to developing countries.  The provision for official development assistance in 1986 reflects the Government's continuing commitment, as set out in <i>Building on Reality,</i> to expand Ireland's assistance to the developing countries of the Third World.  In accordance with <i>Building on Reality</i>, the allocation for Irish Official Development Assistance (ODA) is £43,961,000 in 1986 as compared with a provision of £38,357,000 in 1985.  There is therefore an increase in 1986 of 15 per cent over the 1985 figure. It is planned that expenditure will rise to approximately £50 million in 1987. Expressed as a percentage of GNP, our ODA is set to increase from 0.23 per cent in 1984, 0.245 per cent in 1985, 0.26 per cent in 1986, to 0.275 per cent in 1987. The rate of expansion of Ireland's ODA allows for its orderly and steady increase over a four year period.  The Government's awareness of the problems facing developing countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, have led them to make the commitment to the expansion of Ireland's ODA as outlined in <i>Building on Reality.</i> I am pleased to reaffirm that commitment today.</P>
    <P>In November 1985 Ireland joined the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).  DAC brings together 18 industrialised countries in Western Europe and North America and the Commission of the European Communities.  While we admittedly start from a low base, the rate of increase in Ireland's ODA in 1984 (the last year for which DAC figures are available) compares favourably with that of the other 17 DAC member countries. Eight DAC members have seen their ODA measured as a percentage of their GNP drop in 1984, eight have seen their ODA rise, and one country (the United States) has maintained its level of contributions. The Government accept that while we can be proud of the steady progress being made, particularly against the background of reduced public finances, there is a lot of ground to cover before Ireland can achieve the ultimate aim of <Col N="798" /> reaching the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GNP as ODA.</P>
    <P>It is opportune that the debate covering the Vote for International Co-operation takes place this week.  Last Sunday the eyes of the world were fixed on many runners taking part in Sport Aid.  Following the very successful Band Aid and Live Aid ventures, Sport Aid has again raised money for some of the poorest and least developed countries of the world.  It has also raised awareness of their plight.  One of the messages from Bob Geldof to the people of the world on Sunday last was &ldquo;You can affect the world you live in&rdquo;. Contained in Mr. Geldof's message is an awareness of the fact that we live in one world.  We in developed countries cannot ignore the plight of less developed countries. It is clear that the many units comprising our one world are interdependent.</P>
    <P>Continued deprivation, especially at low absolute poverty levels, ultimately causes people, countries and regions to reject the system which permits such a situation to continue.  Political instability in developing countries quickly involves developed countries.  It is in all out interests, therefore, to reduce the wealth gap by helping the poorer countries to develop.</P>
    <P>The global economy is characterised by a web of trading agreements highlighting the interdependence between developed and developing countries.  We depend on developing countries for many of our stable raw materials.  Any disruption of important raw materials supplies can cause severe dislocation in developed economies.  Furthermore, if we want to develop export markets in these poorer countries we must open up our own markets to them.  Only by earning foreign exchange can they afford to purchase our goods.  Therefore, we must help them to develop and also liberalise trade as far as possible.</P>
    <P>While the Government are well aware that it is in the interests of the developed countries to help the less developed, there is a more fundamental reason which underlies our development co-operation policy.  We recognise a moral and <Col N="799" /> humanitarian duty to help others less fortunate than ourselves, whenever we can.</P>
    <P>What can a relatively small country like Ireland contribute to the development process?  As a member of the European Community we strongly support the Community's development policy.  To this end Ireland welcomes the Lomé Agreements as a realistic step forward. Furthermore, Ireland is supportive of the various Community development aid operations.  We are proud that the so called &ldquo;Dublin Plan&rdquo; to send additional emergency food aid to Africa was adopted while we held the Presidency of the Council.</P>
    <P>In the area of development aid, this country has a balanced approach.  We will contribute over £24.5 million this year to various multilateral agencies who perform valuable development work.  These agencies have expertise and experience gained over a long period.  Multilateral aid allows us to be involved in certain large scale development activities which we could not undertake on our own.</P>
    <P>The allocation for bilateral assistance this year is £18.8 million.  Though small in money terms relative to other larger countries, Ireland can be proud of the quality of its aid.  Our own recent development experience and our high educational standards give Ireland a pool of quality technical expertise which can be readily used by developing countries. Ireland's areas of particular expertise are reflected in the sectoral breakdown of the aid to priority countries last year &mdash; rural development, 32 per cent of expenditure; agriculture, 22 per cent, education and training, 22 per cent; industry, 9 per cent; infrastructure, 8 per cent; and health 6 per cent.  There were 66 Irish experts employed at the end of last year on bilateral aid programme projects in Lesotho, Tanzania, Zambia and Sudan, which are the priority countries of our aid programme.  In addition, many Irish public and private sector organisations act as technical consultants for bilateral aid programme projects.  There is great variety among the projects run in the <Col N="800" /> priority countries, from the handknitting project in Lesotho to the Kilosa district rural development programme in Tanzania, from the aid to the school of veterinary medicine at the University of Zambia to the Gezira dairy co-operative project in Sudan.</P>
    <P>Behind the facts and figures lie a number of clear guidelines which mark our approach.  Underlying our aid is a moral and humanitarian concern which targets our aid to the poorest sections of developing countries.  Self-reliance is encouraged as projects are supported which address the needs of a target population which in turn should be able to respond positively.  Irish involvement is seen as being only temporary, with indigeneous workers taking over the projects as soon as possible.  Co-operation is an important principle for the bilateral aid programme.  Projects are planned, implemented and sometimes co-financed in conjunction with the relevant authorities of the recipient countries.  Our main concern is for the welfare of the people of developing countries.  Our aid, therefore, is untied; it is free and not dependent on any favours to Ireland, economic or political.  These principles are clearly evident in the various ways in which Irish development assistance is donated.</P>
    <P>I shall turn now to my fifth, and final, topic &mdash; developments under the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Three-and-a-half years ago, when our Government took up office, we were faced with a critical situation in Northern Ireland.  Nationalist alienation had become entrenched, successive British initiatives in the North had failed and constitutional nationalism itself was threatened.  We had to act: we did so quickly.  In 1983, for the first time in the history of the State, the representatives of constitutional nationalism &mdash; North and South &mdash; came together in the New Ireland Forum.  The report of the New Ireland Forum, unanimously endorsed in May 1984, was the first result of our efforts.</P>
    <P>The report of the New Ireland Forum is a far-reaching reassessment of Irish nationalism at present.  Its analysis and conclusions provide a charter which will <Col N="801" /> inspire nationalist action in this island well into the next century.  In the short term the New Ireland Forum laid the basis for the Anglo-Irish negotiations; those in turn culminated last November in the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement at Hillsborough.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement is the second result of our effort.  The agreement was the result of long and often difficult negotiation and required great effort.  But the negotiation succeeded because it was in the joint interest of both Governments that the negotiation should succeed.</P>
    <P>In the last six months, we have begun another major task &mdash; seeing that the agreement is implemented as planned. Both Governments stand by the agreement. It is in our joint interest to ensure progress over the whole range of the agenda in the agreement, progressively and in time, and that the promise of the agreement becomes reality.  I use the words &ldquo;progressively and in time&rdquo; deliberately. The agreement has not set out to provide instant solutions to problems that go back to the Partition settlement of 65 years ago, but it provides the correct framework for solutions, progressively and in time.</P>
    <P>The agreement provides also the machinery for implementation &mdash; the Intergovernmental Conference and the Joint Secretariat which services the conference on a continuing basis at Belfast. The two Governments have committed themselves to work together within the conference for the accommodation of the rights and identities of the two traditions in Northern Ireland; and peace, stability and prosperity throughout this island.</P>
    <P>At the five ministerial meetings of the conference held so far we have begun the work of giving effect to this commitment. For an Irish Government, the accommodation of the rights and identities of Nationalists is a major concern.  In the conference we have put forward views and proposals on such issues as a Bill of Rights, the use of flags and emblems, Irish language and culture, electoral arrangements, the role and composition of public bodies in Northern Ireland and <Col N="802" /> discrimination in the economic and social areas.  Details have been published in the joint statements issued after each of the meetings of the conference.  We are in the process of a continuing negotiation through the conference and its secretariat at Belfast on all these matters.  I might say that while we have put forward views and proposals with the principal aim of accommodating of Nationalist identities and rights, we have sought to recognise and respect both communities' identities and rights and we are very much aware that a number of changes we have proposed have cross-community support.</P>
    <P>Our second commitment &mdash; peace, stability and prosperity throughout the island of Ireland &mdash; is in the interest of all the people of Ireland, Nationalists and Unionists alike.  The agreement provides the political context in which peace and stability can be constructed.  The conference deals with security policy, relations between the security forces and the community, the legal system and the administration of justice and with cross-Border security co-operation.  Work has begun in all these areas.  The conference also deals with cross-Border co-operation in economic, social and cultural matters: here also work has begun.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement aims at bringing about the conditions in which Nationalists can see the system of law and order in Northern Ireland as their system and also give it support.  We are working in the conference for a programme of special measures to make the security forces more acceptable to Nationalists and for reform in the administration of justice.  Both communities in the North stand to gain from a situation where they share confidence in the system and instruments of the law. That is the situation we want to work towards.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined to do their utmost to combat violence and terror in this island.  This is a shared duty of all of us, Northerners and Southerners. For our part we have taken action in the area of cross-Border security co-operation and extradition.  Evil men from both Irish traditions are intent on bringing <Col N="803" /> down the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Peace and reconciliation are not in their interests. They want to destroy rather than build.  Since the agreement was signed, there has been the cold-blooded killing of members of the security forces in the North by the Provisional IRA, the attacks and intimidation by Loyalist mobs and paramilitaries against the RUC and the disturbing renewal of sectarian violence in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>The latest outrages of the IRA show once again how the Provisional IRA have sought to impose tyranny through terror and intimidation with total disregard for democratic values and the values of civilised society.  The &ldquo;protection&rdquo; which they pretend to offer Nationalists in the North is a cruel and cynical facade.  Instead of protection they offer only fear.  I repeat my condemnation of all that they stand for.  The Government intend to fight violence and terror with all the means at our disposal with strength and determination. I also repeat my call to Unionist politicians, and especially to the leaders of the OUP and DUP, to cast the evil-doers in their own community from their midst. Our first duty as constitutional politicians is to pursue our aims by peaceful means and to ensure that those who would impose their will by violence do not succeed on either side.  There can be no ambiguity in this.</P>
    <P>I believe that Unionists will come to see the agreement as posing no threat to their rights and identity, but rather as providing a peaceful, stable and hopefully more prosperous society which they and their Nationalist neighbours can enjoy together.</P>
    <P>Devolved government is strongly desired by the majority among both Nationalists and Unionists in Northern Ireland. We will continue to encourage the achievement of devolution on a basis of widespread acceptance as provided in the agreement.  If the representatives of the constitutional parties from both traditions sit down without preconditions and come to an agreement on an acceptable form of devolution, then we will welcome <Col N="804" /> such agreement.  If devolution is achieved, the conference will continue its work in dealing with those matters not devolved as provided under the agreement.  If devolved government is not sustained &mdash; and of course we and the British Government will be determined in our efforts to prevent such a failure &mdash; the matters devolved will again be dealt with by the conference in accordance with the agreement.</P>
    <P>In the period ahead we will do our utmost to promote the aims of the agreement through the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister well, knowing as I do the tremendous responsibility resting on him and the many demands on his time.  I avail of this opportunity to wish Deputy O'Keeffe every success in this new Department.  His successor, Deputy Birmingham, will have my full help and support wherever possible, as had Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the three and a half years of this administration little of any note has been achieved for which the Minister's period in office will be remembered.  Our whole position in the European Community has been eroded.  On the international scene we have followed the policy of the low profile, keeping our heads down lest anyone might be offended.  The Minister's public statements have very largely concentrated on Anglo-Irish relations <Col N="805" /> and latterly the agreement.  I propose first of all to consider that.</P>
    <P>All of us in this House were prepared to await developments under the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  There were constitutional aspects which we could not accept and to which we were opposed but on the basis that the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference would tackle the alienation of the Nationalist community we were not prepared to undermine its efforts in any way.  Originally we had been led to expect that the Hillsborough Agreement would contain significant reforms.  That hope was disappointed.</P>
    <P>In the early heady days following Hillsborough people believed or were led to believe by the media that early progress would be made on a number of issues that have long been of deep concern in relation to the administration of justice and the operation of the security forces.  That seemed to be the implication behind the items listed for discussion in the agreement.  That hope has also so far been disappointed.  The Minister has stated by way of excuse that problems that have been there for 60 years cannot be resolved overnight.  But, with respect, many of the reforms sought concern issues that have arisen only in the last 15 years.  Supergrass trials, plastic bullets and the Ulster Defence Regiment, for example, did not exist in 1930 or even in 1960.</P>
    <P>The Minister admits to a lack of progress. In a speech to a Fine Gael meeting in Cavan-Monaghan on 15 May he said &mdash; and I quote&mdash;:</P>
    <P>We are making progress in implementing the provisions in the agreement on security co-operation and on extradition policy; progress is needed also in the administration of justice and in the improvement of relations between the security forces and the Nationalist community.</P>
    <P>The Minister is there admitting that progress has been one-sided, entirely related to British concerns, while Irish concerns have not been attended to.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was very weak when <Col N="806" /> asked in an RTE interview on 18 May: &ldquo;What would you point to at this stage and say that has been achieved by the Anglo-Irish Agreement?&rdquo; He mentioned two points.  He alleged that: &ldquo;there has been a significant change in terms of UDR patrols accompanied by the RUC ... although it still has a long way to go&rdquo; and he also claimed to be hopeful that a statement by the British Attorney General on the subject of supergrasses might mean that &ldquo;this particular problem will cease to be the kind of problem it has been&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach was visibly clutching at straws.</P>
    <P>Any impartial examination of the British Attorney General's statement in the House of Commons on 19 March would indicate that as far as he is concerned the supergrass system can continue as before. If there be any doubt about the matter, I have here a letter from the Northern Ireland Office dated 21 April 1986 and signed Valerie Scott which states:</P>
    <P>The Government cannot agree with some of your other recommendations, however.  The use of evidence from accomplices in criminal trials is well established ... The evidence of an accomplice is admissible against an accused person and may be accepted as sufficient for a conviction.  But the courts in Northern Ireland are required to consider very carefully how far it is safe to rely upon such evidence in each particular case and to have regard to the danger of relying on such evidence unless it is corroborated.  If this rule is followed, it is open to the court to decide, that, even in the absence of corroboration, it is satisfied that the evidence of the accomplice is true and sufficient.</P>
    <P>Is it not obvious that the British Government intend supergrass trials to continue? Indeed, since the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed, 27 men have been convicted on the evidence of a supergrass and two men have been shot by an unaccompanied UDR patrol, not to mention a young man who has been killed by a plastic bullet.  No doubt the Minister will have seen the report of the Northern <Col N="807" /> Ireland Justice and Peace Commission on the Loyalist Day of Protest in early March which states that in Armagh, Down and Fermanagh for example the UDR misbehaved and erected and manned barricades throughout the day.</P>
    <P>What is the position about the international financial aid for the Anglo-Irish Agreement about which we heard so much?  Will it ever materialise?  Six months have passed, and there is still no sign of it.  Despite Government denials to the contrary, it seems to have become tied to the Extradition Treaty in Congress. It would appear that the British Government have turned down EC aid. The Canadians and the Australians are not interested.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.</P>
    <P>The agreement unfortunately has not so far made any contribution to peace, reconciliation and stability.  Indeed, the North is more tense than it has been for some time.  There is much talk of handling the agreement sensitively.  It is hard to know what this sensitivity could consist of, given that the conference has refrained from producing any visible results whatever.  The Unionists call for suspension of the agreement.  But it is in fact already in suspension as far as doing anything positive is concerned.  Is it not the case that the Government are caught in a trap of their own making?  Having totally oversold the agreement, having presented it as something just short of joint authority, the Government can hardly turn round and tell the public the honest truth that they have exercised no authority, and little influence over the last six months, and that the British Government are carrying on exactly as before, the only difference being that they can now claim the full support of the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the subject of Northern Ireland, I would have to say that I regard Mr. Tom King's remarks about Ireland becoming a European Cuba as patronising and insulting.  In particular I object to the following sentence: &ldquo;Behind the green Nationalism and the romance of a united Ireland is a Marxist revolutionary caucus determined to subvert these two <Col N="808" /> countries to establish an offshore Cuba for Europe&rdquo;.  This language makes no distinction between the commitment to a united Ireland of democratic nationalist parties and the IRA.  Let me tell Mr. King that Irish democracy is strong and firmly established and will be subverted by no one.  If one wanted to go looking for symptoms of revolution, Mr. King should look to his own island and ask what the Home Secretary is expecting that he has found it necessary to equip all police forces there recently with water cannon and plastic bullets.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to the international scene.  The weak and ineffectual response of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the aid raid on Tripoli, which killed innocent civilians was widely seen throughout the country as shameful and out of keeping with our foreign policy traditions.  The Minister, in attempting to justify that act was certainly not speaking for the people of this country.  The raid on Tripoli, which the Minister believed could be justified in international law has encouraged other states to take the law into their own hands.  Prime Minister Botha justified his recent cross-border raids by reference to the raid on Tripoli.  He said &ldquo;We will fight international terrorism in precisely the same way as other Western countries&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Apropos of the Tripoli air raids, I am very concerned about what the Minister had to say about unauthorised military overflights.  It is a clear implication of his remarks that while aircraft involved in the Tripoli bombing mission did not, as it happened, use Irish airspace, they could well have done so without permission having been sought.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister in his reply to state in more detail what exactly the current position is.  Do I understand that permission is generally given for military overflights, if sought?  Is this permission given to some countries; or to all countries without discrimination?  Is information sought regarding the particular mission the aircraft might be on?  Is information sought as to whether the aircraft in question is carrying bombs; and especially nuclear bombs?  I think it is the Minister's duty on this matter to give as much <Col N="809" /> information to the public as possible, either now or in the future, so that we can decide whether current practice, which has clearly become lax, is compatible with our policy of military neutrality.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear in more detail what the European Community's response is to the growing conflict in southern Africa.  The clear impression is that despite the appalling killings, which have become an everyday occurrence, despite the clear cut case against apartheid, some EC Governments are dragging their heels over sanctions.  Do the Twelve have a vision of the long-term future in South Africa?  I must draw the Minister's attention to a leading article in <i>The Economist</i> magazine of 10 May, which is opposed to breaking up South Africa into constituent tribal or geographical entities.  It states: &ldquo;the concept of one man, one vote in a unitary State is the only proper interpretation of democratic nationalism and is one to which black South Africans naturally aspire&rdquo;.  What a pity <i>The Economist</i> does not adopt the same approach to Ireland?  But I hope the Minister will note their opinion that a unitary state is the only proper interpretation of democratic nationalism, because that is our view as well.</P>
    <P>The highly successful Band-Aid and Sport-Aid events have highlighted the problem of famine in Africa, and have shown that there is a depth of public goodwill ready to support action to relieve starvation.  The organisers and participants are to be congratulated.  We must be proud that the organiser of these events internationally is one of our own, Bob Geldof.  One of the purposes was to put pressure on Governments.  I would like to know how our Government now proposes to respond to the enthusiasm and idealism of the Irish people and what changes in policy and increases in funding they now propose to make.  Will the Government persist with the development aid cutbacks set out in <i>Building on Reality?</i> From the Minister's statement it is clear that the Government do not intend to do anything more than they are doing already.  There will be a lot of disappointment at that attitude.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="810" /> Fianna Fáil are totally dissatisfied with the Government's response to the nuclear menace, whether at Sellafield or Chernobyl.  Over the last few years our feeble and timorous Government have been parroting the reassurances pumped out by the nuclear industry, and more recently wringing their hands, saying how little they can do.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have repeatedly called for the closure of Sellafield.  The Taoiseach on RTE last Sunday week attacked this call and said: &ldquo;That's politics, not diplomacy and no responsible Government goes around behaving like that and responsible oppositions don't suggest it&rdquo;. Is the Taoiseach calling the Austrian Government irresponsible, because they have called on the German Government not to proceed with a nuclear reprocessing plant at Wackersdorf in Bavaria?  Is the Taoiseach calling the German Government irresponsible because it asked the Soviet Union to close down the twenty nuclear reactors of a type similar to Chernobyl and demanded compensation for damage incurred by German farmers? Is the Danish Parliament, both Government and Opposition, irresponsible in calling for the Swedish nuclear power station at Barseback across the Baltic Straits to be closed down?</P>
    <P>Many countries on their own initiative are seriously considering closing down, phasing out or deferring nuclear plants in the light of recent events.  Britain is one of the few countries left in the world still determined to plough ahead with its expansion plans.  The Government here are not even seeking to influence the British decisions that would affect us.  In my book the Irish Government are irresponsible, in neglecting their duty, in failing even to attempt to protect and defend the Irish people from the threat of wholesale contamination, and long term damage to life, health and the environment from dangerous nuclear plants sited close to our shores.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Government and the public are aware of the fact that the majority of British nuclear power stations, 26 of them, are sited on the west coast facing across to Ireland?  This is not <Col N="811" /> just a British phenomenon.  There is a tendency across Europe to site nuclear power stations as close as possible to the borders of other countries.  If nuclear energy were as safe as it is claimed to be, why are they not sited on the outskirts of large cities or in heavily populated areas, as other power stations are?  The official statement after the 1957 accident at Windscale said euphemistically: &ldquo;It is untrue that a large amount of radioactivity was released; the amount released was not hazardous to the public and what there was, was carried out to sea&rdquo;.  We know from studies into Down's Syndrome babies in Dundalk and County Down what the consequences of that were.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, have repeatedly rejected the call for the closure of Sellafield.  Indeed, the Tánaiste here on 11 March listed a whole lot of investment measures which are part of the Sellafield expansion plans.  The Minister of State on 11 March 1986, claimed: `The second main thrust of the Irish Government's policy is that this is a matter of international concern and the most effective way it can be dealt with is through a European inspection force under the aegis of the Euratom Treaty&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 7 May he went even further and stated: &ldquo;We feel and the Government have been so advised by the Attorney General that the Commission under the Euratom Treaty have powers to inspect the safety of nuclear installations.  As I have said, we have formally asked the Commission to exercise these powers&rdquo;. The Minister for Energy on 8 May said: &ldquo;In various discussions we have had with the Commissioner it was stated that we were satisfied that the Commission has a central and vital role to play in the implementation of the Community's basic radiation supply standards under the Euratom Treaty....  The Commissioner has confirmed that the question of a Community inspection force is one <Col N="812" /> which is being examined under the terms of the Euratom Treaty&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Haughey, the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, visited Brussels a couple of weeks ago and had discussions with the Commission, he found what we had already suspected was confirmed. The Minister of Energy and his Minister of State have been misleading the House and the public in suggesting that there are any provisions for a safety inspectorate under the Euratom Treaty.  There is no such inspectorate, nor do the powers exist under the Treaty, to set up such an inspectorate.  On the contrary, the responsibility lies with the member states.</P>
    <P>Article 33, in the chapter on Health and Safety of the Treaty states: &ldquo;Each member state shall lay down the appropriate provisions, whether by legislation, regulation or administrative order, to ensure compliance with the basic standards which have been established&rdquo;. Article 34 states: &ldquo;Any member state in whose territories particularly dangerous experiments are to take place shall take additional health and safety measures on which it shall first obtain the opinion of the Commission&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is no article anywhere in the Treaty which suggests or allows inspections of nuclear power stations from the point of view of human health and safety. The only inspections allowed are safeguard inspections for the purposes of nuclear materials accountancy, to ensure that in non-nuclear weapon States, such as Germany, nuclear materials are not diverted into bomb making.  It has nothing to do with what we are concerned with here.  In all probability amendment of the Treaty would be required to allow a European safety inspectorate to operate. The EC Commission clearly do not accept the legal basis of this Government's case.  The fact that they are sending experts to have discussions with the Attorney General's office, as stated by the Minister here yesterday, surely makes that clear to every Member of this House.</P>
    <P>By a happy coincidence, the Dáil will shortly be discussing the draft European <Col N="813" /> Act.  The Euratom Treaty is largely ignored in this Act.  We would certainly support the Government if, prior to ratification, they were to seek additional Treaty provisions that would allow the setting up of a European safety inspectorate for nuclear power stations.  However desirable such inspections, inspection by itself will not make nuclear power stations more safe.  Since Chernobyl, a whole string of incidents have been reported from nuclear power stations in Britain and France.  Some of the stations have been proved by their record to be extremely unsafe.</P>
    <P>Our monitoring facilities, our Civil Defence preparations were barely adequate to cope with the effects of a major nuclear accident 1,500 miles away. It is acknowledged even by the Government that they would be totally incapable of dealing with a similar emergency on the other side of the water.  Chernobyl, happening only a few years after Three Mile Island, has shown beyond a shadow of doubt that major nuclear accidents can and will happen, not once in every 10,000 years as the nuclear experts assured us, but on average at least once every ten years.  Since the inception of nuclear power in the fifties there have been four major accidents, two in the Soviet Union, one in the United States and one in Britain.</P>
    <P>On that basis, it is unfortunately more than likely that a serious accident will occur before the end of the century somewhere in Western Europe, and perhaps in Britain.  An official of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission has already said that such an accident is inevitable in the United States.  If in Britain, let us remember that most nuclear power stations are located on the west coast facing across the Irish Sea.  We must do everything in our power to try to lessen this risk.  The first thing is to induce in people and in Governments a realisation that nuclear power stations are literally time bombs in our midst and to get them to act accordingly.  Our Civil Defence should be trained to deal with such an emergency.</P>
    <P>I would also like to raise briefly the question of nuclear submarine traffic in <Col N="814" /> the Irish Sea.  Quite apart from the danger to fishing vessels and their crews, there is also the danger of an accident to the nuclear reactor on a submarine which could have serious consequences.  While most of the Irish Sea is in international waters, the Government would nevertheless be justified in making representations to the countries involved that nuclear submarines should, for exercise purposes, stay away as far as possible from coastal seas, especially when conventionally powered submarines can presumably patrol just as effectively in these types of waters.</P>
    <P>I will deal first with the statement by the Minister, which I welcome as far as it goes, that the Government have decided to carry out a review of our whole approach and strategy in the Community. I certainly welcome it, but I am afraid it does not go far enough.</P>
    <P>My party have for a considerable time now been asking that such a survey &mdash; and it would need to be a detailed and precise study &mdash; be carried out and the balance sheet of what the Irish economy has gained and what it has lost through membership of the European Communities be drawn up.</P>
    <P>When Ireland voted overwhelmingly as it did in 1972 in favour of membership of the EC it was in the high belief that membership would be of great advantage to us, of advantage, not just in an economic way alone.  There is far more to the European Communities than that. But I will deal here with economic issues at the present stage.  We saw great advantages in the Common Agricultural Policy. We equally saw that there would be losses in other areas, but we believed that the advantages would more than outweigh the losses.</P>
    <P>Agriculture certainly gained, especially in our early years of membership, but the agricultural sector, as is well known, is now labouring under severe adjustments to Community policy.  We did not expect in 1972 that there would be a quarter of a million unemployed in the following decade.  How much of the present serious economic difficulties <Col N="815" /> which we now suffer are due to our European Community membership?  How much has there been a shortfall in the aid we rightly expected from the Communities for the development of the Irish economy? Of course, we could not have hoped to escape unscathed the world economic recession following on the oil crisis of 1973.  But there are questions to be answered about the extent to which the adjustments to European Community industrial conditions imposed on us an unfair burden, with the effects on our economy which we see.</P>
    <P>I want to make it very clear that I wish the balance sheet to be drawn up in a neutral manner.  Drawing it up in no way implies any change in this country's attitude as regards membership of the European Communities.  Were there to be a vote on that issue again tomorrow, I have no doubt, indeed I am certain, that there would continue to be a strong vote for continuation of membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>I would see the balance sheet as a first means to judge our economic situation. With that judgment and with our own ideas clear as to what actions are needed to put our economy on a sure road to recovery, we could go to our European partners and present our case to them. Our case would essentially be that a small and still under-developed economy on the extremity of Europe needs far more aid, especially in the way of regional and social aids, than is now being given to us. We will have to remind our partners in Europe very firmly that the aims and purposes of the Rome Treaty should not be forgotten and that Ireland presents a very good case for remembering these aims and purposes.</P>
    <P>In the negotiations over the draft European Act the Government missed a golden opportunity to renegotiate our terms of membership of the EC.  Instead, they have accepted the deterioration of our position as a <i>fait accompli</i> about which nothing can be done.  When we return to Government, we shall not be adopting such a fatalistic approach.</P>
    <P>Through the formation of a common <Col N="816" /> market and the progressive approximation of the economic policies of the member states, the EC aim has been to promote throughout the Community the harmonious development of economic activities, a continuous and balanced expansion and increased stability.  It has also set as one of its aims an accelerated raising of the standards of living and closer relations between member states.</P>
    <P>The Treaty also provided for the establishment of a social fund to improve employment prospects for workers and to contribute to the raising of their standard of living.  Despite the fact that total commitments from the European Social Fund during the period 1973 to 1985 amounted to £830.3 million, the unemployment rate in Ireland has persistently remained well above the EC average of 11.5 per cent.  This figure relates to the EEC of the Nine, as figures for Greece, Spain and Portugal are not comparable.</P>
    <P>The record of the Coalition Government in the creation of jobs for young people when compared with our EC partners is appalling.  Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany and the Netherlands have all recorded a fall in the annual average of young people under 25 registered as unemployed in the period 1984-85. In 1984, youth unemployment among men in Ireland stood at over 42,000.  By 1985 it has risen to 45,000. Unemployment among women under the age of 25 rose from 24,500 to 26,600 during the same period.</P>
    <P>The European Social Fund is chiefly concerned with promoting youth employment. It has to be pointed out also that 75 per cent of the fund's total financial resources have been earmarked for that purpose.  Despite the fact that Ireland's share of the European Social Fund in 1985 reached a record 12.5 per cent of the fund, compared with 11.4 per cent and 9.7 per cent in the previous two years, youth unemployment remains alarmingly high in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government have shown a singular lack of ability to deal with the rampant unemployment crisis stalking our country.  Their failure is taking its toll.  Regrettably, many of our <Col N="817" /> young people are now emigrating.  I am convinced, however, that were it not for the existence of the European Social Fund, the situation of our young people would be even worse.  We cannot ignore the failure of the present Government to act on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of unemployed people in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have entered a critical period in the affairs of the EC.  Budgetary difficulties loom large.  The cost of enlargement is substantial.  Following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the EC, and following the failure of the European Community to provide adequate resources to take into account enlargement, Ireland's share of EC resources is threatened.  Our share of the social fund will fall in 1986.  The Government have had adequate warning about the precarious budgetary situation. EC Commissioner Sutherland is among those who have sounded the alarm bells.</P>
    <P>On 10 April last Commissioner Sutherland stated that unless strong opposition to supplementary financing for the European Community could be overcome, grants from the social, regional and agricultural development funds could not be paid from September next.  Will the Minister say what action the Government are taking in response to the warnings to avert this situation as outlined by Commissioner Sutherland?</P>
    <P>More than half the cost of AnCO activities are met by the resources of the European Social Fund.  If AnCO's major role in contributing to training in Ireland is not to be undermined, the Government must show that they are prepared to take all the necessary action to avert a major budgetary crisis.  They must ensure that our partners in the European Community are made aware that any reduction in Ireland's share of EC funds will have serious consequences for our entire economy. Cutbacks are already taking place. The Minister should state frankly what the position is and what the Government are doing about this.</P>
    <P>The same concerns apply to the European Regional Fund.  Ireland has always been classified as a priority region.  Spain and Portugal also have priority status. The Regional Fund has a major role to <Col N="818" /> play in correcting regional imbalances in the Community and because of the inadequacy of the existing resources of the Regional Fund, and the Government's failure to fight for the necessary additional resources, the disparities already existing between the less-favoured and the most-favoured regions have not diminished.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that Ireland has received commitments in regional fund aid worth £604 million between 1975 and 1985, it must be recognised that major infrastructural problems remain.  During the period 1975 to 1984 Ireland's share of the Regional Fund amounted to 6.2 per cent.  When the ERDF regulation was amended in 1984 Ireland's share was to range from 5.64 per cent to 6.83 per cent. Following the entry of Span and Portugal into the Community our share now ranges from only 3.82 per cent to 4.61 per cent.  If our share of the Regional Fund is to be restored the Government must call for a substantial increase in the EC's resources.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the Minister's statement about the farm price package as, &ldquo;the best which we could have achieved&rdquo;. Our agricultural situation at present is fairly disastrous, and, regrettably, occupies a very low priority round the Cabinet table.  I notice the Minister made no reference to the decision taken about milk. Here Ireland accepted and even voted for a 3 per cent cut in our milk quota and this despite the very clear understanding at the time when the super levy was agreed in 1984 that Ireland would now have its milk quota further reduced.  The Government then rightly took a stand on milk production being for Ireland a vital national interest.</P>
    <P>As the Minister says, this prices agreement was debated at some length in this House a few weeks ago, and I do not intend to go into detail here, but I must note the careful way in which ministerial statements have avoided meeting headon the very valid criticism of the Government's agreeing in 1986 to something which was of vital national interest in 1984.</P>
    <P>It would be as well also at this point to <Col N="819" /> say that while we would hope that a fair representation of our case to our partners in the Community would not fail to have special help given to us, we must, at the same time, look facts in the face and realise that the Community has allowed itself to become virtually bankrupt.  By September next, at the present rate of progress, the Commission will have no money left to pay its bills.  Why is this?  It is because the Heads of State over the years have wrangled over the amounts of money needed to fund the Community and have been far more concerned with what are in relation to most of these members states comparatively minor sums of money.  Heads of State have been involved in details of finances to an extent which has put out of their minds the fundamental purposes of the Community.  I can recall that at the Dublin Summit the British Prime Minister continuously harangued her colleagues for three days demanding that she get her money back.</P>
    <P>The Community was enlarged but the finances to look after the enlarged Community were not provided even though members of our party during a debate on the enlargement of the Community urged the Minister, and the Government, to take that matter on board immediately. As a result of this the moneys which Ireland receives under the regional fund are going to be considerably reduced.  On the best estimates available at present there could be a significant percentage drop in allocations for Ireland in 1986 out of the Regional and Social Funds combined compared with what we would be expecting considering the moneys made available to us in the past.</P>
    <P>Ireland out of enlargement has gained nothing.  We certainly welcome the new members states to the Community.  We look to the possibility of being able to sell more on their markets.  The new member states have had benefits shared indeed by some of the older members under such major Commission activities as the Integrated Mediterranean programmes. Nothing in particular has been done about Ireland, the most isolated member of the Community.  Instead, the funds <Col N="820" /> available to us under the Regional and Social Funds have been reduced and the Common Agricultural Policy is no longer the vehicle to improving our agriculture than it was in the past.</P>
    <P>Our Government have been far too silent in bringing to the notice of our partners in Europe the state in which this country finds itself and the neglect of our economy by our European partners.  I am afraid we tend to be naively over enthusiastic about developments within the Community and I refer here in particular to the decisions of the Heads of State in bringing together the document known as the &ldquo;Single Act&rdquo; taken at the end of last year.  It is very good to improve the Community Institutions so as to make them more efficient and suitable for a Community of Twelve or more members, but there is more to it than that.  Why should we let go unmarked an occasion such as the setting up of the single market which will bring undoubted benefit to the rich central areas of the Community but leave in a worse position than before an isolated economy like that of Ireland? Without in any way allowing any thought about our allegiance to the Community to be involved, we should say very firmly to our European partners what we think their responsibilities are and what action they should be taking in regard to the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>The European budget does not compare favourably with the sum of its national counterparts.  According to EC Commission figures, it amounted to just 3 per cent of these in 1984.  Finances directed towards welfare level convergence, such as the Regional Fund, the Social Fund and the guidance sector of the CAP accounted together in 1985 for a mere 15 per cent of the total.  I do not believe the Government have been making the necessary effort to ensure acceptance by the richer countries that full convergence requires the promotion income transfers between member states on a much wider scale than is being practised at present.  It is high time the Government took full advantage nevertheless of all the resources available to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> In the 1986 budget, £1.142 million has been set aside for new integrated operations. The aid is for financing specific action in the framework of integrated development operations in areas of the Community affected by both exceptionally high levels of unemployment and an absence of basic social and economic infrastructure. Dublin is specifically mentioned. I call on the Minister to make a statement with regard to the Government's position on these particular EC funds.</P>
    <P>Today, when Connacht Regional Airport is also being opened, we are reminded of the Government's appalling attitude towards funds earmarked by the EC for this project.  Substantial EC funds are also available for regional studies.  Can the Minister explain why so few studies have been assisted in Ireland? Are the Government afraid that the EC study would show up their failures?  Is it that the Government would yet again be shown in a bad light and would turn down potential EC aid?  In the UK, 55 regional studies have been carried out and 20 in Italy.</P>
    <P>The value of the CAP is enormous. The guarantee section in 1985 alone was worth £835 million in approvals.  The guidance section was worth £56 million. This latter figure, however, represents a fall of some £19.7 million on the 1983 figure and must be explained.  The Coalition's failure to take up EC aid is underlined in a recent Oireachtas committee report on EC legislation where it states that in recent years a potential £42 million in FEOGA grants was not taken up for industrial development projects.  Money has been lost on EC schemes such as the western package, the western drainage scheme and the farm modernisation scheme.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister explain why 11 projects out of 273 due to be financed under EEC regulation No. 355/77 were in fact not carried out?  The regulation relates to the improvement of the processing and marketing of agricultural and fishery projects. Answers are needed to these important questions and should be given. According to the Commission's 14th financial report, guidance section, dated <Col N="822" /> 7 August 1985 out of 712 projects financed in Germany only six were not carried out.</P>
    <P>I do not share the Minister's attitude to the protection of Irish neutrality in the draft European Act.  The draft European Act has not yet come up for discussion in this House.  It is interesting to note that a sentence, the inclusion of which Senator Dooge did not agree to when the Dooge report was being drawn up, has nevertheless found its way into the draft European Act approved by the Government.  The Dooge report, section 2 on security and defence, paragraph 2(i).(v)., spoke of: &ldquo;The will on the part of the Member States to create the technological and industrial conditions necessary for their security&rdquo;.  The draft European Act states at paragraph 6 (b): &ldquo;The High Contracting Parties are determined to maintain the technological and industrial conditions necessary for their security&rdquo;.  I thought that little irony might be of some interest to the House.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that our partners do not accept the Minister's restrictive interpretation. The Minister knows that himself. He came under pressure on 25 February when his EC colleagues began to discuss arms control negotiations in Geneva.  I quote from a <i>Cork Examiner</i> report of 26 February 1986:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Belgium Foreign Minister, Leo Tindemanns, and his German colleague, Hans Dietrich Genscher, have both made clear their view that security should from now on be discussed as a matter of course, as recent Treaty Reforms have officially incorporated political cooperation within the EEC Funding Treaty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then we have the Tokyo summit declaration which on the basis that it is supposed to be an economic summit is attended by representatives of the European Community.  Statements were subscribed to on behalf of the Community, I believe for the first time, which related to military aspects of security.  The summit also issued a pro-nuclear statement, which said: &ldquo;Nuclear power is, and properly managed will continue to be, an <Col N="823" /> increasingly widely used source of energy&rdquo;.  It affirmed the full responsibility of each country for nuclear safety but said nothing about international safety inspections.  The American raid on Tripoli was also endorsed by implication. We have heard no comment from the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the Tokyo summit communique.  I recall in June 1980 the then Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, specifically dissociated this country from a pro-nuclear statement by the Venice summit of the Seven.</P>
    <P>Then recently we had the spectacle of the European Parliament, including Deputy McCartin of Fine Gael, voting for EC co-operation on security including co-operation with NATO on 15 May. Some of the MEPs in Strasbourg used the draft European Act as a justification of their position.  It is obvious from all this that the draft European Act will place Irish neutrality under extreme pressure, because the language is so ambiguous.  In particular, I have to ask why the Government did not at least make a declaration to be attached to the Final Act reasserting Ireland's neutrality. It is not too late to do this.  I would venture to suggest that neutrality is of greater vital importance to us than the insurance industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to start by sending a message out from this debate to those people who order the business of this House to inform them that there are now many more Deputies who wish to participate in a debate on foreign affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, Deputy, when the order is made on this subject, is the time to make that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed that the amount of time allowed for this debate is such that it allows two and a quarter backbenchers to participate.  I do not know who is going to be the one quarter backbencher today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area of foreign affairs has, perhaps, for far too long been confined in <Col N="824" /> this House to Members' questions at particular times as to the welfare of Irish citizens in countries around the world, whether it be as a result of earthquakes or wars.  Generally speaking, the interest taken by Members of this House has been minimal.  This is highlighted today by the fact that the Minister, in his opening remarks, raised the issue of interdependence. If this House is to recognise what the Minister said, and the concept of interdependence, it is time we began to take more interest in what is happening around us.  Therefore, I welcome the fact that there are more speakers offering today than there is time for people to participate.  I very much welcome the fact that the Minister has recognised the interdependence of our country and the rest of the world.  For too long successive Ministers have been too confined and too insular in their activities to realise that actions taken many thousands of miles away have an enormous effect on what happens here.  We have a very full example of that in the recent disaster at Chernobyl and the ongoing problems in Sellafield.</P>
    <P>A cloud of nuclear radiation coming across the world is not going to decide when it reaches Ireland that because we are a neutral country, it will not drop down on top of us and contaminate us. Therefore, what happens in Russia or elsewhere with regard to nuclear power and energy is very much a matter for the rest of the world to be concerned with. What we want are not pious calls for closing of plants which we know we cannot bring about, but world standards to be set which every country in the world will abide by.  We will all, therefore, be better protected from each others' follies and accidents.</P>
    <P>The time allowed here today does not allow me to go through a number of areas of the Department of Foreign Affairs Estimate which I would like to touch on. Therefore, I will confine myself to the area of the Estimate which refers to our development programme.  Again, I will confine myself to two areas of that.  I hope this House will get an opportunity shortly to have a wider debate on our <Col N="825" /> development programme when the report of the Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries will be debated.  First of all, I want to welcome the fact that the amount of money allocated this year to our ODA programme for development education has increased.  This year, there will be a sum of £600,000.  This is a big increase on previous years.</P>
    <P>Part of that money will be used to fund the setting up of a development education support centre in St. Patrick's College in Drumcondra.  This is the first consolidated development education project undertaken by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I welcome it as a first step in the area of broadening and mobilising public opinion so that in turn we, the politicians, can recognise that, if we are to meet our international commitments and responsibilities to the developing world, we need to be mobilised and assured that the people do wish us to continue to take up our commitments and responsibilities in the developing world, even if it means cut-backs in certain areas in our domestic budgets.</P>
    <P>The development education support centre funded out of this Estimate is very welcome and will stretch its tentacles out into the first level, second level and third level colleges where it is needed and can be used to supplement and endorse a programme adopted by many of our NGOs over a large number of years when they mostly beavered away without much recognition or assistance from the public, the politicians or the Department.  It is only in recent times that the recognition of the need for this development education has been highlighted as it should be. It is interesting to note that the Irish Bishops pastoral letter on development highlighted the need for development education and I quote:</P>
    <P>The duty of helping these nations does not fall only on individuals and organisations; it is a duty which falls on the richer nations themselves and on their governments... it is our Christian duty as individuals to share <Col N="826" /> our wealth and to help our needy brothers. It is equally our Christian duty to demand that the political authorities representing us act always with justice and responsibility towards less fortunate countries and be prepared to use all means necessary for this end.</P>
    <P>In that pastoral and in many other statements issued about development education, there is an underlying message to us, as politicians, to the Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs that not only do we have to fulfil our commitments through aid, but we also have to be prepared at times to take sensitive political stands.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the second point I want to refer to briefly in this contribution. This is the question of Irish involvement at international level in mobilising and changing international opinion.  We are particularly suited as a country, small and all as we are, to do that.  I have just returned from a visit to some of our bilateral countries.  It is extraordinary, despite the small amount of money in proportion to what other EC countries have to spend, the enormous input the Irish are making, not just in the projects they are doing but in the involvement they have in mobilising Governments and in involving themselves in the infrastructure of those countries.  We should recognise this and realise that our Minister and those who speak for us in the international fora, whether at the United Nations or the EC, should be not afraid to stand up and be leaders on certain issues.  I refer particularly to apartheid. The Government policy on it is very clear, but I am afraid we are slightly reticent in putting our point of view before the world on this issue.  We must be prepared to take a lead.</P>
    <P>I welcome very much the recent decision of the Government to impose a ban on fruit and vegetable imports from South Africa when it can be proved that prison labour was used.  We have followed Sweden in doing this and that is a good indication that Ireland is beginning to take a stand.  I urge the Minister to continue to work on this when he attends <Col N="827" /> the Ministers' meeting next week.  We can then hope that other countries will follow our stand.  Our position is in accordance with the rules of GATT. Yesterday I met a group who told me there is a possibility that we can go further than we have without infringing GATT rules.  I hope the Department will examine that so that we may be able to impose much more stringent action against the importation of produce from South Africa, whether prison labour was used in production or not.  When I get certain information that I have requested I will let the Minister have it.  In Denmark last week they passed legislation in this respect and I hope we may be able to set a lead in this respect.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that only 35 million ECUs were set aside to help the victims of apartheid.  Sadly, shortly afterwards that figure was reduced to 10 million ECUs and I understand that only 5 million ECUs will be available this year and next year to help to assist the apartheid victims.  The Department and the Minister must have the will to stand up against things like this.  Let us try to get other European countries who have a much bigger trade involvement with South Africa &mdash; bludgeon them if necessary &mdash; into appreciating that you do not tinker with apartheid, you do not try to make it better: that you must dismantle it totally. It is not something you can titivate and try to make more acceptable to anybody. There are many people in Ireland who wish the nation to become a front runner.</P>
    <P>I refute what Deputy Collins said, something which I regard as utter nonsense, when he accused the Minister because, he said &mdash; possibly to catch a headline &mdash; that nothing has been done that will make his period of office stand out in the world.  Has the Deputy forgotten that under Deputy Barry's Presidency the EC produced policies which were supposed to be the most successful in the history of the Presidency?  Has he forgotten the setting up of the New Ireland Forum and the achievement of the Anglo-Irish Agreement?  Many of the senior officials we met in Zambia and <Col N="828" /> Sudan were interested particularly in the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Therefore, to say that Deputy Barry will not leave a mark on the Department or the country is ludicrous.  Apparently, what Deputy Collins is complaining about is that whether we like it or not the EC must review many of their policies, including the CAP.  Up to recently Ireland was regarded as the poorest relation in the Club that is the EC.  That can no longer be so with the entry of countries like Portugal and Greece.  We cannot continue at the bottom of the list, hoping we will get the biggest handouts.  Deputy Collins must have been complaining about the air of realism that has come into European Council meetings recently.</P>
    <P>The morality of allowing food surpluses to be built up in Europe was highlighted by the African famine referred to by Deputy Collins.  It was questioned by the whole world, particularly by our own Bob Geldof and I add my congratulations to him for doing in a short period what millions of people could not do: he mobilised the world in questioning the ethics of allowing food to rot while millions are starving.  As I said, I support the Estimate and I hope that on the next occasion we will have more time for debate on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Owen that we should have much more time to debate this Estimate, because foreign policy is the external representation of the national interest.  As we become more and more involved externally in representing our economic interests and our stands on issues that have been stated emphatically during the years, it is vital that we demonstrate the maturity of this Parliament and nation by having a full debate on foreign policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will confine myself to three or four matters in the hope that they will be developed.  National interests are demonstrated in the foreign policies of such nations as the US, France, Britain and the USSR.  Foreign policy is not something that operates in a detached way from the priority interests and principles at home.  Therefore, it is time that we <Col N="829" /> began to demonstrate in the interdependent world the Minister spoke about that Ireland will be in the vanguard not only in demonstrating our national interest but in making a positive contribution because of our background, history and common cause with so many other nations.</P>
    <P>We must be concerned with helping developing countries.  I will deal with our external obligations under three or four headings.  First I will give my views on the role of the Department.  A world economy recovery is under way.  New markets are opening up around the world and a great opportunity is there for an open trading economy like Ireland to avail of every opportunity to use whatever strength we have to exploit markets that are waiting to be exploited.  We can do that provided we have a national strategy for development &mdash; I do not say that in criticism of the Department or the Minister.</P>
    <P>I will illustrate what I mean by referring to Denmark, which has demonstrated to the world that everything must be done in external promotion through one coordinating centre.  We have been dissipating our resources for too long in promoting the economic interests of our nation abroad.  We have many different agencies such as the IDA, CIT, SFADCo, Aer Lingus, CIE, CBF, the Milk Marketing Board and so on.  We have many different agencies focusing on promotion of opportunities in markets abroad but we lack a co-ordinated approach and the personnel and resources to realise the potential that exists.  There is no point in our distinguishing between the Milk Marketing Board, CBF and CTT in the work they do here.  What counts is how they are perceived abroad.</P>
    <P>We should follow the example set by Denmark.  We should have an Ireland House, whether it be in Tokyo or any other place, promoting Ireland Incorporated, with every single contact being made through that centre.  All the agencies I have mentioned should be co-ordinated under one roof.  It is time we did this because it is the only way we can guarantee maximum impact from our <Col N="830" /> limited resources.  As the body that politically opens avenues for the various agencies, it is time our diplomatic services abroad led all these necessary developments. No longer can we afford to have embassies just for the sake of keeping us informed.  I am not saying that is their only role: as Minister I appreciated the capacity of the people in the Department. I am saying that if we want to improve our impact and our market strategy abroad we have an obligation to co-ordinate the efforts of all under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs in what should become more clearly a Department of foreign trade also.  Other countries have shown us this is the way. It is time our foreign policy was more closely linked to export promotion and the national interest.  Otherwise, it is simply a matter of academic interest, where we take positions in areas in which we are not directly involved.  That is all very well but there is more to foreign policy than that without compromising our fundamental principles.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to this matter but that is not enough.  I accept that criticism in this regard could also be levelled at his predecessors, including myself, but the matter is more urgent now than ever before.  I have the highest regard for the personnel in the Department from my own experience there but I say that recruitment should be carried out in the knowledge of the necessity to have a much more sharp representation of the economic interests of the country.  There is a case to be made in certain areas for appointing at the highest diplomatic level people with proven skills in promoting the interests of the nation.  Other countries do that.  There is no rule stating that the only way to achieve the highest status in representing Ireland abroad is through the established channel of recruitment at the age of 24 or 25 years.  It is important that we consider that aspect.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the EC have been engaged in relaunching the Community and he went on to say that they have successfully confronted the budget problems of the Community.  I have to <Col N="831" /> take issue with those statements.  Unfortunately, we are not engaged in relaunching the Community.  What we are actually doing is burying the Community and the original principles and treaties.  We are moving away from the Community we joined and we are launching something new instead of building on the Community we joined.  I will give the House some examples to demonstrate my case.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the Common Agricultural Policy for what it is worth.  What has emerged recently from the Community has not been consistent with the principles of the CAP as enshrined in the original treaties to which we acceeded, such as the maintenance of family farms, the provision of guaranteed prices and the guarantee for farm income.  Perhaps we could argue about the merits of the policy but the fact is it was the fundamental and only central policy of the Community. Instead, in recent times there has been a preoccupation with the budget and this has meant that policies are judged according to the funds the major countries in particular are prepared to contribute.</P>
    <P>It is time that we in Ireland reminded all our colleagues in the Community, particularly the Federal Republic of Germany, Britain, Holland and France &mdash; this is no begging bowl stuff &mdash; that we do not come begging when we talk about adequate resources for policy developments. That is an obligation of the Community. Adequate resources to promote the policies of the Community are an essential balance in a Common Market that gives the major countries opportunities they can exploit much better than can the smaller countries.  The Federal Republic of Germany, Britain and the other countries should never be allowed, either in argument or in presentation of their cases, to declare themselves the paymasters.  The reality is that they gain more from the Common Market than any other country.  For instance, in respect of the enlargement of the Community, they have the capacity to exploit trading opportunities that we do not have.  The Common Market gives them these <Col N="832" /> advantages which they quite rightly exploit but they should not be allowed to forget there is a Community dimension that says policies must be funded.  It is vital that that be said loud and clear but I have not heard it said at all in the past two or three years.  There has been much talk about the relaunching of the Community but what we have been doing is burying the Community.  We have called down the god names, Schuman, Di Gasperi and Spaak, the great idealists, while departing fundamentally from their ideals.  For the last five years we have had a Europe which contemplated its navel, reacting to internal problems, particularly those on the budget issue of the British Prime Minister almost exclusively, and the rest of us are expected to react.  It is time we had policies for the development of small and medium sized industries, research and development, technology and an effective education policy built on the original treaty.  This would make Europe relevant to all its people.  That must be the way forward, but we have not been saying it.  That does not mean that saying it would achieve that result, but we should keep saying it because it is vitally important.</P>
    <P>I attended the European Council which launched the EMS.  How long are we going to allow Britain to remain an external associate, contributing to the weighting of the ECUs while retaining certain rights.  I remember the British Prime Minister at that time, Mr. Callaghan, saying that they would like to contribute to the weighting of the basket.  He said this was a measure of their support for the EMS and their willingness to join the EMS at the appropriate time.  We have waited eight years and instead of developing the stability of the EMS, Britain remains outside, posing many problems.  We cannot force them to join but we can demonstrate that stable exchange rates &mdash; domestic European loans from the EIB and other agencies &mdash; should be a feature of our common effort to work together and any country which opts to stay out is not a fully effective member of the EC.  It is time this was said.</P>
    <P>I am not saying this just for the sake <Col N="833" /> of knocking Britain because there are areas where our common interest must and should be promoted but this is very important.  If we could arrange to borrow in ECUs we would be able to borrow a domestic European currency as distinct from other foreign currencies, such as the Japanese yen or the United States dollar, because we would be part of the system from which we were borrowing.  It is time the Government fought much harder for this and demonstrated the positive effect it could have on our economy.</P>
    <P>We had a special protocol when we joined the EC.  Was it mere words?  More and more that protocol is being ignored. This is an agreement and should have been called on in support of our case in terms of the impact that the cutbacks in milk production would have on our economy.  That protocol guarantees that members of the EC would support the economic priorities of this or any other Government.  We should have at least put it forward as an argument and if the EC ignored it, it would be seen that they were departing from that agreement.</P>
    <P>I want to mention the Regional Fund and FEOGA guidance.  It is clear that we are not availing of this fund.  If we produce integrated programmes we can benefit to the tune of 20 per cent more than we are at present.  We are merely presenting individual projects which come back to the Department of Finance and we do not see the additional funding at the end of the day.  Before it is too late, we must produce integrated programmes for infrastructural development, be it, say, for Cork &mdash; and God knows it needs it &mdash; or the west of Ireland, in line with the proposed developments within the Commission.  We have failed to do that over the last three or four years.  Recently the director general of regional policy underlined this fact in a public address in the west of Ireland.  It is time we utilised the funds to the maximum by productive integrated programmes.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the development of agricultural structures and FEOGA guidance.  Even in my own time as Commissioner, the take up from FEOGA guidance was deplorably poor.  We have <Col N="834" /> the capacity to develop the structure of agriculture, to improve the base of our agricultural production, to enhance our farm development programme, our meat and milk marketing, which are vitally important, the added value of food processing and so on, but our take up of the FEOGA grants is less than it might be. It is a question of maximising the benefit in a consistent and positive way.  I hope the next time we address ourselves to these issues those of us who have a little experience and considerable interest will have more than 15 minutes to express our views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for the opportunity to say a few words on this subject, and I propose to divide my time with Deputy De Rossa.  Before addressing the Anglo-Irish Agreement I would like to comment on the fact that the Minister Deputy Peter Barry and Deputy Nora Owen mentioned South Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All civilised people deplore the régime in South Africa although there are hopeful signs that they are coming to terms with the problem, or at least recognising them.  The Minister did not mention Afghanistan.  I wonder why?  Why do Irish people get uptight about South Africa and ignore the plight of the hapless people of Afghanistan who were bludgeoned into submission and raped by the might of the Soviet Union.  Is it because we cannot see the atrocities in that country or in all the countries behind the Iron Curtain, that we do not comment?  It is <Col N="835" /> easier to speak about South Africa and ask that we do not buy their fruit but we continue to trade with the greatest threat the world has known, the Soviet Union and the satellite States.  In my view, we should be as concerned with the plight of the oppressed people behind the Iron Curtain as we are with the wrong doings of the South African Government.</P>
    <P>It is as a Border Deputy that I wish to say a few words.  As a Border Deputy and a public representative, I have no reason to applaud the efforts of either the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs for their economic efforts in my neglected and deprived region, but I want to laud their efforts in producing the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I deny Britain the right to even a blade of grass in this country.  They are the oppressors.  For 65 years this country has been divided, and now the Taoiseach has reached a magnificent achievement in getting the British Government for the first time in 65 years of home rule and self-determination to acknowledge that they will some day vacate this country.  That will ensure that the names of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be written into the annals of Irish history.  The task was not easy to achieve.  It called for great diplomacy on the part of all concerned.  As a public representative I encourage them not to be disheartened at the apparent lack of success in the Border region where the outrages that have been perpetrated over the last 20 years have reached into the heart of my constituency, my town, with devastating effects.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that we need time to achieve significant improvements on behalf of the Catholic minority in the Six Counties, but it is not just the Catholic minority we have to be concerned with. The Protestant majority have paid a heavy price for the excesses of the IRA whom I describe as human animals who have cemented the partition of Ireland with blood by their excesses.  The week before last eight people were butchered with appalling ferocity in the North.  Just across the Border from where I live a <Col N="836" /> young man whose family I know well was taken in his underpants from his sister's home and gunned down 20 yards from there.  That is the background against which Fianna Fáil should come out of their ambivalence towards the IRA and the tragic partition of this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy <Col N="837" /> McGahon for the few minutes he has given to me in this debate.  I am sure that he will not take it amiss if I say that I do not agree entirely with his opening remarks in relation to where the threat to the world comes from.  I would like to put on record once again this year that I am not at all satisfied with the time allocated to this debate.  Two years ago the Minister promised that there would be an extended debate on foreign affairs and we still have not got that.  The Minister should set about organising with the Government some extended time for debate of these very important issues.  It is impossible for me or any Deputy to deal with foreign affairs in two or three minutes.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to consider that seriously.  As a final point, he should keep in mind that our interdependence in this world in relation to foreign affairs applies as much to aid as to making our position known on different issues of terrorism and so forth.  It is not good enough to say in relation to giving aid to other countries that we are not really concerned about what benefit we might get from it; we have a moral and humanitarian duty in that regard.  We have a moral and humanitarian duty in relation to terrorism, whether it be from the US, the Soviet Union, Libya or any other country which may be involved in it.</P>

      <P>I take your point.  I am quite willing to have a day or two day debate in this House.  The establishment of special committees is not the business of Ministers.  These are matters for the House.  The Minister responds to the wishes of the House if it decides to have a two day debate.  If the House decides to set up a committee I am not sure what my role will be, but whatever the House wishes I will do.  It is not a matter for me personally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Collins asked about the overflights I referred to in my speech. Permission for foreign overflights and military overflights in Irish airspace is not lightly given.  Our legislation requirements apply equally to all states.  He wanted to know if it was selective.  It is not.  We examine each request on its merits.  Our practice is to ensure in respect of overflight requests that the aircraft in question are unarmed and that they do not carry arms, ammunition or <Col N="839" /> intelligence gathering equipment.  Moreover, it is not our practice to accede to overflight requests where the granting of clearance would be prejudicial to the foreign policy or physical security of this State.  Our practice is not to grant clearance flights which form an integral part of military exercises or military operations. That clears that technical point.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to Deputy O'Kennedy's contribution.  I found it difficult to disagree with much of it.  Certainly we should aim at the co-ordinated approach he refers to, but it presents difficulties when you think of the host countries with which we operate.  For instance, a co-ordinated one office in Moscow or Saudi Arabia where the state buys would make sense, but you might be in danger of losing if you had a one house operation in New York where private enterprise is the main thing and they might prefer to see purchasing and promotion agents distanced from the Government of the country.  Therefore, it is not all that simple but I agree with much of it.  The Deputy is quite wrong in seeming to suggest that we have not been stating in the EC the necessity for balanced policies in the EC.  We have been saying it very loudly and we have not been alone in voicing those concerns.  Greece, Italy and Denmark have joined us in that. However, we must face the problem of over-supply.  There is no doubt that more agricultural produce is produced in the Community than the Community is using, which was not the case in 1970-72. We must not pretend that we can wish that away or that the problem will go away or that the people will continue to fund the build-up of mountains of surplus produce.  We must live in the real world as well as looking after our own interests in the EC.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil policy in regard to the EC is quite difficult to understand.  Although Deputy O'Kennedy did not refer to it, Deputy Haughey said in this House on a previous occasion that we should renegotiate our entry to the EC.  Deputy Collins, the official spokesman, said that again this afternoon.  I do not know whether <Col N="840" /> that is the official Fianna Fáil policy because even though Deputy Haughey and Deputy Collins have said that in the House, when Deputy Haughey went to Strasbourg recently he said, on visiting the Parliament, that he was not calling for renegotiation but for an assessment of Ireland's position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Community. That is a totally different thing. Deputy Haughey said, with great authority, in a slow voice and waving his hand, that we must renegotiate our terms of membership of the EC in the national interest but he had a very different thing to say in Strasbourg.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins and Deputy Haughey should get together, at home or abroad, and agree their position.  Are they looking for renegotiation of our membership or an assessment of our position?  The Government continually assess our interests in the Community and we will be very happy to give the House an assessment of the benefits of being a member of the EC.  The transfer of resources from the Community to this country between 1973 and 1985 amounted to £4.7 billion. During the same period we received substantial aid from the Common Agricultural Policy, the social fund, the regional fund and the European Investment Bank. For example, in 1985 we received £836 million from the guarantee section of FEOGA which provides price supports for agricultural products.</P>
    <P>The Community now comprises 12 members instead of ten when we joined it.  There have also been two major disruptions and a recession as a result of oil crises and obviously that has caused changes.  It would not be desirable if the Commission were set in cement and incapable of dealing with change.  The net benefit to this country is dramatic and real and we should be careful when talking about renegotiation.  The next time we have a debate on the EC or relating to it, I hope Fianna Fáil will outline their exact position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins also said that unemployment here is above the European average.  However, the point is that unemployment here started above the European average and I do not know of <Col N="841" /> any other Government in Europe who have had to deal with the kind of problems we have had to deal with brought about by the ridiculous policies of the party opposite from 1977 to 1981.  They were the cause of many of our problems.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Owen's remarks in relation to nuclear fallout.  It is ridiculous for the Opposition to call for the closure of plants when they know that we will never achieve such closures.  Deputy Collins must know that and Deputy O'Kennedy was wise enough not to repeat it.  Deputy Collins is incorrect in claiming that the Minister for Energy misled the House on this issue.  He argued the provision of the Euratom Treaty, in particular Chapter III, which provides a legal basis for the Commission to establish such an inspection force.  However, the Commission, in acknowledging the formal request from the Government to establish such a force, indicated that the request is being studied.  It is anticipated that this examination will be completed shortly, when the Commission will formally respond to our request.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to deal to a great extent with the programme for aid because we will have an opportunity to discuss that matter in the future.  However, I wish to correct what Deputy Collins said in referring to cut-backs in <i>Building on Reality</i> in relation to aid.  I listed the increases, which are quite dramatic, in my speech, a 15 per cent increase in 1986 compared to 1985 and there will be further increases next year.  For the past four years there has been an annual increase in the money we have provided for aid. While that is not unique, we are in a minority in providing such increases.  The targets set in <i>Building on Reality</i> have all been achieved.  It has been repeated here today that the provisions in the Single European Act regarding political co-operation in some way threaten our neutrality. They do not because it is quite clear that security in relation to political and economic policies is what is in question and does not in any way involve military or defence matters.  These assertions can only be an attempt to muddy the water because any fair-minded reading of <Col N="842" /> the Act would prove that what I said is correct.  I wish to repeat that the Single European Act relates to political and economic security and not to anything else.  Any other discussions on defence and security matters must be in other fora and not in the forum of political co-operation.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank Deputy Owen and Deputy McGahon for their comments regarding the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  It is an historic agreement and the work done on it is well appreciated by the Nationalist community in the North. They understand the difficulties of dismantling in a few short months what has been built up over 65 years.  Deputy Collins questioned the period of 65 years and said it had only existed for 18 years.  In a sense that is true, but the attitudes obtaining in the North and the sense of alienation felt by the Nationalists has existed since well before Partition.  The agreement is addressing this and is trying to bring about a solution where the Nationalists can take part in the running of institutions in the North and feel just as nationalistic as they do now.  We want to achieve this for the benefit of not just the Nationalists but also for the Unionists and to bring about an end to violence. We want to see reconciliation, peace, stability and prosperity for the two traditions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins referred to the constitutional aspect of the agreement, to which he objects.  I wish to say clearly to Deputy Haughey, Deputy Collins and Members of the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; unfortunately, Deputy Barrett is the only one present &mdash; that, if they feel the agreement which was ratified by the House is not in keeping with the Constitution, they have an obligation to test it in the courts. The Taoiseach and I have said this on many occasions since 15 November.  If they are not prepared to do that they should not refer to it any more.  I ask Deputy Barrett to tell his leader and his spokesman for Foreign Affairs what I said.  They should shut up or test the matter in the courts.  It is not good enough to continually imply that the agreement <Col N="843" /> is repugnant to the Constitution and at the same time do nothing about it.</P>
    <P>It is proposed under the Anglo-Irish Agreement to set up an international fund sponsored by the British and Irish Governments.  The United States Government very generously propose putting a Bill through Congress to contribute to such a fund.  The Bill is going through at present and should be law within the next few months.  An approach will then be made to the EC by the two Governments and an approach has already been made to the Australian, Canadian and other Governments.  I am confident that they will mirror the generosity of the United States in contributing to this fund.</P>
