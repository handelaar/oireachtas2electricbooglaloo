    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>During my contribution I have been emphasising the overall cost of the Department of Social Welfare.  The figure in that regard is in the region of £2.5 billion.  As I said last evening, if the number of unemployed could be reduced there would be a consequent reduction in the cost to the Department.  That is a basic conclusion.  The cost to the Department of paying unemployment benefit or assistance to 1,000 persons is in the region of £2.7 million.  Having regard to the numbers out of work we can readily understand why the overall cost in terms of social welfare payments, derisory though they may be in some cases, is so high.  Last evening I was checked by the Chair for wandering from the Bill at a time when I was putting the emphasis on the unemployment figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1607" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was not checked for wandering.  The Chair thought he had got lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not lost.  The solution rests in the Government tackling the problem of the long term unemployed, a number which is much higher than the registered figure when one takes account of those following short term courses and also of the numbers who are emigrating. Some of these short term courses are very useful but they are not a substitute for sustainable jobs.</P>
      <P>Another reason for the huge demand on the Department of Social Welfare is the cost of borrowing incurred by the Government for day to day spending.  It is time they addressed themselves to these problems.  They should forget about the commitments and the promises they made and which have not been put into effect.  We are still borrowing more money than ever before.  There is no deficit budgeting and the unemployment figure is in the region of 250,000.  Despite this all we hear from the Government is talk of crusades.  Statements on matters of Government are made outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have learned of the meat exhibition from the papers.  We have no representative at that exhibition though again we learn from the papers that we may have such a representative in two year's time. The Government are merely punching in time.  There were many who thought they were filling in time merely to enable them to qualify for pensions.  On that basis they should have given up in December last, but they have the audacity to continue in office and to shuffle unpopular and in some cases incapable Ministers.  Other Ministers were kicked in the teeth merely for projecting Government policies.  While all of this is in progress the economy is suffering for want of leadership.  Because of the Government's failed economic policies huge numbers of people must depend on social welfare payments.  Borrowing for day to day spending continues when every Department should be making the <Col N="1608" /> utmost effort to deal with the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>When the family income supplement was introduced a couple of years ago we were told that it would be availed of by about 35,000 families but that has not been the case.  When income is taken into account and when the difference is established between the income of the household and the amount the Government consider to be the amount needed to maintain a family above the poverty line, the shortfall is not provided for but is cut by 50 per cent.  In other words, if a family are regarded as being £10 below the poverty line they will receive an income supplement of £5.  Is it any wonder, then, that only 5,000 people availed of the scheme?  I know of one case of a man who has a wife and four children and who was assessed in terms of family income supplement to warrant the payment of £1.50 per week.  That was an insult.  Yet the Government continue to try to give the impression that they are a caring Government.</P>
    <P>I note that this Bill must be guillotined at 1.15 p.m. today.  I am sure that is no fault of the Whips nor of the Minister, but I am aware that a number of Members on both sides are anxious to contribute to the debate.  In future when this kind of Bill is before the House, especially in the context of the times we live in and when so many people depend on social welfare, a little more thought should be given to the time being allotted for the Debate.  I cannot see the urgency for a guillotine on Second Stage.  I am dissatisfied with the decision, whoever is responsible for making it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The House was responsible for making it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter to me who is responsible.  That does not detract from the fact that it is regrettable that so little time has been made available. There were only a few contributors and many more would have wished to speak. A Bill on welfare deserves more time in <Col N="1609" /> the House.  I shall conclude now to give others an opportunity to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take this opportunity, first, to congratulate the Minister on her appointment to the portfolio of Social Welfare and to wish her well in her new post.  In the context of this Bill I make a special appeal to her to please examine the appalling complexity which has developed in the whole social welfare code. The position has become untenable.  The code has become as complex as the income tax code &mdash; and that is saying something.  We had an original consolidating Bill, amending legislation and innumerable regulations and it would take a master lawyer and very many hours of research to try to master the intricacies and complexities of that system.</P>
      <P>It is just not good enough, in a scheme of assistance to people who are in difficulties and have to avail of the social welfare code, that they find it impossible to discover their rights.  We are talking here about matters of rights, not of charity. People are entitled to a reasonably understandable system under which they can open a book, booklet or pamphlet to find out their entitlements and pursue them. I have no doubt that many people miss out on many of their entitlements under this code or some aspects of it through sheer inability to get to grips with the system.  The degree of expertise required is not often available.  Even as a public representative and a trained lawyer of many years' standing, I find it incredibly difficult and time-consuming to try to resolve many of the points of complexity which arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will find, as she reads her way into the portfolio, that the system is riddled with anomalies.  It is remarkable that these have not been dealt with yet.  I do not wish to take up time here by going into any great detail but want to highlight what I am talking about.  Is it not ludicrous that there are 36 separate rates of child dependant allowances under the social welfare code, ranging from £13.80 a week for the <Col N="1610" /> second to the fifth child in the case of a widow's contributory pension down to £5.18 a week for the sixth and later children of people on supplementary welfare short term unemployment assistance? The child of the family on unemployment assistance costs no less to rear than the child of a family on a relatively more generous benefit.  I am disappointed that this Bill has not tackled such anomalies which have built up and become a fixed part of the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister is new to the job but I have no doubt that that type of anomaly will be tackled by her and quite soon.  We operate a dual parallel system of social welfare, the benefits section and the assistance section.  That is wrong; there should be one system of social benefit operating.  The need of one family is no greater or less than another. The insurance aspect of the scheme must be re-examined.  Appropriate rates should be fixed, irrespective of contributions. Whether people may not be liable for or have been unable to make contributions, those fixed rates should apply across the board and there should be a single system.</P>
    <P>Another aspect on which I want to touch is the question of social welfare appeals.  Many do not know that they are entitled to appeal.  It may say so on the forms which the Department send out, but many are turned off by forms; they do not comprehend them because they are complex and in official language. Time limits are something that they do not understand.  People are not made sufficiently aware of the rights they have. For people to appear before an appeals officer alone, unassisted and unaided, as most of them do, puts them at an enormous disadvantage.  It requires an appreciable degree of articulation to put one's case across in such an appeal.  It requires a good deal of knowledge of the system, which they do not have.</P>
    <P>I suggest, to cope with this, that the Department make available a number of officials who would be familiar with the scene, and able to consult with members of the public regarding appeals and go into the appeal hearing with them.  First, <Col N="1611" /> they could discuss the case in advance privately, find out the situation from the appellant and assist that person when he or she appears before the appeals officer. I will not say that many of the people whom I have met did not get a sympathetic hearing from the appeals officers, they did, but I do not think that the appellants succeeded in getting across the points which they could have and which might well have produced a different result.</P>
    <P>Of all the difficulties in the social welfare code, the supplementary welfare situation is the most unsatisfactory.  It arises primarily from the fact that, as I understand it, there are no clear written guidelines available, no rules or regulations under which money or other benefits are provided for an applicant for supplementary welfare.  The supplementary welfare officers who dispense this benefit appear on the surface &mdash; even to me as a public representative, let alone to members of the public who are unfortunate enough to have to resort to them for assistance &mdash; as having a discretion whether they will dispense money on a particular occasion, or how much, or what benefit or assistance in the way of bedding, clothing and so on.  That is the appearance that is given, because one cannot refer to any guideline setting out that in particular circumstances certain assistance should be provided.  Even within broad parameters, that does not appear to be the position, which is very unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to cast aspersion on any of the supplementary welfare officers.  I know they have a very difficult job to do and by and large they tackle it with a degree of professionalism.  In the absence of written guidelines it appears that they are operating in a discretionary way.  This leaves one with the feeling that the values and guidelines that one such officer may operate may be different from the guidelines operated by another.  For example, the supplementary welfare officer with responsibility for Tallaght may have one set of values which may be harsher <Col N="1612" /> or more discriminating than those of his counterpart in the adjoining dispensary in Clondalkin.  One gets the feeling that there may not be uniformity in the exercise of the dispensations made by the supplementary welfare officers.  If justice is to be seen to be done on this issue there ought to be drawn up and made available to the public representatives and health centres some kind of outline guidelines for examining entitlements.  In this way public representatives could assist people who look for help.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the question of the absence of a satisfactory appeals procedure which is a very serious matter.  A person who is not entitled to social welfare benefit goes to a supplementary welfare officer for help.  A decision is given which very often seems like an arbitrary decision which the person does not understand.  As a public representative, I have had many bitter complaints from constituents about the treatment they received by supplementary welfare officers.  Many mature women came to me in tears with the reception they received.  I expect that all public representatives have had similar experiences. Many people do not know that they can appeal under the existing system, unsatisfactory as it is.  It was not drawn to their attention.  The right of appeal in the supplementary welfare code is the same as that in the health boards who employ the supplementary welfare officers.  One is appealing from official 1 of the organisation to official 2 of the organisation.  The senior official who will conduct the appeal will have the report of the decision from his colleague.  It is fair to say that for that reason the appeals officer may be disinclined to interfere with it or to admit that his colleague has made an incorrect decision.  He will be disinclined to over-rule it.  The appeals procedure should be independent of the health board involved.  A person from a Department or some organisation should be appointed to conduct the appeal and to give an objective decision.  If the appeals officer then comes to the conclusion that it is appropriate to over-rule that decision then that should be done.  I ask the Minister <Col N="1613" /> to examine the situation of having an independent appeals procedure in regard to social welfare and to ensure that people are made aware that that procedure exists.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to raise is in connection with the fuel schemes.  The duality of the fuel schemes which produces such a ludicrous result has been going on for years.  It is devoid of logic and sense.  Maybe many years ago there was some logic to it but I do not know what it is.  It is based on the theory that people in rural areas could get their fuel by cutting turf.  If that ever was logic it is now high time that this social welfare benefit was rectified.  In my constituency there are two adjoining estates, one a Dublin Corporation estate and the other a Dublin County Council estate.  Both are occupied by people with similar economic backgrounds with no distinction in their incomes, their families or any other circumstances. Because of this dual system a tenant in the Dublin Corporation estate is entitled to fuel vouchers but a tenant living in the county council estate is not. How does one explain that this is the law of the land?  We as legislators allowed this nonsense to carry on for two, five or even ten years.  It is high time that some Minister realised that enough is enough and say, &ldquo;I am going to rectify this nonsense and recognise the fact the people in unfortunate financial circumstances require assistance with their fuel provision&rdquo;. A sensible scheme should be brought into operation which would not take cognisance of whether the person happens to be a corporation or a county council tenant.  It should be directed to the need of the family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only when one examines the statistics that one realises the extent of the need to provide assistance to people.  In 1975 8.9 per cent of the workforce, 103,000 people, were on the live register.  The last official figure, at the end of 1984, showed that there were 214,000 people unemployed, 14.7 per cent of the workforce.  This figure has now risen to 240,000.  It makes us realise the real problems facing this country and <Col N="1614" /> that we must substantially reduce the numbers unemployed.  When one considers that practically one-third of the population are in receipt of benefit, that about 60 per cent of widows are in receipt of benefit and that 80 per cent of people over 66 years of age are in receipt of benefit, it gives an indication of the bill that State has to meet.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to anomalies, irregularities and abuses in the social welfare system and outlined what was being done to eliminate abuses.  It is urgent to get the system operating properly.  Over the past few weeks we saw banner headlines and there was a lot of discussion about social welfare abuses in the north eastern region.  While there might be a bigger proportion of abuses in large centres of populations such as Dundalk, there is a very small amount of abuse in exchanges in Monaghan and Cavan where smaller numbers of people are being dealt with.  The managers in those exchanges have their finger on the button and know what is going on.  Because of the larger population in Dundalk, for instance, it is harder to keep tabs on the people claiming unemployment benefit or assistance.</P>
      <P>However, in Monaghan there are only 1,000 people on the live register and in the other three exchanges there is a total of about 2,600 people on the live register and those figures would be similar to what obtains in Cavan, so it is easier for the managers to make themselves aware of what is going on.  The north eastern region has been portrayed as a fiddling region.  Over the years there have been accusations especially in relation to itinerants who are a moving population. They are accused of collecting benefit on both sides of the Border and this problem has been discussed at health board and county council level.  There has also been a problem about people residing in the North, working in the south, and drawing benefits in the North.  That has been a fairly prevalent abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in recent times the banner headlines have indicated that people are crossing the Border and signing on in Dundalk and that it is costing the State <Col N="1615" /> £25 million.  The hardworking men paying their taxes are worried about these fraud allegations and they are asking public representatives to right the system if it is corrupt.  I ask the Minister, with all haste and power at her disposal, to clarify the situation and let the people know whether the fraud rate is 1 per cent or 99 per cent of claimants.  The Minister should ensure that the hard working people who are carrying this State are not defrauded and that any fraud which is being perpetrated is identified and attended to.  Fraud is not a serious problem in my constituency but if there is fraud in other areas it should be identified and dealt with.</P>
    <P>Another cause for concern is the method of assessing eligibility for unemployment assistance.  Small farmers and self employed in receipt of a fairly substantial amount of benefit are having their benefits discontinued at the stroke of a pen.  In some cases on appeal and reinvestigation benefit is restored to some extent.  Prior to Christmas a case was referred to me and it annoyed me very much.  A man with a wife and five schoolgoing children who was in receipt of unemployment assistance of £52 per week to supplement his income from a 30 acre farm was assessed on the basis of the money he received from the creamery to which he supplied the milk produce of ten cows.  This man has fairly heavy borrowings and an overdraft of about £3,000 which he could not eliminate with the milk cheques as the money had to pay for feed and fertiliser.  In the event he got very little income although he was assessed on the basis of the money he got in a previous year.</P>
    <P>In December this man was receiving no money.  Just prior to Christmas I contacted the community welfare officer to ensure that he got some money.  After Christmas the case was investigated.  I brought to the attention of the Department the factual position of this man.  The result was that benefit of £30 a week was restored to him.  This may seem a small amount but, as he said, it at least paid for groceries for the family.  In such <Col N="1616" /> hardship cases discretion should be used. The circumstances of the person should be taken into account and we should not work on figures alone.</P>
    <P>I agree with the point made by the previous speaker in relation to the operation of the supplementary welfare allowance system.  I am glad that the Department have taken over that system and that the health boards do not have a problem operating it.  This allowance has caused me a fair amount of concern over the years.  I agree with practically every word the previous speaker said regarding the lack of uniformity in the examination of applicants for supplementary benefit.</P>
    <P>The community welfare officer is working in an impossible position as he is expected to exercise discretion and make an on the spot examination of a person. Sometimes he is not satisfied with the amount of evidence he is receiving with the result that he may be unfair to an applicant in ensuring that that person does not get what he is not entitled to.  It may be that that person suffers.  Many times I wonder how the scheme operates in various areas.  The four-county health board area which I represent is an area which shows a fair amount of change from fair wealth to, I would not say &ldquo;poverty&rdquo; as I do not like the word, to less well-off people in disadvantaged areas.  As on 31 March 1984 the number there in receipt of social welfare and supplementary allowances the number of recipients was Louth, 606; Meath, 725; Cavan, 77 and Monaghan, 67.  How can you have such a demand?  Is it that in one area people are more craftier than in another area to avail of it?  The final figures of the number of recipients, adult and child dependants, are as follows: Louth 617; Meath, 1,180; Cavan, 88; and Monaghan, 140.  The number of beneficiaries, not the supplementary system, in those counties was as follows: Louth, 1,401; Meath, 2,222; Cavan, 188 and Monaghan, 237.  They seem to be imbalanced. Apart from the actual figures, in 1986 we should be able to come up with a different system than the one we are operating at present as far as supplementary benefit is concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1617" /> A report of a few years ago outlined very clearly the losses and the amount of, I would not say &ldquo;fraud&rdquo;, of money that they had failed to recoup.  In the delay between the person applying for DB, UB or UA a social welfare officer provided the money on a weekly basis.  In my experience the Department were very stringent.  When they had a claim processed and ready for payment they checked with the local community welfare officer to find out if they had made payments to those recipients.  They then withheld it and paid it to a health board.  The report indicated millions of pounds of losses and stated very clearly that it was due to people who had received supplementary payments on the double.  Seemingly the refund had not taken place.  When I relate it to the area which I represent and to the cases with which I deal, it does not add up.  I would be satisfied that my constituents are not getting it on the double for the simple reason that there was that check done.  It should be done, and rightly so.  Refunds were always made.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the voluntary organisations.  In the years to come there will have to be a greater recognition of their work and there will have to be more co-operation with them.  An additional amount of funding should be provided. At a recent health board budgetary meeting we were faced with a situation of serious cutbacks.  The restraints are there.  We are operating with less money in our pockets.  There is no doubt that in situations such as ours voluntary organisations will go to the wall.  They will not receive as generous a funding as we would be inclined to give them if there was more money available.  These organisations are doing valuable work.  The future of the care for the aged and many of those services which the State are finding it practically impossible to fund and operate will be dependent on the voluntary organisations, who are doing terrific work.  In every built-up and rural area they are doing very commendable work and a continuation of that is necessary.  The State cannot fund, nor should they have to in all cases.</P>
    <P>Another problem, more so now than <Col N="1618" /> at many times recently, is the question of delays in paying disability benefit and various other payments.  I put down a Question on 26 February:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Social Welfare the reason for delays in disability benefit payments to persons who are submitting certificates on a continuous basis.</P>
    <P>I have one case at present of a person who has three weeks pay for January which he has not received, but the Department claim that the cheques were issued.  If one looks at the Order Paper they will see the number of Deputies who are continually tabling questions regarding delays of payment to individual applicants. It is a habit I do not like and only use it when I am put to the pin of my collar and getting no satisfaction.  It is very rare that I put down a question such as that.  But it is an indication of the problems that are besetting public representatives because of those delays affecting their constituents.  The Minister's reply to that question was as follows:</P>
    <P>The position generally in relation to disability benefit is that payments are being issued promptly when the claim is made correctly and the claimant is qualified on his or her insurance record.  As the issue of payment depends on the receipt of medical evidence of incapacity, any delay or irregularity in the submission or delivery of medical certificates to my Department inevitably delays the issue of payment.  These are matters over which my Department have no control.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the need for the speedy processing of disability benefit claims.  In this respect internal administrative practices are kept under continuous review to ensure that they are operating as efficiently as possible.</P>
    <P>That reply states factually how it should be.  It is not what actually happens.  On many occasions when people send in certificates on a continual basis and without delay they find their benefits are not being paid to them in the same way as their <Col N="1619" /> medical certs are being sent in.  This is something that should be attended to.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in her very long speech the number of people who are operating the scheme.  It is now operated centrally from Dublin.  I am of the opinion that it is now time that there was a decentralisation of the Department of Social Welfare, because more use could be made of the regional offices. The Minister mentioned in talking about delays that there were 251 officers in 94 different locations.  Medical referees have been increased to 25.  Delays in assessment are much too long and they cause hardship to many people who consequently have to go on supplementary benefit.  The system must be simplified and the two types of benefit should be looked at together.  In that way, payments would be expedited.  Regional offices should be established because if everything goes to a central office in Dublin delays are inevitable.  It is the officer who is established locally who will know the facts.  I do not see why the decision making officer in Dublin should be the first to examine claims.  A system like the one I have suggested would expedite matters.  With not very much extra outlay the system could be streamlined, made more efficient and be more acceptable generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I was impressed by one speaker who referred to complications and multiplicity and said the social welfare code includes 36 different types of payment.  I fail to see why the system should be so complicated.  Anybody in public life for a number of years will understand the complexity of completing an ordinary social welfare form.  If that is so, it must be nearly impossible for an ordinary claimant to understand what is required.  People are continually appealing for greater simplicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been reference to appeals and the frustration they cause, particularly in rural Ireland.  It should be possible, with little extra cost, to have an office in each county manned by a local officer capable of dealing with appeals.  If somebody goes to a local representative <Col N="1620" /> with a query, the representative will be very lucky if he can get through to the Department on the same day.  He will get a reply saying that the matter is being looked into.  I fail to see why a public representative in, say, County Limerick could not go into an office in Newcastle West or Askeaton and be told by a local officer what the nature of the problem would be and how long the claimant would be waiting for his money.  Sometimes, people with families have to wait five or six weeks and one can imagine the frustration of the family.  If the cheque does not turn up on the Friday, within an hour the public representative will be approached.  Inevitably the question put to him is: &ldquo;How will we live over the weekend?&rdquo; We cannot answer that. Therefore, I suggest there should be immediate access to a local officer.</P>
    <P>In villages in rural areas on Tuesday mornings you will see a number of people going into the Garda barracks.  It is degrading for anybody living in a village to be seen by everybody entering a Garda station to sign for the dole or for unemployment benefit.  It is not good for a man's children that his father can be seen going into the Garda station because when somebody goes to a Garda station it is because he has a legal problem, has broken the law in some way.  That system is wrong and should be changed.  In my local village there is an area office to deal with home assistance matters.  People in local communities should have a community officer to help them to solve their problems.  Apparently, everything has to be done in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am not happy about the manner in which social welfare officers investigate cases.  Those people, living in Dublin, are not tuned in to the needs of people in rural Ireland.  For instance, in cases where farmers apply for dole, a man from Dublin will approach the claimant to assess him.  He will go by guidelines, he will examine a man's creamery cheque, but he will use the same assessment for a man who is working a farm of good land in Killmallock, for instance, as for a man on bad land in Carrickerry or Athea in west Limerick.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1621" /> When Alumina in my constituency opened, many local farmeres went to seek jobs.  Those farmers when they were given jobs kept others who did not own farms out of work and earned up to £120 a week.  In those cases a very small amount of assistance would have kept those farmers on the land and would have given work to those without land or jobs. That was a mistake on the part of the Department and of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about doctors' certificates and reassessments by referees. Doctors certify people as being unfit for work and if a man is called before a referee the referee will find him fit for work.  It puzzles me what would happen if a man so certified by the referee went back to work as a lorry driver or a car driver.  If he has an accident, how would he fare out as regards insurance, considering that the first doctor certified him as being unfit for work?</P>
    <P>There are other matters we should look at closely.  I welcome the Bill but I am dissatisfied with certain provisions in it. For instance, the annual sum for social welfare amounts to £2,500 million.  A question has been raised before as to why some of that money should not be used in the field of employment.  We should be able to utilise some portion of the money spent on unemployment benefit and assistance to get people back to work on such projects as the county roads throughout the country.  I have raised this point on several occasions and have received support from Limerick County Council and various other people, but there is no real will to do anything about this problem.  This will continue to be the case as long as people are prepared to live on social welfare payments.  The day will come in the years ahead when someone will take up this idea and say that we were very stupid people not to use that money to create employment.  They will look back on us as legislators as being very simple people.  Nobody has ever justified spending so much money on social welfare while we have so many <Col N="1622" /> people unemployed who could be doing useful work.</P>
    <P>The figure of £2.5 billion is a very substantial demand on the Exchequer which has to cater for growing demands in other areas as well.  A clear indication of the Government's commitment to this very vulnerable section of the community is that over the past three years substantial increases have been given in each budget which have exceeded the rise in the cost of living.  Unemployment assistance for the long-term unemployed has been increased.  All other weekly benefits go up by 4 per cent from July.</P>
    <P>I am very happy about the child benefit scheme which is to come into effect in April.  I always hoped that budget increases would be paid as soon as possible after the budget.  Of course, the argument is that the previous year's budget extends into the following year. The Government have decided to introduce this non-taxable child benefit scheme under which £15.05 per month will be paid for each of the first five children. The amount for the sixth child will be increased to £21.75 per month.  This is a clear indication that the Government are prepared to support the larger family and provide help to mothers.  They look forward to having some money of their own, perhaps to augment the husband's salary or social welfare income, which is often very limited.  The cost of the scheme is £218 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Government and I welcome the new Minister and wish her the best of luck.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Social Welfare on her recent appointment and I wish her well in her new office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not at all satisfied with the operation of the social welfare code.  Apart from the fact that there are people on social welfare who would much prefer to be working, there are various problems in relation to the operation of schemes within the Department.  The Minister said during her speech that there is another attitude beginning to surface in <Col N="1623" /> recent times, that people on social welfare payments are doing well and many are only too glad to avail of the benefits of the system.  I do not agree with those sentiments.  The vast majority of people in receipt of unemployment benefit and assistance would much prefer to be working. It would be far better for their health and the welfare of their families, as well as the betterment of the country, if employment could be created instead of putting the emphasis on social welfare.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we all know how important social welfare is for the unemployed. I am disappointed that the increase is only 4 per cent.  This applies to the recipient, but not to his wife and family.  The increase takes effect from the third Monday in July rather than the first Monday in July, as used to be the case. I remember a time when all social welfare increases took effect from 1 April.  The Government should apply the 4 per cent increase across the board to spouses and dependants of social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien mentioned the proposed introduction of the child benefit scheme from 1 April.  We should remember that the children's allowance scheme will be phased out from that date.  Many families will be worse off under the child benefit scheme than under the children's allowance scheme because the benefit scheme will allow for taxation of benefits received and will not be taken into account in claims for tax free allowances. An increase in the existing children's allowance scheme would have been far more beneficial than the proposed child benefit scheme.</P>
    <P>I am most unhappy with the appeals procedure in the Department of Social Welfare, particularly in relation to appeals against refusals of unemployment assistance or reductions in unemployment assistance.  My experience leads me to believe that the appeals section in the Department is in utter chaos.  Sometimes it takes ten or 14 weeks to get a decision on an application for unemployment assistance.  If that decision does not suit the applicant it could take up to six months to decide an appeal. <Col N="1624" /> Were it not for certain Dáil Deputies, including myself, putting down Parliamentary Questions about delays on appeals, the applicants could be waiting up to 12 months for a decision on their appeals.  During this time they are without money or else they are in receipt of a very low rate of supplementary welfare allowance from the local health board.  This is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The total staff in the social welfare section of the Department is 3,500, a colossal staff.  The total social welfare payments come to £1.3 million per week and 37 per cent of the population depend on social welfare.  This is a very sad reflection on the Government of the day.  Were it not for the high, unacceptable rate of emigration today, particularly among our younger and better educated people, we could add another 8 per cent to 10 per cent to that figure.</P>
    <P>I recommend that the appeals section of the Department of Social Welfare in Dublin be abolished completely and that the appeals system be decentralised to each county, if not to each town with an employment exchange.  I cannot understand why it is necessary to send appeals for decision to Dublin.  In many instances these appeals are being decided by persons who do not know what is happening on the ground, or how tough it is for people to live in remote rural areas relying solely on unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.  While that appeal is awaiting a decision, that person is in receipt of meagre supplementary welfare allowance from the local health board.  Each county should have appeals officers.  If an appeal is lodged against the decision of the deciding officer, the appeal should be decided in the county within a reasonable time.  I do not see why we should not introduce a time limit, by law, for deciding unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit appeals.  We have such a time limit in relation to planning applications where a decision must be taken within two months, but when a bread and butter decision is needed there can be a delay of months.  As I said, I strongly recommend that the appeals section of the <Col N="1625" /> Department be decentralised and that a number of appeals officers be appointed in each county to clear up the backlog and to keep the number of appeals under control.  In my view it should not take longer than two or three weeks to decide an appeal.</P>
    <P>Fewer people in receipt of unemployment assistance can get an oral hearing of their appeal.  I know of hundreds of cases in south Kerry where unemployment assistance recipients who are not satisfied with the rate they are getting and who have appealed, have been denied oral hearings.  This applies particularly to smallholders who cannot provide for their families during the winter months without unemployment assistance. In many cases the winter months have long gone before a decision on their appeal is made.  An unusually high rate of oral hearings on these appeals is being denied.  I ask the Minister to take into account the amount of money which will be saved by health boards if there were speedy decisions made on appeals on unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit, because some of these people must go on supplementary welfare. It has been costing Kerry County Council approximately £1 million a year to pay supplementary welfare.</P>
    <P>There are some anomalies in the social welfare code.  I am informed that two contributory old age pensioners living together are in receipt of a greater allowance than a married man with two children on unemployment assistance.  I would like these anomalies rectified.  There are also delays in deciding applications for the deserted wife's allowance and social assistance allowances.  I cannot understand why it takes so long to investigate these applications.  In my view this is due to the fact that there are not a sufficient number of social welfare officers working in certain areas.  This may be one of the reasons why it takes so long to decide applications for widows' pensions, non-contributory old age pensions, the deserted wife's allowance, social assistance allowance and unemployment assistance.  I am not happy about these <Col N="1626" /> delays and I ask the Minister to do something positive about them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Willie O'Brien mentioned medical referees and the fact that there are delays in the Department in deciding appeals even following the refusal of an appeal by an appeals officer on the recommendation of the medical referee. I note from the Minister's statement that the number of medical referees in the Department is 35.  I cannot understand why persons who are well known to me and who are genuinely ill are being turned down on appeal for disability benefit.  I have a number of genuine cases which I would like to discuss with the Minister of State.  These people are still attending the local regional hospital for continuous monitoring of their very serious illnesses and their applications are supported by very strong medical specialist reports.</P>
    <P>I should like to know how seriously the Minister's Department take these strong medical reports from specialists in various fields.  I know also that, while their cases are being reconsidered, some of these people have been advised to go on unemployment benefit.  They apply for unemployment benefit, producing letters they receive from appeals officers refusing their application for continued payment of disability benefit, and receive unemployment benefit.  I often wonder whether it is that the amount of money available in the Department for disability benefit runs out at a certain time of the year, so that it suits the Department better to transfer such people to unemployment benefit?  That is a serious question that must be answered by the Minister or Ministers of State.  I have come across a number of such cases recently and I ask the Minister to have them examined.  This position cannot be denied.  I have sufficient proof to back up these allegations and statements.</P>
    <P>I should very much like to see the restoration of the old special scheme of unemployment assistance to smallholders. Its abolition by this Government in their February 1983 budget dealt a severe blow to smallholders in the west and south west.  That scheme was introduced <Col N="1627" /> by a Fianna Fáil Government in the sixties &mdash; and improved in the seventies &mdash; to supplement the income of smallholders particularly in the winter months when those in dairy farming had no income whatsoever.  Such money was put to good use by those smallholders.  Apart from keeping bread on the table for their families in lean periods, some of that money was put into the development of those small holdings.  The real proof that that scheme was a success is the fact that, not alone did it stem the tide of emigration in the west and south west, but it allowed the population to increase there at practically the same rate as the remainder of the country.  This scheme has been substituted by a means-tested one.  We have emigration again from these areas along the west and south west coasts.  I firmly believe that this scheme should be re-introduced and I have no doubt that Fianna Fáil will do so if and when returned to office.  There is no doubt in my mind that the phasing out of that scheme for smallholders was a disaster as far as family incomes are concerned.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment especially a small, hard working section of the Department of Social Welfare, the section known as the TDs' inquiries section, those employed in the disability section who service inquiries from TDs. They work hard and are most helpful at all times.  I have always found them most obliging.  Their biggest problem &mdash; particularly those social welfare officers manning local labour exchanges &mdash; is that they are over worked.  That is another reason I appeal to the Minister to decentralise the appeals section of her Department.  I should like to pay particular tribute to the management and staff of the exchanges throughout the country, particularly those located in County Kerry, who are always most obliging and helpful and who do enormous work under very difficult conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I waited patiently here last evening and again this morning.  I must repeat that the <Col N="1628" /> system of calling people in the House to speak leaves a lot to be desired.  I will be taking this matter up with the Whips in the hope that it can be improved.  Some people appear to be able to walk into the House and be called immediately while others must wait.  Last evening and this morning I listened to Deputy Lyons complaint that this Bill was being guillotined at 1.30 p.m. today.  He said that was a disgrace because people wanted to contribute to such an important debate. However, when I stood up here last evening there was no Fianna Fáil speaker in the House.  He came rushing down the steps at the last moment, without a speech prepared, and then he berated everybody this morning for not having given the mater thought, time and careful consideration.</P>
      <P>Indeed, he devoted most of his remarks to budgetary matters rather than concentrating on the Bill before the House.  He referred several times to the sick failures of the Coalition Government &mdash; referring to their damaging the freedom of this country &mdash; no doubt in relation to the Anglo-Irish agreement.  While Deputy Lyons berates the Coalition Government and looks forward to Fianna Fáil coming back into office to put the country back on its feet, I would say he may get his first taste of Coalition himself after the next election.  After 16 years in office Fianna Fáil got a rare taste of Opposition and they have not made a very good fist of it.  Therefore, they may not make such a good fist of Coalition, which requires much commitment and skill, when one takes into consideration the mix of the different parties that goes into making up a Coalition Government.  What can most fairly he said about Coalitions is that almost invariably they put the country first.  Bearing in mind the balance to be maintained between the parties, the interests of either party must always be challenged, and probably always are, by the other party in Government.  The only alternative is to put the country first. That attitude has enabled us to make a phenomenal amount of progress in the last three or four years in the area of social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1629" /> There are many good provisions in the Bill and a few sad things.  We must sound warnings to the Minister about the direction social welfare has been taking in recent years.  We realise that about 35 per cent of the population benefit under the social welfare system.  To a large extent that indicates that 35 per cent are no-hopers.  It appears that many people believe they will not have to depend on social welfare.  There are a lot of anomalies in this system and one should ask oneself what approach to adopt when discussing a Bill like this, whether one should discuss the improvements in the benefits, ask for more for the areas that have not been improved, or whether one should consider it in the overall context of the problems facing the country.  One cannot discuss the Bill exclusively from the point of view of more services and improvements and more of a drain on the national coffers.  We must go in a direction which will tend to mitigate the high charges on the Department of Social Welfare because of their obligations.</P>
    <P>There are many people existing barely above the poverty line and many are shocked at the extent of that problem. The extent of unemployment in large measure gives rise to the high expenditure by the Department of Social Welfare. There was a good deal of criticism by Deputy Lyons of the Coalition, the prospect for more jobs and emigration. One would think listening to him that the Government were the total cause of all problems that exist in the country.  He gave the impression that he alone has the answer to our jobs crisis.  I heard him shouting a lot about the problems but I did not hear him put forward any concrete suggestions as to how we could rectify the matter except that if the people put Fianna Fáil back into office all these things would be sorted out if the people had faith.  I do not think people will rely on faith any more; they will look at the record of the different parties.  The record of the Government in regard to this has not been bad.  We are at a crossroads with most of the work completed and we are in a position to take off and improve employment prospects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1630" /> I realise that in the budget an extra £70 million was provided for additional expenditure on social welfare this year. There was an increase of 5 per cent in the amount of long duration unemployment assistance and a general increase of 4 per cent in the personal and adult dependant rates of welfare payments from next July. As a consequence of the 1985 budget increases, welfare payments in the first half of this year will be 6½ per cent higher than in the first half of 1985.  We are expecting inflation in the coming year to be below 4 per cent and, therefore, we are able to satisfy the commitment made in the national plan to improve those rates in line with the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>There have been individual increases in benefits which are outlined in the Bill. I should like to comment on the weekly amounts of income which determine entitlements under the family income supplement scheme which is being increased in line with the increases in short term social welfare benefits.  The rate of payment under the scheme is being increased by 25 per cent to 33? per cent.  The child benefit scheme, a major new development under this heading, is based on the amalgamation of the existing child support schemes.  The monthly payment of £15.05 for each child and £21.70 for the sixth and subsequent children is welcome, although I have heard comments to the effect that the figures should be reversed.  I will not pass any comment about that suggestion but it leaves a lot of room for debate.  I wonder why people make such comments.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of her speech, mentioned the complementary role of the State in community action in caring for the less well-off.  Members must bear in mind the reason why we have to provide money for the less well off while at the same time we try to eliminate the causes of poverty.  We are talking about eliminating poverty as far as possible and in this regard it is important to note that we have a Combat Poverty Agency Bill on the Order Paper. The element of poverty in the community could be separated and catered for financially by the social welfare benefits dealt <Col N="1631" /> with in the Bill.  The social welfare budget costs £1.3 million per week, a sizeable sum.</P>
    <P>The figures mentioned in the Bill are extraordinarily high for such a small country but I am concerned that the gap between social welfare payments and the average industrial wage is narrowing. That causes immense problems in a community that has been practically destroyed by the handout system.  What worries me most is that the younger generation who up to recently have not been affected by the handout system could be totally destroyed in the same way that older generations have been. We will then have the begging bowl attitude. Deputy O'Leary mentioned the special unemployment assistance for smallholders.  The attitude that one does not really have to work and can live on handouts should be discouraged.  The only way to discourage the new generation from adopting that attitude is to provide jobs.  The tendency is, as far as possible, not to work if the benefits come within a day's wages of what one would get for a full week's work.  There is a total loss of dignity and pride.  As a consequence we are left with numbers of what are referred to as &ldquo;dossers&rdquo; in the community and that is very bad for society. We are reaching the stage where people over 40 do not bother looking for jobs because they know they have little chance of being employed.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the 4 per cent administrative charge in respect of the running of the Department be examined.  We are talking about an overall budget for the Department of £2.5 billion to which the Exchequer will contribute £1.6 billion. The 4 per cent represents about £100 million, which seems an extraordinarily high figure.  Therefore, between now and Committee Stage I should like to have a breakdown of that amount so that we may discuss it further then.  I should like to hear, too, whether we are getting value for the money we are spending.  I do not think we can regard the 4 per cent in the same way as we would regard an administrative charge in, say, business or <Col N="1632" /> even in a semi-State body such as the IDA.  In terms of the huge amount of money involved this 4 per cent may or may not be good value for money.  I appreciate that a good deal of pressure is applied by TDs and by the public generally who wish the various services to be continued.</P>
    <P>It is depressing that inexorably we are liable to an increase in the cost of social welfare.  The Minister calls for an adequate level of support from the rest of the community, but the community are entitled to an adequate number of jobs.  If there is not an adequate number of jobs we will not be able to afford the system we are aiming for.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves whether we wish the system to continue as it is. Poverty must be tackled and I am glad that this area is singled out specifically for attention.  If we could eliminate poverty we could aim to make improvements in payments in those areas that are not within the poverty category.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the matter of fraud in social welfare has been put into perspective in the Minister's speech.  A lot of damage has been done by the attention this matter received in the media and elsewhere.  To a large extent the problem was exaggerated.  It is estimated that 4,000 people were involved in an element of fraud in respect of social welfare and that the total amount involved was in the region of £3 million.  I should like to hear what was the actual number of cases involved, but the £3 million represents about 0.0001 per cent of the entire budget.  That portion is so small as to be hardly worth arguing about.  I should like to hear what the prevention methods in use in the Department to eliminate the possibility of fraud are costing.  However, the public can be reassured that the problem has been tackled.  We must not forget that people who are on these levels of subsistence are not very well off.  They cannot be said to be living in any sort of luxury.</P>
    <P>The measures taken to combat the abuses are extensive, as the Minister has indicated.  These measures are far more superior than the methods that have been <Col N="1633" /> used in areas of overcharging and of fraudulent practices which affect people who depend on social welfare payments. I am thinking, for example, of the huge amounts of money that have been taken fraudulently from these people to line the pockets of the operators in the gaming industry.  These people have made millions of pounds in this way.  We may take it that tens of millions of pounds of the money paid by the State to social welfare recipients has been taken from them fraudulently by people who are breaking the gaming laws.  There is little comparison between the public outcry and the steps the Department have taken in regard to fraud in the social welfare area and the outcry there have been about those in the gaming industry who operate illegally.</P>
    <P>Legislation that was brought forward recently can only have the result of huge amounts of money being continued to be taken from social welfare recipients.  We should admit that we made a mistake and bring in emergency legislation to ban gaming machines.  From speaking to people who depend on social welfare payments but who were spending a lot of their benefits in these gaming establishments, I am aware that they are much better off now that some of these places in the city and elsewhere have been closed. Proof of this is the fact that they are spending their money wisely now.  The matter of fraud in the Department has been dealt with so I think the media should refrain from highlighting that issue further.</P>
    <P>There are a few problems which the Minister might pay attention to in the matter of a follow-up to the action that has been taken in the area of fraudulent practices.  The practice of working but also of signing at the employment exchange seems to be the biggest area of abuse.  The rents of tenants of local authority houses are increased if there is evidence of involvement in this type of fraud.  If these people are taken into court they are not allowed to take the oath while officials are allowed do so.  If rents have been refused from local authority tenants they are found automatically to <Col N="1634" /> be guilty and are therefore at a disadvantage. Justice should be done in those cases, because in many instances the people concerned are not very literate. In many cases social welfare recipients are not very well educated and do not understand the system.  I am not implying that people should be allowed draw social welfare payments while working, but we should operate a fair system in every respect.</P>
    <P>There is a problem in respect of the employment incentives schemes.  This is because the payment is low &mdash; £70 for a few days &mdash; by comparison with the amount of social welfare payments. Because of this people are not inclined to participate in the scheme.  I should also like to mention disability benefit and medical referees where a second opinion is required.  Other Members have mentioned this and the unsatisfactory way in which the system works.  Perhaps that is the way it has to operate but I should like to ask if it is a gravy train for the medical referees, as I note that their number has been increased by 25.  Many people are fed up at being brought back time and time again for medical checks.  I know medical referees have succeeded in weeding out many people who did not deserve to receive benefits but medical referees should be paid as retainers and given a lump sum so that it is not in their interests to bring back patients in order to get extra payments.</P>
    <P>Dental benefits should also be examined because the system is totally mismanaged. Dental benefits are paid in respect of fillings, extractions and scaling and that means that it is in the interest of every dentist who treats people on social welfare payments to extract, fill or scale. This means that people are subjected to many fillings or may end up with no teeth, whereas in modern dental practice the idea is, as far as possible, not to extract teeth: Indeed many top dentists regard extractions as failure.  They even recommend not filling teeth.  I do not know the reason for scaling and I notice that dentists never emphasise proper dental care.  The Department and dentists do not stress that people should use floss on <Col N="1635" /> their teeth once a day to get rid of plaque. If a person has a proper job done on his or her teeth, they should not need any more fillings for a very long time.</P>
    <P>I know examples of people who have gone to good dentists and who do not need treatment for many years after that. I also know dentists who very rarely extract teeth and I will give a personal example in that regard.  I went to the same dentist for 15 years and every six months during that time I had some form of filling although I did not have any extractions.  Then I went to a dentist who knew what he was doing and I had a complete job done on my mouth.  That was eight or nine years ago and I have not had a filling since.  That practice is not highlighted and I should like to bring it to the attention of the Department because there are serious problems in Ireland and Britain, although Scotland is the worst where one-third of the population have no teeth.  There should be a simple procedure whereby people are informed that they should use floss on their teeth daily and that they should not eat too many sweets.  Dentists should not be paid for extractions or fillings, they should be paid on a retainer basis and there would then be no need to extract or to fill teeth in order to make more money.  The same applies to optical benefits, although dental treatment is more important.  Abuses in all areas of social welfare benefits should be wiped out.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention labour exchanges and the indignity which people suffer because they have to queue in a smoke-filled atmosphere in a room with a butt-laden floor.  They then have to plead their case to get a small amount of money.  If we had computers the system could be streamlined which would make things easier for everybody.  There should be telephones in offices in outlying districts.  We claim that a sum of £800 million has been spent on our telephone system and it is supposed to be second to none, so I do not see why we could not have a very efficient system.  In other countries social welfare cheques are sent <Col N="1636" /> out by post.  From the facts produced it is obvious that hysteria has been generated in relation to fraud because the amount of fraudulent claims is so small you could almost ignore them.  I lived in other countries and I saw unemployed imigrants receiving benefit without having to queue in a police barracks.  It is very hard to get across Dublin city, especially for mothers with small children. They cannot physically drag themselves around the city at the whim of an officer who requires letters to prove their claims.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the supplementary social welfare benefit has been taken out of the budget and that the Exchequer is now paying for it because it is an area requiring attention.  We can now statistically gauge the number of people seeking or availing of benefits and, by examining the figures, make the system more responsive to the immediate needs of those unfortunate people and make payments more readily available by having local offices.  That needs attention, in the same way as the appeals need attention. They seem to be very slow but then there are many people appealing who know that they have not much chance.</P>
    <P>The increases in the social welfare allowances are welcome.  Regarding the child benefit scheme, I do not know what to say about the idea that people get £15.05 for the first five children and after that they get £21.75 per child per month. The family income supplement is another improvement but we have to ask what we want out of this system.  There is a case for streamlining all the documentation because the level of literacy required to pick one's way through the system is very high.  The present system imposes a lot of stress and strain on people trying to get their entitlements.  Frayed nerves and tempers result in rows when neighbours say one person is getting something to which others also feel they are entitled. Although tax has not increased to the employee the PRSI ceiling keeps rising, which amounts to an increase.  There is also an increase in the labour redundancy and insolvency fund and many of us who <Col N="1637" /> spoke on that Bill pointed out that this could happen.  It is starting to go that way.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the income levy is gone because the money was wasted in terms of the schemes it was spent upon.  The occupational injury benefit changes are also welcome, especially because the scheme now encompasses people going to and from work.</P>
    <P>While the benefits and awards under the Bill are welcome and absolutely essential, we must bear in mind that the reason so much money has to be spent in this way is because of the overall situation in the country, mainly in regard to employment.  We need to create tens of thousands of jobs and to get away from the hand-out.  I am cautioning the House that if we allow our young generation, who make up about 50 per cent of the population, to become dependent on social welfare payments, easy options and hand-outs, if we allow them to become lazy and stay at home because if they worked they would earn only £10 or £20 more than they would receive in social welfare benefit, then the whole fabric of society will be destroyed.  We need a whole generation to work for Ireland and we have to put them to work. The efforts made already by various agencies, including the IDA, by the Government and by the private sector have not come up with the answers.  I believe the answers are there.  I would know how to put tens of thousands of people back to work.  If we do not do so we will fail totally and the figure of £2.5 billion will increase inexorably until we are unable to afford to increase payments. We will have a totally discontented population which will probably become militant and we will lose the cream of our population through emigration. That is the saddest thing of all.  It is something which has been happening since the Famine but we have no one to blame but ourselves.  This is the supreme challenge to this House, the Government and the people.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the setting up of the Cabinet task force to tackle employment creation, I would appeal to them not to <Col N="1638" /> rely entirely on themselves, on economists or theoreticians to come up with all the answers.  We will not find too many Ph.Ds working as developers or successful builders or business people.  Let the rest of us, both inside and outside the House, make an input to job creation.  If we want to restore the dignity of the unemployed and those who have to depend on the system, we should first of all streamline it and bring it into the 20th century by using technology while at the same time put to positive use the skills, education and experience of our young people.  There is no use putting them on training courses for jobs which are not there.  There are lots of people living here who have invested their whole lives in this country and who have not emigrated. They are probably in their forties and in many cases are professionals.  They are seeking leadership.  We would get the young generation to come with us if, for example, we were to say we were going to make Dublin city into a shopping, entertainment, tourist mecca for the islands of Britain and Ireland by making it the most attractive place and using the market of 60 million people who are there.  We would tie it into the tourist industry with the hotels' federation and bring tens of thousands of people to this island, creating up to 50,000 service jobs in this sector.  This would rejuvenate the island.</P>
    <P>We have more talent, proportionally, than any other country in Europe.  I am talking about even such things as entertainment talent among young people. The only sectors of our culture that we did not lose were our music and our art. We lost practically everything else.  We have an amazing talent and we have an advantage over all the surrounding countries in attracting people here to be entertained and to be in the company of vibrant, fresh, good-looking young people.  That is what we have to do in order to reduce the amount of money paid on social welfare.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to take into account some of the recommendations made in the first report of the House of Commons Social Services Committee in <Col N="1639" /> the session 1985-86 regarding the reform of social security, especially items 5, 7 and 11 in the list of recommendations and conclusions of that committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I was completely dissatisfied and disappointed with the increases given to social welfare recipients especially in view of the fact that the cost of living rose so much in the past 12 months.  Those people in receipt of social welfare payments are in very poor circumstances. As a TD in a rural area, I have heard many complaints in the past 12 months of how those people cannot exist on the social welfare payments which they receive.  No week passes in which I do not receive a big number of applications from people on social welfare payments applying for supplementary welfare payment.</P>
      <P>People in receipt of contributory old age pension got an increase of £2.05 this year.  The non-contributory old age pensioners got an increase of £1.70.  Those increases do not come into effect until the middle of July when half the year is gone.  I would like to ask the Minister why those increases are not paid from 1 April as they were in the past when we had a different Government in power. People on disability benefit received an increase of £1.60 this year.  This is a very small increase, about the price of a packet of cigarettes.  It is completely inadequate for present day needs.  The Oireachtas should look more sympathetically at our unemployed and what they have to put up with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last time we had a Fianna Fáil Government the increase given in the last budget to social welfare recipients was 25 per cent which was paid from 1 April. We gave an increase of 25 per cent in the second last budget also.  That is an increase of 50 per cent in two years. Old age pensioners, both contributory and non-contributory, deserved that increase.  If they had not got those substantial increases at that time their plight would be much worse today.  The increase should be much more substantial.  Deputy Skelly spoke about the record of particular <Col N="1640" /> Governments.  When Fianna Fáil were in power they were very sympathetic towards the poorer sections of the community and always gave them substantial increases.  I would say to Deputy Skelly that, since they came into power three years ago, the present Coalition Government have not been so generous with people on unemployment assistance and with old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>Again I would like to emphasise the fact that I am disappointed that payment will not be made until the middle of July. All old age pensioners look forward to any increase in their pensions, as do people on unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit.  It is a long time to wait until the middle of July to enjoy that small increase.  I think this is the first Bill the Minister put through the House since she became Minister for Social Welfare but I may be wrong in that.  I would like to wish her well in her new position as Minister.  I hope that next year when she increases social welfare benefits she will consider paying them from 1 April rather than 1 July.</P>
    <P>The change in the payment of social welfare to small farmers, better known in the south of Ireland as the small farmers' dole, was very undesirable.  Not much thought was put into it.  If a married couple running a small farm with more than 12 cows receive more than £45 profit a week they do not get small farmers' unemployment assistance.  It was interesting to listen to Deputy Skelly talking about the unemployment assistance paid to small farmers.  He said some of them should get up off their tails and do a little bit more work.  One must accept that from a Dublin orientated TD who does not understand how the small farmers live in the south west of Ireland.  I would like to tell Deputy Skelly that it is very difficult for a small farmer with a wife and one or two children living on the income from 12 cows to eke out a living on a small farm any place in the west of Ireland.  Some Dublin TDs would not understand that those cows milk for only eight or nine months of the year and do not give 1,000 or 1,200 gallons of milk.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the new Minister for Social <Col N="1641" /> Welfare to review the means test for the small farmers' unemployment assistance. Last year many small farmers who do not make silage were unable to save hay because of the bad weather and they had great difficulty in trying to make ends meet from 1 November until 1 March when they again started enjoying an income.  The small farmers have very little on which to live.  Many of them have come to me during the winter seeking supplementary welfare payments because they could not get small farmers' unemployment assistance.  They told me that they were hungry due to the fact that last year was so bad that the cows had to come in early and the milk yield was not as good due to wet conditions and the state of the land.  Special consideration should be given to these farmers and the means test should be changed.</P>
    <P>I accept that the amount paid in social welfare generally is considerable.  In the past 12 months there has been 240,000 people unemployed. I sympathise with the Government who have to pay the unemployment benefit and assistance. However, the Government are lucky that we have the emigration outlet.  I would estimate that in the past two years about 100,000 people, some of them school leavers, have gone to America and the same number have gone to England.  If the present Government had to meet an unemployment benefit payment bill for another 200,000 people they would have a real headache.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy comes down to my county I will prove the emigration figures to him.  I am sure his neighbour will tell him about the people who have left County Clare.  Perhaps the Government are disappointed or resentful at having to pay so much unemployment assistance.  The way to solve the problem is to provide jobs.  That will be a difficult task.  The Government should make a better effort to provide jobs.  In the past three years the numbers of jobs <Col N="1642" /> provided have been minimal.  If the Government provided jobs they would have to pay out less in social welfare benefit.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that social welfare officers when investigating cases with a view to granting unemployment assistance are very harsh and difficult.  In my constituency recently, a man who was cutting timber to provide household fuel for himself was disallowed unemployment assistance on the grounds that he was cutting timber for commercial purposes. The man did not have a car or even a pony and cart or a tractor to transport the wood, so I do not see how he could have been cutting it for commercial purposes, and he should not have been disallowed assistance for trying to provide fuel for himself and his family from a forest where he had received permission to cut the timber.</P>
      <P>People who receive unemployment assistance at a very low rate often find that an appeal to get the rate increased takes from four to six months to process. Some small farmers in receipt of a very reduced rate of unemployment assistance are in dire straits because their circumstances have changed considerably and it is unfair for them to have to wait four to six months for appeals to be heard.  Their only resort is to apply for supplementary welfare allowances which in many cases they get.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to see in the Bill that in future local authorities will not be responsible for the payment of supplementary welfare benefit.  That is a good step as this money should come from the Central Fund.  The Bill also refers to the child benefit scheme which is to replace children's allowances.  When a new scheme is introduced there is always something distasteful in it.  As a result of this new scheme an employed person will lose his £100 personal allowance which up to now he got for each child.  Employed people were much better off with the children's allowances.  This killed the scheme completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, I am very dissatisfied with the amount of the increases.  It is hardly worth while paying <Col N="1643" /> them to old age pensioners who had looked forward to a few more pounds to enjoy in the last few years of their lives. They are a special category and they should be treated as such: they should have been given more substantial increases than anybody else drawing social welfare benefit.  We have people on unemployment assistance with four or five children who have great difficulty in providing for their children with costs going up every day.</P>
    <P>We have been told that another £10 million will be taken off food subsidies, but we do not know because we have not seen the Finance Bill.  That will make food even dearer and the lot of the unemployed far worse.  In these circumstances what good will these increases be to them?  This year, in particular, the increases should have been more substantial and I am sorely disappointed that they have not been given from 1 April.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Social Welfare who, if her record means anything from her time in the Seanad, will do a great job.  She has gone through the rigours of political life and I was glad to hear Deputies express appreciation of her excellence.  In her opening speech she dealt at length with the various problems the Department have to contend with.  Deputy McEllistrim spoke about the huge number relying on social welfare benefits and I wish the Minister well in her difficult task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be considering some reforms in the social welfare code and I should like to make a suggestion in regard to what is known as the farmers' dole. This should not be the responsibility of the Department of Social Welfare.  Farmers' incomes could be better monitored by those dealing with that industry and consequently I suggest that the funds provided for farmers' dole should be controlled by the Department of Agriculture. I therefore ask the Minister for Social Welfare seriously to consider changing the scheme from its present form.  The recent system of farmer assessment which came about because of a Supreme Court <Col N="1644" /> judgement in relation to rateable valuation should alter the system of control in this regard.  This code of social assistance for farmers was being worked in a compassionate way by the Department of Social Welfare but I am afraid that Department are not geared to appreciate the role our farmers play and the methods by which they control their incomes and budgets. For equity's sake, therefore, I hope the Minister will persuade the Department of Social Welfare to hand this fund over to the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Because of modern technology new systems are now available which could be used to the benefit of the Department of Social Welfare who could then devise better ways of availing themselves of information in regard to claimants and beneficiaries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Deputies who spoke on the Bill and I wish to express appreciation of their good wishes to me in my new portfolio.  I will respond to specific points made by Deputies as far as possible in the short time remaining.</P>
      <P>Deputies McCarthy and McEllistrim complained about what they considered to be low levels of increases.  It is all very well to complain about rates of increases and to compare them with higher percentage increases in other years. Obviously, what we must look at is the level of increases as compared with the cost of living.  That is the only logical yardstick to use.  When one talks about increases of 20 per cent and inflation at the same rate of 20 per cent, one can put the increases into their proper perspective. One of the successful features of the Government's strategy has been a reduction in inflation from the runaway high level of previous years.  The rate of inflation this year is expected to be about 4 per cent and this year's social welfare increases will have to be reckoned against that measure.  We could talk about the absolute level of social welfare payments, and I am quite sure there will be a long debate on it when the report of the Commission on Social Welfare is brought before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1645" /> The Government have more than met their commitments to maintain the value of social welfare payments and this year we have provided real increases.  When we compare the rates introduced in 1983 with those that will obtain from July next and then compare increases in social welfare rates with inflation to mid-1987 we get a real increase of about 5.5 per cent in disability and unemployment benefits, 8 per cent in old age pensions, 13.5 per cent in long term unemployment assistance. Given the state of the public finances these are no small achievements by the Government.</P>
    <P>Of course the state of the public finances has had its impact on social welfare payments.  We would prefer to bring in those increases at an earlier date but we have to trim our cloth to the situation we find ourselves in.  This year the cost of the increases is £35 million.  To have paid them from April would have cost an additional £22 million.  To have done so in 1985 would have cost £32 million, in 1984 it would have cost £34 million extra and in 1983 it would have cost £39 million extra.  The Government applied their resources in the most equitable way possible. So when Opposition speakers deplore the fact that the increases will not be paid earlier they are definitely talking about £100 million extra in public spending in those few years.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCarthy will, I hope, forgive me when I say that one of the problems of the Opposition is that they never took very much account of the cost of anything. It is necessary that control be exercised.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in some of the figures that Deputy McCarthy used.  He said that 4 per cent equalled 2.7 per cent, that 5 per cent equalled 3.4 per cent and we had much playing around with figures. The only figures that matter are the real levels of increase which are got by comparing the social welfare payments in 1983 with those now being provided. What people are interested in is the amount of money that they get each week and what that money will buy.  They know that the rates of payments have been maintained by this Government and that <Col N="1646" /> their position has been protected and in many cases improved.</P>
    <P>At the same time, Deputy McCarthy complained about the burden on the taxpayer and the low return which he is getting for what he pays.  That does not make much sense because he cannot have it both ways.  The only way to reduce taxation is to reduce expenditure.  The logic of the Deputy's argument is that we must reduce expenditure in order to reduce the burden on the taxpayer.  A Government must strike a reasonable balance between the real needs of social welfare recipients and the real needs of taxpayers who must bear the burden of the cost.  In this year's budget and in this Bill such a balance has been achieved. The reason for there being no increase in the child dependant rate is, quite simply, that there will be a 25 per cent increase in the rates of allowances payable for each of the first five children in all families. Those are the simple facts.</P>
    <P>The child benefit scheme will represent a major improvement and development of the social welfare system.  Child tax allowances, on the other hand, provide the greatest level of benefit to the higher paid and the least benefit to the lower paid.  Direct payment to families is the best form of child support for all families in need, including those on social welfare payments, those who are working and those not lucky enough to be in any tax bracket.  It is an essential factor of the full child benefit scheme that the benefit itself would be taxable.  This is the main way in which the redistributed impact of the scheme will be achieved.  We would all want to make sure that the worst off will benefit most in the bringing up of their children.</P>
    <P>We have decided in the medium term to introduce the scheme by abolishing tax allowance, freezing the child dependant allowance increases in social welfare payments and making available a significant increase in children's allowances rates. We have put aside for the child benefit scheme this year the resources made available by the abolition of child tax allowance, £18 million, resources which would have been used for increasing <Col N="1647" /> social welfare child dependency rates, £4.2 million, and an additional £11.1 million from the Exchequer.  The Government are seriously tackling the problem of child support.  What I am giving to the House are solid facts.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCarthy referred to the family income supplement scheme. There is no doubt that the level of take-up has been disappointing and the Bill contains a provision to improve the level of payment and the level of take-up.  We are budgeting for around 6,500 people receiving family income supplement by the end of this year.  In the longer term obviously, the future of the family income supplement scheme will fall to be reviewed in the context of the introduction of a full child benefit scheme.</P>
    <P>There is one other very important area which I want to make sure to mention. This is the question of the EC directive on equality of treatment for men and women in the social security system.  As I said in my opening remarks, the reason for the delay was the fact that one of the staff unions in my Department took the view that the implementation of these provisions could not go ahead until certain staffing issues had been resolved.  I want to refute any allegations of unwillingness on the part of the Government to bring these provisions into operation. We have had to deal with a very difficult situation in trying to control the size of the public sector, which is something generally demanded.  This, obviously, has had a serious impact on Departments, particularly those like Social Welfare which has a high staffing complement and which at the same time is facing an increased level of demand on the services it provides.</P>
    <P>For implementing equal treatment and particularly those elements which involve changes in dependency arrangements, an additional amount of work for the staff of our Department is involved.  I must bring these provisions into operation in the most efficient and cost effective manner.  Discussions are very actively under way and I hope to be in a position to announce the full implementation of <Col N="1648" /> the equal treatment package at an early date.  I am glad that I have been able to include in the present Bill provision for the implementation of the parts of equal treatment which do not involve additional staff, that is, the increases in the rates and duration of certain payments for married women.</P>
    <P>I would like briefly to touch on the question of retrospection, which was also raised by Deputy McCarthy.  This general question has been the subject of a High Court case and has been referred to the European Court of Justice.  To that extent, it is <i>sub judice</i>.  However, I must draw the attention of the House to the fact that when people propose retrospection they should remember that as well as those elements of the equal treatment package which involve increased payments there are other elements which involve a drop in present entitlements. At present, the married woman is almost always regarded as her husband's dependant and accordingly he qualifies for increase in benefit in respect of her, regardless of her employment status.  The new definition is based on the principle that one spouse will be regarded as dependent on the other spouse only if he or she is being wholly or mainly maintained by that spouse.  It is a fairer definition, but means that certain people who would be regarded as dependants at present will no longer be so regarded.  I do not suppose the Deputy is suggesting that people who got social welfare payments since December 1984 under the present arrangements should have these revoked or that they should be demanded back.  That is what would be involved if the equal treatment provisions were made retrospective.  I do not know if Deputy McCarthy is looking for the best of both worlds and that we have retrospection only in respect of those parts of the package which involve increased entitlements.  That would undoubtedly be a very popular course of action but realistically we must see equal treatment as a whole.  Retrospection on particular parts of the package and not on others would not be justified.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1649" /> Regarding comments on the payrelated benefit floor, I said earlier that we are continuing a policy of progressively raising the level.  I should mention that if the floor had been maintained at the same level in relation to the flat rate benefit as it was in April 1974 when first introduced, it would now be around £84 instead of the £58 which is proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGinley was concerned about the disqualification period extension for disability benefit.  I want to assure him that under the existing arrangements those who have genuine reasons for not attending are not penalised in any way. That arrangement will continue in the future.  I can assure the Deputy that people who have genuine reasons will not be penalised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor referred to the complexity of the social welfare code and I fully agree with him.  One of the provisions in the Bill is specifically designed to facilitate the process of consolidating the very many social welfare regulations which now exist.  We had the Social Welfare Consolidation Bill of 1981 and much legislation since.  We need to consolidate them and this work is very well under way.  Section 22 of the Bill is a technical measure designed to facilitate the consolidation task.  On Committee Stage, after consultation with the parliamentary draftsman, I shall be bringing in an amendment designed to simplify and clarify the provision in section 22.  It is purely a technical amendment which arises from reconsideration by the parliamentary draftsman of his early draft.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor also referred to the need for improvements in the appeal system, both the appeal system for social welfare matters generally and the separation system which applies in the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  I would emphasise for the Deputy's benefit that the system is designed to be independent and to give the ability of arriving at decisions quickly.  Appeals officers are senior officers of the Department and their independence is guaranteed by the legislation.  It is generally accepted that they operate independently.  It is very <Col N="1650" /> important that the system should be as compassionate as possible and that matters should be dealt with as quickly as possible.  I am anxious that we would not introduce any new measure which would add to delays caused by the volume of appeals &mdash; there are 12,500 appeals dealt with by 40 appeals officers.  We would not like to increase that delay.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor was also concerned about the procedures being off-putting for very many people.  He felt that it could be a frightening experience.  I certainly hope that this is not the case for most people.  It is up to the appeals officer to decide whether there should be an oral hearing in any case.  In practice, however, no reasonable request for an oral hearing is refused.  The oral hearing gives the person an opportunity to put his own case personally to the appeals officer.</P>

      <P>On 11 March the House of Representatives adopted a Bill authorising a United States contribution to the International Fund to be established under the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Under the terms of the Bill a direct cash contribution of $250 million will be made available over a period of five years.  The Bill also provides for other assistance to serve as an incentive for economic development and reconciliation in Ireland and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that United States contributions in support of the International Fund may be used only to support and promote economic and social reconstruction and redevelopment in Ireland and Northern Ireland and, in particular, that the contribution be distributed in accordance with the principle of equality of opportunity and non-discrimination in employment without regard to religious affiliation.  The Bill also specifies that contributions will address the needs of both communities in Northern Ireland.  There is also a requirement for an annual presidential report to the Congress on the degree to which the objectives of the fund are being achieved.</P>
      <P>The details of the Bill may, of course, be subject to modification during its passage through the Congress.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that, according to <i>The Irish Times</i> of 6 March, £20 million are to be made available as a direct grant to Ireland?  Would the Minister agree that that is a very small amount of money to create such a fuss over?  I am <Col N="1652" /> glad to hear there are no strings, other than economic strings, attached, but given the history of the United States economic investment throughout the world, it is not clear if that will remove us from other kinds of strings.  In view of the small amount of the grants, loans and credits, is it wise for us to take up this loan?  Are we not reducing ourselves to a state of beggary to the same extent as an under-tip that a taxi driver might take? Would it not be better to politely refuse this money and raise it by other means&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the number of Irish citizens being held in custody in England under the Prevention of Terrorism Act; and if he is aware that a number of these have been held in custody for a long period, despite the fact that they have no connection with any illegal organisations and that the matter is now one of serious concern for the families of these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Figures for persons detained under the PTA are issued quarterly.  The most recent figures available are for the last quarter of 1985. As records are not available for the citizenship of persons detained, it is not possible to indicate how many Irish citizens were detained in that period.  However, I can say that between October and December 1985, 66 persons were detained under the PTA in connection with Northern Ireland.  A further 25 persons were detained in connection with international terrorism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Prevention of Terrorism Act there is provision for the arrest and detention of persons, initially for a period of 48 hours extendable with the approval of the Home Secretary up to a maximum of seven days before charges have to be brought or the person released.  Where a person has been detained or charged under the PTA, the Embassy can and do help his or her family in ascertaining where the person is being held, whether <Col N="1655" /> a detention order has been extended or what charges, if any, are being brought. The Embassy also seek to ensure that the person detained has access to a solicitor, can communicate with his family, has no medical problems and is being treated correctly.  Where complaints are made to the Department or the Embassy by relatives of those who have been detained about the treatment of persons in detention, the Embassy raise these complaints with the British authorities.</P>
    <P>The Embassy act in PTA detention cases at the request of families, legal counsel, or public representatives or where the Embassy are otherwise aware that there are grounds for concern.  In some cases persons do not wish the Embassy to intervene.  Such wishes are at all times respected as is the privacy of the persons concerned.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that the possibility of abuse of powers and of discrimination against Irish citizens is inherent in the PTA legislation and, in consequence, I make representations concerning the scope and method of operation of the Act to members of the British Government on a regular and ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has specific cases in mind, I will have the matter investigated if he will let me have the details.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that two of my constituents have been held since last June?  I have been in touch with the Department about the people concerned.  Is he also aware that these people are completely innocent but are not being given an opportunity to prove their innocence?  They have been told by a solicitor that he will take up their defence if they pay him £7,000.  Is he further aware that as a result of this, those people have lost their jobs and the wife of one of them is seriously ill in hospital?  Is it not a very serious matter when our Government, on behalf of these people, seem to take no interest but come in here and make bland statements?  I brought this matter to the notice of the Minister's office on 25 August last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I guessed that was the <Col N="1656" /> case to which the Deputy was referring but I was not aware of some of the facts he gave.  As he said correctly, he brought this matter to the attention of my office on 25 August last and he was informed of the position at the time.  The two people in question have been charged under section 11 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act with failure to disclose information which might be of material assistance to the police.  That is a matter for the judicial process in Britain and we could not interfere in that process.  They are not being detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act now; they have actually been charged.  There is a difference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that it is most unjust to have people detained in this fashion over a long period?  In that period they have lost everything.  One man was a small contractor and he has lost everything, his wife's health as well, as a result of this. Would the Minister not try to ensure that our people in England are protected against this kind of so-called British justice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do, of course and, as I said in my reply, I have made frequent representations about the operation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  The number of people who are being detained under its provisions, as distinct from being charged, has dropped considerably in recent years.  Likewise, the detentions appear to be more selective because the percentage of people who are being charged has risen.  Amongst those who have been charged are the two people about whom Deputy Gallagher speaks.  I do not know the facts even though I have no doubt that what the Deputy says is correct about the personal circumstances of the individuals involved.  But they are now being charged under an Act of another country and it would not be proper for me to interfere in that case until it has been disposed of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there appears to be a parallel <Col N="1657" /> here with what we see happening in the North of Ireland where people are held in custody over a period?  This seems to be what we are dealing with here.  Would the Minister make strong representations, even at this late stage, to try to ensure that these people, who are completely innocent and are not involved in any way with illegal organisations, would at least have a chance of defending themselves without being held in this way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with what Deputy Gallagher has said.  I presume, even though I do not know, that the men's solicitors applied for bail when they were charged initially. Whether that was refused, I am not sure, and that is another factor in the case. What I will try to do &mdash; and there is a limit to the influence any foreign Government have in another country in matters like this &mdash; is to ensure that they are brought to trial as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be appropriate that I should go into the motivation of anything that happens in the judicial processes in another country. As I said to the Deputy, these people were detained originally under the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. They were subsequently charged and there is a difference in that step &mdash; they were subsequently charged.  They had either not applied for or had been refused bail &mdash; I do not know which is correct in that regard.  As the Deputy says, they have been in detention awaiting trial for a number of months.  That is not uncommon in many of the judicial systems around the world, including ours.  My ability to influence events is very marginal <Col N="1658" /> but I will see if anything can be done to speed it up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to help here.  Would the Minister not agree that the whole operation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act in Britain is on a par with what might be called institutional breaches of the rule of law we have seen in regard to the judicial and legal system in Northern Ireland?  Looking at the whole area &mdash; where there is a common pattern &mdash; would the Minister not agree that it represents, along with the breaches of the judicial and legal system in Northern Ireland, an area for discussion within the Inter-Governmental Conference, if that conference is really concerned about the basic trouble in Northern Ireland, which has spilled over into mainland Britain and which constitutes gross breaches of the rule of law by the governing authority both in Britain and Northern Ireland as far as Irish people are concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made my views on the Prevention of Terrorism Act quite clear in this House on a number of occasions. As I said, in my reply, I have made these views known to the British Government.  I do not think it is necessary for the setting up of the Anglo-Irish Conference for that to happen.  It has been happening not just under this Government but under previous Governments as well, and the views about this Act are made known each time its provisions come up for renewal.  But the difference in the case to which Deputy Gallagher was referring is the point I am trying to make, that even though these people were detained initially under the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, they have been charged under a different Act.  I think Deputy Lenihan, as a lawyer, will see the difference there.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he is aware of the threat made by Colonel Gadaffi on 16 January <Col N="1660" /> 1986, to train, arm and finance terrorists; and if he will make a statement on the steps which are being considered by the EC Ministers to counteract this threat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the reports to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>At their meeting in Brussels on 27 January 1986, the Foreign Ministers of the Twelve reaffirmed their determination to combat international terrorism.  They condemned such terrorism in all its forms: perpetrators, accomplices and instigators as well as Governments that support them.  They also condemned statements emanating from any quarter expressing support for terrorist attacks. They indicated their wish to co-operate with all States to deny terrorists support, cover or refuge.</P>
      <P>At their meeting, the Foreign Ministers also agreed to intensify their efforts to improve their own defences against terrorism and to discourage those who support it.  Specific areas of practical Twelve co-operation &mdash; including security at airports, controls at points of entry into the Community, visa policies &mdash; are identified in the declaration adopted by the Ministers, a copy of which I have made available to the Library of the Dáil. Ministers also established a special working body to monitor and give impetus to the implementation of these measures.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, in addition to restrictions they already apply, the Twelve, at the meeting on 27 January, decided not to export arms or other military equipment to countries which are clearly implicated in supporting terrorism.  They also decided to examine jointly, with special care, national measures designed to prevent the export of arms or other military equipment from being diverted for terrorist purposes.  The Foreign Ministers of the Twelve indicated, moreover, that they will do everything within their power to ensure that their nationals and industry do not seek any commercial advantage from measures taken by others in reaction to terrorist attacks and other terrorist activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also agreed to keep the problems of international terrorism <Col N="1661" /> under review and to take appropriate additional measures whenever the situation requires it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this matter is of particular concern to Ireland?  Is he aware of the statement made yesterday by Mr. Nial Millar, the marketing director of Bord Fáilte, to the effect that the American tourist trade to this country is substantially threatened as a result of terrorist attacks and threats on European airports?  Consequently, having regard to the extensive trade proposed between this country and Libya, would the Minister bring his influence to bear on the Libyan authorities, in the context of trade, to try to provide some restraint on these terrorist threats from that source?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There are about three different parts to that supplementary.  I am not aware of a statement having been made yesterday.  I am aware that there is concern being expressed in tourism circles, not alone in this country but in Europe as well, about the drop off in American tourists because of the concern felt by the American authorities and by individual citizens of America about terrorist attacks on airports before Christmas and the subsequent threat of terrorism in Europe.</P>
      <P>Terrorism is of grave concern to Ireland, no matter where it occurs in the world.  We have unreservedly condemned it and, indeed, we have had a lot of political and financial experience of trying to deal with the threat of terrorism on our own island.  We would not wish to see that problem raising its head in any other part of the world.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's reference to Libya, it is fair to say that the Libyan authorities have condemned all acts of terrorism, particularly the two terrorists' attacks on airports before Christmas.  We should accept the word of a Government with whom we have diplomatic relations if they say they had no involvement in those attacks.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will make a statement regarding the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan and on whether Ireland voted in favour of Resolution 39/13 on the United Nations General Assembly; and the steps the Government are taking, or have taken, to assist the Afghan people in obtaining their sovereignty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The war in Afghanistan is now in its seventh year.  It is proceeding with an intensity that has brought appalling suffering to the Afghan people, almost five million of whom have been forced to flee the country.  The report submitted by the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Mr. Felix Ermacora, to the current session of the Commission in Geneva on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan makes sombre reading. Mr. Ermacora also presented reports on this matter to last year's session of the Commission and to the UN General Assembly.  Ireland has taken an active role in the human rights aspect by co-sponsoring resolutions which dealt with abuses of human rights in Afghanistan adopted at the Commission and the General Assembly last year.  At the current session of the Commission in Geneva we are also co-sponsoring a similar resolution.</P>
      <P>On the political level since the invasion of Afghanistan Ireland has consistently supported resolutions on the situation in that country at the UN General Assembly including Resolution 39/13 adopted in 1984.  I take it that the Deputy is referring to that resolution.  We supported a similar resolution last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome and support the mediation efforts of the Secretary General's representative and believe that any solution must be based on the principles set out in successive UN resolutions.  These principles include the withdrawal of foreign troops, the right of the Afghan <Col N="1663" /> people to self-determination and the voluntary return in safety and honour of the refugees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that when the Minister says &ldquo;foreign troops&rdquo; he means the Soviet forces?  Will he confirm that? Have the EC Ministers discussed this matter recently, and, if so, what steps have they taken?  Has the Minister discussed the question of Soviet involvement in Afghanistan with the Soviet Ambassador to Ireland at any time or does he intend to raise the matter with the Ambassador with a view to expressing the Government's view, if that is the view, that Soviet troops should withdraw from Afghanistan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is the Government's view and one we supported when it was put forward by the ten and now the 12 Ministers of the European Community.  The Soviet Ambassador to Ireland is very well aware of the view of the Irish Government in this matter and of the views of the member states of the EC.  We wish to see the Afghan people being allowed to decide, without interference, how to run their own country.  We wish to see the refugees who had to flee their country being allowed to return home.  We wish to see the Soviet troops who have invaded Afghanistan being withdrawn as quickly as possible.  The European Ministers discussed Afghanistan frequently.  I cannot give the Deputy the precise date of when the matter was last discussed as an item on the agenda but I can get that information for him. The fact that the matter is not formally on an agenda does not mean that there is not great concern among European Ministers about what is happening in Afghanistan.  That concern has been reflected unanimously in the speeches delivered by the Twelve at the 40th session of the UN last autumn.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>At our meeting in The Hague on 25 February 1986 I, along with my ministerial colleagues of the Twelve, conveyed our congratulations to Mrs. Aquino who has assumed the heavy responsibility of the Presidency of the Philippines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1666" /> We welcomed the fact that President Marcos had decided to step down and were confident that this action would contribute to the restoration of democracy in the Philippines and the promotion of national reconciliation.</P>
    <P>Since that statement President Aquino has announced her new Government. President Hillery has sent her a message of congratulations, as has the Taoiseach to vice-President Laurel who is Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs in the new Government.  During a recent visit to Manila Ireland's Ambassador to the Philippines who is normally resident in Beijing met Mrs. Aquino with other Ambassadors of the Twelve before the collapse of the Marcos regime and again later when she had been proclaimed as President.  Now that the Philippines has opened a new chapter, I have no doubt we will continue to have good relations with President Aquino and her Government.</P>
    <P>We welcome the release of political prisoners by the new Government and the announcement of the full restoration of the right of <i>habeas corpus,</i> a right which in our view constitutes one of the simplest and most efficient means of preventing human rights abuses.</P>
    <P>In 1985 Irish exports to the Philippines were worth £4.7 million and imports were worth £9.2 million giving a balance in the Philippines favour of £4.5 million.  The Philippines is 54th on the list of Ireland's export markets according to value.  I hope that the present situation in the Philippines will lead to economic improvements which in turn will increase opportunities for our exporters.</P>

Will the Minister agree that, unless that is done, the situation in the Philippines might degenerate to what existed under President Marcos?

However, I have given instructions that the matter be raised with the new Government as soon as possible.</P>

We have had diplomatic relations with the Philippines for the last two years so we can raise these matters directly but we will also be asking our friends, the Canadians, Americans and Australians to help to try to establish Father Romano's whereabouts. We will seek to have him released if he is incarcerated and to have him reunited with his community.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that Ireland is one of the biggest suppliers of missionaries in the world, <i>pro rata,</i> would the Minister consider giving status to these inquiries by sending a special ambassador to the Philippines to ask the new Government there to locate the whereabouts of Father Romano in view of the concern which has been expressed by his Order.</P>

I assure the Deputy that the Ambassador, my Department and the EC are all concerned about Father Romano and will continue to seek a solution.</P>

      <P>This ties in with a supplementary which I asked on an earlier question. Does the Minister agree that this case, along with a number of others under the Marcos regime, represents a test of the bona fides of the new administration as to whether they intend to have regard for human rights and rule of law?  Does the Minister also agree that the case should be pursued on this basis because I should hate to think that it would be a case of <i>plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose</i>.  It is on the basis of coming clean on Father Romano that the new Government in the Philippines will be judged on their attitude to human rights.</P>

      <P>There is an implication in the Deputy's question which I would not care to accede to at this stage.  I am sure he does not mean what he implies but we are talking about a new Government who have come to power in extraordinary circumstances, after virtual dictatorship which lasted for 20 years. We should give that new Government every possible room for manoeuvre so that democracy in the Philippines is established genuinely and human rights respected.  We will be watching developments there not with a critical eye but with an encouraging eye.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

      <P>Would the Minister consider sending to the Philippines a special ambassador or a special representative from the Department, such as the Minister of State or an official to undertake an on-the-spot investigation?  I ask this because of the significance for Ireland of the development in that other country in the context of our being a supplier of missionaries.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I will give more serious thought to what the Deputy suggests than I would give normally to a question in the House.  However, the sending to the Philippines of a special ambassador, to use the Deputy's term, might be taken as a vote of no confidence in the existing ambassador who is an accredited representative of the Irish Government to the Government of the <Col N="1673" /> Philippines.  We should keep that factor in mind also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the total amount of money received by Ireland for overseas duties with the United Nations; the purpose for which these funds have been used; the amount of money presently owed to Ireland by the United Nations; the period on which this money is due; the reasons for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The total amount of money received from the United Nations, up to 31 December 1985, in reimbursement for costs incurred by Ireland in UN peacekeeping duties was £43,901,993.  These moneys are lodged to the Appropriation in Aid subhead of the Defence Vote and are not designated for any specific use: they are, of course, reimbursements for costs already incurred by the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>As of 31 December 1985 a total of £14,029,746 million was outstanding in payments owed to Ireland by the United Nations in respect of costs arising from peacekeeping operations.  Of this, £13,493,000 relates to our involvement with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, (UNIFIL), since May 1978.  I explained the background to the outstanding UNIFIL reimbursements in my answer to a Dáil question on this matter on 6 February.</P>
      <P>Of the remaining amount, £2,023 is still owing from our participation in the UN operation in the Congo between July 1960 and May 1964, and £534,723 in relation to our involvement with the United Nations Force in Cyprus which began in April 1964.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, unfortunately, very little chance that the money owed in relation to the Congo operation will ever be repaid. Certain countries withheld contributions designated for the support of the Congo <Col N="1674" /> operation and the UN was consequently unable to fully meet its obligations.</P>
    <P>As regards money outstanding in claims relating to UNFICYP, the prospects for repayment are also regrettably very poor.  That force is financed by voluntary contributions from member states which fall far short of the cost of maintaining the force.  The deficit in the UNFICYP account as of 30 September 1985, amounted to some £122.2 million in respect of the period ending 15 June 1985. It is unlikely that the money owed to Ireland from the UNFICYP fund can be paid while the fund continues to run a serious deficit.  Appeals for increased contributions by the Secretary General supported by troop contributors, including Ireland, have met with some response but a large deficit seems likely to remain.</P>
    <P>Ireland has consistently argued at the United Nations for a strong and assured financial basis for all peacekeeping operations. The responsibility for maintaining peace is one that is, under the Charter, shared collectively by the member states. It follows from this that financial responsibility for peacekeeping operations duly authorised under the provisions of the Charter should be shared equitably by the member states.  The system of financing established in relation to more recent peacekeeping operations such as UNIFIL seeks to reflect this principle of joint responsibility.  In practice, however, continued withholding of contributions by certain UN member countries has placed a disproportionate financial burden on other member states, particularly the troop contributors.  We have voiced our serious concerns in this matter at successive sessions of the UN General Assembly and have urged all member states to pay their contribution to UN peacekeeping operations.</P>

      <P>I agree Ireland is making a huge contribution to peacekeeping in the world.  This is one of the most positive aspects of our foreign policy, but it is very regrettable that member states of the UN, who share collectively the responsibility for peacekeeping, should not contribute collectively to the fund to finance that exercise.  On every occasion on which I have met the Secretary General, whether privately or as part of the group of peacekeeping contributing countries, I have impressed on him the necessity for having the fund properly established and for all members states to contribute to it.  Those of us who form part of the contributing countries have devised strategies by which we would hope to exert pressure on those who are not contributing, but the Deputy will understand that ours is a moral pressure and that we do not intend to pursue the matter further than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have assured the House on a number of occasions of my concern at the continuing practice of strip searching at Armagh Women's Prison.  I have raised this matter with the British authorities and am continuing to monitor closely any developments relating to this practice.</P>
      <P>During February 1986 a total of 29 strip searches were carried out on 18 prisoners. Eight prisoners were searched once, nine were searched twice and one was searched three times.  This compares with a total of 49 searches at Armagh Women's Prison during the month of January.</P>

Is the Minister aware also that details have been emerging recently regarding the strip searching of two women on remand in Brixton Prison and that this provides further evidence that strip searching is used for the purpose of punishment and to degrade and humiliate?</P>

      <P>I have no wish to comment on the statements of another politician in regard to a matter which is his responsibility, but I have said here before that strip searching is a degrading and humiliating practice.  However, as the Deputy will be aware, the offices of our party were occupied during the week by people protesting about strip searching in Armagh Women's Prison.  Perhaps not the individuals who occupied them but certainly some of their fellow travellers are associated with the Provisional IRA and I find it extremely cynical that an organisation who have no hesitation in taking a young man and his wife down an alleyway and shooting them, as they did recently, should now start protesting about strip searching.  We should not pay any attention to the voicing of concerns about strip searching from that quarter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think only five or six have been transferred.  The latest transfer involved a person from the Deputy's county and a previous transfer took place some years before.  There were four or five transfers in the mid-seventies.  My Department were particularly involved in the transfer of five prisoners, the last of whom was moved to Northern Ireland last September.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the main reason for desiring a transfer to a prison in Northern Ireland is to facilitate visits by friends and relatives? It is practically impossible to visit people imprisoned in England, especially when they are moved from prison to prison.  The authorities do not seem in all cases to advise these people.  The Minister is aware that on numerous occasions visitors have arrived at a prison only to find that the prisoner had been transferred some days earlier.  I can appreciate that there must be security precautions on that day but on the following day the Department of Foreign Affairs or the prisoner's family should be immediately <Col N="1682" /> advised.  Would the Minister pursue this point and comment upon it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in identifying the fact that for security reasons there is no indication given to relatives or the Embassy when a prisoner is to be moved from one prison to another.  These security considerations apply also in the case of the movement of a prisoner from Britain to Northern Ireland.  I very much appreciate the problems of people going to a prison in England and finding that a relative had been moved a short time previously.  Without interfering with the legitimate concerns of the authorities, I will see what can be done to stop wasted journeys by relatives.</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of the problem of high tariffs on whiskey imports into Japan.  In recent years the market share of the domestically distilled spirit Shochu has increased greatly.  At the same time imports of whiskey have fallen by approximately 20 per cent.  The Commission has queried the matter with the Japanese on many occasions and the entire question is currently under active study by the Community.  In co-operation with interested member states such as Ireland and a professional consulting service, the Commission has identified various factors of a regulatory nature that have worked to undermine the position of imported liquors on the Japanese market.  Some of the key factors are: The impact of import duties; the impact of the Japanese tax regime; issues relating <Col N="1683" /> to product information, labelling &mdash; particularly of domestic Japanese liquor &mdash; and distribution.</P>
      <P>It is of particular concern to us that the definition of whiskey in Japan should become much closer to the traditional distillers definition, which is that the spirit must be matured in wood for at least three years.  At present in Japan a spirit of any age can be termed as whiskey.</P>
      <P>Our representatives to the Community, as well as Irish Distillers and Córas Tráchtála, have actively pursued the Irish interest in this matter, and are continuing to do so.</P>
      <P>I myself took the opportunity to raise the matter with the Parliamentary ViceMinister for Foreign Affairs of Japan, Mr. Urano, when he visited Dublin in January this year and I made known to him our concerns.  Our Embassy in Tokyo has also briefed the Japanese on our concerns in the matter.</P>

      <P>Defence matters as such do not fall within the scope of European political co-operation.  Discussion of <Col N="1684" /> security questions within European political co-operation is clearly confined to the political and economic aspects of security.  The provisions on European co-operation in the sphere of foreign policy, which were recently agreed in the context of the Single European Act, formalise the existing practice in this regard and confine the scope of security discussions within European political co-operation to the political and economic aspects of security only.</P>

      <P>We must await a debate in the House on it.  Clause 6 (a) purports to limit co-ordination of security to political and economic aspects but it does not exclude discussions on military aspects. Would the Minister agree that the nonexclusion of military aspects leaves scope for Ireland being involved in discussions of a military nature outside of what has heretofore been regarded as security in the economic and political sense?  Would the Minister not agree that this non-exclusion leaves it open to other countries to take that interpretation?  Furthermore will the Minister support or reject the statement which has come to our notice that at the last Council meeting military matters were discussed by some of the powers at such a meeting of political co-operation.</P>

      <P>A Deputy with as much experience as Deputy Lenihan should continue his observations on article 6 (a) to include paragraphs (b) and (c) as well.  Article 6 (a) is not the only part of it.  Article 6 (c) says that, recognising the fact that the military aspects of security do not come within the scope of new arrangements for EPC, those partners who wish to co-operate more closely on security matters, that is on military and defence questions, may do so within NATO and the Western European <Col N="1685" /> Union, organisations to which Ireland does not belong.</P>

      <P>It is quite clear if one reads article 6 (a), (b) and (c) that there is a clear distinction between political and economic security matters and defence matters.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any exclusion of those military matters being discussed by these countries at meetings of European Political Co-operation?  Our information is that military matters are discussed by these countries at these meetings.  That opens the door to a dangerous situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct. Deputy Lenihan, of all Deputies in this House, knows better than anyone else, because he was the first Minister for Foreign Affairs to go to an EPC meeting in Europe, that the arrangements have been quite clear during our negotiations for entry, during the Accession Treaty negotiations, and during debates in this House prior to entry, and that military and defence matters were not within the remit of European Political Co-operation.  That has not changed in the intervening years. During that period, as Deputy Lenihan will know, other Foreign Ministers, forgetting which meeting they were at, have strayed into the area of discussing defences, strategic defence weapons and that sort of thing.  That has happened on three or four occasions when I was present.  I am sure it happened when Deputy Lenihan was Minister for Foreign Affairs.  That is what happened on 27 January last or whatever date it was.  I drew the attention of my colleagues to the fact that it was an inappropriate discusion for a European Political Co-operation meeting and that, if they wished to pursue it, they should discuss it in NATO or <Col N="1686" /> at the Western European Union.  They accepted that, apologised and were ready to transfer the discussion elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I can appreciate the Minister not being willing to discuss details in the House about what happened at Intergovernmental Conference meetings, but surely in broad principle the Minister could indicate whether matters of this kind were discussed, because otherwise the Intergovernmental Conference is a meaningless institution.  Matters of grave import, such as the attitude of the security forces in the Six Counties during the recent demonstrations, and matters, such as the Cookstown incident where a UDR patrol shot at two citizens for no reason, should be dealt with in the Conference.  Unless the Conference deals with that sort of problem it is a meaningless institution.  It is in the area of getting respect for the rule of law that the primary task of the Intergovernmental Confernece lies.  Would the Minister go so far as to say that he would regard it as a matter of paramount importance for the Conference to ensure that there is respect for the rule of law and the handling by the security forces of law and order in Northern Ireland?  That is a fundamental consideration within the ambit of this Conference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will state any reservations, derogations or qualifying statements that were attached by the existing signatory states to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism; which of these countries refuse to extradite their own nationals for any reason whatever; and which countries have signed but not ratified the convention and the dates of their signatures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The signatory States to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism are France, Greece and Ireland.  Signatory States are those which have signed but not ratified the convention.  At the time of signature France made a declaration stating, <i>inter alia,</i> that it would make reservations on ratification to ensure that efficiency in the struggle against terrorism would be reconciled with respect for the fundamental principles of French criminal law and the French Constitution.  Greece and Ireland did not make declarations or reservations at the time of signature.</P>
      <P>The Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism was signed by France and Greece on 27 January 1977; Ireland signed on 24 February 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume that the Deputy's question extends in fact to contracting States as well as signatory States.  In this context the following are the contracting States: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, FRG, Iceland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Lux-embourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the UK.  I am making the texts of the reservations made on ratification available separately to the Deputy <Col N="1689" /> in tabular form.  It will be noted that Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, FRG, Iceland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland made reservations the majority of which relate to article 13 of the convention.  That article provides that any State may, at the time of signature or when depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval, declare that it reserves the right to refuse extradition in respect of any offence mentioned in article 1 which it considers to be a political offence, an offence connected with a political offence or an offence inspired by political motives, provided that it undertakes to take into due consideration, when evaluating the character of the offence, any particularly serious aspects of the offence, including:</P>
    <P>(a)  that it created a collective danger to the life, physical integrity or liberty of persons; or</P>
    <P>(b)  that it affected persons foreign to the motives behind it; or</P>
    <P>(c)  that cruel or vicious means have been used in the commission of the offence.</P>
    <P>The tabular statement also contains the full text of the statement made by France at the time of signature.</P>
    <P>The question of extradition of own nationals is governed by the 1957 European Convention on Extradition concluded under the auspices of the Council of Europe to which Ireland is a contracting party.  The convention coincides with our policy relating to extradition and our legislation closely follows its provisions which reflect the general international law on the issue.  In relation to the extradition of nationals the convention allows contracting parties the right to refuse extradition of their nationals.  Several constitutional provisions of national legislation from extraditing their own national.  However, such a party is obliged, if requested, to submit the case, in the words of the convention, &ldquo;to its <Col N="1690" /> competent authorities in order that proceedings may be taken if they are considered appropriate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It would require some time to ascertain the precise details of present law in each of the 17 States which are party to the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, as well as France and Greece which have signed but not yet ratified it, but my understanding is that the FRG, Greece, Cyprus, Switzerland, Belgium and France do not extradite their own nationals.  Irish law reflects the provisions of the 1957 European Convention on Extradition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to establish in regard to this is that it is quite clear that under Article 6 of the Convention the State, in this case the Republic of Ireland, has the option to try one of its citizens in its own jurisdiction rather than extradite.  Would the Minister answer clearly and definitively that that clear option will reside here with the State?</P>

I do not think such a reply would have any standing.  As a lay person, my belief is that what the Deputy has said is correct but I would not regard that as being the final word on this matter. People with far greater authority will be the interpreters of the convention.  It is the courts who will decide that, but this House, including the Minister for Justice, will have a say in it.</P>

As a matter of public policy, the option to try within our own jurisdiction is the option that clearly should be exercised by the Government, the DPP, the Garda authorities and the courts here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like first of all to give the House a brief account of the sequence of events at Arbour Hill Prison yesterday.</P>
      <P>At about 11.40 a.m. 24 prisoners from the segregation unit set up at the prison to accommodate offenders identified as having AIDS antibodies, attempted to escape from the prison.  The prisoners first barricaded the entrance to the prison's East Wing to prevent access by staff and then broke through the ceiling to the roof.  They made their way from there to the roof of the adjoining garrison chapel.</P>
      <P>Six of the prisoners jumped from the roof to the chapel grounds.  Two of these suffered leg injuries which rendered them immobile and a third was recaptured by gardaí who by that time had arrived at the prison in response to an alarm call. The other three prisoners made good their escape.</P>
      <P>The remaining prisoners started to throw slates from the chapel roof at gardaí and prison staff.  During the course of this, one member of the prison staff was injured by a slate thrown by a prisoner. Six offenders sustained injuries requiring hospital treatment during the incident yesterday.</P>
      <P>While some damage was done to the roof of the chapel, damage caused to the prison itself was minimal.  I am awaiting a detailed report from the Governor on the incidents and the Garda are searching for the escapees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House has previously been informed of the background to the use of part of Arbour Hill prison to segregate offenders with AIDS antibodies.  The decision to segregate offenders in this category was taken principally for two reasons, first, to deal with the problem of unease among the general prison population and, second, to enable the restrictions and precautions which medical <Col N="1693" /> advice indicates are desirable to be applied easily.</P>
    <P>During their protest yesterday afternoon the prisoners complained about a lack of education and work facilities.  As regards education facilities, the situation is that the requirements of offenders in the unit have been udner assessment recently by teachers at the prison so as to establish the education levels of the offenders.  This was necessary so as to determine the type of classes appropriate to their needs.  Two rooms had been set aside for education for this group of offenders and classes were due to start this week.</P>
    <P>The provision of work facilities, however, poses a particular problem because it would be unwise to allow offenders with AIDS antibodies access to equipment and machinery which could cause cuts and consequent spillages of blood.</P>
    <P>Attempts have been made to introduce work, some of it of a purely therapeutic kind, which would not involve, or would at least reduce to a minimum, this danger, but the prisoners did not show sufficient interest in the types of work which were made available.  A further attempt is to be made shortly with the introduction of wood polishing and I hope that this will be successful.  But again, of course, the prison authorities have, for obvious reasons, to be careful in allowing the use of various substances. It is unfortunately the case that there are severe limitations to the type of work which can be introduced in view of the difficulty I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I should mention also that instruction in physical education is available and used externsively by the prisoners.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that the presence of a substantial group of offenders, all of whom had drug problems and who now have to cope with the knowledge that they have AIDS antibodies, clearly causes difficulties for the prison service and these are of a kind which did not previously have to be contended with.  I am sure the House will acknowledge the difficulties posed for prison staff and management and their efforts, on behalf <Col N="1694" /> of society, to cope with them as effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>The wing at Arbour Hill was chosen to accommodate these offenders because the prison itself is modern and has good facilities.  The regime being operated there was intended to be as humane as possible in the difficult circumstances which applied and every effort will continue to be made to provide the widest possible range of facilities for offenders there.  It will be clear, however, from yesterday's events that the requirements of safety and good order will have to be a special consideration in developments at the wing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that two rooms have been set aside for educational facilities starting next week.  I am sure he is aware of the complaints made by the protesting prisoners, some of which seem to be based on reasonable grounds specifically with regard to the inadequacy of the educational facilities and the opportunity to work now being provided for these prisoners and also the inadequacy of medical care.  Would he care to comment on the aspect of the inadequacy of medical care?  An advertisement has been placed, I understand, for a general medical director.  I note that the Minister is planning to maintain the policy of segregation. He made that very clear.  Does he think this a necessary or wise policy in the circumstances?  Does he have available to him medical advice which might help him to sort out this problem, since there is no medical director?  I understand that in other prisons there is not segregation, certainly not to the same degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the availability of work opportunities, I dealt with that quite fully, I thought, in my answer. I fully appreciate the difficulty which is there among a group of people who are in any case in a stressful situation and who would need an occupation, not purely for the therapeutic effects of it by largely for that reason.  As I pointed out, there are restrictions on the kinds of work activities which are appropriate.  We must ensure, and Deputy Woods would agree with <Col N="1695" /> this, that we avoid situations in which the possibility of infection or of the spread of infection could come about.</P>
      <P>As far as the educational facilities are concerned, I am aware that there have been complaints about what were regarded as inadequate facilities in Arbour Hill.  The difficulty goes back to the time when we had to make space available for the group of prisoners about whom I am talking.  It was inevitable that that would interrupt or curtail some of the other facilities available in the prison.  I am very concerned to make sure that we restore the educational facilities as quickly as possible.  As I pointed out we have set aside two rooms for educational activities for this group of prisoners.  They have been in the course of being assessed during last week in order to identify what kinds of classes would be most appropriate for them.  We were moving to deal with that area of activity, to define the needs and to meet them in so far as we could.</P>
      <P>I am not sure what Deputy Woods has in mind when he refers to what he calls the inadequacy of medical treatment. There is no inadequacy in the medical treatment of those who have been identified as being antibody positive in relation to AIDS.  On medical advice we are taking the steps that are open to us to take in that regard.  None of the medical advice that I have seen or heard about is presented as being definitive, but we are doing what we can within the context and along the lines of the advice that has been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, Deputy Woods raised the question as to whether segregation is necessary or wise and if there is medical advice to that effect.  Given what is known about AIDS antibody positive prisoners &mdash; and I must emphasise that we are talking about people who are antibody positive; we are not talking about AIDS sufferers &mdash; our advice includes a strong recommendation that antibody positive people should be segregated from the rest of the offenders and we moved them to Arbour Hill.  We had better and more modern facilities there <Col N="1696" /> to look after those people.  This is based on advice; it is not simply a &ldquo;top of the head&rdquo; decision.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that when prisoners have completed their sentences they will return into the community and they will certainly not be segregated there?  I appreciate that that is a completely separate question.  Could I ask the Minister to look again fairly deeply at the degree of segregation and at the whole medical approach at this stage and see if the decisions taken earlier were, with hindsight, the wisest ones? Would he see if the problem cannot be handled otherwise than with the degree of segregation which was introduced?  As the Minister knows, we are all advised that it is only through blood or sexual relationships that the transfers can occur. That would seem to limit such cases.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister is fresh to this post.  There was no trouble previously in Arbour Hill and it could have been regarded as a model prison.  Since there have been long term prisoners there it has had a very good record.  What has happened to bring about such a radical change?</P>

      <P>The question of looking again in depth at the decision to provide separate facilities for these prisoners does not arise.  The matter is kept under continuous review.  It is constantly the subject of medical advice.  It is not as if we just turn off our consideration of this problem at 5 o'clock in the evening and do not look at it again for another week.

As to the previous good history of Arbour Hill, that is the case.  The difficulty arises because we now have in Arbour Hill, as I said earlier, a group of prisoners who are in a more stressful condition than prisoners generally.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make one or two comments arising from discussions which we had on Committee Stage and from the remarks made by Deputy Hyland a few moments ago. When we were discussing Committee Stage, Deputy Mervyn Taylor raised the point in relation to section 1 of the Bill, that is subsection (6) of the new section 15 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926.  Deputy Taylor's point was that the certificate required under subsection (6) as the amount of the debt still outstanding at the date of the certificate, does not constitute sworn evidence of the amount that is due and it was important that the Bill should require the creditor or his witness to give sworn evidence in this matter.  I have considered that point <Col N="1736" /> but decided not to put down an amendment. Briefly I would like to say why.</P>
      <P>Subsection (6) proposes that at the examination of the debtor pursuant to a summons the creditor will be required, among other things, to produce evidence of the original debt that is due in accordance with the relevant court decree and the certificate as to the amount of the debt still outstanding.  This certificate would be in a form required by the Rules of Court.  Under section 15 as it stands this evidence is given at the preliminary hearing.  That preliminary hearing is now being dispensed with and instead new proceedings are being initiated on the basis of a statutory declaration as covered in the new subsection (2).  The change that is proposed in subsection (6) makes it clear that the evidence of the debt that is due and that is already required under section 15 as it stands has or may have two components, the amount of the original sum for which a decree was granted and the amount that is currently outstanding after taking account of any repayments already made by the debtor of any interest and of any interest due.  The change will enable that net amount that is owing to be stated clearly and concisely by being set out in a certificate the form of which will fall to be settled by the Rules of Court.  This is designed to simplify and to speed up matters for both parties concerned and for the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are talking about in subsection (6) is evidence to satisfy the court that the debt exists.  That evidence would normally be the court order, or a copy of the court order if the original is not available.  However, if by the date of the hearing there is any change in the amount then due the creditor simply completes the certificate in a settled form.  There is nothing in the Bill which says that the certificate is conclusive evidence and the debtor is not precluded in any way from challenging it.  The result is that the evidence furnished by the certificate, the form of which as I have said will be settled by the Rules of Court, would be open to be contested.  Therefore the district justice is not precluded from exercising his judgment in respect of the matter.  I <Col N="1737" /> am satisfied that the provision as proposed, which is being recommended by the Rules Committee will be operable and will maintain a fair balance as between the rights of the creditor and the debtor.</P>
    <P>During Committee Stage last week I undertook to give further consideration to publicising the date of the annual licensing sessions in the newspapers.  In the past, this has not been necessary as a rule.  The annual licensing sessions are held at the same time each year and accordingly anyone who has an interest in them, for example licenses, Garda superintendents or members of the public, know about them well in advance. Under the new arrangements the annual licensing sessions will continue to be held every year at the same time as they are held at present, that is at the end of September.  Under the old system, as we discussed on Committee Stage, objection to the renewal of a licence could be made on the day of the court without any prior notice being given.  This power of objecting without prior notice was very little used in practice but it was capable of being abused.  I propose that it now be abolished.  Objecting without notice is clearly unfair to the licenses and disrupts the work of the court.</P>
    <P>It is likely that for the first four years after this Bill becomes law the placing of advertisements in the newspapers before the latest date for lodging objections would serve as a useful reminder not only for those who feel that they have genuine grounds for objecting but also for licensees who would thereby be reminded of the new arrangements.  Accordingly, I am prepared to have suitable advertisements placed in newspapers for a few years at least after the new renewal procedures come into force so as to help everybody concerned during the period in which they will be familiarising themselves with the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods inquired as to whether the saving of time from the introduction of the new procedures had been quantified. If I remember correctly he got himself into a bit of a wax about the lack of quantification.  As I said, I did not <Col N="1738" /> consider it necessary to attempt to arrive at a precise quantification but I am satisfied nevertheless that the saving in time for individual court clerks will be substantial. The vast majority of licence renewals go through at present without objection but a considerable amount of time has to be spent in sending out the requisite forms in every case, in assisting the licensees or their representatives in filling out the forms, checking the completed forms and getting them in order for the annual licensing sessions.  It is clear that under present rules a considerable amount of time is spent on this administrative work. It would be unrealistic, unjustified and would amount to a disproportionate expenditure of time and money to try to arrive at a more precise estimation of the savings in time that would be achieved by the measures contained in the Bill.  I am, however, satisfied that there will be substantial saving in time for the District Court clerks.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, Deputies opposite, including in particular Deputy Hyland, were concerned by what they seemed to believe was a dilution of local control over the issue of intoxicating liquor licences.  I can assure the House that that is not the case.  In all important respects the procedure for renewing the licences remains as it is at present, the only substantial change being that in the majority of cases a court certificate will not be required where no objection has been raised.  The licensing sessions will be held as before in the District Courts. The power of objection, including objection by the Garda, will remain.  All objections will be heard at local level as they are at present.</P>
    <P>As to the details of the new procedure, the position will be that the person wishing to renew his liquor licence will apply directly to the Revenue Commissioners and they will issue the renewal licence in accordance with their own procedures. Anyone wishing to object to the renewal may do so by serving a notice of intention to object on the licensee at least 21 days before the date of the annual licensing court and must send a copy with a statutory <Col N="1739" /> declaration of service to the District Court clerk 14 days before the sitting. The District Court clerk will then send a notice of the objection to the Revenue Commissioners, and, where the objector is not a member of the Garda Síochána, he will also send a copy of the notice of objection to the Garda superintendent for the area.  After the annual licensing session the District Court clerk will send a certified copy of the court order to the Revenue Commissioners.  Where an appeal has been lodged against the order, he will also send a notice to that effect to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with most of the points raised on Committee Stage to which I said I would give some further attention, apart from one further point which does not really arise on this Bill, but Deputy Hyland mentioned it, and I want to assure him that it is not being lost sight of.  Deputy Hyland asked me to give some serious thought to the abuse occasioned through the purchase of wine from supermarkets by young people.  As I explained on Committee Stage, I am very concerned about the extent of alcohol abuse particularly by young people. The preparation of proposals to help curb under age drinking is being proceeded with in my Department and will be the subject of a separate set of proposals which I hope to bring before the House in the not too distant future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that, having reached Report Stage and despite a number of amendments tabled by me on Committee Stage, the Bill remains substantially unchanged.  The Government, and the Minister's predecessor&mdash; the present holder of the office is new to his present portfolio&mdash;missed an opportunity to bring about worthwhile and much needed reform in the District Court system.  This Bill has done very little in this regard, with the welcome exception of making provision for the introduction of the new District Court rules which are long overdue.  I compliment both Ministers on their efforts to bring in this very necessary procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1740" /> In my opinion the introduction of the new rules would have provided an ideal opportunity for the reform of the District Court system to make it more meaningful and more relevant to the people.  On reflection, and having participated in the debate on all Stages, I consider that the provisions in this Bill do nothing in the area of general court reform.  In some instances the provisions in this Bill add further complications to legislation which is already confusing many citizens.  I am sure the Minister will agree that this Bill does nothing to streamline the operations of the District Court as it affects the renewal of intoxicating liquor licences and other provisions.  As I said in my earlier contributions, it took no more than an hour of the courts' time annually to renew the licences in the various District Court areas.  From that point of view there is no real benefit in terms of court efficiency under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to acknowledge the Minister's commitment to the renewal of intoxicating liquor licences.  He indicated that in the short term a public notice will be inserted annually for the purpose of notifying the public of the opportunity and the time for renewal of licences.  I acknowledge that gesture and I thank the Minister for it.  I appreciate the sincerity of his gesture in response to my request on the last occasion that something be done about the almost free availability of wine in supermarkets in so far as this affects teenage drinkers.  I accept fully the Minister's sincerity in this area.  This concern is shared by many Members of this House and we should try to curb and control the menace of alcoholism.  This is not an area for political point scoring. The Minister can be assured of the full support of all Members on this side of the House.  I appeal to him to move as hastily as he can along that road and to bring in this much needed legislation.</P>
    <P>I said I was disappointed that, despite a number of amendments which I genuinely believed would have improved the provisions of the Bill, the Bill remains substantially the same as introduced by the Minister's predecessor.  I might refer briefly to section 2, which discriminates <Col N="1741" /> against and places at a disadvantage a private citizen who through no fault of his or hers has fallen on hard times and who is unable to meet his or her financial commitments.  In many instances these will have been family commitments &mdash; the commitment, say, of a father who became unemployed and who had no means with which to pay the court fines referred to in that section.  This Bill and the law generally requires that in such cases an individual surrenders himself to the custody of the State for a period of imprisonment.  That period of imprisonment is specified in this section where, in relation to fines not exceeding £50, the person in default of a payment would have to spend five days in prison.  In future legislation the Minister might take a serious look at the need for reform in this area.  I would ask him to do so with a view to amending this provision as soon as possible, giving the district justice the discretion of applying other sanctions or of deferring payments until family circumstances change.  This provision is somewhat regressive in what we would like to regard as being modern legislation. At a time when we have spoken so much about the need for general law reform and administration, it is regrettable that the only sanctions referred to in this Bill are those of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The Minister will recall that I and my colleague, Deputy Woods, spent many hours in this House endeavouring to impose on the Minister's predecessor the importance of devising or of finding alternative forms of sanction than the overcrowded and unsatisfactory system which operates in terms of imprisonment at present as constituting the ultimate sanction in respect of some of these offences.  I might cite the example of the community services order.  In regard to the first requirement of fines not exceeding £50, where a defaulter would have to spend five days in prison, surely a better and more credible alternative would be that a justice would have flexibility under legislation to impose some other form of sanction &mdash; for example, to be able to use a community services order.  It is a great pity that in the upgrading of legislation <Col N="1742" /> in this area we find ourselves so rigidly attached to the oldest sanction known and available to us, that of imprisonment. I submit that in many cases the sanction of imprisonment and its effects on the family unit far outweigh the seriousness of the offence in the first instance.  I would contend that, where the breadwinner must spend five days, or even one or two days, in prison as a result of not meeting a court fine of £50, the damage done not only to the individual himself but to the members of his family far outweighs the extent of the charge or crime in the first instance.  When discussing any law reform Bill in this House surely we should be genuinely interested in upgrading the law in that area for the purpose of finding sanctions other than imprisonment.</P>
    <P>In contrast with the structures and rigidity of the law in relation to the individual, as we are discussing them here, it is interesting to note that the provisions of this Bill are more flexible, and certainly less severe in their sanctions, in relation to corporate bodies.  It is regrettable that we treat the individual to one set of sanctions while applying another set, less severe and rigid, to corporate bodies.  We accept that there are many genuine cases on financial grounds for dealing in a considerate manner with corporate bodies. However, we are all aware of the increasing number of cases in which such bodies have tended to be organised and used for deliberate evasion of the law.  We are aware that some of the individuals involved, with assistance provided under various legislative headings approved in this House from time to time, find loopholes, deliberately flicking their fingers at this House and at law enforcement generally.  I contend that such anomalies in legislation, as in this Bill, tend to undermine the confidence of the ordinary citizen in legislation.</P>
    <P>Why should we be more strict on the individual and less strict on corporate bodies who use the structure of the corporation to evade their legal responsibilities in relation to matters of this nature? While it cannot be dealt with under the provisions of the Bill before us, it is an area worthy of examination.  Night after <Col N="1743" /> night there are glaring examples on our television screens of people who tout and utilise the law to their advantage and get away scot free, where some poor unfortunate unable to pay a fine of £50 finds himself locked up in Mountjoy for five days.  That is unsatisfactory and does not constitute a fair and balanced administration of the law.</P>
    <P>There was scope under the provisions of this Bill to make use of community service orders as an alternative to imprisonment.  I made the point on Second Stage that perhaps the Minister should have considered introducing a small claims court, some procedure whereby small claims could be processed with the minimum of expense, thereby reducing the burden on the District Court system.  It is a source of regret to me that we were not sufficiently progressive in outlook and that the Minister did not find it possible in relation to this matter, which has a direct bearing on families and individuals and which contributes to overburdening our District Courts, to devise a way of dealing with such small claims. Another point I might make in relation to small claims generally is that the cost to the individual of having to go into the court adds another tier, if you like, to his indebtedness.  I would hope we would be able to devise a means in future legislation whereby small claims could be dealt with outside of the court system as it operates at present.  I realise that, with the indulgence of the Chair, I have perhaps deviated somewhat from the exact contents of the Bill before us.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with section 4.  I have already acknowledged the Minister's sincerity and generosity in meeting our views in regard to that section.  I am anxious that the strongest possible control should exist in regard to the availability and sale of alcohol.  However, the success of our efforts requires the goodwill and support of those involved in the licensed trade.  It is true of every Bill debated in the House that a level of goodwill on the part of those affected by the legislation is required if it is to be successful.  In regard to this area it is <Col N="1744" /> important that we get those involved in the licensed trade to share our concern about the abuse and misuse of alcohol. They are important from that point of view.  The vast majority of licensed vintners conduct their business in a credible and professional manner and are anxious to see the law upheld, just as we are, in this crucial and delicate area.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations about the effectiveness of the endorsement of vintners licences as a means of dealing with breaches of the licensing laws.  The Minister, when preparing the new legislation he has promised, should consider more effective sanctions such as the imposition of substantial fines.  A district justice should at least be given flexibility under the new legislation to endorse a licence, apply a substantial fine in relation to a breach of the licensing laws by a publican or an endorsement and a fine. We do not want to be seen as anti-vintners because they are an important element in our commercial life and the majority of them do an extremely credible job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>However, to some extent we are a bit hypocritical in our attitude to the sale of alcohol.  We announce annually that we expect the Exchequer to take in substantial amounts in tax by increasing the price of a pint or a half one.  In that regard the State is to some extent living on immoral earnings.  In the long term we are losing more than we are gaining.  We have the direct short term benefit of the revenue generated as a result of decisions by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>And the direct short term benefit of the half one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>As against that increase in revenue we have the total loss to the State by a reduction in the level of industrial output, a loss in work days and an increase in the cost of health care not to talk about the many family problems that <Col N="1745" /> result from an abuse of alcohol.  The sooner the Minister legislates to reduce the abuses and protect citizens the better. That would be the first step along the road.</P>
      <P>It is extremely difficult, because of the climate in which we live, for vintners to be always up to the mark in regard to complying with the licensing laws.  It is difficult at closing time for a vintner to be able to close his house instantly because he will always have to deal with aggressive people, those who do not want to leave and those who may be difficult. The view expressed by the vintners is worthy of consideration.  They have suggested that the sanction in relation to endorsement is too severe from their point of view and does not do anything to achieve what the Minister and Members want to achieve in terms of controlling the sale of alcohol.  It would be better if a district justice was given flexibility when dealing with breaches of the licensing laws.  He should have the power to impose a substantial fine if he considers it is warranted, and, in serious cases, to record an endorsement and impose a fine. We should not legislate against such commercial enterprises.</P>
      <P>Our main objective should be to legislate for the proper sale of alcohol.  That can be done by bringing our legislation up to date.  I accept the Minister's assurances but I regret that the Bill before us does not do that.  It is only fair to record that the Bill did not set out to do that but I urge the Minister to introduce a new Bill as quickly as possible to cover the areas I mentioned.  I should like to express my concern at the abuse of alcohol and the fact that it is available to school children. That should be a cause of major concern to us all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to address myself to section 1 which deals with the Enforcement of Court Orders Act and the amendments to that procedure.  This enforcement of court orders procedure, the last vestige still outstanding of the old Victorian imprisonment for debt system, should be scrapped and done away with altogether.  In the old days under the Victorian <Col N="1746" /> procedure people were put into prison for debt until the money was paid. That has been carried on in attenuated form to the present day under the enforcement procedure I have outlined.  In this day and age people can find themselves in prison for not paying a civil debt.  I am not talking about fines but about civil debts, hire purchase debts or whatever. It is not as though there is not already an adequate armoury in the hands of creditors, hire purchase companies, banks and so on to recover the moneys due to them.  They have many and varied remedies apart from putting people in prison for civil debt.  They can and do send in the Sheriff to seize the person's goods.  They can apply for a judgment in regard to mortgages if they have a house and there are all sorts of charging orders and other procedures available.</P>
      <P>I would regard it as acceptable in a modern system of law enforcement that there could be a simple procedure whereby a debtor in employment and in receipt of weekly or monthly wages could have a court order directed to his employers to pay a fixed weekly or monthly sum of an appropriate amount directly to the creditor.  That would be reasonably acceptable as long as the person was in employment but, where the person is unemployed or in receipt of social welfare benefits, that procedure should not apply.  The Minister should look at this in a broad, historical context.  One thinks of the pressures on prisons at present and we hear reports of criminals convicted of quite serious crimes having to be released from prison because there is no room for them.  It is rather strange that prison space should be taken up by people who have committed no crime and who have merely not paid a civil debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister introduced an amendment under the Enforcement of Court Orders Act and its thrust is to make the position easier for creditors.  It seems to be based to a large extent on recommendations made possibly by the officials of the Department and the District Court Rules Committee.  I have no doubt that the District Court Rules Committee are a fine body of men and women but, if <Col N="1747" /> the Minister went along to any District Court, he would see that people are brought up for examination as to their means with a view to having instalment order and, subsequently orders made against them and he would find that all the crditors are represented by solicitors. However, seldom if ever does a debtor appear in court represented by a solicitor. It is a rarity.  Obviously, any debtor in that position has had the Sheriff out to his house but he got nothing.  He will not be very flush with money and, if he cannot afford to pay the debt, he is hardly likely to be able to afford a solicitor.</P>
    <P>Most, though not all, solicitors will not act unless they get a fee.  There is no free legal aid available for assistance in this kind of case and the Minister should look at this aspect.  Debtors are not represented by solicitors and, therefore, it follows that that element of the District Court Rules Committee who are made up of solicitors, as a certain proportion is, will be either solicitors who do not represent debtors or creditors or solicitors who represent creditors.  I am not saying that they did not approach the matter objectively.  I am sure they did, but the reality is that the amendment increases the pressure on the debtor in a number of respects, which is regrettable. I would have thought there were some aspects of the procedure which would have warranted an improvement from the point of view of the debtor.</P>
    <P>The Minister responded to the point about the acceptance of a certificate giving the final balance as of the date of the examination order hearing and I listened carefully to what he said.  I appreciate the point he made but I am not happy about it because it does not adequately meet the situation.  The certificate would be produced, according to this amendment, when the examination order hearing takes place and would be handed in by the creditor's solicitor.  Of course, the Minister was correct when he said it is not conclusive and that the debtor could give evidence if the amount was wrong and so on.  That is true but it does not have reality for a number of <Col N="1748" /> reasons.  The debtor does not know what the certificate says or what final balance figure will appear on the certificate.  He may not hear anything at all as, normally, he is at the back of a crowded courtroom and does not know what is happening. Even if he does hear it, he does not know in advance what the figure will be and he has no opportunity of checking it.</P>
    <P>The judgment in the original court debt could have been given a year before these events, may be even longer.  There is a provision for six and 12 year periods here so it could have been over a year since the original hearing.  There are all sorts of complications in so far as the balance of the debt is concerned.  The debtor may pay £5 here, send in a postal order for £4 there and, in the meantime, costs are being added on to the bill.  It is a jungle and if you were to ask debtors, particularly in hire purchase cases, how much they owe, with the best will in the world, they could not tell you.  They do not keep records.  When they get a few pounds together they send them off.</P>
    <P>Where the debtor is required to send in his statement of means showing his asset, liabilities and income and so on, he is required to send it in well in advance according to section 1 (4) which states:</P>
    <P>The statement of means shall, not less than one week before the sitting of the District Court at which the examination is to take place...</P>
    <P>It does not say that the creditor has to send in his view of the final balanced debt so that the unfortunate debtor could check it and go through whatever receipts he might have.  Why is the debtor obliged to send in information a week in advance?  It is to enable the creditor to go through it with a fine tooth comb, to prepare and to have all arrangements made to cross-examine the debtor as to the accuracy of what the debtor is putting forward.  What is the position of the debtor?  The creditor comes into court when the case is called, hands in a written certificate, not even a sworn statement, saying that the balance due is £628.24. To expect a debtor to be able to rebut <Col N="1749" /> that with that kind of notice is just not on.</P>
    <P>The point we were trying to make on Committee Stage about the sworn statement was that at least it would give a degree of seriousness, of formality, to the situation from the point of view of the creditor.  There is much less seriousness when all that is done is when the secretary or someone from the creditor firm produces a form with such wording as &ldquo;I hereby certify that the balance due is £624.&rdquo; Human nature being what it is, one would be inclined not to take that too formally, or at least not to regard it with anything like as much care or as necessitating such research as would be required if one had to take the oath in open court and swear to a certain figure or even, not going that far, handing in a sworn affidavit or a statutory declaration.  Even that would apply the mind of the creditor firm to the issue and we are taking of a very important issue from the point of view of the debtor.</P>
    <P>For the most part what is involved in these kinds of proceedings is not one single case but bulk cases.  For instance, there might be the case of a hire purchase company who had 70 to 80 cases for hearing on one day or at every court sitting. In that kind of wholesale procedure there is not the individual care that would apply in the case of the single case perhaps. The unfortunate debtor is caught up, in that kind of situation.  We are talking in this context about people who are at the wrong end of society.  In fairness to the district justices, they have always practised a kind of unofficial rule whereby if a debtor appears in court where one of these matters is being dealt with and says he is unemployed or is on social welfare and produces his unemployment card, no order will be made for any weekly payment.  The district justices are to be applauded for taking that line.  The problem is that many people who are unemployed and many who are in receipt of social welfare assistance are not aware of that practice and very often for that reason omit going to the court to point out those circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1750" /> Such people consider their cases to be hopeless.  They do not go to court but find that an order is made against them for a sum which they could not possibly pay.  Subsequently when the order is found not to be honoured an order is made for imprisonment though the sole offence on the part of the debtor would be ignorance, not knowing that if he simply went to the court and produced an unemployment card or a social welfare card, no order would be made against him. Imprisonment orders are made in many of these cases of default.  It would be fair to assume that there are in Mountjoy at least some people who have been sentenced for non-payment of debt but who, if they had known the procedure, would not be in prison.  On occasion the imprisonment of such people is brought to the notice of a solicitor or a public representative.</P>
    <P>Some time ago one of my constituents found himself in this position and I had extreme difficulty in having him released from Mountjoy.  He had been in prison through ignorance.  The officials of the Department were more than helpful to me in my efforts to have the man released but it was not a simple matter of the Minister making a ministerial order because the case had to be researched and arrangements made with the creditor so it was a complex procedure which took some days to resolve.</P>
    <P>On reaching the stage of amending this procedure one would have thought that more balanced kinds of amendments could have been proposed, not only in terms of speeding up the procedure and simplifying it in ease of the creditor, which is what these amendments are proposing to do, but also in ease of the debtor.  What is proposed will simplify matters considerably for the creditor and his solicitor in that they will only have to hand in a signed certificate.  The certificate will not need to be sworn and there will be no need to produce witnesses. There is nothing wrong with speeding up matters but something should have been done from the debtor's point of view. This aspect could have been tackled in a number of ways.  There could be some <Col N="1751" /> spect of his initiating a declaration to give what information he may have as to whether the debtor was in employment. The creditor must make a declaration in terms of section 2 but is there any reason why he should not be asked to include also whatever knowledge he might have of the employment status or otherwise of the debtor?  In many cases the creditor might not have that information but the courts are entitled to access to such information as the creditor may have as to the employment status of the debtor.  This could have been provided for by making it obligatory to have a prescribed form on the summons sent to the debtor setting out clearly in block capitals and in red such wording as: &ldquo;If you are unemployed, or if you are on social welfare and if you come to the court and produce your unemployment card or your social welfare card, it is unlikely that an order will be made against you.&rdquo;  Such a formula would help to avoid the situation of helpless and innocent people finding themselves in prison through ignorance alone.</P>
    <P>It would have been helpful, too, if a provision could have been included to deal with the circumstances of a person being in prison through ignorance of the procedure.  I am thinking of the kind of provision that would simplify the procedure whereby officials of the Department of Justice could have the person released immediately following satisfactory evidence that he was wrongfully imprisoned in the first place.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether any of these points will meet with the approval of the Minister or whether I have succeeded in making the various points clear but perhaps he will consider these matters further when the Bill is before the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall leave aside the point about speeding up the procedures.  The issue in contention is <i>cui bono,</i> so to speak, in this regard.  I would be prepared to consider the Deputy's suggestion in relation to information that might be given on the forms sent out to debtors.  It is not a matter, strictly <Col N="1752" /> speaking, of court rules.  Looking back on his remarks on Committee Stage and listening to what Deputy Taylor was saying this afternoon, it seems that there could be scope for dealing with the matter in the administrative way he has suggested. As a general rule I would have to agree with him that when official contact is made with people, for whatever reason, we should look at the types of cases involved and consider whether in certain kinds of cases &mdash; he has identified one &mdash; we should find some summary way of advising people as to what their rights might be.  I will consider that point and see if we could deal with it in the way Deputy Taylor has mentioned.</P>
      <P>The other point on which Deputy Taylor concluded is not one for the rules of court.  I readily grant the point that, if the court procedures are handled properly in the first place and people are made aware of their rights and use them, this kind of situation should not occur very often.  In relation to the number of cases where this difficulty arises, I would draw Deputy Taylor's attention to an answer given by my predecessor to two questions from Deputy McGahon on 20 November last, Questions Nos. 107 and 108.  The then Minister said that as of that date 18 persons were in custody on foot of committal warrants issued in the types of case which Deputy Taylor has mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that for the whole country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I will consider whether we should have a simplified procedure in the event of a person being committed who should not have been committed, in the light of the considerations Deputy Taylor has mentioned.  It is not a matter that would be appropriate for discussion within the framework of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am not in any sense criticising what Deputy Taylor has been saying or the people he has been talking about, we should be very careful to ensure that when people get a summons to appear in <Col N="1753" /> court they take it seriously.  We all have experience of people who come to see a public representative and claim they never knew the case was coming up in court.  In about 60 per cent of cases that is a bit less than the truth, and the people knew perfectly well it was coming up in court but could not be bothered to appear and perhaps ended up with a higher penalty being imposed than they had expected.  Not having bothered to turn up, they were not able to explain the circumstances in a way that might have led the justice or the judge to take a different view.  Since the system is there, people should take a summons seriously. I know it is not always convenient for people to do that but, on the other hand, the law is not intended to be there for the convenience of people who do not wish to be discommoded by its application.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland raised a number of issues on section 2.  Nobody may be committed to prison for failure to comply with a court order unless there has been an examination of the person's means. Nobody may be committed to prison if the court decides that the person has not the means to make the payment.  That is an established part of practice and should not be overlooked.  It is regrettable that Deputy Hyland did not raise all the points he raised this afternoon while we were discussing Committee Stage.  He made some remarks on section 2 during the debate last June which were very much briefer and less comprehensive in scope than those he made this afternoon.</P>
    <P>I would draw his attention to the fact that in relation to the penalties provided for individuals in the case of non-payment, we are actually reducing very substantially the penalties as far as individuals are concerned, all within the framework of the provision I have mentioned that nobody may be committed to detention for non-payment unless the court has decided that the person has the means and will not pay.  I know that Deputy Hyland will be as familiar as I am with the cases of people who have not paid fines, not because they have not the means to pay them but because they find <Col N="1754" /> ways of delaying payment, sometimes for a very long time.  This disturbs me but I do not intend to go down that lane at the moment.  That section reduces the penalties on individuals.</P>

      <P>I am sorry if I am not responding to the question which Deputy Taylor has in mind.  I am responding to Deputy Hyland and perhaps Deputy Hyland's remarks do not correspond to Deputy Taylor's questions.  There is a slight disjunction.</P>
      <P>Regarding the provisions in relation to corporate entities, I do not accept that we are providing for outrageously differential treatment or more favourable treatment for corporate bodies than for individuals.  We are reducing the penalties in relation to individuals and we are streamlining and modernising the procedure in relation to corporate bodies.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is much point in going into great detail on section 4.  If I may be a little discordant for a moment, I cannot see the point of Deputy Hyland's coming along, after I have spent some time discoursing on the way in which the change in the procedures will save time for the District Court clerks, for the fifth or sixth time during the course of this debate, and saying that this will not make any difference.</P>

      <P>That is an example of the kind of loose argument that should not be allowed in the House.  The Deputy knows perfectly well that I am not talking about dismantling court clerks &mdash; painful as that procedure would be.  I am not talking about dismantling court procedures. I am talking about one simple measure which we have in this Bill that will save time for District Court clerks, time they could more constructively use for other business.  For Deputy Hyland to come in and operate on the basis of a bland assertion makes no difference.  It is not debate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On section 5, there was one point which I meant to refer to earlier.  Deputy Woods expressed a fear on Committee Stage that section 5, which provides for the amendment of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, was in a sense hidden by being included in this Bill and should be brought to notice in some other way, perhaps by adverting to it in the short title.  As I promised him at the time, I <Col N="1756" /> have reflected upon it and went back to the parliamentary draftsman for advice. On a matter of this kind, which is very technical, I would defer to the advice of the parliamentary draftsman.  It is on such advice that I have come to the conclusion that I cannot do the kind of thing that Deputy Woods had in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a reversion of the argument the Minister was putting to me a few moments ago.  Just because the suggestion came from this side of the House the Minister could not agree with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is any consolation to Deputy Hyland, I can safely say to him without fear of contradiction, and I think Deputy Taylor will agree with me, that it would not matter twopence worth whether it was Deputy Liam Hyland, Minister for Justice, who was asking the parliamentary draftsman for advice&mdash;God be between us and all harm&mdash;or whether it was Deputy Alan Dukes, Minister for Justice, who is asking the question.  The parliamentary draftsman will give the same answer in either case.  This is a totally non-political point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no law which says that the advice of the parliamentary draftsman necessarily should be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, but in a matter of this kind which is very technical and in the nature of the suggestion made by Deputy Woods I would defer to the judgment of the parliamentary draftsman. There are, of course, other cases where that does not arise but we will not go into that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hyland made quite a number of references to various matters concerning endorsements, fines and things of that nature.  I do not intend to follow Deputy Hyland down that road because it is not relevant to the Bill.  I intend to stay within the confines of the Bill.  I will be meeting a deputation from the Irish Vintners' Federation next week to discuss this matter. I have already met quite a number of them in my own constituency for what <Col N="1757" /> was a very cordial discussion about the matter.  I do not intend to go into the matter now.  Finally, I wish to make one comment on Deputy Hyland's contention that in this Bill we have missed out on an opportunity for reform of the District Court system.  We have not.  It was never the intention of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hyland probably does the Bill a great deal more honour, with all respect to my predecessor and myself, than it deserves.  It was never presented as a major reform of the District Court system.  It was intended to do some very specific things.  I am sure there would be even wider scope for debate on measures of reform of the District Courts than there has been on this simple little Bill which I hope will now finish its travail in this House so that I can bring it elsewhere for its final blessing.</P>

    <P>(b)  elected as a member of either House of the Oireachtas or of the Assembly of the European Communities, or</P>

    <P>he shall thereupon stand seconded from employment by the Corporation and shall not be paid by, or be entitled to receive from, the Corporation any remuneration or allowances in respect of the period commencing on such nomination or election or when he is so regarded as having been elected, as the case may be, and ending when he ceases to be a member of either such House or such Assembly.</P>
    <P>(3)  A person who is for the time being entitled under the Standing Orders of either House of the Oireachtas to sit therein or who is a member of the Assembly of the European Communities shall, while he is so entitled or is such a member, be disqualified from becoming a director of the Corporation or from employment in any capacity by the Corporation.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provided that the directorate of the corporation had to cease to be a directorate and employees had to stand redundant from employment by the corporation if they were (a) nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann, (b) nominated as a candidate for election to either House of the Oireachtas or to the Assembly of the European Communities, or (c) regarded pursuant to section 15, inserted by the European Assembly Act, 1984, of the European Assembly <Col N="1760" /> Elections Act, 1977, as having been elected to such Assembly to fill a vacancy.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage in the Seanad objections were raised by Senators on both sides of the House, including the Leader of the House, to the provision regarding nomination as a candidate for election to the Seanad.  In the current Seanad electoral legislation a person can be so nominated without his or her consent and cannot then withdraw his or her candidacy.  As a result, valuable persons might be lost to statutory bodies because of nomination for election and such persons might not succeed in being elected.</P>
    <P>A peculiar quirk which could also arise is that if some Senators wished to get rid of the chief executive of a State body, four of them could come together and nominate him for the Seanad and he would have to cease to be a chief executive. I am sure that was never intended to be the position in legislation and it has never actually happened in practice, but it could happen.  I agree with the Senators that this is an undesirable situation so I have decided to amend section 22.  The amendment should also provide protection for persons nominated for election to Dáil Éireann or the European Assembly.</P>
    <P>The amendment provides that persons would have to be actually elected to either of the assemblies before giving up their position as chief executive.  On the advice of the parliamentary draftsman the original section 22 has been deleted and a revised section 22 has been substituted. The kernel of the amendment is that directors and staff of the NDC will be required to give up their directorship of the corporation or stand seconded from their employment by the corporation only on their election to either House of the Oireachtas or to the Assembly of the European Communities. The provisions contained in the original section in regard to nomination as a member of Seanad Éireann or entitlement to sit in the European Parliament by virtue of being on a replacement panel of that Parliament have also been incorporated into the section as amended.</P>

      <P>This shows the result of <Col N="1761" /> the debate in the Seanad where the nomination of persons in more relevant than it is in this House as all representatives must be elected to Dáil Éireann. Will this amendment seep through to affect all semi-State companies and State bodies?  I do not object to this amendment. Both elected members and nominated members of either House of the Oireachtas should be protected by this amendment, so I have no objection to it. Is the NDC a semi-State body, or a State organisation?  We can go into that at another time.  I do not have an objection to this technical change.</P>

      <P>The NDC is a corporation established by statute.  I am grateful to Deputy Lyons for accepting the amendment.  I remember when the National Council for Education Awards Bill was going through the House I suggested a similar amendment and Deputy Wilson who was then Minister for Education did not accept it.  This amendment, however, is a move in the right direction. Eminent people who are nominated to fight an election to the Seanad should not be barred from being a director or have to stand seconded from their employment. This recent development has been incorporated in the Dentists Bill, the Nurses Bill and the Combat Poverty Bill which recently went through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is a relative innovation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 38 to 43.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had been speaking on section 12 when we were cut short by madame guillotine. I had made the point that in my opinion the Minister was taking authority which was not necessary on the basis that the section was seeking unnecessary authority and consequently was cribbing and confining the authority of Iompras Bhaile Átha Cliath.  Either the Authority will be a high powered one with its own fund of expertise, with knowledge that no other specialist authority would have, or it will not.  If it is to have that expertise, the taking of a general directive from the Minister seems to be superfluous.  The task force that has been in operation for <Col N="1766" /> some time was very successful, and sections of this Bill will give statutory authority to the kind of work the task force was doing.</P>
    <P>I presume the expertise that was there for the task force will be available to the Authority and therefore I do not think the Minister needs this power.  However, there has been a tendency in legislation to concentrate power in the hands of the appropriate Minister.  That is very necessary in some instances but in this case, when you have an authority with expertise and with statutory powers, I do not think these powers for the Minister are necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid this amendment is unacceptable.  Section 12 is precautionary.  It makes clear statutory provision for the giving of appropriate ministerial directions to the Dublin Transport Authority should the need arise at any time in the future.  Any such directions will have to be in writing.</P>
      <P>This reserve power must be available to the Minister for Communications to secure timely corrective action if, for example, the Authority failed to give sufficient priority to its most important traffic management functions, or failed to establish effective controls over its costs or the use of its resources.  It is not possible, therefore, at this stage to be more specific as regards either the circumstances or purpose of any ministerial directions under this section.  It is obviously to be hoped that the need for such directions will not arise.</P>

      <P>In page 12, to delete lines 17 to 20 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) elected as a member of either House of the Oireachtas or of the Assembly of the European Communities, or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to make provision in relation to membership of the Authority as they affect elected members of Dáil Éireann, Seanad Éireann or the European Parliament. Just a few minutes ago the Dáil and the Seanad agreed to a similar amendment to the National Development Corporation Bill and I now propose that we adopt these five amendments.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to provide that any member of the staff of the Dublin Transport Authority who is a candidate for election to the Dáil, Seanad, European Parliament or a local authority in the functional area of the Dublin Transport Authority will only be seconded from employment with the Authority from when he or she takes the seat after the election, and not from when he or she is nominated as an elected candidate as the Bill stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments bring the provisions in the Bill for secondment of staff into line with provisions in the Combat Poverty Agency Billy, 1985, and the National Development Corporation Bill, 1985, as amended by both Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann this afternoon.  Similar <Col N="1770" /> amendments are proposed to paragraph 4 of the Schedule to the Bill in relation to disqualification of persons from membership of the board of the Dublin Transport Authority.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these amendments is to provide that any member of the board of the Dublin Transport Authority who is a candidate for election to the Dáil, Seanad, European Parliament or a local authority in the functional area of the Dublin Transport Authority will be disqualified from membership of the board of the Authority only from when he or she takes the seat after the election, and not from when he or she is nominated as an election candidate as the Bill stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. This is a long running saga, this problem of whether Members of this House, or candidates for membership of this House, Members of the Seanad or candidates for membership of the Seanad, and recently Members of the European Parliament, should or should not be eligible for election to various boards and bodies. On numerous occasions between 1973 and 1977 I challenged this because I genuinely did not see the reason for it.  Then between 1977 and 1981 I came on the problem from the point of view of somebody who was presenting Bills to the House.  The weight of advice nearly always was against Members or potential Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas. It comprises a small development but I support it.  The matter could have been dealt with by the general declaration of interest clause.  I hope some day such a declaration of interest by candidates, by Members of the House, will be sufficient to allow them to be members of various boards and to act on various boards.  This whole question of declaration of interest is raising its head at present.  My personal view is that there should be total declaration of interest when any Bill is being processed or any policy being formulated or put into effect.  If this were so it would be a charter for greater freedom for the Members of the Houses who are often excluded from areas of activity in which they have <Col N="1771" /> special expertise.  For that reason I am in general support of the amendments the Minister has brought forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments the Minister has introduced certainly constitute an advance.  I take it that the first lot deal with the appointment or secondment of officials, employees of one kind or another to the agency whereas the second lot refer to the actual Authority.  There is there a whole area of declaration of interest to which Deputy Wilson has referred which needs to be dealt with urgently by this House.  For some time past I have felt also that the least possible restrictions should be placed on individual citizens in regard to their wanting to or having the capacity to seek office, in these Houses, at local authority level or any other level.  The question of membership of boards is a separate one and is perhaps a more contentious issue.  It should be remembered that generally boards will deal with matters in much greater detail, having a much closer relationship with commercial, day to day decision making whereas Members of this House or of local authorities would not necessarily have that kind of close relationship in decision making.</P>
      <P>I support the amendments generally and welcome the move toward making it easier for people who are in the service of the State by way of being officials or people who want to stand for election to these Houses, to take up positions on the Authority because they should not be precluded from doing so.</P>

In making its recommendations the Authority shall have regard to Government policy in relation to the public finances, and in particular to the prevailing budgetary and economic situation.  The Authority shall make its recommendations to the Minister who, after consultation with the Ministers for the Environment and Finance, shall submit them to the Government.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is based on what I referred to on numerous occasions on <Col N="1773" /> Second Stage, Committee Stage and since Report Stage began.  As the clear words indicate &mdash; they do not need interpretation &mdash; for the implementation of the plan it was my wish that the Authority would have financial powers with regard to capital and non-capital expenditure. Moneys from the Exchequer for the provision, operation and management of transport infrastructure and services should be allocated to the Authority.  The Authority, as an expert body, should take the decision as to how it should be divided.  In the amendment I have mentioned also that the recommendations should be based on the Dublin transport plan.  There is no more powerful a weapon than having the finance.  If plans are ready and the Authority are able to say it is part of the overall plan that a roadway for buses or a rail line should be constructed from the city to Tallaght, then the Authority are in a very powerful position to have their plan implemented. There is provision, perhaps an over-cautious one, that the Authority shall have regard to Government policy in relation to the public finances.  This is self-evident, something we would expect without writing it in.  But it is inserted in the amendment to indicate that there is no tendency towards giving what would be in effect a large sum of money to the Authority without due caution.  I know that what I have been pushing by way of amendment logically hung together, the plan and the financing.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out over and over again, one of the weaknesses in the Bill is that there is too much consultation with too many people, for example, with too many Ministers, to make the Authority effective.  When Deputy Bruton was speaking on the Second Stage he indicated that he felt the same.  I am not naive enough to think that at this stage I will get this amendment passed.  But I want to give the House an opportunity to assess the arguments behind the whole scheme of planning and financing and, importantly also, the idea that CIE should act as the agent of the Dublin Transport Authority, in other words, that the activities of CIE in the city of Dublin should <Col N="1774" /> be controlled as they would be the agent of the Dublin Transport Authority.  The obvious patent result of this would be that when the Authority had decided to improve the Dublin city services, for example, to develop new routes, change routes, establish different stops and so on, they should be in a position to do so and require their agents, CIE, to carry out what they had decided.</P>
    <P>I am recommending the amendment to the House and intend pushing it hard. The only glimmer of hope I have from the Bill as constructed shone through on the last day we discussed the matter where there seemed to be a possibility of introducing an enabling section to cover such things as an overall Dublin plan and a provision for the Dublin Transport Authority being the dispenser of the finances in order to put that plan into execution.</P>
    <P>I urge the House to consider this amendment seriously in the context in which I have placed it in the hope that we will have a better and more effective Dublin Transport Authority.  I know that the powers they age given &mdash; Deputy Taylor indicated that there are considerable powers &mdash; will mean that the Authority will have effective power.  I specifically mentioned the area which was catered for hitherto by the <i>ad hoc</i> task force set up after the Transport Consultative Commission had reported.  I am not in any way denigrating the Bill <i>in toto.</i> There are areas which are good, but my criticism from the beginning has been that the Bill does not have a provision for an overall plan or for the financing of the Authority's activities to include the putting into effect of that plan.</P>

      <P>This amendment could not be accepted because it would allow the Dublin Transport Authority to make unreasonable and unrealistic assessments of the quantum of new public expenditure which it considered should be incurred for the provision and so on of road and rail transport facilities and services.  It is a matter for Government to decide on the parameters of public expenditure and, therefore, the appropriare <Col N="1775" /> function of the Authority, as already provided for in section 21 of the Bill, is to consider and make recommendations to the Ministers concerned as to the priorities which should be assigned in expenditure for the provision of road and rail transport facilities and services.  The Government will decide on the final allocations for any particular items, as heretofore.</P>

      <P>The kernel of Deputy Wilson's argument is that a plan is essential for the real development of a Dublin transport authority.  Without muscle a plan is useless.  The contention of the Minister is that if the Authority was given power to assess annually the amount of its expenditure it would incur unnecessary expenditure and do unreasonable things. Estimates of expenditure put forward by the Authority will have to be approved by the Minister for Finance and that represents a hold on what the Authority can do.  The Authority should have power and be allowed to draw up its own plans. It should be given the finance to put those plans into action.  Deputy Wilson's amendment seeks to give that power to the Authority.  The Minister's treatment of the amendment is an indication that he does not have any intention of accepting it.  It is clear that he is not willing to accept the arguments put forward by this side of the House.  Because of that the transport authority that will be established following the passing of the Bill will not be a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made the point that the quantum of expenditure would be decided by the Authority.  I should like to trace the argument back. The amendment states that the recommendations shall be based, as far as possible, on the Dublin transport plan.  That being so, the expenditure will be related to the plan.  That plan, as conceived by me and pushed in another amendment, would be the most democratic possible structure because the Authority would be required to formulate it.  The plan would <Col N="1776" /> come in for the benefit of the expertise in the local authorities &mdash; in this sense Dublin Corporation and what will replace Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Council.  In other words, the expertise there would be brought to play on the plan.  The plan would be published for everybody to see. An inquiry would be held and the plan would be viewed by all those interested in this very important subject of transport in our capital city.  Their ideas and suggestions would benefit the plan.  A public inquiry would give an opportunity to everybody to comment on the plan.</P>
      <P>At the back of all this would be a consideration of what it would cost. When it is sent to Government for final sanction the first thing that will be considered will be its annual cost.  It should not be forgotten that the proposal was that the plan should cover a five year period or a time decided by the House. Paramount in the mind of the Government when they would be considering the plan would be its cost.  What the Government would be called upon to do later when the plan was being put into effect is something they would have reviewed beforehand.  They would know beforehand in general terms what the cost per annum would be.  It is not possible to take any power away from the Government. They have the final <i>ipse dixit</i> on it.  We were suggesting that the Dublin Transport Authority which we conceived of as an expert body to deal with a very important section of our country, the transport in the capital city, would do the assessment.  The Government, in sanctioning the plan, would also be sanctioning expenditure and none of their prerogatives in this matter could be touched. For that reason the Government decision with regard to expenditure, the expertise for local authorities and the interests of the public would be safeguarded and there would be no problems such as those which the Minister mentioned.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 17, to delete lines 5 to 15 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;28.&mdash;Notwithstanding any provision contained in any existing legislation, CIE shall operate public transport services within the Authority's administrative area, to such an extent, in such a manner, and at such fare levels as the Authority may from time to time determine. Section 2 of the Transport Act, 1964, which reads &ldquo;it shall be the duty of the Board (of CIE) to conduct its undertaking so that, taking account <Col N="1781" /> of payments made to the Board by the Minister out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, its operating expenditure, including all charges properly chargeable to revenue shall not be greater taking one year with another than the revenue of the Board', is amended by the insertion of the words &lsquo;Dublin Transport Authority and the&rsquo; between the words &lsquo;the&rsquo; and &lsquo;Minister&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I will stop there to indicate that this is a very radical suggestion with regard to Dublin transport.  As of now, such decisions are made by CIE, in so far as Dublin city services and suburban rail services are concerned, different sectors of the company dealing with road and rail respectively. The overall thinking behind the establishment of the Authority was that plans would be co-ordinated and therefore an authority outside the agency, in this case CIE, would be charged with the responsibility of organising the transport services.  It is important that the Authority should be in a position to elaborate their transport schemes for the Dublin area and have the power in the Bill, which they would if CIE were an agent of the Authority, to put those plans into effect.</P>
    <P>As this House knows well, if a company like CIE or the future triple or double company exercise their statutory role in the area, there is not much point in asking the Dublin Transport Authority to advise them, yet they should be in a position to advise them.  As conceived by us it was to be an expert authority.  There is not much point in giving them power to advise because in fact CIE would have the power to say: &ldquo;No, we think this is the way it should be and we are not taking the advice given by the Dublin Transport Authority&rdquo;.  This is the kernel of the problem as I see it.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to the wording of the amendment:</P>
    <P>... within the Authority's administrative area, to such an extent, in such a manner, and at such fare levels as <Col N="1782" /> the Authority may from time to time determine.</P>
    <P>If the House were to accept this, the Authority would be in the way of improving our transport in the capital city.  The establishment of the Authority has no other purpose.  There is no point in having it in a consultancy or advisory role.  It would be just another talking shop and a joke as far as making anything effective which had been decided upon with regard to the operation of CIE was concerned.</P>
    <P>I am not too sure whether part of the amendment is properly constructed but I will read the rest of it into the record:</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Transport Act, 1964, which reads &lsquo;it shall be the duty of the Board (of CIE) to conduct its undertakings so that, taking account of payments made to the Board by the Minister out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, its operating expenditure, including all charges properly chargeable to revenue shall not be greater taking one year with another than the revenue of the Board&rsquo;, is amended by the insertion of the words &lsquo;Dublin Transport Authority and the&rsquo; between the words &lsquo;the&rsquo; and &lsquo;Minister&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the obfuscation of the wording &mdash; and there is some &mdash; the general purpose is that in so far as the Dublin area is concerned and the defined area for the Authority, the Authority would make their case, as suggested by the defeated amendment No. 2, on the basis of the plan and get the money.  Then they would utilise that money in both the services and infrastructure area.</P>
    <P>I have been talking particularly about the services area because that is the area in which CIE operate.  A good deal of frustration felt by the Minister's predecessors, and perhaps by the Minister himself, was due to the fact that there was no control over services development. Interested groups such as residents' associations were at liberty to make suggestions and for the most part they would be received and at least listened to by CIE.  CIE might be elaborating plans for roadways, Dublin Corporation might be anxious for some other <Col N="1783" /> kind of development or possibly Dún Laoghaire Borough Council or Dublin County Council might have plans.</P>
    <P>The whole thrust of the amendment before the House on Report Stage has been to see to it that there is not any unnecessary duplication of activity or, what is worse than duplication, activities which are at cross-purposes which would involve the wasteful expenditure of public moneys because of lack of coordination. For that reason I have been pushing the amendments that have come before the House today and this amendment is in line with the others.  I do not think we have time to have another division before 7 o'clock on this amendment and for that reason I should like to tease it out fully and ask the support of the House for it.  I intend to come back to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is not acceptable because it would effectively mean the takeover of CIE's Dublin operations by the Dublin Transport Authority.  No justification for such takeover has been given or is seen.  Such takeover would, of course, conflict with and prejudice the effective performance by the Authority of its vital policy-making advisory and regulatory functions on the Bill.  The Dublin Transport Authority will set standards for CIE's passenger operations in the Dublin area relating to the extent of the bus and rail service provided and the quality and reliability of that service. The DTA will have regard to the overall transport requirements of their functional area and the special needs of particular areas, for example, the developing western suburbs or categories of passengers, the level of the Exchequer subvention made available for CIE and the permitted fare level.  In view of financial constraints the DTA will be obliged to adopt a realistic approach in the setting of standards while seeking to ensure that the services provided represent good value for money.  A close liaison with CIE would be necessary in the context of deciding on reliable operation targets and as regards the monitoring of these services provided by the board.  I oppose this amendment.</P>

      <P>I, too, regrettably have reservations about the amendment which Deputy Wilson is proposing.  The make-up of the Authority would have a very great bearing on the effectiveness of what Deputy Wilson is proposing.  If we do not have an Authority made up of experts, then clearly the decisions being taken by that Authority could be questionable. At present we have no idea who will be on this Authority.  The Minister has power to appoint all the members, as far as I can recall.  We had an amendment down on Committee Stage, which was not reached, seeking to change that.  If the amendment as proposed was adopted it would take from CIE some of their key decision making roles and would practically denude them of their right to manage the company.  It would transfer power from CIE to this Authority.  The amendment does not attempt to control other elements of the transport area, such as the taxi service, the private buses and the private cars which are also key elements in the whole transport scene in the greater Dublin area.  While I can appreciate what the Deputy is getting at, we need to have a co-ordinated and tightly run system of organising our transport.  I do not believe that this amendment is the way to do it. I also appreciate that this amendment is part of a total approach being applied by Deputy Wilson to this Bill.  Perhaps for that reason it is a little unfair to have to deal with it on a piecemeal basis at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Wilson said at the outset, this amendment would bring about a major change in the manner in which transport is regulated in this city and the Dublin Transport Authority administrative area.  It would change the whole power of operation of public transport and take it out of the hands of CIE. It would in effect be the Authority that was envisaged by Deputy Wilson and the Fianna Fáil Party with experts who would co-ordinate the whole transport scene within Dublin city, Dublin county and Dún Laoghaire.  It would not only refer to CIE.  The Authority would also have power to regulate other forms of transport. It is essential to understand that <Col N="1785" /> CIE would not be thrown aside.  They would still be the public transport authoritive body.  It would be no harm to have an Authority which would be able to co-ordinate all the different arms of local government, Telecom Éireann and An Post who operate in the area.  CIE have not the power that the new Authority would have to control these local authorities. The Authority would be good for public transport and for the improvement of the transport system.  It would not be an Authority concerned with speaking shop.  The amendments that have been put forward from this side of the House would have given the Authority the necessary power to co-ordinate and to organise the whole area in question.  The end result would have been a more fluent and better service to the public in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to take up what the Minister said.  Certainly the whole thrust of my amendments was to have a regulatory Authority, an Authority with power to plan and with money to execute that plan.  The advisory role is all right in its own way but it is a bit like Kathleen Mavourneen, it may last for years or it may last for ever.  We have far too much of that.  The Minister mentioned, and rightly so, the importance of the development of transport for the western and southern suburbs.  To a certain extent the Government made strong provision in the northern suburbs with the provision of the DART service.  The type of Dublin Transport Authority which I have been advocating is precisely the type of transport authority which would be in a position to develop proper services for the western and southern suburbs of this city.  It is all right to talk about close liaison but if we have not got the power that would come from the overall plan and from having control of the finances then it is much more difficult to affect any kind of reform or development in transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa quite rightly said that what we are aiming at is an Authority with experts.  We did not intend that the Authority be totally representational.  I commend what the Minister did with <Col N="1786" /> regard to giving a minority representation to the local authorities.  The whole thrust of the Bill as we conceived it was that it would have experts and that they would be tied down to a <i>modus operandi</i> which would bring them before the public, the authorities and the Government before a plan was finally approved.  As Deputy De Rossa said, it would mean a transfer of authority from CIE to the Dublin Transport Authority.  The Authority would also have a competence with regard to taxis, private buses and private cars.</P>
    <P>Because of the recession, the number of redundancies and the number of people who have been taken off the payroll over the last couple of years, and the Government must share responsibility for that, there has been an easement of traffic.  The big snarl up which we expected would have been reached now has not occurred as yet and the new bridges over the Liffey have helped in that area.  The type of Authority which we envisaged and which we pushed on Second Reading and have pushed by way of amendment since then is the type of authority necessary if Dublin is to develop in the way we think and hope it will develop as our capital city.  For that reason I recommend that the House accept this amendment.  I know my time is running short&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to demand that the British Government have regard to the vote of the European Parliament on 20 February, 1986, calling for the closing down of the nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield, in view not only of the danger to life and health from accidental leaks and emissions to date, but also in view of the serious risk of a major accident with incontrollable consequences, and in view of the fact that plans for the further expansion of Sellafield involve a heavy traffic of ships carrying nuclear waste in the Irish Sea.</P>

    <P>and, while recognising that the setting up of an investigation into Sellafield by the UK Health and Safety Executive is a positive step, supports this Government's arrangement of Ministerial discussions at European level with a view to establishing a community inspection process to determine independently whether Sellafield can operate safely or whether its operations should cease or be suspended until satisfactory standards of safety are achieved.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night before moving the Adjournment I referred to the blatant irregularities in the Sellafield plant that are being totally ignored by the authorities and by the British Government. Since then a new hard hitting report has just been issued slamming this plant which to date has been the source of more than 300 accidents and radioactive leaks since it opened.  The report also confirmed our worst fears as expressed previously by other experts that because of the massive discharge of waste the Irish Sea is the most radioactive stretch of water in the whole world.</P>
      <P>Medical research in Ireland points to a high incidence of physically and mentally handicapped babies born in certain parts of the country along the coastline.  It surely is no coincidence that the incidence of cancer and leukaemia in certain areas, geographically located closer to Sellafield, is much higher than anywhere else in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite that evidence the British Government and BNF Limited continue to assert that there is no danger from the plant and that maximum safety standards <Col N="1789" /> are being maintained.  It has even reached the ridiculous stage where the recent report stating that reactors should be shut down was rejected by British Nuclear Fuels Limited and they went on to say that they had asked consultants to prepare another report based on alternative engineering assumptions.</P>
    <P>Presumably they intend to continue this masquerade until they receive a report which will be considered suitable for them.  The irresponsible line being taken by these people is unbelievable and their attitude must be considered highly criminal when weighed against the huge serious risks that are being taken.</P>
    <P>My party leader, over 12 months ago, when speaking about Sellafield in the House said that the people responsible should be prosecuted and brought before the courts.  At that time Government Ministers took his comments rather lightly but, in view of the recent serious accidents, and in retrospect I am sure that the Taoiseach and his Government must now take that statement seriously, the Taoiseach should be impressing our insistence to the British Government that the plant must be closed.  Sellafield is a very old nuclear station and a number of well known engineers said recently that the designers of the early nuclear stations had not taken the possibility of earthquakes into account.  A shocking discovery was contained in one of the recent reports which indicated that in the event of even a light earth tremor nothing would prevent a fire of devastating proportions.</P>
    <P>There have been a couple of earthquakes of significance not too far from Sellafield, particularly in 1979 and 1984 but one of the main problems apparently is that it is impossible to check the bolts surrounding the reactor pressure vessel because of their positioning inside the concrete shield of the reactor and it is impossible to check whether they are even damaged already at this time.  It is also unlikely that they could be repaired because of the intense radioactivity inside the shield.  It is not unreasonable to assume that there will be other earth <Col N="1790" /> tremors in the Irish Sea which could put the plant at final risk and the continuing operation poses a direct threat to the whole of northern Europe but particularly to the Irish coast.</P>
    <P>European laws are being deliberately ignored as a number of minimal safety measures laid down by the European Parliament are not being complied with in the case of Sellafield.  The British Government are clearly in breach of directives of the European Commission and proceedings should be instituted by the Commission against the British Government.</P>
    <P>The European Community Environmental Action Programme drawn up for the purpose of investigating the level of radioactivity in the Mediterranean and the North Sea over a five year period should now also be extended to cover the Irish Sea because, as I have already pointed out, the Irish Sea is the most radioactive stretch of water in the world.</P>
    <P>The urgency of this very serious matter is reflected in the fact that the European Parliament recently passed four motions calling for, among other things, the closure of Sellafield as it presently exists. The members of that parliament did not take these motions lightly and it is very obvious that there is a huge amount of international public opinion which calls for an end to the Sellafield operations.</P>
    <P>The fullest possible information about the extent and causes of radioactive emissions has not been admitted by the British Government and it is appalling that in the circumstances the British Prime Minister has repeated over and over that her Government are satisfied that Sellafield is not a cause of danger or risk to anybody either in Britain or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It has been proved recently that information which emerged from an investigation which was commissioned by the British Government some years ago about the operation and safety of the plant has since proved to be downright false in many respects and this obviously does not create confidence in the minds of the general public not only about the way in which this plant is operated but also about the irresponsible attitude that <Col N="1791" /> has been adopted by the British Government.</P>
    <P>There are, however, in Britain a substantial number of politicians who have called for closure to allow a full safety inquiry but unfortunately that call has also been ignored.  It is now quite clear that Sellafield represents an ever increasing hazard to the environment, marine life, animal life and above all human life. One of the greatest worries people have is that, whilst so many reports have been commissioned, the depth of information coming to the public has apparently been censored and the public have not been made aware of the full contents of these reports.</P>
    <P>Some individuals involved in the preparation of reports have made certain statements from time to time which have been very disquieting and it is most disturbing that recently the Minister responsible in Britain stated that the record where the operation of Sellafield is concerned is second to none.  The Minister's statement cannot, however, give any further cause for confidence in the light of the way in which the Black inquiry was conducted and the misinformation that it produced.  No country should be allowed to impose on another the consequences of the disposal of radioactive waste from a nuclear plant simply for the sake of its own nuclear development and employment.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil motion is a very responsible one but the amendment tabled by the Government is meaningless in the light of what is happening.  I believe the point has now been reached when the Government have no option but to demand the closure of Sellafield.  I urge the Minister to accept our motion which is submitted in a non-contentious and non-controversial way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mrs. A. Doyle) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mrs. A. Doyle)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mrs. A. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government share fully the general concern at the problems continually being posed by the existence of the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant and do not need to be reminded of their responsibility <Col N="1792" /> to the Irish public in this matter. Since assuming office the Government have voiced concern at every opportunity, both in bilateral discussions with the UK authorities and in various international fora, at the dangers to the environment inherent in the discharge of wastes form this plant to the Irish Sea. Indeed, we did not have to wait for today's reports to tell us the Irish Sea is the most radioactive in the world.</P>
      <P>While operations have been carried on at the Sellafield plant since the fifties, as far as I can see, prior to the assumption of office by the present administration, little or no notice was taken of these activities at Government level, nor was there any apparent awareness of the effects discharges from this plant might have on the Irish environment.  In the very first months of their term of office, however, this Government began to take up actively with the other Governments concerned both the Sellafield discharges and an allied matter, the dumping of nuclear waste in the Atlantic south-west of Ireland.  Since then, this Government have been pressing consistently for a solution to the problem.  I was part of a parliamentary group who visited Sellafield two years ago.</P>
      <P>No later than last week, in the Council of Environment Ministers of the EC, the Minister for the Environment forcibly put on record the Irish Government's concern at the escalation of the problems at Sellafield.  He said that our gravest worry was the possible public health risks, but that we were also concerned for the effects on our air quality and marine environment and the danger to Ireland's image as a clean and unpolluted country. He went on to say that Ireland would shortly be proposing the establishment of a European inspection force and besought the Council to interest itself more vigorously in this whole problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Outside of bilateral discussions between Ireland and the UK the principal forum through which the Department of the Environment have been making their case for the elimination of discharges of nuclear waste to the sea has been the Convention for the Prevention of Marine <Col N="1793" /> Pollution from Land-Based Sources, generally known as &ldquo;the Paris Convention&rdquo;. Under this convention, which applies to the north-east Atlantic area and which has been ratified by both Ireland and the UK, the discharge of certain specified substances, toxic, radioactive etc. to the sea is prohibited or limited. Over the last few years Ireland has taken a leading role in getting the convention to assume a more active part in the control of radioactive discharges to the sea &mdash; particularly the Irish Sea, because of the low dilution factor, compared with the Atlantic for example.</P>
    <P>At the last annual meeting of the convention a motion was passed declaring the firm intention of all members to take account of the best available technology in order to reduce radioactive discharges coming from all nuclear industries, including reprocessing plants, to the marine environment.  I made this comment here almost two years ago when speaking on the Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution, on 30 May 1984.  So, tragically today's reports are not news to us.</P>
    <P>The meeting also called on states which have nuclear reprocessing plants to give priority to discharges from these plants. The relevant states &mdash; the UK and France &mdash; are to adopt effective measures to deal with discharges as a matter of urgency and to report back to the convention on measures planned and applied, and the results achieved.</P>
    <P>We welcome the various measures which the UK authorities have taken in recent years to improve the methods of treatment of waste before discharging, thus leading to a considerable reduction in contamination levels; but our ultimate aim must continually be the ending of the discharges altogether.</P>
    <P>The Government disapproves of any radioactive discharges from Sellafield to the Irish Sea and we have continuously sought to have these discharges minimised and then eliminated as soon as possible. We are advised by the technical experts that the present discharges from Sellafield authorised by the UK authorities are well within the safety limits set <Col N="1794" /> down by the recognised international advisory bodies and, they say, pose no threat to health or the environment generally.  We accept this advice, but at the same time realise that it is based on the present state of knowledge of the subject and that perhaps future scientific discoveries may show that these discharges in fact all along have been causing environmental damage of a nature at present unforeseen.  It would then, of course, be too late to undo what has been done.</P>
    <P>We are, therefore, opposed to all discharges from Sellafield, even those authorised in good faith by the UK authorities.  The recent series of accidental discharges from the plant have, of course, considerably highlighted our anxieties and give added weight to the argument that the only safe course is to abandon these discharges altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I earnestly request that we have a reasoned debate on this subject.  The Government are opposed to any radioactive discharges from Sellafield to the Irish Sea and have called for these discharges to be minimised and to be eliminated as soon as possible through the use of the best available technology.  That is the Government's clear position.</P>
      <P>This position has been stated at every opportunity both to the British authorities and at all appropriate international fora.</P>
      <P>The Euratom Treaty, to which Ireland belongs, requires compliance with basic standards for radiological protection. This treaty give the Commission several responsibilities with regard to the control and monitoring of radioactive emissions from nuclear installations in member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is our contention, therefore, that the Sellafield issue is not only a problem for Ireland but must also be of serious concern to the European Commission who can take effective action.  It is for this reason that we have been stressing in discussions with Commissioner Clinton-Davies <Col N="1795" /> the need, as we see it, for a Community inspection force.</P>
    <P>The House will know about the recent incidents at Sellafield.  After the first two in 1984, we called for an immediate meeting of the contact group set up by the Minister for Energy and Mr. Patrick Jenkin, the then Minister for the Environment in Britain.  Our officials were assured that the radiological emissions in these incidents were not significant.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise that the recent incidents at Sellafield are, in themselves, of little radiological significance to the Irish population.  This must be stated clearly to avoid hysteria.  However, it is the frequency of such incidents that has caused the Government and the Irish people to lose confidence in the safety of the plant.  These incidents have caused concern about the possibility of an accident happening in the future which could have consequences for this country.  This has given rise to an increasing public concern at the continued operation of the plant.  This concern must also be shared by the British public.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the Euratom Treaty requires adherence to limits, not only to limits but also to the principle of ALARA &mdash; that emissions should be very low.  In a case in the UK Crown Court last year British Nuclear Fuels Limited were found guilty, <i>inter alia,</i> of not complying with ALARA.  It cannot be denied, therefore, that there is evidently scope for improving operations at the plant.  The House is aware that a programme was introduced recently at Sellafield which is designed to effect significant reduction of discharges.  However, the need for reassurance regarding the safety of the plant remains.</P>
    <P>A recent report stated that a nuclear scientist, Dr. Jakeman, formerly employed at Sellafield, had revealed that the figures given to the Black inquiry on radioactive discharges in the 1950s were inaccurate.  The report claimed that BNFL had admitted that the levels were actually 40 times greater than stated to the Black inquiry.  It was also reported <Col N="1796" /> that the chairman of the inquiry, Sir Douglas Black, had commented that he considered that he will not be altering his conclusions.  It has been confirmed with the UK DHSS and the report is substantially correct.</P>
    <P>As long as this type of occurrence is allowed to continue there will remain a loss of confidence at the continued operation of Sellafield.  The fears associated with this loss of confidence can only be allayed by a thorough review of the safety of the plant.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the Minister for Energy met the then Minister for the Environment in Britain, Mr. Jenkin, in February 1984 to express our concern and to discuss the discharges and dumpings of radioactive waste.  As a result, a contact group were established between Ireland and the UK to form a channel of communication between the two countries on nuclear matters.  The group have been meeting at regular intervals, most recently on 14 February, when the Irish Government expressed our deep concern at recent incidents at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, met the then UK Secretary for the Environment, Mr. Patrick Jenkin, in February 1984 to express our concern regarding Sellafield and to discuss the issue of the discharge and dumping of radioactive waste.  As a result of that meeting a contact group were established between Ireland and the UK to provide for a formal channel of communication between the two countries on nuclear matters.</P>
    <P>The group have since met at regular intervals, most recently on 14 February 1986 when the Irish Government's concern at the recent incidents was expressed. Through this contact group and by other formal means, the Government have taken measures to ensure that we would be kept well abreast of all developments at Sellafield.  As a necessary improvement to the working of the contact group, it is our intention to seek a full meeting of officials of all relevant departments and bodies in the UK and the Republic.  This should contribute to greater cohesion in the information being made available to us.  I should add that <Col N="1797" /> at last February's meeting of the contact group a procedure for prompt notification of incidents was agreed and notification of incidents which occurred following that meeting has been almost immediate.</P>
    <P>I assume that the announcement by the UK authorities of the appointment of a team of 12 inspectors to undertake an investigation into Sellafield is due in no small measure to the firm representations which the Irish Government have been making and will continue to make to the UK Government.</P>
    <P>As well as recommending further studies, the Black report also recommended a review of the liquid discharge authorisations and a reduction of routine liquid discharges from the plant.  The UK Department of the Environment are in the process of carrying out a review of these liquid discharge authorisations.</P>
    <P>The UK authorities have undertaken to consult my Department during this review.  However, I am dissatisfied with the lack of progress in finalising the new authorisations for liquid discharges, which should have been in place by 1 January of this year but which, in fact, have not yet been agreed.  Consultation on the new authorisations is not now expected to commence until after Easter.</P>
    <P>Moreover, current discharge authorisations for gaseous discharges specify only that the best practical means to reduce discharges must be observed, without imposing numerical limitations. We would obviously wish to see this situations remedied as soon as possible, but we understand that there are no immediate plans for the introduction of such numerical limitations.  This is a matter which will be taken up by us.</P>
    <P>The Black report has been referred to and has been discussed in this House on a number of occasions.  It did make certain recommendations regarding further studies and these are now being carried out.  It is important that they be carried out.  They are relevant to departments other than the Department of the Environment in Britain.  A UK Department of Health committee will reassess that part of the Black report which <Col N="1798" /> is concerned with discharges in the light of recent disclosures by BNFL that the figures provided to the Black committee were apparently too low.  This health committee will advise within six months as to whether the revised discharge figures should in any way affect the Black committee's conclusions.</P>
    <P>The House will also be aware that our Department of Health have set up a steering committee to examine the incidence of childhood leukaemia since 1970 and of Down's Syndrome in the under 25 year group.  The committee will also undertake a critical examination of the Black report.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that the levels of radioactivity are carefully monitored by our Nuclear Energy Board who are engaged in a continuous monitoring programme which measures radioactivity levels.  Broadly speaking, the Nuclear Energy Board's monitoring programme involves the collection of samples of fish, seawater, seaweed and sediment at different locations.  These samples are processed and then taken to the board's laboratory at St. Luke's Hospital where the levels of radioactivity are determined using internationally recognised testing procedures which the board have advised as being of the highest standard.  The methodology used is very complex to describe.  Should any Member of the House require details of the procedure the Nuclear Energy Board will be happy to provide full information.</P>
    <P>Independent research programmes are also undertaken by the Environmental Radioactivity Laboratories of University College, Dublin and Trinity College, Dublin.  The results of these monitoring programmes have clearly shown that contamination has occurred in the Irish Sea as a result of discharges from Sellafield. However, the radiation does to the Irish population resulting from Sellafield is very small and would be, on average, less than 1 per cent of the limits advised by the International Commission for Radiological Protection and by the European Community.</P>
    <P>A joint Irish-Spanish research cruise is planned for this year to monitor levels <Col N="1799" /> and distribution of caesium 134 and caesium 137 in the area bounded by the north-east Atlantic dumpsite, the south-west coast of Ireland and the north-east coast of Spain.  This will include an examination of the extent to which discharges from Sellafield and Cap de la Hague have now penetrated these southerly areas.</P>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board, with the assistance of the Meteorological Service of the Department of Communications, also monitor radioactivity levels in air, rainfall and drinking water samples.  I am assured by the Nuclear Energy Board that the levels of artificially produced radioactivity in the atmosphere and in the environment are low and do not constitute a health hazard to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The monitoring system operated by the Nuclear Energy Board has been adequate to determine the level of radioactivity which has occurred to date.  However, in the light of these recent incidents I propose to have the monitoring procedures reviewed in consultation with the Nuclear Energy Board, with a view to establishing whether monitoring requires any modification.  I will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that we will continue to be in a position to accurately measure future radioactivity levels.  I might also add that the Nuclear Energy Board published a report in 1984 on their monitoring programme, copies of which are available in the Library.  A more recent report will be published shortly and will also be made available in the Library.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that the Sellafield issue will continue to fester until such time as the basis for concern regarding its possible effect is investigated.  While recognising that the review by the Health and Safety Executive is a step in the right direction, we are of the firm opinion that what is required is an independent inspection of the plant.  We contend, furthermore, that it is clearly in the interest of the nuclear industry that they should support such an impartial inspection of the Sellafield plant and also support any measures that might be necessary to improve the safety and environmental impact of the plant. <Col N="1800" /> This inspection force should be in a position to establish whether plants such as Sellafield are safe and, furthermore, whether discharges are in conformity with the obligations set out in the EURATOM Treaty, which include compliance not only with numerical limitations on discharges, but also with the ALARA principle that discharges must be as low as reasonably achievable.</P>
    <P>As long as there are discharges from Sellafield into the Irish Sea, the Irish population will continue to be concerned about the possible impact on their health and safety, as indeed, will the Government. We believe that the Irish people have a right to reassurance in these issues and it is for this reason that we are pressing the matter of a EURATOM inspection force with the Commission.</P>
    <P>Recent events at Sellafield warrant serious consideration of the issues which I had raised.  The Commissioner has agreed to visit Ireland towards the end of this month for a meeting with the Tánaiste and Minister for Energy, Deputy Spring, other Ministers and myself to discuss the matter further.</P>
    <P>The House is aware that I was in Strasbourg yesterday for discussions with Commissioner Stanley Clinton-Davies who is responsible for environmental, nuclear safety and transport matters in the European Commission.</P>
    <P>In these discussions I was adamant that there is a need for Commission action to ensure that nuclear plant operations, in particular the nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield, comply with the highest possible standards of safety.  I referred to the mounting concern in Ireland about Sellafield and said that I was satisfied that the Commission has a central and vital role to play in the implementation of the Community basic radiation safety standards under the EURATOM Treaty.  I made this quite clear in my discussions with the Commissioner.  In particular I repeated the Irish Government's call for a European inspection force which would be internationally regarded as an objective and impartial watchdog.</P>
    <P>I am convinced, and I informed the Commissioner of this, that the Irish <Col N="1801" /> Government's stance reflects the views of other Community countries and the serious concerns of the European Parliament as expressed in a number of resolutions recently passed by that parliament. I said that the issue was of international importance because of the trans-national effects of discharges into the marine environment and the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Clinton-Davies said that the Commission was urgently reviewing aspects of Community policy on nuclear safety following recent events at Sellafield and would give serious consideration to the issues which I had raised with him. The Commissioner has agreed to visit Ireland towards the end of this month for the meeting to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The publication of the report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons reinforces the Government's position on the UK nuclear industry, and in particular on the operations at Sellafield. The reprocessing of nuclear fuels at Sellafield is the biggest source of radioactive waste.  Bearing in mind the unfortunate history of this plant it comes as no surprise that many of the comments in the report identify the problems and shortcomings of current nuclear waste management practices.  As the report itself indicates, it has to be recognised that, if no satisfactory and publicly acceptable means for the safe disposal of radioactive waste can be found, the continuing production of such wastes will be put into question.  This is the nub of the matter. The proper management of nuclear waste is a matter of major public concern.</P>
    <P>The comment in the report which has attracted most attention is that the UK Ministry of Agriculture have confirmed that Sellafield is the largest recorded source of radioactive discharges in the world and as a result the Irish Sea is the most radioactive sea in the world.  This clearly illustrates what the Irish Government have been repeatedly saying to the British authorities, namely, that it is not acceptable that radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea should be tolerated for much longer.</P>
    <P>However, it is important that we keep <Col N="1802" /> a balanced view and are aware of the effects of this contamination.  The level of contamination is greatest near Sellafield and decreases with increasing distance from Sellafield.  Continued monitoring by the Nuclear Energy Board of fish, shellfish, seawater, seaweed and sediment of the Irish Sea shows that the radiation doses which might be received by members of the Irish public are very small.  These doses would be less than 1 per cent of accepted dose limits of the European Community radiation safety standards.  I would stress that such a dose is only a very small fraction of exposure to naturally occurring radiation sources. I wish to emphasise this because it would be irresponsible to be alarmist simply for effect.  For example, it is important that the public should know that the fish which we harvest from the Irish Sea poses no hazard to the Irish public.  Having said that, it also needs to be said that the doses from Sellafield should not arise at all.  As I have said, discharges from Sellafield must be eliminated before much longer.</P>
    <P>I indicated earlier that radiation levels are highest near Sellafield.  I would like to refer particularly to plutonium and other actinides which are discharged from Sellafield and are of major public concern.  The UK report draws attention to the fact that &ldquo;The environment around Sellafield has effectively become an open store of long lived radioactivity&rdquo;.  It is expected that very little would be detected in the western Irish Sea.  This has been confirmed by the measurements of the plutonium levels in fish and shellfish landed at our ports.  However, I was pleased to note that the UK report recommends that discharges of plutonium and other actinides into the Irish Sea should be virtually eliminated.</P>
    <P>It did not come as any surprise that the UK report states that the UK Government and nuclear industry are confused and only feeling their way towards a coherent waste management policy.  The report describes waste management arrangements in the UK as &ldquo;amateurish, haphazard and <i>ad hoc</i>&rdquo; compared with other countries.  That is a cause of concern.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1803" /> The report also recommends that any disposal methods chosen should reduce the quantities of radioactive wastes discharged to the environment &ldquo;to be as small as technically possible&rdquo;.  In general, the conclusions and recommendations in that report must be welcomed.  We welcome in particular the following: first, consideration of the abandonment of plans for extending reprocessing facilities (thorp); second, that radically lower discharge limits should be set; third, that limits should be introduced for radioactive gaseous discharges to the atmosphere; and, fourth, that the nuclear industry should be more open with the public. While the report is concerned about the effects of accidents at Sellafield, it does not address the likelihood or effects of such accidents.  It also fails to acknowledge the international nature of the problem.  This is of serious concern to my Government.  The question of closure of the Sellafield plant is not as simple as it seems.  There is already a large quantity of spent fuel for reprocessing stored at Sellafield.  This would continue to require attention and management even if further reprocessing is not carried out.  The Government must be assured beyond doubt that the plant can and will be operated safely without danger to the Irish public and in conformity with the principles laid down by the EURATOM Treaty.  This is the central thrust of the Government's policy.</P>
    <P>For this reason the Taoiseach, at his meeting with the British Prime Minister on 19 February 1986, urged that there be a review of safety procedures at the plant. We welcome the subsequent announcement that the UK health and safety executive is undertaking an investigation into Sellafield.  However, this is not exclusively a UK problem.  It is one that transcends national boundaries and is therefore a problem affecting member states of the EC.  There is a need therefore for an investigation by a European inspection force such as we are proposing. The Irish Government are of the firm opinion that it is in the interests of all concerned to support this inspection <Col N="1804" /> force at European level and to support any measure that might be adjudged necessary by an inspection force to improve the safety of Sellafield, even if this means suspension or cessation of operations until the necessary safety measures are introduced.</P>
    <P>I have been anxious to be reasonable in my contribution and to stress two essential factors.  The first is the safety at the plant, which has been our main concern and would require the minimisation and elimination of radioactive discharges from the plant.  That we have stressed in contacts with the British Government and at European level.  The second main thrust of the Irish Government's policy is that this is a matter of international concern and the most effective way it can be dealt with is through a European inspection force under the aegis of the EURATOM Treaty.  I believe we have been reasonable. I want to assure the Irish public that the advice I have received from the Nuclear Energy Board is that there is no problem at the moment and that we can safely eat fish.  There is a need for concern, but the people can be assured that this Government will take every step to ensure the continued safety of the Irish public and that the doses received by the Irish people are minimised and will be reduced to nil as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>A clear case has been made for this plant to be closed.  A clear case has been made for the Irish people to have a direct interest in the closure of this plant from the point of view of safety and health.  Experts on the Irish side have indicated that the only way this plant can be made safe is to close it down.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out that he wants a European inspection force.  I argue that there is nothing wrong with that if he wants it, but what is immediately required is that we have the right to go into that plant to inspect it in view of the fact that it affects our people.  We have a right to inspect that plant to see what can be done to make it safe in the immediate future.</P>
      <P>There is no room for complacency on this issue.  There is no room for being reasonable on this issue.  We must make the strongest possible call from this House tonight and the only way that can be done is to support the Fianna Fáil motion and the addendum I am proposing to it.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste has assured us that less than 1 per cent of radioactivity level has been found on the Irish coast, but he failed to tell us it is 100 times greater on the Eastern coast than it is on the western coast.  He said this is 1 per cent of the known safety level.  Who decided what the known safety level is?  We are totally in the dark because we do not know what the known safety level is, as the Minister admitted in his speech.</P>
      <P>What concerns me also, and it may be slightly to one side of this immediate issue, is that reading paragraph 6a of the agreement recently signed by this Government in the EC in relation to European Political Co-operation, it seems that we have locked ourselves into keeping this plant in existence.  This is something we should look at very closely at a future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dependence of the British Government on this plant for their nuclear energy and nuclear weapons strategy should not be ignored.  If we go pussyfooting to Britain saying &ldquo;please, would you kindly clean up this place&rdquo;, we will be <Col N="1806" /> sent home with our tails between our legs.  We must demand that it be closed. We must demand immediately that an Irish observer be allowed access to this plant on a permanent basis.  We must also demand that the discharges into the Irish Sea cease forthwith.</P>
    <P>British Nuclear Fuels Limited have consistently issued false and misleading information about the operation of this plant.  They have denied the seriousness of various accidents and emissions that have taken place.  It is clear that, not only is the place itself unsafe structurally, but that its management are incompetent, that it should not be allowed to continue in existence.</P>
    <P>There is also the failure by this Government to properly fund our Nuclear Energy Board which is not in a position to properly monitor the radioactive levels in the atmosphere on our eastern coast or in our sea.  It has been pointed out that of the 22 staff employed by the Irish Nuclear Energy Board less than half are scientists and they are tied up totally in the licensing of various Irish enterprises which use radioactive materials of one kind or another.  It is totally inadequate for the Government to expect us to have confidence that we are being told the truth even by them in relation to the levels of radioactivity when they failed to provide adequate funding for our Nuclear Energy Board.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the only way in which to make Sellafield safe is to close it down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the motion in the name of Deputy V. Brady calling for the closure of Sellafield.  I listened with growing amazement to the Minister of State, Deputy E. Collins, some moments ago.  Since his appointment as Minister of State he has acted as spokesman for the Government on this issue.  Indeed, he and they have acted as nothing less than apologists for the British Government and for British Nuclear Fuels Limited.  Fianna Fáil have continuously raised this issue.  Continuously the Minister of State has defended the British Government and British Nuclear Fuels Limited.  For example, in this House on <Col N="1807" /> 22 January 1985 the Minister of State had the gall to accuse the Leader of our party of being alarmist when he asked for the closure of Sellafield.  The answer given by the Minister of State in January 1985 was that there was no danger to people living in Ireland from discharges from Sellafield. That was his educated comment at that time.  My colleague, Deputy G. Brady, raised the matter in July 1983 when he was accused of hysteria, of trying to excite the Irish people about it.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of deep regret that the Government could not come with Fianna Fáil, with this House, on the issue of the closure of Sellafield.  They have introduced an amendment which merely calls for more independent inquiries and inspections.  The health of our people is at risk here.  That is the question we are discussing here this evening.  Surely it is something in respect of which the Irish Government should not be tied to the apron strings of London.  Rather they should go along with this House, calling for the closure of Sellafield.  In their heart of hearts I know there are many Members on the Fine Gael benches who believe that constitutes the only way forward.  To say that the European Commission are being asked to help us in this matter is not sufficient.  The European Parliament set the headline for this Government when they called unanimously for the closure of Sellafield.  Why not the Irish Government?  Are the Irish Government not prepared to stand up to the British Government and say that they want that plant closed down?</P>
      <P>It is not today or yesterday that the Fianna Fáil Party have been calling for its closure.  On 30 May 1984, on the Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution, I said in this House that in accepting the motion the House should call on the Government to put pressure on the British to have that nuclear processing plant closed down.  We must remember all of the lies we have been told over the years by British Nuclear Fuels Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our election programme &mdash; Power Back to the People &mdash; for the local elections <Col N="1808" /> in 1985, a programme which received massive support right across the country, we said specifically that the British Government must cease discharging radioactive materials into the Irish Sea. We said Fianna Fáil believed that the disposal of radioactive materials from Sellafield, formerly Windscale, constituted a threat to the people and the marine life on the east coast of Ireland and that it must cease immediately.  That is the view we have been putting forward continuously.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State talked about significant meetings in London with the Minister for Energy.  He referred to one meeting in particular, in February 1984. Let me remind the House exactly what emerged from that meeting, a meeting held between Mr. Patrick Jenkin and the Minister for Energy, Deputy Spring. After the meeting the Minister for Energy said he was particularly satisfied with the talks, that Mr. Jenkin had reassured him that an incident such as last year's could not happen again, according to <i>The Irish Times</i> of 18 February 1984.  He said that scientific evidence available to date did not indicate adverse effects for the Irish people.  Yet the Irish Government are prepared to believe the British Government on this issue.  What was significant about the meeting of February 1984?</P>
    <P>We are told now by the Minister of State that we will have prompt notification of incidents.  There is little use in prompt notification of a major disaster at Sellafield.  We will get notification all right.  It will be a flash in the sky; that is what our notification will be.  There will be no group meetings, no monitoring committees, no more studies to be undertaken then such as the Minister of State talks about.  I might talk now as chairman of Dublin County Council.  Dublin County Council in November last called unanimously on the British Government to close Sellafield, a unanimous decision taken by the Fine Gael, Labour, Fianna Fáil and The Workers' Party members on Dublin County Council.  It should be remembered that it is we on the east coast who will be affected by it, particularly in <Col N="1809" /> the Dublin region.  I know I speak on behalf of the people of Dublin in demanding that this plant be closed down.</P>
    <P>A number of people have already referred to the fact that the Irish Sea is the largest recorded source of radioactive discharge in the world, that it is really a radioactive cesspool.  The only solution that will bring peace of mind and security of health to our people as far as radioactive materials are concerned is the closure of Sellafield.  The Minister has been conned by the British Government.  He has allowed himself be conned.  The Irish people will never forgive a Government who allow themselves to be conned by a British Government, to play footsey with them in relation to something which is so serious not only to the lives of this but also the next generation, as has been evidenced by the well documented incidents with regard to Dundalk.  There has been the high incidence of Down's Syndrome children born to the girls who were pupils in Dundalk at that time, resulting from the emission from Windscale as it was known at that time.</P>
    <P>The Minister will never be forgiven by the Irish people for playing along with the British Government on this issue. This is not the time to be cuddling up to London.  This is the time when the Irish Government have a responsibility to stand on their own feet and follow the best interests of the Irish people.  Nobody can argue but that the best interests of the Irish people will be served by closing Sellafield.</P>
    <P>What is Sellafield, a plant that is closer to Dublin city than Galway?  It appears that we are prepared to go along with the British Government, and their mouthpiece, British Nuclear Fuels, a company who have consistently lied and were found guilty by a British court of telling lies in regard to the dangers of Sellafield. The Minister referred to the Black report, a most disreputable report which was based on wrong assumptions and figures which were given to Professor Black by British Nuclear Fuels.  That has since been admitted.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, and the Government, even at this late stage, to <Col N="1810" /> withdraw their amendment so that a single call can go from this sovereign Parliament to the British Government and British Nuclear Fuels seeking the closure of Sellafield.  Only a closure of that plant will do away with the passage of ships carrying nuclear waste from every country in the world in the Irish Sea. How can we be guaranteed that an accident will not take place in the Irish Sea, that a ship will not sink or that something will not go wrong?</P>
    <P>Instead of Sellafield being wound down investment has been increased to cater for countries like Japan which has the biggest nuclear industry in the world.  We have had an expansion at Sellafield rather than a reduction in its operations and our Government are prepared to go along with the British on this.  The Minister in the House is prepared to accuse us of being alarmist and hysterical about this issue.  In the past three and a half years the Minister was lied to, as he has since admitted, but he is prepared to go along with the deception of British Nuclear Fuels.  He is prepared to be led along and conned by the British Government and BNF.  The honourable thing for the Irish Government is to unite the House on the Fianna Fáil motion and call on the British Government to close Sellafield.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Fianna Fáil motion demanding the closure of Sellafield. Coming from a constituency like Wexford it is only natural that I should have an interest in the nuclear industry and its related problems considering that some years ago we had many heated debates about a proposal to erect a nuclear power station at Carnsore Point. I am glad that the determination and courage of the Wexford people won the day and that we do not have to worry about such a prospect.  Having rejected such a facility it is galling to find that we are being contaminated by a nuclear plant across the sea which is of no benefit in the short or long term to the Irish people. It is totally objectionable that Irish people should have the health and <Col N="1811" /> environment of the nation under continuous danger and threat from the mismanagement of a nuclear station in a foreign land.</P>
      <P>Besides the danger from the plant there is another area of concern clearly realted to its operation.  Sellafield and Cap de la Hague in France are the only two reprocessing plants in western Europe.  Sellafield is a dumping ground for nuclear waste from other nuclear plants throughout the world.  Clearly the nuclear industry is big business for British Nuclear Fuels and the making of massive profits is clearly their motivation.  They are not one bit concerned about the relevant dangers to their workforce, the health of our people or the protection of our environment.</P>
      <P>The Irish Sea is being used frequently for the transportation of deadly nuclear waste from different parts of the world to Sellafield.  What happens if an accident occurs during this movement in the Irish Sea?  Not only will the Irish Sea and the Irish coast be ruined with determental effects on the livelihood of fishermen but, most important of all, it will have grave effects on the health of our people.  There were many illegal discharges from the reprocessing plant at Sellafield.  The Irish Sea is regarded as the most heavily polluted and as containing the highest level of radioactivity in the world.  Half a tonne of plutonium 239 has been deposited in the Irish Sea and, according to experts, a millionth of a gram is lethal to an individual. Discharges have been many times less at a more modern reprocessing plant at Cap de la Hague in France.</P>
      <P>The beach at Sellafield has been closed to the public since December 1983 as dangerous and studies have shown a higher incidence of leukaemia up the west coast of Scotland which is directly in the path of currents.  Radiation is 10-100 times higher on the east coast of Ireland than on the west.  Incidence of cancer is closely linked to the dumping of radioactive waste.  They are all genuine reasons why the plant should be closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>British Nuclear Fuels have used high powered public relations to con the <Col N="1812" /> people.  They spent massive amounts of money in the process and conned the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government. At Sellafield there has been a leak a week, fires and numerous incidents involving toxic fuel, corroded containers, radioactive leaks and dumping into the Irish Sea.  Different medical opinions say that leukaemia, cancer and incidence of Down's Syndrome in babies can be linked to such fall-outs and leaks.</P>
    <P>The EC Commission, the guardians of EC treaties, are duty bound to take action against the British for allowing Sellafield to be a continuous danger to the public.  A few years ago we had Windscale but then it was changed to Sellafield. One wonders why it was decided to change the name.  Was it an effort to confuse and con the public even more?</P>
    <P>The plant at Sellafield is a time bomb ticking away with enormous potential dangers for our people and our environment. Incidents at the plant have become a weekly occurrence and, unless there is an immediate closure of the plant, sooner rather than later there will be a major human catastrophe.  The inept management of Sellafield is an international disgrace. The management have deceived the general public by telling lie after lie about happenings at the plant.  We have had cover up after cover up and the appalling practice of using the Official Secrets Act to silence the workers at the plant.</P>
    <P>The British Prime Minister's dismissive attitude to the Taoiseach in saying that no problem exists at Sellafield smacks of an arrogant scant disregard for Irish men and women that should not have been tolerated by any Taoiseach or Government. We are not a nation of foolish gombeen people who will allow any British Prime Minister, or her cohorts, to hang the dangers of nuclear activity over our heads forever.</P>
    <P>The Government's amendment is a bit of a joke and shows their total lack of sincerity towards the Irish people. Despite the fact that most Deputies on the Government side agree with our motion and have spoken in that vein inside and outside the House, the Minister and the Government have decided <Col N="1813" /> cynically to oppose our motion.  That type of cynicism has resulted in people outside having a low regard for politicians in general. The Government should support our motion.  Already the EC have demanded the closure of Sellafield.  What is needed tonight is a unanimous call from the House demanding the closure of the Sellafield time bomb.  We owe it to this and future generations to take action now to ensure the safety of their health and the protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>The one issue that most young people are aware of at present is the danger of nuclear activity.  They have not been impressed by the Government's actions, or, indeed, lack of action, in demanding that the British Government close down Sellafield. As custodians of the nation the Government are duty bound to protect the health and welfare of this and future generations from dangerous situations such as that at Sellafield.  They should demand the immediate closure of the plant by the British Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a representative of a constituency that is probably the most exposed of all constituencies on the east coast.  In County Louth medical research was carried out on the possibility of a link between a leak from Windscale, as it was then called, and Down's Syndrome babies born to women who were at school in Dundalk in the mid-fifties.  There was a great fear that the link between Down's Syndrome births, various cancers and the close proximity of the nuclear processing plant in Sellafield was due to emissions from Sellafield.  People in County Louth, County Down and those living all around the coast are very concerned.  Is there not a very strong case to be made for the closure of Sellafield until such time as an international body of scientists have had an opportunity to assess the impact of the various leaks to date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently a general practitioner in the Dundalk area claimed that the rate of stillbirths in her practice was above the national average.  Does that not call for an immediate investigation of the impact of the leaks from Sellafield?  It is time to <Col N="1814" /> set up a body which will examine all the GP practices along the east coast to identify the level and causes of stillbirths in that area.  Are adequate monitoring methods employed by the Nuclear Energy Board?  Can they satisfy the people that all is well?  The evidence and statistics given to the Black committee were subsequently found to be inaccurate. Why was it necessary to distort the facts and to indulge in a public relations exercise to mislead the people of Britain and Ireland?</P>
    <P>What effect will this have on our fishing industry on which so many people depend?  There is great potential for development and expansion in that industry but the emissions from Sellafield will not encourage confidence in this area.  The Government will have to demand that the plant is closed until satisfactory regulations can be imposed to ensure that there will be no further leaks. If there was a major leak which caused a catastrophe with great loss of life, who would take responsibility for it?  The Government?  British Nuclear Fuels or the British Government?  The Minister has a duty to tell us where that responsibility lies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my party's call to close Sellafield now.  I speak as a Deputy representing part of Bull Island, Sutton, Howth and Baldoyle.  Last Sunday I had the pleasure of attending the opening of an interpretative centre on Bull Island. It was very interesting and a large crowd turned up.  Of course Bull Island is one of the finest bird sanctuaries and nature preservations in the world and it is also a major leisure and recreation centre for Dublin's northside.  In that sense it is a vital and precious amenity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned, as many are, about the silting up of the lagoon and the possible loss of the salt marshes and the waterways.  In the course of discussions last Sunday, I raised questions about the rods which had been installed there to measure silting.  The rods were installed &mdash; and this is very important &mdash; to measure the rate at which silting was occurring and I discovered that these rods had been <Col N="1815" /> abandoned.  The scientists are now using tests to measure radioactivity in the silt as a means of monitoring the build-up of the silt.  The radioactivity can be measured and comes directly from the caesium discharged from Sellafield.  The work on this is being carried out by Trinity College.</P>
    <P>Since 1979, because they know what the emissions are from Sellafield, based on the published data, they can predict the levels of radioactivity to be found in the silt in the lagoon.  I am not talking about silt on the other side of the Irish Sea but silt on Dublin beaches.  Using these samples they can fix the time when the silt was laid down because of the amount of radioactivity recorded.  The figures correspond very well although they are not exact.  It is a good basis for guidance on the silting rate and more satisfactory than the rods which were dispensed with.  They do cross-checks with the caesium radioactivity in seaweed and fish to see how things stand and to check their levels.  Therefore, we measure the radioactivity coming from Sellafield and the sand and silt on Dollymount are radioactive.  We know that that radioactivity is coming directly from Sellafield to Bull Island.  This requires immediate action as these discharges must stop.</P>
    <P>Mrs. Thatcher said that the average level of radioactivity is one tenth of the 1 per cent in Britain but this is the average over the whole population.  Those in Cumbria are obviously in a much worse situation.  She then said that the average for Ireland is lower but we are concerned about the east and north east coasts where the concentration is greater.  Such statements are misleading and we are seriously concerned regarding the people who are directly exposed to leukaemia and Down's Syndrome in Louth, Dublin and possibly Antrim.</P>
    <P>At Sellafield, specifically at Calderhall, the reactors are 30 years old and have gone beyond their economic life.  This is a very high risk area to which Deputy Burke referred.  It is apparently Britain's only source of plutonium and that is why it is still used.  New deliveries of nuclear <Col N="1816" /> waste from Japan should be stopped and I join with our party in demanding that the Government call on the British Government to close Sellafield.  If they do not close the plant, Britain should be taken to the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague.  An immediate public inquiry should be conducted into the radioactive levels and/or safety of the environment, including the beaches.  I ask the Government to support our motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I have only a few minutes, I will be as concise as I can. While I will be supporting the efforts of the Minister for Energy to persuade the British authorities to take urgent steps to clean up Sellafield and while I applaud the speed with which the Minister has acted in this matter, I believe that Sellafield should be closed.  Credit must be given to our colleague, Deputy Brady, for the way in which he consistently highlighted the dangers of Sellafield over the years.  If this plant is not closed there will be a disaster and we have the right to demand its closure because we are at risk. There are no conceivable benefits to be gained in return for that risk, no jobs, no exports, no added value, no balance of payments benefits and no military advantages. All we get from Sellafield is the ever-increasing risk of a major health or environmental catastrophe.  There is a maxim in the English common law which if Deputy Wilson were here he could translate.  That maxim is <i>sic utere tuo ut aut alienum non laedas</i>. It means &ldquo;Thus shall you use your own property that you do not thereby cause from it a nuisance and danger to the property of your neighbour.&rdquo; Surely that is very applicable to the British scene in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sellafield is a plant containing some of the most dangerous materials known to man.  It is built in the vicinity of a geological fault.  Its design is totally out of date and it uses technology which is obsolete by several generations.  In addition, the plant is run by people who are both dishonest and incompetent.  It is clear that we are living uncomfortably close to a time bomb and one that is ticking louder <Col N="1817" /> by the day.  I realise also that Sellafield is the property of a sovereign foreign Government and that our capacity to coerce that Government to do something they do not wish to do is limited.  It is easy to demand closure knowing well that it is not within the capacity of our Government to deliver on that demand.</P>
    <P>Nuclear energy has the capacity to destroy our world several times over either through military means or even military accidents but even the nuclear energy which is supposed to be designated for entirely peaceful purposes has that same capacity.  The closest we have come to a major nuclear accident was in the nuclear station used for generating electricity at Three Mile Island in the US. Even if we manage to avoid calamity by way of accident or confrontation, we are storing up certain catastrophe in the treatment and management of nuclear waste.  I trust that one day the world will realise that nuclear power must be dispensed with but for generations after that happened the world will have to live with the waste that has been accumulated, never knowing when or where it will surface.</P>
    <P>No one will convince me that the consequences of the plant have not been witnessed already both here and in the UK.  The high incidence of leukaemia in the vicinity of Sellafield and the abnormal incidence of Down's Syndrome in the Dundalk region after a Sellafield fire in the fifties have been linked closely with the plant.  The reassuring noises by British Nuclear Fuels about these and other incidents can be described only as pathetic and transparently hypocritical.  I notice a report that a fish and chip shop in the North of England were advertising their wares with the caption: &ldquo;No fish sold here from the Irish Sea.  All fish here is from the North Sea.&rdquo;  That gives some idea of the implications for our fishing industry, a factor referred to by Deputy Kirk.</P>
    <P>There is a tragic irony in the findings of the UK House of Commons committee report published today to the effect that Sellafield essentially is not necessary. Therefore, I would argue that additional <Col N="1818" /> monitoring of the position is essential and that the review and monitoring should be carried out with a maximum of environmental expertise as opposed to nuclear expertise and that that emphasis should be relied on by the Government in their deliberations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>After that contribution I expect confidently that Deputy Taylor will be voting for our motion.  The Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant is and has been demonstrated to be a positive menace to human life on both sides of the Irish Sea.  A major accident there could have horrendous consequences and there have been sufficient incidents to confirm the likelihood of such an accident. Serious accidents today happen on oil rigs, on space missions, in chemical plants and indeed in nuclear power stations. Modern technology cannot eliminate the risk of such accidents.  There is, however, a crucial difference between most of the type of accidents I have mentioned and an accident in a nuclear reprocessing plant such as Sellafield.  However tragic the immediate consequences of these other disasters, their effects are usually confined to those involved and are of limited duration and local impact. Plutonium, however, is one of the deadliest substances known to man, with a life of thousands of years.  The dispersal of plutonium into the atmosphere or into the sea could have widespread catastrophic consequences which would last, for all intents and purposes, not for ten or 50 years but forever.  That is not being either fanciful or alarmist.  It is the factual reality and even though a mistake could have such an unthinkable outcome, mistakes continue to be made at this benighted plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish public must look at the performance and the credibility of the different bodies involved in this matter: the British Government and the management of the Sellafield plant, British Nuclear Fuels, the Irish Government and the Irish Nuclear Energy Board.  With regard to the British Government, we regrettably have to have grave doubts about their bona fides.  Presumably they <Col N="1819" /> see this plant as affecting Britain's national security and, therefore, feel justified in dealing with the matter in a certain way.</P>
    <P>The British Prime Minister's reply to the Taoiseach's representations must be regarded as unsatisfactory.  It fails entirely to address the question of the competence of the Sellafield management or to provide guarantees of the future safety of the plant.  It amounts to no more than a bland, anodyne attempt to say &ldquo;that there is nothing to worry about&rdquo;.  That sort of assurance could be accepted about many matters of mutual concern to the Irish and British Governments which are of ordinary everyday significance.  But it will not do where something as chilling as the prospect of a major nuclear explosion and fallout is involved.</P>
    <P>This is not something of purely British domestic interest or responsibility.  The Irish people North and South have an entirely legitimate interest in the health and environmental effects of a major nuclear complex facing them across the Irish Sea and which, as has been mentioned, is nearer to us than the city of Galway.  That interest has been recognised and endorsed by the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>This is not something to be dealt with unilaterally by Britain, nor should our approach be on the basis of either intercession or concession.  We are entitled to be involved directly as of right.  There is already good evidence accepted by the most reputable doctors and scientists that radiation was responsible for an unusual cluster of Down's Syndrome babies in this country.  Radioactive elements from Sellafield have been found all the way up the west coast of Scotland and much further afield.  As Deputy Woods has pointed out some such elements have been found at Dollymount which is in the heart of this city.</P>
    <P>The Black report of 1984 was a classic instance of an establishment whitewash and a cover-up based on data supplied by BNFL that was inaccurate by a magnitude of not one, ten or 20 but of 50 <Col N="1820" /> times.  Black refused to draw the obvious conclusion that the plant was to blame for the high incidence of leukaemia deaths in the area.</P>
    <P>When I attacked the Black report and called for the closure of the plant at the end of July 1984 because it was responsible for contamination which as I said then bordered on a crime against the people on both sides of the Irish Sea, my remarks were called intemperate, illinformed and as reflecting on the integrity of Sir Douglas Black by a BNFL spokesman who went on to say: &ldquo;I don't think anybody would question the thoroughness or the authority of the team under the chairmanship of such an eminent medical expert&rdquo;.  So thorough indeed was the Black report that it ignored data which we know now from the British Prime Minister's letter, were published back in the fifties.</P>
    <P>The management of this plant, British Nuclear Fuels, have been guilty of duplicity, deception and lies during a long period.  For a while they sought to persuade the public it was quite safe to bathe at Sellafield.  Two days after a radioactive slick was noticed at sea, BNFL announced that beaches were safe.  A month later with radioactivity levels 100 to 1,000 times higher than normal 25 miles of beaches were declared unsafe, and they have remained so ever since.</P>
    <P>On 30 July 1984 a BNFL spokesman stated the following: &ldquo;What we are saying and I think what is demonstrably proven, is that the amount of discharges for which we are responsible are very carefully authorised and limited by independent government departments&rdquo;.  Forty eight hours later the British Director of Public Prosecutions decided to prosecute BNFL for unauthorised discharges.  In January nearly half a tonne of plutonium was discharged without authorisation into the Irish Sea.  A couple of weeks later a plutonium mist was released into the atmosphere. At first it was said two workers were affected and then it was admitted that there were 15 affected.</P>
    <P>The whole string of accidents, which are occurring with increasing frequency indicate incompetent management and a <Col N="1821" /> state of affairs which must be regarded as totally unacceptable.  We cannot trust any assurances that have been or will be given by these dangerously reckless and dishonest people at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>This Coalition Government have consistently adopted a complacent, blind-eye approach, refusing to acknowledge the danger to the Irish people and to act on the basis of such acknowledgement.  The Tánaiste and Labour Party Leader, Deputy Spring, went across to London on 17 February 1984 for a meeting with the British Environment Secretary. Afterwards he said he was &ldquo;particularly satisfied with the talks&rdquo; and that Mr. Jenkin had reassured him that an incident such as happened in November 1983 &mdash; this was a radioactive slick at sea &mdash; could not happen again.</P>
    <P>When I attacked the Black report, and said: &ldquo;These figures alone would in my view justify closing down the plant immediately for further investigation and certainly putting a lot of people in jail who have clearly been telling us lies over the past four or five years about this matter&rdquo;, the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Liam Kavanagh, called this unnecessarily alarmist and said about the level of radioactivity in the Irish Sea: &ldquo;It's quite sufficient for safety&rdquo;.  But a British House of Commons committee today tells us: &ldquo;Sellafield has made the Irish Sea the most radioactive sea in the world&rdquo;.  I was right.  They should have been put in jail then and they should still be put in jail, if this Government were doing their duty.</P>
    <P>On 22 January 1985, the Minister of State, Deputy Eddie Collins also accused me of being &ldquo;alarmist&rdquo; and made this familiar statement: &ldquo;There's no danger to people living in Ireland from discharges from Sellafield&rdquo;.  He has the audacity to come into this House tonight and try to persuade us that he has been active in this matter.</P>
    <P>The role played by the Nuclear Energy Board in regard to Sellafield must be severly criticised.  They have totally failed to discharge their responsibility. The fact that such a board existed would entitle the public to believe that their <Col N="1822" /> interests were being looked after and protected. In fact, the very opposite was the case.  The board, to their discredit, allowed themselves to be used as part of the general smokescreen.  They continued to utter platitudes and assure us that all was well and that the critics were irresponsible alarmists.  Only now when the truth can no longer be concealed are they prepared to admit the danger.</P>
    <P>In my view there is an urgent need to replace this facade of a board with something different and effective.  A board of this kind might have had a role in supervising the nuclear power station which Deputy Desmond O'Malley campaigned so vigorously for when he was Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if it had been built.  Fortunately it was not, as Deputy John Browne points out.  What we need instead now is a board or an agency attached to the Department of Health whose responsibility will be to monitor the whole nuclear radiation situation in the interest of the health of the people and that alone.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have been very much aware of the danger that Sellafield represented to the people of this country over a long period and have been doing everything in their power to alert public attention and to persuade this reluctant Government to act, but to no avail.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy Gerard Brady, who has rightly been praised for his activities in this regard, and myself have raised the issue on a number of occasions.  Ógra Fianna Fáil have organised public meetings because our young people are very concerned about this matter.  Deputy Jim Tunney, in his capacity as Lord Mayor of Dublin, arranged a special conference of the heads of local authorities along the east coast to discuss the matter and to convey their anxieties in regard to it.</P>
    <P>Unbelievable though it might seem to any sane rational person there are now plans costing £3 billion for a major expansion of reprocessing in the early nineties. The Irish Government who have had full details of the proposed expansion for some considerable time must have this stopped.  It is lunacy, madness.  The expansion of Sellafield would mean the <Col N="1823" /> passage of foreign ships carrying nuclear waste up and down the Irish Sea, thus enhancing the risk of a nuclear accident close to our shores.</P>
    <P>We do not hesitate to call for the complete closure of Sellafield.  There are international precedents for this.  The Austrians voted not to commission a brand new nuclear power station at Zwentendorf and the Swedes voted to phase out nuclear power by the early nineties.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament in a resolution put forward by the Fianna Fáil members and passed called on the British Government to stop all further discharges of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea and that the plant be closed until certain standards are met.</P>
    <P>In asking the Dáil to accept our motion, I think it is important that I remind Deputies of exactly what Sellafield is, lest there be any lingering belief that we are dealing with a simple civilian plant which does no more than produce useful electricity.  Sellafield is a nuclear, military installation as well as a civilian plant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>And was so when Deputy Haughey was Taoiseach and Minister for Health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should take his medicine.  Sellafield is used to store nuclear material for military as well as civil purposes.  Nuclear material is reprocessed there for military use in the form of plutonium.  Approximately 0.5 million gallons of toxic nuclear waste, caesium, uranium and plutonium containing radioactive elements are pumped into the Irish Sea every year.  Sellafield is the dirtiest nuclear plant in the world and has been described by the British House of Commons committee that I mentioned as &ldquo;the largest dispenser of nuclear waste into the environment in the world&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A whole catalogue of incidents, particularly in the last two and a half years, shows that the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant is not safe, while medical <Col N="1824" /> studies are showing unusual concentrations of cancer deaths and natal abnormalities, not only in the vicinity of Sellafield but on this side of the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>That is the type of installation we are talking about.</P>
    <P>Because of the nature of Sellafield, I do not think the Government are being fair to the Irish people in asking the Dáil to substitute their vague amendment for our positive motion.  If Dáil Éireann were to accept the Government amendment it would simply acquiesce in a continuance of the fudging of this issue, a fudging which has already gone on for far too long.  It would condone the ongoing concealment of this very real danger at Sellafield. That is what the Government amendment will amount to.  Let there be no mistake or illusion about it.</P>
    <P>All the Government amendment does is ask for support for discussions with a view to establishing a process to determine whether Sellafield can operate safely.  My friend, Deputy John Kelly, would have no hesitation in describing that as fatuous guff, if he were here.  That is totally inadequate.  We already know that Sellafield cannot operate safely.  The overwhelming evidence is there.  We do not need any more discussion, inspection or monitoring.  What we need is a clear-cut decision to close down this proven menace to the health and safety, not just of Irish people but of British people as well.</P>
    <P>Would it not be absurd, if the European Parliament were to &ldquo;recognise the extreme concern felt by the Irish authorities and the people who live on the eastern seaboard of Ireland who are under constant serious threat of contamination&rdquo;, while the Irish Government and Dáil Eireann merely pass a motion which refers only to the Irish public's concern at a number of incidents, which they say are of limited radiological impact?  Is it the case that the majority of MEPs in Strasbourg care more about the risks to the Irish people from Sellafield than the majority of Deputies in this House?  Let us see when the time comes to vote if that is the position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1825" /> This matter transcends party affiliations and allegiances, this is a matter of the health and possibly even the lives of Irish citizens.  We need a clear-cut demand from Dáil Éireann in the interests of the people.  Such a demand will have an effect.  It cannot be ignored.  It will give the Irish Government the lever they require to deal with this menace.</P>
    <P>Deputies should not look upon this as a parochial or insular matter.  The dangers of nuclear radiation and the possibility of a nuclear explosion are world issues.  People everywhere understand what is involved.  Dáil Éireann can establish its reputation internationally in this field in the eyes of concerned millions of citizens and groups everywhere around the world as an enlightened legislature if it takes this clear and positive decision. It will give a headline for others to follow. I can guarantee every Deputy that if we take this clear decision it will be hailed around the world as something of great importance and significance.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Deputies on all sides to take a broad and responsible view of this motion and to vote for it.  I also even at this eleventh hour appeal to the Government in the interests of the safety and security of the Irish people not to press <Col N="1826" /> their amendment.  It does not meet the situation.  The people are demanding that this dangerous plant be closed and that this threat to their well-being be removed. The realistic truth is that our health and safety cannot be guaranteed except by closure.  The leaks, discharges and emissions are serious in themselves and a major worry, but they are much more significant as proof of the incompetence and dishonesty of the management of Sellafield, the dangerous, faulty nature of the plant and the real risk of an explosion.</P>
    <P>I do not know if many Deputies experience, as I do, a very real feeling of anger when I consider the enormity of this situation and what we Irish people are being asked to tolerate.  It is already late in the day, but not too late if this motion is passed.  If it is not passed, I would be deeply concerned about the future. Deputies have a very real and definite personal responsibility to exercise here tonight, on behalf of the people who elected us, to look after their welfare in precisely this sort of situation.  I appeal to every responsible Deputy in this House to vote for our motion and to the Government to withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I had already pointed out that the thrust of this Bill was to redirect the aims and objects of the Industrial Development Authority.  I commended the Minister for his efforts to consolidate existing industrial legislation, to bring these matters up to date and try to formulate a policy for the future.  In particular, the Bill gives effect to the value of the greatest asset that we have now, which is an educated young workforce.  This means that there will be greater stress laid on keeping apace with modern technology and, on the other hand, recognising the value of the old traditional industries for this economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1831" /> The IDA for a number of years have followed the glamour industries.  The Minister in his appointment to the board of the Authority has included new members who will give recognition to the old and the new.  He has appointed people well known in traditional industry and also a director from a company established in the town of Ennis, a company which utilises well the facilities offered by the State.  Joint work has been done with the universities and the workforce. Much research and development have been completed jointly.  New products have been patented which are first in their field.  This should provide additional jobs in the future and put Ireland at least on the way to improving its position in the technological league.</P>
    <P>When examination is made of our industrial tradition we find that investment has been made by the State and to some extent there has not been a review of how the funds have been utilised or whether any additional progress can be made.  In this Bill the Minister has taken cognisance of this and has provided for a review within the Department which will examine from time to time the progress being made by the Industrial Development Authority.  That is a progressive proposal and I was surprised that Deputies on the other side said that no fundamental examination should be made of the way in which that Authority are proceeding about their charge.  Whether that examination is done in Kildare Street or, if decentralisation of the Department goes through and the work is done in Limerick, the taxpayer at least has a cushion in that the Department of Trade and Commerce will in the future examine the progress being made on the industrial development front.</P>
    <P>This State cannot be totally dependent on an agency like the Industrial Development Authority.  We must make our own efforts to resolve the huge unemployment problem.  We must have confidence in ourselves.  This Government have made strenuous efforts to get economic conditions right.  They have reduced inflation. <Col N="1832" /> It is hoped that costs will come down for such major items as electricity and fuel and that the cost of funding will be reduced, especially because of international trends, and that interest rates will fall.  Those who lend money to this country have confidence in the economy, otherwise they would not continue to allow us to borrow at the rate that we have done.</P>
    <P>For the future, the combination of policies pursued by the Industrial Development Authority, the Department of Finance and any of the other agencies, such as the Department of Labour, who assist in providing manpower policy will in the long run see us through the next century.  Our future lies in a mixture of the traditional and the new.  I appeal to the Industrial Development Authority, as newly constituted, to formulate in their policy a greater combination of traditional industries and small indigenous industries.  When Deputy O'Malley first proposed a greater emphasis on indigenous industry there were many sceptics.  I am afraid that I was one of those because I believed that much of the progress that had been made here on the employment scene in the sixties was a result of the investment made by the State in the Industrial Development Authority and its back-up.  The people were not able to take advantage of the liquidity which the new industries brought into certain areas and many people invested in the promotion of their social status rather than in manufacturing industry, and that was a distinct loss.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill and the powers it gives to the Minister will be the jumping off point for greater progress for the country as a whole.  I do not believe the Authority need more independence.  This House should have some means of updating the plans of the Authority from time to time. I wish the Minister well and I know the IDA will prove itself in the years to come.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to this debate and I hope Deputy Carey's final remarks on the IDA turn out to be true.  There has been a dearth of knowledge and ability in the <Col N="1833" /> field of job creation over the past number of years.  To all intents and purposes, it seems that the IDA, at a critical stage of development, have practically thrown in the towel.  They are ensconced in a £26 million building on the banks of the canal populated with people who do not know how to create jobs.</P>
      <P>The main problem facing the Government over the next 18 months is that of job creation on a massive scale.  We need a whole generation to work for the benefit of the country.  During the seventies the present Taoiseach and the present Leader of the Opposition were constantly telling us how great an asset our young people were, but that is not being said now because the truth is that that asset has become our greatest liability and we do not know how to deal with it.  For the first time since the famine we have a chance to get the whole population working together, the young, the old and those in between.  We used the sluice gates of emigration to solve our problems prior to 1922, when we had no control over our destiny, and since then, even though we had control over our destiny.  We turned a blind eye to the cream of our population going all over the world building other economies because we did not know how to put them to work here.  Very conveniently we forget about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this House today we had Members bragging, as they usually do, about the spread of our population, our missionaries and so on, all over the world but few seem to realise that that is a story of the failure of successive Governments since 1922.  Successive Governments have failed to provide employment for the whole population.  Another tragedy of the unemployment situation is that we have invested huge amounts of money in third level education, high technology industries and preparing young people through the institutes of higher education for the world of high technology.  We have some of the best qualified people in that area but we are preparing them for emigration.  We are giving them free, gratis and for nothing to countries which are short of labour and skills and which have not had to invest huge sums of <Col N="1834" /> money in education.  In 95 per cent of these cases, these people never come back.</P>
    <P>Members of this House have encouraged people to emigrate and to get experience. Many semi-State companies and private companies send their employees abroad for experience.  There is no need to send people abroad because most people who go away, particularly those who have to go away because they need employment and cannot afford to stay at home, are not likely to come back. Deputies who give this advice are usually referring to middle and upper middle class people who are going away for a few years to sow their wild oats and get experience.  They then come back to Ireland to take over daddy's business, or to continue in a specific profession.</P>
    <P>Disadvantaged people suffer from lack of opportunities and lack of education. Because so many of our young people emigrate, in the long run the country is the loser.  Young people are the life blood of the nation.  Without them the nation loses its vitality.  Most people in this House have experience of this.  We have all seen the depopulated parts of the country, particularly in the west and north-west.  These areas are denuded of their young people and the country has lost vitality.  Journalist John Healy in his book <i>No One Cried Stop,</i> serialised in <i>The Irish Times</i> in 1967, described what it was like when he grew up around Charlestown.  He spoke of the number of houses which had been closed up and the families and young people who had left our shores never to come back.</P>
    <P>No one cried stop in the fifties.  In fact, many politicians were very happy to see their problems being solved in this very unsavoury way.  The question to be asked now is: will anybody cry stop in the eighties?  In the fifties we lost the uneducated labouring class to the building sites in Britain, but nowadays that class of people are not emigrating because they will not be taken in other countries.  We are losing the educated classes.  A reason for the slowdown in the growth of the left wing parties may be that their natural <Col N="1835" /> support is no longer here.  The numbers of discontented people are growing.</P>
    <P>In the past week we have been discussing the Combat Poverty Bill and today the Social Welfare Bill.  We discover from statistics that 25 per cent of our population are in receipt of some form of social welfare benefit, that there is an unbelievable number of people existing below the poverty line and an increasingly large number who are unemployed who will never work again.  Indeed, the employable age is falling from the sixties down to the fifties so that even people now in their forties are thinking that they might never hold down another job.</P>
    <P>The importance of this Bill must be seen in perspective.  We must not hide from the problem of emigration if it is recurring.  Equally the IDA must not hide from their failures.  They must spell out exactly what are their plans for the future and what have been their successes over the past few years.  Three or four years ago it was the habit of the IDA to announce their job targets for the ensuing year.  As far as I know their last announced target was for a figure of 18,000 jobs which they failed to achieve by a figure of 8,000.  That practice was dropped.  It was announced that no longer would the IDA give job targets for the ensuing year because those targets could not be met realistically.</P>
    <P>Over the past 18 months there has been the most recent innovation, the announcement of jobs in clusters.  One sees a Minister announcing on behalf of the IDA the creation of 150 jobs in ten different counties.  For example, two weeks ago there was an announcement of 1,100 jobs, when people everywhere were delighted, thinking there was a huge number of jobs being created again.  But those 1,100 jobs were announced all over the country in tens, fifteens and twenties. The truth of the matter is that the IDA erred in going exclusively after the multinationals in the seventies, to the extent of investing tens of millions of pounds in multinationals like Ferenka in Limerick, Mostek in Blanchardstown and Fieldcrest <Col N="1836" /> in Kilkenny.  Then these places were closed down creating what can be described only as a haemorrhage in those areas. The workers in those plants had invested, had married, bought houses, committed themselves to mortgages and suddenly they were left with nothing.</P>
    <P>While that was the policy of the IDA, in America &mdash; to which we look for so much &mdash; it was not recognised that most of the jobs in America arose from small industries and businesses, an extraordinary figure of the order of 70 to 80 per cent.  The then Prime Minister of Britain, Mr. Harold Wilson, had changed his Government's policy, investing heavily in small businesses there.  The IDA have endeavoured to catch up in the last few years.  They should have admitted their earlier mistakes.  That is why we have experienced this public relations exercise over the last two years with radio and television advertisements showing, say, Johnny Murphy standing up and saying, &ldquo;I am Johnny Murphy, I received a grant from the IDA.  I started this little business and look at me now&rdquo;, that kind of thing. All of us have received copies of the annual reports of semi-State bodies. Enormous amounts of money are spent in the preparation of such glossy reports, showing how successful they have been. If one were to judge from these reports it would appear that each one has been a rip roaring success, at least according to their authors.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that we have a problem.  It is not insurmountable but we must first recognise that we have a problem, the most serious we have faced since we took over control of our own destiny.  Successive Governments have failed &mdash; we are not blaming them &mdash; but they have failed.  In the fifties we closed our eyes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am relating them to the White Paper on Industrial Policy which is about job creation, the bringing together of all of the different strands in <Col N="1837" /> that area.  We have been closing our eyes to the loss, through emigration, of much of our workforce.  In the fifties there were 500,000 people, out of a population of 2,275,000, a phenomenal number of people, but it gives the House an idea of the extent of the problems we experienced then and also of the extent of our failure to overcome it.  In the sixties we lost people through emigration at a rate of 20,000 per annum.  We have now the largest youngest population <i>pro rata</i> of any country in Europe.  That can be a liability or an asset depending on one's approach.  Industrial policy will solve some of the problems.  The White Paper on Industrial Policy, which gives rise to this Bill, is laudable in that it advocated a new direction, a new method of solving our employment problems.  But, of itself, it will not be sufficient.  We will not create sufficient jobs through industry and certainly not through manufacturing industry because workforces have been trimmed down.  For example, we were told in the last few days that 380 people out of a total workforce of 520 in Rowntree Mackintosh will lose their jobs through lack of competition and the state of our economy.  We must look elsewhere for these jobs.  We need imaginative schemes to put these young people to work. We need to do something not attempted before.  In an area like Dublin, where there is one-third of the population, we need to put tens of thousands of people to work.  One might ask, how does one do that?  We must devise some imaginative schemes that will put as many as 50,000 people back working.  We have a young generation seeking work, through whom we must regenerate our economy, giving them their heads.  To do that we should regard Dublin as a city well situated &mdash; in the midst of 60 million people on the islands of Britain and Ireland &mdash; making it the most attractive city for people to visit, a tourist, shopping, entertainment mecca.  To do that we need the co-operation of Aer Lingus because nobody will travel from any part of Britain to Ireland &mdash; certainly they will not come from London to Dublin &mdash; when they can travel to Amsterdam for £49.  We need <Col N="1838" /> the co-operation of the Irish Tourist Board, of the hotels federation, the shops and entertainment people.  What some people have not realised is that not only do we have the youngest population but we have enormous talent; we have the most talented young population of any country in Europe.  We lost practically everything, including our language, but what we did save were our music and folklore.  There is in our universities the best folklore collection of the entire world.  We must use those people as components of this project.  In order to do so we should start to rebuild the city of Dublin which is in tatters, about to crumble into the Liffey.</P>
      <P>In the past few weeks people have started to look at the city.  It may not be too late to start.  If we get projects going in Dublin we will be able to attract tens of thousands of tourists from Britain on package holidays.  Aer Lingus have a lot of capacity at week-ends because their business schedules do not operate then and that capacity could be used to bring visitors here.  However, because Aer Lingus are a very successful and go ahead company they have managed to use up that spare capacity at weekends by providing package holidays to Spain and the Canaries.  Other airline companies in Britain are prepared to fill that gap.  We can have people coming here for three or four day week-end holidays.  Those with more time to spend can tour the hinterland of Dublin, go to the garden of Ireland which is Wicklow, or visit Meath or Kildare.  Such people could hop down to Cork, Limerick or even Knock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such a venture has been very successful in North America.  I am aware that in one area they created as many as 50,000 jobs. One may ask: what is there to attract people to Dublin bearing in mind the high VAT rate and drink charges?  The Government have made a good job of many things.  They have set the base for development and expansion but they have not tried to do the job of businesses. We have to have some trust in the business community.  I accept that some elements of the Bill provide for incentives. <Col N="1839" /> The hotel industry have week-end packages costing, for example, £29.  Recently in Dublin we had a rugby match and a boxing match on the same day and because of the huge influx of visitors 452 extra jobs were created that week-end.</P>
    <P>If we rebuild our city, make our transport system work better, make the city more accessible to those who live in the suburbs and attract people from British cities we will create tens of thousands of new jobs.  While we are progressing with the inner city development programme we could create a lot of other jobs in the construction sector and the supply industry to that sector.  For example, it is worth stating that 95 per cent of all materials in the construction sector are manufactured in Ireland.  We manufacture everything from blocks to fabrics, curtain materials, carpets, glazing, plumbing needs, air conditioning and so on.  We can have a spin-off into the service sector, into the hotel industry and the area of entertainment.  They all feed off each other.  We can create an atmosphere of confidence that will get young blood flowing.  We can motivate each other, as happens in America.</P>
    <P>At the moment we are dragging each other down because 35 per cent of the population are on social welfare.  Many people are depressed because they do not see any prospect of getting another job. They do not have any confidence in the future and eke out a living from one week to another.  That is why we cannot depend entirely on the elements in the White Paper on Industrial Policy.  However, we must recognise that the up-dating that has taken place is essential.</P>
    <P>In the Bill there are provisions for new selectivity criteria for grant assistance by the IDA, new technology acquisition grants and the triennial review of national industrial performance which is very important.  At the same time we are taking advantage of consolidating all existing industrial development legislation in this Bill.  The Confederation of Irish Industry made positive comments about the White Paper on Industrial Policy.  The Minister picked up a lot of <Col N="1840" /> the suggestions made by that organisation and listened to complaints made by members of his own party.  On many occasions he was told about the atmosphere in business, in industry and some of the suggestions made have been taken on board.  Provisions in the Bill increase the degree of certainty by which industries can plan for the coming years.</P>
    <P>In 1984 the CII asked that the White Paper be complemented by policies to curb inflation and reward effort.  They said that if those two things were done and the new international recession was avoided the industrial growth targets were attainable.  The interesting thing is that looking at that comment two years on one will realise that one of the targets has been achieved extraordinarily successfully. Inflation has been reduced not only to the level of the comparative inflation rates in Europe but below them and we expect inflation to be below 4 per cent in the coming year.  We are in the process of rewarding effort.  It started with the budget.  It may be very small but the important thing is that we have begun the process.  We have also avoided the international recession.  The industrial target is to double the level of industrial output over the next ten years, almost twice the rate obtained in the past ten years.  That growth will depend on international trading conditions and domestic policies.</P>
    <P>We are on target to achieve that industrial output.  Time did not enable me to obtain information on that but I will do so before Committee Stage.  I am anxious to know the type of targets we are aiming at and the effect a doubling of the level of industrial output will have on our unemployment figures.</P>
    <P>The CII asked for the containment of domestically generated inflation to a rate no higher than our trading partners.  That has been achieved and, all things being equal, will hold for the coming year.  They outline the conditions that must exist to reward work, risk, investment and innovation at a personal level.  We have made a start on that road and we hope further improvements will be made during the year.  I hope considerable progress will <Col N="1841" /> be announced in the next budget.  It is worth noting that the high levels of personal taxation were caused by excessive public spending and that they have in turn reduced the incentive to work.  I do not think anybody can deny that.</P>
    <P>Public spending is another area that must be tackled.  It is another thorny subject and the Government have had to contend with many of those over the last number of years.  We have not closed our eyes to the problem and we have been criticised by this side of the House in many instances.  I criticised many things also, but that is the benefit of belonging to a party which can absorb critics who have the interest of the country at heart.</P>
    <P>Coalition Governments have often been criticised, and Deputy Lyons is the latest to do so.  He said that coalitions do not benefit the country and that we must be got rid of so that Fianna Fáil can get back to office to show us how the job should be done.  He said that there is lots of money to be invested and that the country is only waiting for them to come back.  However, he did not say how they would create jobs.  If Fianna Fáil are returned to office, it may be in the form of a coalition Government.  Having been in office for 16 years at one time, they could not cope with being the Opposition and they have not learned the art of being a good Opposition.  I hope they will make a better fist of being in a coalition Government then they did when they were a single party Government.  There are balances in a coalition Government and usually when conflicts arise the country is put first because, if one party tries to dominate another, it would not be in the interest of the country.  That is why there have been such good increases in social welfare payments and why we have managed to keep ahead of inflation.</P>
    <P>The only thing left to tackle now is job creation on a massive scale.  The IDA must rethink their policies and the Minister must use the powers which he is asking for in this Bill to be critical of them.  We have sacred cows which cannot even be discussed, and I was slated three or four years ago for daring to criticise the policies of the IDA.  I was merely pointing <Col N="1842" /> out that they had been going in the wrong direction and that they should switch from trying to attract multinationals and concentrate on small indigenous businesses. They have been doing that now for some time, although they have been slow in realising the potential in this area. There is nothing better than having people at the helm of business or industry running something which is the flagship of their operation.  If you are depending on a multinational company which has scores of other branches and similar industries in different countries they will be very quick to close down.</P>
    <P>We should also be very careful about the type of industry which we allow into the country and we should not be soft touches for industries which are not acceptable because of falling standards in Britain and the United States.  Often they will only locate in places like Puerto Rico and Third World countries where they can get away with low standards.  I refer particularly to chemical companies who would not set up here except for the fact that they get an easy ride.  I am talking about the Merck, Sharp and Dohmes of this world and the deleterious materials which emanate from these places.  I am also referring to the dangerous chemicals which they use and it saddens me that many people have prostituted themselves by pleading for these factories to be maintained around the country even though it costs the lives of humans and animals and is destroying the environment.  If that happens, there will be nothing left.</P>
    <P>Part of job creation has a lot to do with the environment and with tourism.  If tourism were being debated tomorrow half the Members would participate because of the areas they represent, and rightly so.  The reason we have a beautiful country is because there are not enough people to destroy it.  If there were enough people to destroy it our country would be in ruins and there would not be any fish on our rivers and lakes.  The countryside would be in ruins and there would not be any fish in our rivers and lakes.  The countryside would be polluted and destroyed and, if you do not believe me, <Col N="1843" /> the next time you drive around the country look into the ditches and dumps behind the beauty spots in every picturesque little town and village.  It is unbelievable. We are a most destructive and unappreciative people in regard to our environment.  It is incredible that we are living in the capital city beside one of the most picturesque cesspools in Europe which was described by George Bernard Shaw as more beautiful then the Bay of Naples &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will just finish that sentence by saying that Dublin Bay is a cesspool which must affect tourism.  We have destroyed whole stretches of our countryside such as the Liffey Valley in my constituency.  It is one of the most beautiful valleys in the country through which the Liffey flows to the bay and we are using it as the main dump for Dublin city and county.  The intention is to fill it up to the top from Chapelizod to Lucan. It is an absolute disgrace and a comment on the future of the country.  Big investment has been poured into the tourist industry and incentives have been given in the budget to encourge it, yet we are doing our best to destroy it.  I was glad that before the Minister left the Department he brought this Bill to the House and now that he is in the Department of Finance he will be able to appreciate better the programme that is ahead of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At last the message has got through that personal taxation was crippling individuals, ruining incentive and preventing expansion in industry.  We must be very careful about manufacturing and not rely too heavily on any one area.  Incentives are needed to encourage the faster growth rate that is needed to absorb the <Col N="1844" /> huge numbers who are unemployed.  We have learned the lesson about being competitive. Because inflation has been reduced and there is a decrease in interest rates and in energy costs we have a chance of achieving a faster growth rate. The reduced energy costs should be passed on quickly to the consumer generally and to industry.  While we must not rely totally on these factors, we must be prepared to take a chance.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of expertise available to the Government but while there might be an economic theorist in every Government Department it must be said that not many of those holding PhDs in economics become successful entrepreneurs, builders, developers or industrialists.</P>
    <P>In a short space of time there has been a miracle in terms of endeavour, concentration and unselfishness in sorting out everything, to the stage where we can create jobs on a massive scale but the Government have not told us how this can be achieved.  I am not saying this by way of criticism of this Bill.  The reason the advisers and others have not come forward with the answers is that they do not have the answers.  The new Cabinet task force who have been set up by the Government, while bearing in mind what they have to offer and being humble about their backgrounds, should be prepared to listen to those who have some experience in that area and listen to people from both inside this House and outside it who have practical experience.</P>
    <P>The books are in good enough order, inflation rates are low enough and interest rates are falling sufficiently to enable us to take the chance we must take.  This involves an imaginative scheme that will be fantastic enough to capture the imagination of the young generation who are crying out for the leadership that is necessary if we are to rebuild our country.  In this endeavour we are to spend hundreds of millions of pounds.  Despite the devastation that Belfast has suffered in the past 16 years it is ahead of us in terms of what we are to spend in rebuilding this city. Up to £300 million has been committed to rebuilding Belfast.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1845" /> We have a policy that has been formulated fairly quickly in respect of industry.  The Government with an input from backbenchers from the parties have decided to provide a package of incentives in relation to saving Dublin.  While I wish every success to the effort to develop Mountjoy Square and the docks area, I do not think the package is attractive enough to bring about the desired success. Despite the tax concessions and so on there is not enough incentive for people to become involved in the project. Despite the tremendous pressure exerted by the housing construction sector to invest all the money in that industry the Government courageously refused, saying that that industry should not lead, that the infrastructure should come first. It has been accepted that the policy of building 1,000 or 2,000 houses in an area, moving out and leaving behind 2,000 people without work was not sensible.</P>
    <P>The Opposition when in Government tried to stifle the incentives that existed by way of local authority housing and the Housing Finance Agency.  We have solved the housing crisis in this city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to expand the incentives that have been outlined in the matter of industrial policy because these are not sufficient to encourage people to risk their capital especially in intensive capital industry.  The rewards are not sufficient to encourage people in the manufacturing area to become involved. Home based business and industry should be given much more encouragement. The IDA should have an open arm policy towards entrepreneurs.  In the past number of years we have proved that we can stand shoulder to shoulder with the best anywhere.  One need only have regard to the success abroad of Irish trained executives and business people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two pronged approach of continuing to attract new overseas investment while assisting strong indigenous companies, <Col N="1846" /> whether large or small, has proved successful.  We need to keep ahead in terms of marketing and development. The policy of developing simultaneously Irish owned and foreign enterprise has worked well.  Since 1975 we have had a more rapidly growing output than has been the case of any other EC country or of the US or Japan.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is our biggest problem.  Perhaps we would have been able to contain the problem in this regard to an acceptable level if our population had not been so big.  However, tremendous efforts must be made to solve the unemployment problem.  The State must be concerned to get the best return on the investments it has made and the National Development Corporation should become active immediately in order to fill the gap in the area of equity participation. There was a lack of interest among the banking sector in providing risk capital or going into the risk area at all.  It is a disgrace that the Bank of Ireland, through their chairman, should have tried to adopt the 3 per cent premium for small businesses who wished to expand, but due to an outcry from Members of this House and from businesses they had to withdraw that suggestion.  It is very important that the Government should become involved through the setting up of the National Development Corporation but it now needs money to get it going.</P>
    <P>It is good to see this Bill before the House and to see that the policies set out in the White Paper on Industrial Policy have worked in such a short space of time.  All things are going well for us as far as the dollar is concerned and the staving off of the international recession. I agree with the policies outlined in the paper.  I know it is important, although we stressed it too much at one stage, to concentrate on the maximum number of jobs in manufacturing and services.  I do not want to list the objectives of the industrial policy but I will mention a couple of them such as maximising the value-added in industry and retaining the wealth created for further employment <Col N="1847" /> creating investment.  This is a factor the Minister stressed many times in different fora and he incorporated it in his policy. It is absolutely essential.  We might be thinking about the infamous black hole and the repatriation of profits and we need to give incentives to people to keep their money here, reinvest and create more jobs.  In the sixties and seventies we had a policy of attracting foreign business, giving them tax free incentives in order to get jobs.  We hoped that we would be able to learn the skills and set up our own businesses.  This formula, although it was criticised then, has actually worked quite well and we are reaping the benefits now.</P>
    <P>It is good to see that we have developed an internationally competitive sector. That was the biggest worry of all when we joined the EC and before we had started exporting to any great extent.  We had been used to the protection of tariffs on the small number of industries we had.  It was mentioned in regard to the National Development Corporation that they were to encourage the rapid development of natural resource-based industries and the natural resources themselves.  It is unfortunate that we have not really got going in that area but the Minister should take maximum advantage of the job creation opportunities available.  If natural resources are involved, they should be used.  Five hundred jobs could be created immediately if the Bula ore body were used.  There were 23,000 jobs created as a result of the North Sea oil programme and we could create thousands of jobs in that sector. The road programme is creating jobs but there are huge infrastructural projects where jobs could be created.  We could create a large number of jobs by building the proposed tunnels in Cork under the Lee.  We could create 3,700 jobs by undertaking city centre projects, building bus stations, developing the city, putting in a tunnel in Dublin.  Probably another 5,000 or 10,000 spin-off jobs would be created.  I do not know why the reasons we are shy to take on the afforestation programme have not been published, <Col N="1848" /> since 12,000 jobs could be created in that programme.  One of the Ministers of State had been pressing for a long time for this to be done.  It is now time to look at all these different prospects and get involved in them.</P>
    <P>In chapter 7 of the White Paper the development of industries based on agriculture and natural resources is mentioned but it goes on to mention only agriculture and processing, leaving out resources.  I realise that we could not get into the area of smelters and so on but there are dormant mines which could be reactivated.</P>
    <P>I know there is plenty of venture capital available outside this country for investment within it but there is a shortage of projects in which to invest.  If we could identify projects of that nature there would be no shortage of money in the venture capital area to get jobs going.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I also welcome the encouraging reviews of the national industrial performance.  I ask the Minister to take stock of the performance of the IDA and at the same time remember that we must have a massive job creation programme alongside the industrial programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate.  It is inevitable in the case of such a broad subject as industrial development that the contributions from Deputies will be varied and wide-ranging. A number of suggestions and ideas have been put forward and these will be taken into account.  The debate reflects the broad concensus in approach to industrial development that exists among the major political parties.  This has been advantageous in maintaining a stable environment for industry and in supporting the efforts of our industrial promotion agencies to attract overseas industries here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the former Minister said in his opening speech during this debate, the purpose of the Industrial Development Bill is to give effect, where appropriate by statute to the policy changes set out in the Government's White Paper on Industrial <Col N="1849" /> Policy and to consolidate existing legislation in the industrial development area. While the aims and future direction of our industrial policy have been clearly set out, the present Minister and I are anxious that policy must be dynamic, reflecting the changing needs and realities in relation to industrial development and its potential for maximising sustained employment and output growth.</P>
    <P>In fact, a policy review of developments since publication of the White Paper is already under way within my Department.  Under section 6 of the Bill this will have to be completed and the conclusions arising from it will have to be laid before both Houses before the end of 1986.  The review group is addressing at present a number of important areas such as how direct employment can be maximised from the industrial sector and what further steps can be taken to develop indigenous industry.  Triennial reviews will be a feature of industrial policy for the future.</P>
    <P>A number of common areas of interest and concern were highlighted by Deputies during the debate and I would now like to deal with the principal issues raised.  Some of the more technical points may be taken up on Committee Stage. There was an understandable emphasis by Deputies &mdash; which I share &mdash; on the need to enhance the employment impact from industrial development.  This is acknowledged, of course, as the first objective of the new policy at paragraph 1.9 of the White Paper as follows:</P>
    <P>...to create and maintain the maximum number of sustainable jobs, as many as possible of them high-skilled, in manufacturing and international service industry.</P>
    <P>The employment targets in the White Paper for an average net increase of 3,000 to 6,000 jobs per year in manufacturing over the period 1984-1994 are ambitious ones.  These targets are based on a doubling of industrial output over that period.  Like most Deputies, I would hope that we could achieve a higher figure but in the Government's view it would <Col N="1850" /> have been dishonest, given present circumstances, to set higher targets simply to make them more politically palatable.</P>
    <P>In attempting to increase direct employment in manufacturing, we will have to achieve results which are in stark contrast with the trend in most other western European countries.  Reductions in manufacturing employment have resulted from the continuing advances in technology, improving productivity and the decline of many traditional employment-intensive sectors.  For example, between December 1979 and March 1983, 1.5 million manufacturing jobs were lost in the UK.  Even in the US where overall employment has been showing a steady improvement, 220,000 manufacturing jobs were lost in the first six months of 1985.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that we should not aim to maximise the direct and indirect employment spin-off from industrial development.  Indeed, following an active dialogue between the former Minister and the Industrial Development Authority, the central focus of the IDA in 1986 will be to get a better employment and value-added performance from the existing industrial sector and every encouragement and feasible resource backing will be given to initiatives involving significant or quantum leaps in terms of direct or indirect job impact.  Moreover, some new ideas are being developed and will be the subject of discussion at the next meeting of the management committee on industrial policy which, under the chairmanship of my Department, includes representation by all the major State agencies associated with industrial development.</P>
    <P>Industrial output increased by 4 per cent and exports rose by 8 per cent in 1985.  The annual production of manufactured goods is now estimated at about £15,000 million and 11,000 new jobs were actually created and filled in 1985 in companies receiving IDA support.  Despite these encouraging trends, there was a net reduction in manufacturing employment but this reduction has continually decreased since 1983.  While factory closures attracted most attention, the IDA estimate <Col N="1851" /> that two-thirds of the job losses in 1985 were due to existing companies trimming their workforces.  This resulted, in part, from a trend among firms to contract out services such as distribution, catering and cleaning, previously carried out in-house.  The transfer of such jobs to private services formed part of the employment growth in that sector during 1985.  I will turn to the outlook for 1986 at the end of my contribution.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies highlighted the importance of accelerating the development of our natural resources sector, in particular food.  The recent appointment of myself as Minister of State with special responsibility for the food sector and the imminent establishment of the National Development Corporation emphasises the Government's commitment to developing this area.  Among the positive developments that have already taken place are: (a)  the co-operation between the supermarket multiples and the State agencies to capture more of the Irish food business, of which £1,000 million was represented by imports in 1985; (b)  the identification and quantification by the State agencies of specific opportunities and niches in the Irish food market; (c) an increase in the number of companies negotiating investment proposals with the IDA in this sector.  In 1985, the number of projects being supported had risen to 147 and involved an investment of over £84 million, (d)  the recent decision by the IDA to support three projects in the grading, storing and packing of fresh fruit and vegetables in order to improve the quality and presentation of Irish produce; (e)  the recent IDA Food Fortnight designed to highlight opportunities specifically directed at small companies or individuals thinking of starting up a food business; and (f)  the pilot experiment in the food sector being conducted by Shannon Development in a purpose-built centre at the Raheen Industrial Estate in Limerick. These developments will continue at full pace and represent a determined effort on the Government's part to make progress in this matter.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate, Deputies <Col N="1852" /> raised a number of questions in relation to designation of areas for purposes of the higher rate of fixed asset grants.  At the request of the former Minister, the National Economic and Social Council completed an independent objective review of the use of designation as a flexible policy instrument.  No such review had been completed since 1952. The council published their report in December 1985 recommending objective criteria, based on labour market imbalances, to determine designated status on a needs basis for the future.  Following receipt of the NESC report, the Economic and Social Research Institute were commissioned by my Department to advise on the implications of implementing the NESC recommendations to enable the Government to consider the matter further.  I should stress, however, that no decision has been taken as yet by the Government on any changes in designation.  Section 4 of the Bill is designed to allow Ministers, following the enactment of the Bill, to use designation in a more flexible manner.</P>
    <P>As far as regional industrial development is concerned, Deputies will be aware of the regionalisation of the IDA's small industries programme which was completed during 1985.  This involves a decentralisation of promotion, negotiation, evaluation of projects, payments and after-care service to seven regional small industry boards.  The local authorities and the county development officers are involved in the process.  In addition, one-stop shops have been established in nine regional centres to eventually bring under one roof all of the services of the State agencies with an involvement in small business such as the IDA, CTT, IIRS and so on.  These are radical initiatives designed to provide a locally-based service to maximise the potential for small industry projects.  I am glad to be able to report to the House that the policy is providing to be effective.  In 1985, IDA-backed small firms created 3,700 jobs, an increase of over 20 per cent on the 1984 level.  The IDA expect that an even better performance will be achieved during 1986.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1853" /> There has been some ill-informed criticism of the information available on the cost per job in industrial projects.  I am concerned about this as my Department and I are anxious that we get the best possible return on our investment in job creation.  Indeed, this was one of the principal objectives of the industrial policy White Paper.  Some commentators have not only ignored the amount of information already available on this topic in IDA annual reports and elsewhere, but they have also made far-fetched claims regarding the supposed lack of expenditure control by my Department and the agencies under their responsibility.</P>
    <P>There are many ways of defining cost per job.  Any discussion must therefore be based on a careful definition of what is included and what it is intended to measure.  The need for careful definition reflects the uncertainty attaching to projects, the different nature and timing of the assistance provided by the industrial promotion agencies, the duration of employment in specific projects, etc.  We must also remember that cost per job is only one of a number of mechanisms for ensuring that the best possible return is received on the State's investment in job creation.</P>
    <P>In negotiating for a new industrial project, a level of grant assistance must be agreed on the basis of expected performance in terms of sales, employment, investment in assets, etc.  The actual performance of a new plant inevitably will not follow a smooth and certain progression of increasing sales, employment and investment in assets.  <i>A priori,</i> there are risks and uncertainties attaching to any industrial investment.  Just as a company may not reach its sales and investment target, however, so also it may not receive the total grant-aid agreed at the outset.</P>
    <P>Every project is thoroughly examined by an IDA board, and where appropriate the Authority and the Government. Every project is appraised from a commercial, technological, economic and managerial point of view.  The appraisal process takes account of the cost per job in each project.  A review of the actual <Col N="1854" /> jobs resulting from job targets some years ago did show a degree of over-optimism with regard to targets.  This problem has now been addressed by the putting in place of a more accurate method of estimating the number of jobs associated with each particular project.  As a further control mechanism, the former Minister instructed the IDA to include in their annual report details of jobs approved for every sector in each year, and the number of jobs that have actually come on stream in succeeding years.  This information is included in the 1983 and 1984 annual reports of the IDA.</P>
    <P>In summary, every effort is made to minimise the risk to the taxpayer associated with each individual project.  In the final analysis there is direct control over the payment of grants.  Grants are only paid after investments have taken place.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like to refer to certain inferences during the debate that IDA grant assistance in the past may have been related to party political affiliations. I must unequivocally refute any such inference.  I have certainly received no complaints of this nature during my period at the Department and I would be glad &mdash; as I am sure the IDA would be &mdash; to investigate any such allegations.</P>
    <P>To return to the issue of cost per job, my Department have got the agreement of the management committee on industrial policy to an approach which measures the average cost per job sustained over a six year period.  This is similar to the approach adopted in the Telesis report.  Only sustained first time jobs are counted, that is jobs still in existence at the end of the period.  A first time job is defined as an increase in employment over and above the previous peak employment level.  Costs are measured in constant 1985 prices.  Using this method the average cost per job sustained in the period 1978-84 was £15,790.</P>
    <P>Grant payments show only the direct costs involved.  The administrative cost of the IDA and the other promotion agencies, the cost of advice provided by other agencies such as Córas Tráchtála, the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards, the cost of infrastructure to <Col N="1855" /> improve and facilitate industry and any tax revenue foregone are not included. There are also indirect benefits, however, such as the increased demand in the economy arising from new industries starting up and the benefits in terms of technological and skill development in the economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In the brief time available to me to refer to the budget I would say that this budget is, in essence, a cynical public relations exercise indicating the contempt with which the Minister for Finance and his Cabinet colleagues treat the already outstretched resources of the Irish consumer, at all levels.</P>
      <P>It seems like only yesterday that the Cabinet summoned the State's industrialists to the lavish launching at Iveagh House of the gravely misnamed <i>Building on Reality</i>.  With the benefit of hindsight the document could rightly have been titled <i>Building on Unreality.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning is necessary but should never be an end in itself.  This budget underlined the fact that it was purely an exercise designed to scuttle an already tidetorn economy at the expense of the ultimate paymasters of the economy.  The Minister is treating the public as gullible individuals by presenting a budget, liberally treated and prepared, to present a <Col N="1856" /> rose tinted picture by some back room economic gurus and public relations consultants. The Minister admits that his first requirement is that it will not depress the economy in 1986 &mdash; a modest requirement that reflects a view that covertly says that &ldquo;Things are so bad that we cannot let them get much worse&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I contend that contrary to the Minister's aspirations, this budget will make things much worse.  The Minister's aspiration is, at best, pious, and at worse, a recipe for economic disaster.  Economic commentators have remarked that the budget will shift the burden of taxation. This is one of the smooth platitudes that have been used to market the contents to the Fine Gael Party's socialist bedfellows. The fact is that the personal tax burden will increase significantly during the year.  Taxes on both personal income and spending will rise rather than fall, directly as a result of the budget.</P>
    <P>Financial analysts suggest that taxes on personal income will rise more than twice as rapidly as inflation in 1988, consequently direct taxes on personal incomes will account for almost 15 per cent of gross national product.  This compares with a figure of just over 12 per cent in 1982.</P>
    <P>The apparent concessions granted by the Minister on tax allowances, tax bands and the top rate of tax are only an illusion. Incomes are expected to rise by 7 per cent this year.  This is considerably higher than the expected rate of inflation.  As a result, increasing incomes will push taxpayers into a situation in which they are actually paying more tax.  One commentator has spoken of the extreme &ldquo;progressivity&rdquo; of the Irish tax structure &mdash; this is truer than it ever was.  This structure will now levy high taxes at relatively low levels of income.  The Minister gave with one hand and took away with the other. This shows his scant regard for the intelligence of the people.</P>
    <P>Suggesting that the burden of taxation is being shifted to the financial institutions is grossly misleading.  The deposit interest retention tax, appropriately abbreviated to DIRT, reflects the Minister's intention of doing the dirty on the <Col N="1857" /> personal saver.  The situation at the moment is that thrift is penalised, investment is penalised, there is no incentive to work and spending, even at a moderate level is next to impossible.  These ingredients combine to bring the economy to a standstill.</P>
    <P>While the deposit interest retention tax is portrayed as a tax on financial institutions, on the banks and the building societies, it is, in reality a tax on savers at source.  Personal savers, it is estimated, will save £2,500 million this year.  These are the people who will pay this tax, while also paying high taxes on the income they will earn from work.</P>
    <P>We are told that the burden on the PAYE taxpayers will be eased, however, these same individuals will pay £125 million more in tax this year.  This represents a rise of 6.3 per cent on last year's tax take from the PAYE sector, so individuals are faced with a heavier direct tax burden in 1986.</P>
    <P>There is also an increase in the indirect tax burden on the individual.  By increasing the standard rate of value-added tax from 23 per cent to 25 per cent the Minister expects to bring an extra £160 million into the Exchequer in 1986.  This is going to come out of the consumer's pocket. This is a tax on spending.</P>
    <P>The spending taxes, such as value-added tax, excise and motor vehicle duties, directly hit the consumers and ultimately their spending power.  A drop in consumer spending hits manufacturing and service industries and this in turn reduces the Exchequer's annual take and thereby forces cuts in public expenditure. The development of our infrastructure will be halted.  We have seen the effects of this in the immediate wake of the budget with the health and education sectors being particularly hard hit.</P>
    <P>By coupling direct taxes on income with indirect taxes on expenditure it can be seen that total tax revenues from the personal sector will increase from 33.9 per cent of GNP in 1985 to 34.6 per cent in 1986.  This is the highest level of personal taxation yet recorded in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Primarily the Government have failed <Col N="1858" /> miserably, despite the platitude contained in their economic plan to control current spending.  The Government can no longer blame sharply increased debt servicing costs.  Favourable exchange rate movements and favourable interest rate movements in the international economic environment have eased this burden somewhat.</P>
    <P>In the lifetime of this administration we have experienced an average growth rate of a miserable 0.3 per cent; over 17 per cent of our labour force unemployed and a public sector debt of over £20 billion. These conditions exist as a direct result of the economic mismanagement of the current administration.  The private sector are being suffocated by a taxation system that is destroying the incentive to work.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Finance described employment as being the one area where economic performance has been disappointing.  In short, the Minister is admitting the failure of his own Government's policies.</P>
    <P>People in all sectors are looking for hope and encouragement.  Our own party's Finance spokesman has referred to the absence of any reference to people as a priority in our nation.  Fianna Fáil have always recognised our great natural resources.  Our people are what makes us a nation, not, as our former Minister for Finance would have us as, a blundering public limited company.  The Minister for Finance is limited in outlook.  Fianna Fáil will protect the rights of the people and will not sell them to the highest bidder.</P>
    <P>It can be observed in the media in recent weeks that the Taoiseach is keeping his options open with respect to his next social partner.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Rowntree-Mackintosh Factory.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise this unfortunate intended cut-down on jobs at the Rowntree-Mackintosh <Col N="1859" /> factory.  This is a very old factory, well established in the Inchicore-Kilmainham area.  Its workforce are mainly drawn from the Ballyfermot-Inchicore area, which has suffered a high unemployment rate in the past number of years.  Therefore, the intended cutback on jobs will cause tremendous hardship in the area.</P>
      <P>The factory used to be Van Houten's before 1935-36 and then it became known as the old Choc Coid Cocoa Works before it became Rowntrees.  In 1960 there was an amalgamation with Mackintosh. There are 560 people working there now, a tremendous workforce in any one factory, given the tendency in modern industrial premises to cut back on workforces. The reason for the large workforce is that it manufactures very labour intensive products.</P>
      <P>The unfortunate thing about this cutback of 380 jobs is that the labour intensive output of the factory, the products they are putting out, are the ones affected.  That is the reason given for the cutback of jobs.  The factory had a troubled industrial relations history up to 1984 when there was a loss of £428,000, which was attributed largely to a tenweek strike.  Profits had been declining and unfortunately in the previous couple of years there had not been a good profit flow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the criticism levelled at the workforce ended in 1984.  Since then there has not been the loss of a single hour of production.  People may be inclined to blame the unions &mdash; in a long established company like this there were nine different unions &mdash; but they worked together well of late.  The Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union forewarned of the possibility of this cutback happening if the company did not invest in new plant and new technology and if it did not, like some other companies in this industry, become streamlined and concentrate on single products in the different factories.  Rowntree-Mackintosh are unfortunate in the sense that there are several other plants owned <Col N="1860" /> by Rowntree-Mackintosh in Britain and Ireland and the Kilmainham factory is being sacrificed by the parent company. It has been suggested that the Dublin factory would become a warehouse only, providing work for only 120 people.</P>
    <P>There has been a vote of confidence by the company by investing £1,500,000 in three lines being manufactured there. The company have admitted that they failed to build up improved exports, and blamed uncompetitive high production costs and a bad industrial realations record that has been described as one of the worst in the country &mdash; that is according to <i>The Irish Times</i> of 7 March.</P>
    <P>I regard that as unfair given the response of the workforce and the unions in the past couple of years.  This factory may be a sacrificial lamb, being the Irish operation of a mainly British company, and the labour intensive Irish sector may be sacrificed.  There has been a reliance on a costly low volume product and a failure to centralise the manufacture of individual products at one location.  This could have been avoided by management if they had had a different approach to production.</P>
    <P>This plant has been the source of stable employment for one of the most deprived parts of the city.  In Inchicore only 4 per cent of the population get a crack at third level education and they make up 28 per cent of the population of St. Patrick's Institution and Mountjoy.  In Ballyfermot, from which a large number of the workers come, an area with between 40,000 and 50,000 people, only 1 per cent get a crack at third level education and they make up 17 per cent of St. Patrick's Institution and Mountjoy.  This disemployment is being visited on them on top of all their other problems.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the history of job losses in those two areas. With the shutdown of Killeen Paper Mills some years ago there was a loss of 750 jobs, never to be replaced.  The shutdown of Clondalkin Paper Mills caused 470 job losses, but because it was saved and reopened by the Government there will be a return of 280 jobs, leaving a net loss of 190 jobs.  Within a couple of hundred <Col N="1861" /> yards of that factory we lost the Swan Laundry and a couple of hundred yards down the road we had the closure of Booth Poole some years ago.  We had the closure of the Spa Road, Inchicore, works where they made buses for many years.  We had a huge cutback in the Inchicore Engineering Works.  The area is unfortunate and it needs careful attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe we are not shouting loudly enough.  People do not often realise that one third of the population is in Dublin.  We have areas with huge numbers and huge job losses but we are inclined to take them for granted.  It is devastating in certain areas.  In Ballyfermot there is an unemployment rate of 20 per cent.  In Clondalkin, in certain streets and small estates there is a 60 per cent to 70 per cent unemployment rate.  There is very little chance of new business coming to Ballyfermot or Inchicore where only about 2 per cent of the population would be self-employed, though you would have a figure of about 11 per cent in a place like Dún Laoghaire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We lost 450 jobs recently in Mostek and there had been a loss of 280 previously.  A clothing manufacturing business was to be set up in the constituency which would have provided 1,000 jobs.  Because of some reason, perhaps pressure brought to bear, it was moved to another constituency in Dublin, which decision caused much despair.  The Government had tremendous success, despite opposition from the building construction industry, in boosting the provision of housing by means of the Housing Finance Agency although the Opposition tried to strangle that agency. There was also the help given by the <Col N="1862" /> £5,000 grant.  About 100 people have taken advantage of that grant to move house and go to different jobs.  These have been replaced by about 100 homeless people, probably none with jobs.  I am trying to bring home to the Minister the hardship visited on such an area as the Liffey Valley community by the loss of so many jobs.  I also have great sympathy with those who have suffered by the same hardship in Deputy Lyon's Cork constituency and in the Cork area generally, but he will forgive me for concentrating on trying to help those who often cannot speak for themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy.  The Rowntree-Mackintosh decision was delivered, as these decisions usually are, as a bombshell to the workers.  Any company fortunate enough to be so labour intensive, having such a large number of workers, must be worried about their future in this day and age.  A great deal of blame must be laid on the management because at the other side of the city a very successful arrangement was made by Cadbury's to make most of the chocolate flake for all Britain and Ireland.  By specialising in that area, they have succeeded in keeping a very large number of people working, about 1,100, and in expanding.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that Rowntree-Mackintosh's other plant at Mallow has not been affected adversely.  This factory is engaged in making chocolate crumb and their 70 workers will continue to be employed on that side of the business. The plant used 60 million gallons of milk last year, 16,000 tons of sugar and the output of 870 farms in the region.  I spoke directly to the management this evening. I hope that the investment of £1½ million in the three lines of products which they continue to manufacture is a vote of confidence in the future of the plant and that they will be able to maintain the 180 remaining jobs &mdash; I had given this as 224 jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope it will not be the intention to <Col N="1863" /> use the Inchicore plant as a warehouse for company products imported from Britain.  The IDA have recognised the problems and are looking for import substitution but the lines which Rowntree-Mackintosh are continuing to manufacture are high cost products, the most popular lines in Britain and Ireland such as Kit-Kat, Rolo and Smarties.  I hope these products will not be made in Britain in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot work miracles but I ask him to bear in mind the devastation caused in this part of the city and to ask the IDA to investigate the possibility of more labour intensive factories for that area.  I ask him to bear in mind that this is a disadvantaged area and that the educational and career opportunities are extremely limited.  I am sure I have the support of Deputies O'Keeffe and Lyons in my efforts for the continuance of the Mallow plant.  The Minister should ask Rowntree-Mackintosh if they could put some specialised products into their Irish plant which could supply Britain and Ireland, as Cadbury's have done.  This would give secure employment.</P>
    <P>We appear to be the sacrificial lambs and it is the Irish jobs which are being taken over.  The Irish workers have contributed down through the decades in building up the Rowntree-Mackintosh plant, in supplying the necessary labour in the form of a working pool which has faithfully served the plant owners, in some cases for 40 years.  There is room for specialisation in the line of children's sweets.</P>
    <P>I hope the redundancy agreements into which the company will enter will be generous, bearing in mind the long service of most of the workers.  I am very much aware of the difficulties in providing large numbers of jobs, but I hope that Rowntree-Mackintosh will give an assurance that the maximum number of jobs will be retained and that if the IDA can do anything in the form of grants, incentives or the introduction of new lines, they will do so.  This could mean a utilisation of the spare capacity brought about by the moving out of a large number of people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1864" /> If the plant were used as a warehouse for imported sweets, it would be the worst of all possible worlds because we would not have the employment and there would be a drain of purchasing power.</P>
    <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and I would mention one thing which should be a source of great encouragement to the Minister and to all here.  When Clondalkin Mills in the same constituency closed down, that caused the loss of the 480 jobs.  However, after a battle we got the mill reopened again. We got back 280 jobs but the spin-off included at least another 500 jobs.  The consumables in that mill include chemicals, transport, waste paper, pallets, and engineering services, and in the surrounding districts there is also the spending power of the workforce and small businesses and industries have been able to survive as a result of this measure.  I ask the Minister to examine this urgently and carefully, to enter into negotiations with the management and to meet the workers' deputations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 6 March 1986, this firm announced that they planned to rationalise their Irish operations and as a result it would be necessary to lay off 380 employees out of a total workforce of 560 to take effect in September 1986.  This is a commercial decision by the firm and as such the Deputy will appreciate that the level of influence which I or anybody else can exert on events is limited.  However, being mindful of the need to maintain employment at the highest level possible the Industrial Development Authority have acted promptly and have arranged to enter into immediate discussions with the firm in an effort to secure that end. As a result of this initiative a meeting was held between the Industrial Development Authority and Rowntree-Mackintosh and these discussions are ongoing. The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot pre-empt the outcome of these discussions, <Col N="1865" /> but I can assure him that the Industrial Development Authority, and other State agencies, will do everything possible to ensure that redundancies are kept to an absolute minimum.  I will help as far as I can on that score.</P>
      <P>The firm in formulating their rationalisation programme cited a series of reasons for the proposed lay-offs.  Among these the difficult competitive conditions being experienced by the company were mentioned along with high production costs and surplus capacity within the overall Rowntree-Mackintosh Group.  Having regard to the surplus production capacity position, the firm were of the view that, because of this, major investment in their plant at Inchicore was not possible, and the rationalisation programme announced was in line with the trend already under way in the United Kingdom.  I should mention for the Deputy's information that in the chocolate industry internationally employment has been falling. In the United Kingdom, for example, two of the major producers in this sector have shed approximately 5,000 jobs between them.  While it would be nice to think that Ireland could escape this trend, unfortunately this is not the case.  Ireland enjoys no single advantage in manufacturing terms as against any other location, apart of course, from the crumb sector in which milk supply is of great importance.  Overall the industry has performed well in difficult trading conditions and indeed it is worth noting that Ireland remains a net exporter of chocolate and chocolate products.  Exports of chocolate products, for example, increased in value terms by 30 per cent approximately over the past three years.</P>
      <P>Following on Ireland's entry into the EC artificial barriers to trade cannot be introduced and therefore there can be no question of such measures being used. Quite clearly, in any event, it would not be in Ireland's interest to contemplate measures of this sort in view of the fact that Ireland benefits considerably from exports generally and priority must be given to ensuring that this position is not in any way threatened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reorganisation plan, as I have <Col N="1866" /> stated, will regrettably result in 380 redundancies but is seen as necessary to secure the remaining 180 jobs for the future.  I might say that the Department or the Industrial Development Authority had not got prior knowledge in relation to the company's intentions.  This is not meant to be a criticism of the company who are, in fact, giving advance notice of six months before redundancies take effect.  In this regard, the firm point out that they are giving a lead-in period to enable employees as much time as possible to seek alternative employment opportunities and to provide adequate time for consultations regarding settlement arrangements.</P>
    <P>For the House's information this reorganisation plan will not effect a Rowntree-Mackintosh processing operation, which produces chocolate crumb, located in Mallow.  The plant in Mallow has provided a huge success and last year used large volumes of domestic raw materials thus generating considerable economic activity in the region.  The plant also exports a substantial amount of its produce and in addition provides an important outlet for a large number of farms in the Mallow region.  The employment content in the Mallow plant is comparatively small &mdash; 81 or 82 people.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, this is a commercial decision taken by the company and I am hopeful that Rowntree-Mackintosh will continue to maintain a presence in this country and that the future viability, of an admittedly scaled down operation, is secure.  I can assure the Deputy that everything possible will be done by the Department and the relevant State agencies to ameliorate the impact of the redundancies.  To this end the IDA will impress on the firm the need to re-examine their rationalisation plans in order to reduce to the absolute minimum the number of redundancies which they must implement, and they will also assess the practicalities of providing additional employment generating projects in the area, as was requested by Deputy Skelly.</P>
    <P>The IDA will also be pursuing with the Rowntree-Mackintosh Group the possibilities of locating new products in this <Col N="1867" /> country and the idea has already been put to the local management.  As I said, all these negotiations are ongoing and I am hopeful that come September the <Col N="1868" /> workers' position will not be as bleak as it appears at the moment.</P>

In addition, £181,102 was allocated for emergency assistance to the victims of drought and famine in the Sudan, a grant of £1,500 was made under the scheme of co-financing with non-governmental organisations and funding was provided for eight Sudanese to attend training courses in Ireland.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the statement which I made to the House in response to a question on sanctions on 5 November 1985 when I said that:</P>
      <P>The Government consider that the imposition of effective mandatory sanctions against South Africa is a means of further increasing international pressure on South Africa to abandon its apartheid policies and to this end has supported proposals that the UN Security Council should consider such actions.  In 1984 Ireland co-sponsored a resolution to this effect at the UN General Assembly and has previously co-sponsored resolutions urging the imposition of an oil embargo and a ban on new investment in South Africa.  The Government believe that sanctions should be carefully chosen, graduated, properly imposed by the Security Council in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and fully implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This remains Government policy and Ireland co-sponsored a similar resolution in 1985.  So far the United Nations Security Council has imposed only one mandatory sanction under Resolution 418 of 1977 which imposes an embargo on the <Col N="1700" /> sales of arms or related materials to South Africa.  Ireland scrupulously observes the terms of that resolution and in fact has maintained an embargo on such sales on a voluntary basis since 1963.  As I stated to the House in November, it is also Government policy to work towards making mandatory the embargo on imports of arms and paramilitary equipment contained in Security Council Resolution 558 of 1984.</P>
    <P>It is also Government policy to promote a strong policy on apartheid within the Twelve.  On 10 September 1985 the Foreign Ministers of the Twelve agreed a package of both positive and restrictive measures towards South Africa.  The Ministers stated that if there was no progress in South Africa within a reasonable period then further measures, including sanctions, would have to be considered.</P>

      <P>Fishing rights for Irish fishing vessels depend on Irish jurisdiction over the area in question.  Irish jurisdiction in relation to the maritime areas, including the fishing zone, in the region of Rockall is closely linked with the delimitation of the Continental Shelf between Ireland and Britain in that area.  The Government do not accept British claims to this area and accordingly do not accept a British right to exclude Irish fishing vessels from this area.  Following the outcome of the arbitration in relation to the Continental Shelf the full extent of Irish jurisdiction over its maritime areas, including those where overlapping claims now exist, can be determined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Community takes an active and consistent interest in the problems of South Africa and those of neighbouring States affected by South Africa's aggressive policies.  The Deputy will recall that on 10 September 1985 the Foreign Ministers of the Twelve adopted a package of positive and restrictive measures towards South Africa.  At that time the Ministers undertook to keep the situation in South Africa under review and to consider further action in the absence of progress within a reasonable time.</P>
      <P>On 3 and 4 February 1986 a major meeting took place in Lusaka between the Twelve and the front line states.  The purpose of this meeting was to send a strong signal to South Africa that the Twelve shared the resolve of the front line states to see an early end to the system of apartheid in that country.  In the joint communique issued after the meeting Ministers called on the Government of the Republic of South Africa: &ldquo;to declare categorically that apartheid will be dismantled completely; to end the state of emergency; and to initiate a dialogue with the genuine representatives of those South Africans now excluded from the present government structure on the future of that country&rdquo;.  The communique went on with an appeal to the South African Government to release unconditionally all political prisoners and detainees, including Nelson Mandela, to facilitate the process of negotiations, and to lift the ban on the African National Congress of South Africa, the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania and other political parties so as to create an atmosphere conductive to the desired political dialogue.  I am arranging for copies of this communique to be placed in the Library of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the meeting in Lusaka, Ireland and other member states were represented at a meeting in Harare of the <Col N="1702" /> Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference which consists of all states in the Southern African region, other than South Africa and Namibia, and which seeks to reduce their dependence on the South African economic, transport and communication system. The Deputy will be aware that three of the SADCC member states, Lesotho, Tanzania and Zambia are priority countries for Ireland's development cooperation programme and that the SADCC is a major recipient of aid under the European development fund.</P>
    <P>On 14 February the Foreign Minister of the Netherlands in his capacity as President in Office of the Foreign Ministers of the Twelve met the South African Foreign Minister in Geneva to reaffirm in unequivocal terms the views of the Twelve on what is required in South Africa.</P>
    <P>Most recently Foreign Ministers of the Twelve discussed South Africa at their ministerial meeting in The Hague on 25 February, after which a statement was issued reaffirming Twelve policy and calling on the South African Government to take action.  Copies of this statement will also be placed in the Library of the House.</P>
    <P>From this outline of recent developments I think it will be clear to the Deputy the extent of the efforts the European Community is making to achieve peaceful change in South Africa and the extent to which there is continued interest by the Twelve in what happens there.  The Twelve will continue to express the view that there is much for the South African Government to do to bring about the complete abolition of the system of apartheid, it being clear to them that the measures announced so far by Pretoria do not go far enough.</P>

The decline can to some extent be attributed to the continuous bad weather which made if difficult to spread lime for long periods of the year.  My Department and ACOT will continue to emphasise the importance of adequate liming in achieving the best returns from the land.</P>

      <P>As a result of a loss making situation over a number of years, management decided to close the Walkinstown branch of the company.  This act resulted in the workers' union (ITGWU) entering into official dispute with the company at the Walkinstown branch only.</P>
      <P>Agreement has now been reached between management and the union which provides for severance payments for the workers in the branch who have been made redundant and for the transfer of the remaining workers to other Dublin branches of the company.</P>
