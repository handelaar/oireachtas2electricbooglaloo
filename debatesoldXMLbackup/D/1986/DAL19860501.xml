      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 5 to 23, inclusive, and No. 39.  By agreement, the Dáil shall meet at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow and shall adjourn not later than 4 p.m.  The business shall be confined to Estimates of the Public Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he will confirm or deny the statement by a senior Civil Defence officer that there is no plan for a peace time nuclear disaster &mdash; say for example, Sellafield, as reported in this morning's newspaper? The Taoiseach finds it something to smile about and to be amused about.  It is not a matter that the Irish people feel the slightest bit amused about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business I would ask the Taoiseach, in view of his responsibility and that of his Government in regard to the chief executive of the Nuclear Energy Board, what action he is prepared to take&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach prepared to take action against Dr. Nolan who has been guilty of serious irresponsibility?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Chair is not allowed to have control of the House it is impossible to run the business of the House.  The first elementary rule is that when the Chair stands up there should be silence.  I want to impress that on Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could make a suggestion to the Taoiseach and to the House.  There is obviously very considerable anxiety and worry about this whole nuclear problem.  Would I be in order in asking the Taoiseach to say whether or not the Government would give some time today or tomorrow, either by way of statement or otherwise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey is not in order.  A practice has grown here where it is the House versus the Chair.  That is not desirable.  The Chair is here to implement Standing Orders and to apply the rules of the House made by the House.  The Chair is not against anybody, he is for everybody and for order in the House.  Day after day the situation arises where it is the House against the Chair.  I appeal for an end to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I be in order pointing out to the Deputy that there will be a discussion in the Seanad today on this subject?  He is fully aware of it and he is not making much sense in this House by pretending that he does not know that it has been requested and will take place in the Seanad.  Playing games like that does not make sense in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not accept those impertinent statements by the Taoiseach. They are disorderly.  I am trying to conduct the business of this House as Leader of the Opposition and I am suggesting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out in the beginning that this was out of order. When something that is out of order is raised then somebody else thinks he or she has the right to reply and we have a situation which is undesirable.  I appeal to Deputies to accept the ruling of the Chair until the Orders of the House are changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I <Col N="2374" /> wish the Chair to take notice of the fact that the Taoiseach has made very serious accusations against me, that I am playing games about a matter of great importance. I am asking the Chair to ask the Taoiseach to withdraw that statement. I have put a serious proposition to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <P>I would appreciate if the Chair would express concern regarding the lack of balance displayed on RTE, particularly in the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme, in relation to legislation that is before this House but not yet debated. RTE are taking a partisan approach in relation to advocating divorce.  I am asking the Chair to protect the interests of Members.  RTE are partial in their attitude &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>All of these resolutions reflect matters contained in the Bill and the substantive questions will be dealt with on the appropriate section.  On that basis it has not been customary in the debate on any Finance Bill for a substantive debate to take place on the Financial Resolutions.  The debate takes place on the relevant section of the Bill.  However, if the Deputy having read the resolutions, as I am sure he has, has any question arising on any one of them I will be happy to provide him with any information he seeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is correct there may be a debate on each of these resolutions but it is not a Committee type of debate.  The Minister moves a resolution and any Member who wishes to do so may speak once on each resolution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  My point is that if these resolutions deal with matters arising from the Bill that is all right, but if there are ministerial amendments that are not in the Bill and that are dealt with in the resolutions that is something we would want to know about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding that what the Minister has said is correct, that they are matters that will arise in the Bill and that can be debated there in theory, we know that in practice this is not always the case.  I presume the Finance Bill this year will be debated in the same way as was done in recent years.  If that is so more than half the sections in the Bill will not be debated at all.  Only the earlier sections in each of the parts or chapters are likely to be debated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make some reference to it now because the probability is that it will be impossible to move an amendment or deal with it in the normal place.  I raised this matter already during my speech on Second Stage.  The Minister replied to the effect that various amendments would be put down by him on Committee Stage which would deal with the matter.  On looking at the complete list of amendments which I received this morning, there is no amendment from the Minister to this section and one can only assume that it is being left as it is and that the very unsatisfactory situation which exists as a result of section 85 will continue.</P>
      <P>Even on the Minister's own admission, the situation that will arise as a result of the passage of section 85 is basically untenable and needs to be changed.  I do not need to remind the Minister of the widespread concern in the industry, not simply for their own welfare but for the welfare of their ordinary life assurance policyholders who will inevitably be severely penalised as a result of this section.  The Minister wants to get at a different category of person, the sort of person who has been paying large single premiums for guaranteed income bonds and guaranteed growth bonds.  It is a reasonable fiscal objective but the way in which it is being done is liable to cause tremendous damage to the life assurance industry and in particular to ordinary policyholders who are not involved in these guaranteed income bonds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same problem arose in Britain but it was solved in their 1984 Finance Act <Col N="2385" /> in a completely different way from the rather ham fisted approach in this Bill. In Britain the problem was overcome in consultation with the industry in a way that affected only the type of activity that it was sought to control or tax.  We are entitled to ask why that is not being done here and why instead we have this very unsatisfactory approach in section 85, a promise of amendments by the Minister and now the failure to bring forward any amendments.  The position seems to have worsened since I pointed out on Second Stage that there is very serious concern both here and abroad at what is happening, not at the principle of raising taxation from insurance companies but at the way it is being done.  It is being raised retrospectively from funds set aside to meet legal contracts which cannot be varied. The result is that if the companies are to pay the tax, as they must, they must have recourse to people who do not have tight legal contracts, the ordinary insurer of his or her own life who is paying a premium every year or at various points throughout the year.  The bonuses or additional dividends which such people might normally have every reason to expect will not be paid.</P>
    <P>I understand one of the suggestions made by the industry was that if this once-off payment of a relatively large sum has to be made this year in order to try to help meet the Government's serious budgetary situation and the heavy deficit, the industry feel they could do that without damaging their credibility and underlying structure, provided credit was given for this once-off payment this year against the corporation tax that would be payable in subsequent years if the law were changed on the lines the Minister and his officials indicated to the industry. It is impossible to deal with the matter now because the Minister, in spite of his promise on Second Stage and at the press conference on 4 April when he circulated the Bill to the Press, has not introduced these amendments.  We are left in the position of assuming that section 85 will be allowed to stand as it is and that it is not intended to have it amended by the Minister.  He has already made a major <Col N="2386" /> change in the section compared to what was announced in the budget.  The rate of stamp duty has been reduced from 15 per cent to 9 per cent as a result of the realisation in the Department of Finance that a major error had been made and that the consequences of this on the insurance industry had not been taken into account at all.  It is no great secret that the Department of Industry and Commerce are extremely concerned at the present position and about the effect it is having, or will have if it is passed, on the liquidity ratio and the liquidity position of life insurance companies here, and on the ability of some of them to meet their obligations without having recourse to funds which a prudent insurance company should not have to have recourse to.</P>
    <P>The repercussions abroad are considerable because the very credibility of this country as a location for financial services, which is surely something we should be promoting, is put in doubt by this silly provision which the Minister is apparently now declining to amend.  It is unsatisfactory that this discussion is not of a Committee Stage nature so that I could ask the Minister questions and could comment on his replies.  I understand I will have to confine myself to this one statement but it is a matter which needs the fullest clarification from the Minister particularly in the absence of his amendments and in the light of the deep concern felt throughout this industry and throughout the Department of Industry and Commerce about the ham-fisted activity that is going on in this section 85.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This section 85 is a proposal for one year only.  That is the way it is framed.  The provision for subsequent years will be dealt with by way of an amendment.  That amendment will be circulated in the near future.  The reason for this proposal is based on a number of factors.  The first one is the one referred to by the Deputy.  But there is also the more general consideration that the tax contribution in the form of corporation profits tax by life insurance companies is <Col N="2387" /> very small indeed and, at the same time, there is a very considerable need on the part of the Government to provide funds from this and other sources to enable some relief to be given to ordinary income tax payers, in particular, the PAYE sector.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley said that this levy to which this financial resolution refers is retrospective.  That is not the case.  The base for the levy is the amount of investment income which arises in the case of a life insurance company during the current year.  That is one of the changes which was made from the original budget proposal, to base it on the current year rather than the previous year.  Deputy O'Malley suggests that this payment should be as a credit against corporation profits tax in future years.  Corporation profits tax under the present code by life assurance companies, is a minimal tax. The amount they actually pay after all the expenses they are able to claim have been allowed is minimal indeed.  If Deputy O'Malley's proposals were to be adopted, all we would be doing is getting some money this year at the cost of virtually abolishing corporation profits tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Substantially more will be payable in future years, and the Minister knows that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would allow me to say what I have to say in my own way it would conduce towards good order about which he was making comments himself earlier.  The position is that, on the basis of the present code, the effect of the Deputy's proposal would be to virtually abolish corporation profits tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is essentially the position as far as that is concerned.  It would also create a situation in which one would simply be bringing forward revenue from a future year into this year without actually increasing the total flow <Col N="2388" /> of revenue at all.  That is a procedure with which the Deputy will be familiar since it was adopted in regard to the introduction of VAT at point of entry.  It is not a satisfactory way of doing business and it is not something that I would wish to engage in.  But the effect of giving credit for this year's levy against future tax would simply be to bring forward the revenue without actually increasing the total amount of revenue being obtained, and that is not what the Government's approach in this matter is about.  It is not something which, in general terms, the Deputy should favour.</P>

      <P>Why is it proposed in this resolution to reduce the rate of interest payable by the Revenue Commissioners on repayments of tax to a taxpayer who has overpaid his tax without reducing correspondingly the rate of interest payable by a taxpayer where he has under-paid his tax?  Is it not symptomatic of the unfortunate times we live in that the rules are changed to suit the Revenue Commissioners because interest rates are dropping and they have to pay less and the law is changed to enable them to pay less, but the rules are not changed at all in favour of the taxpayer?  Why do we have to live in this kind of situation where everything is done for the benefit of the Revenue Commissioners and the Exchequer and those who operate it and everything is done to make life as difficult and as unpleasant as possible for those who have to operate within this economy and who are frequently almost held up as criminals by virtue of the fact that they produce and are active and worthwhile within our economy? Resolution No. 23 encapsulates in as good a way as one could ever see that kind of official attitude of mind which is that if the Revenue have to pay interest it will be reduced but if the taxpayer has to pay it is not reduced.  This is the real Department of Finance Revenue Commissioners mentality.  The Minister for Finance should have enough experience and cop-on to go along with such a provision.</P>
      <P>This resolution should not be passed unless a corresponding resolution is passed reducing the rate of interest payable by a taxpayer.  When these interest payments were introduced at the present high levels some time ago they were equal on both sides.  Revenue had to pay the same rate as the taxpayer.  Why change the rules in favour of Revenue only?  Why not retain the same rate of interest for both sides?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I had prepared an amendment on this point but it appears that we may address ourselvs to it now. I hold the same opinions as those expressed by Deputy O'Malley.  It is contrary to <Col N="2392" /> the principles of equity that the Revenue Commissioners should be given the privilege of a rate of interest on demand from the taxpayer when the taxpayer is not entitled to the same rate of interest from them.  If there are over-payments due from the State to the citizen, the citizen is entitled to only 1 per cent interest for each month, but if there is money due by the citizen to the State the Revenue Commissioners are entitled to 1¼ per cent interest per month.  This is an outrageous proposal.  I will address this point in greater detail when we are discussing the section.  On Committee Stage we will have an opportunity to tease out these points with the Minister.  At present we are only allowed to make one contribution and the Minister can reply in a satisfactory or unsatisfactory manner and we have to accept it.</P>
      <P>Not only does this proposal infringe the principles of equity and justice, but it acts as a disincentive to investment in business.  If people who engage in discussions with the Revenue Commissioners are subsequently held to be in default or delay, this 1¼ per cent interest rate per month will be imposed on them, but the Minister for Finance is exempting himself and the Revenue Commissioners from the same sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that our taxation system is creaking under the weight of the structures this Government in particular have imposed.  We all know it is not working efficiently.  Every citizen &mdash; particularly business people &mdash; who has been dealing with the Revenue Commissioner knows that when repayments are due to him he gets no satisfaction.  On many occasions I have been in contact with the Revenue Commissioners on behalf of business people seeking repayment of VAT over-payments, but I found it impossible even to make contact with the people concerned. The level of telephone inquiries from the business community to the VAT section of the Collector General's Office is so heavy that one cannot get through to the officers concerned.  By the time the overburdened officials operating the switchboard can cope and transfer the caller to the second line, the businessman <Col N="2393" /> meets the second line of defence.  I am not saying this as a criticism of the personnel involved but the office is inadequately staffed and the officers concerned cannot cope with inquiries, much less repayments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will relate it.  The much needed capital, on which the business people are paying heavy interest rates to the banks and financial institutions, is being withheld from them by the Revenue Commissioners and they are not getting adequate compensation by way of interest from Revenue.  They are losing both ways.  They have to pay much more to the banks and the financial institutions from whom they borrowed than they are being allowed &mdash; if that is the word &mdash; by the State.  That is inequitable, and I would go so far as to suggest it is probably unconstitutional.  If a provision allows the State to charge a higher rate of interest on money due than it is prepared to pay on money it owes to citizens, there is at least a statable case for suggesting that that does not maintain the essential equality between the citizen and the State which is a fundamental feature and obligation of our Constitution.</P>
      <P>As I said, we may get an opportunity to return to this when we are discussing the section on Committee Stage and we will tease it out.  For the moment I strongly oppose this resolution and agree with what Deputy O'Malley said.</P>

      <P>The cash flow difficulties being experienced by firms at present is very acute and this resolution may add to them.  What is the potential benefit to the Exchequer of this change?  Approximately what will it cost the business community? There is no mention of value-added tax in section 105.  This resolution relates to income tax, corporation profits tax, capital gains tax and residential property tax, but value-added tax is not mentioned. The biggest problem with refunds arises in the area of VAT where there <Col N="2394" /> are often delays.  If someone applies for a VAT refund an inspector is sent out immediately &mdash; a person only sees an inspector when he applies for a refund &mdash; and delays often arise.  Is there interest accruing for rebates on VAT or is that covered under this resolution?</P>
      <P>If, later in the year, interest rates are reduced to 10 per cent, would it not be better to have some provision, other than by legislative change, whereby these rates can be adjusted?  In other words, they could be related to a particular lending rate which is applicable to the day.  If these rates cannot be reviewed until the Finance Bill, 1987, there could be a substantial difference between current lending rates and the rates applicable here.</P>
      <P>How will the amnesty provisions relate to this Bill?  As the Minister said earlier, no reference was made to interest rates under the amnesty provisions and they would be the most attractive aspect of any potential amnesty.</P>

I think they do not understand &mdash; they may not have been advised &mdash; what is going on and what motivated this section. Because of the relatively high rate of interest that has obtained &mdash; 1.25 per cent per month which is a very good rate of interest, better than is obtained from money on deposit in a bank &mdash; companies who have cash to spare, so to speak, and have available to them expert tax planning advice have been paying substantial amounts of tax that they do not owe at all in order that they can put the money in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It may be outrageous but is has been the case for a considerable time including, I am sure, when Deputy O'Kennedy held the office that I now have the honour to hold.  Deputy Yates made an interesting suggestion that in view of the variability of interest rates one should look at a more flexible mechanism for adjusting rates of tax both on late payments and on refunds more closely in relation to market rates.  I will have a look at that.  Deputy Yates' suggestion seems to be sensible but I cannot say whether it will prove possible.  Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy O'Malley raised their concern about the fact that the rate on refunds was going to be different from the rate of tax applied in the other direction on late payments.  My advice is that interest is not charged by the Revenue Commissioners on late payments where the late payment arises from queries by the Revenue Commissioners or by failure to settle matters which are outside the control of the taxpayer.  However, I will have this matter examined further to ensure that the rate of interest, which is quite high, is levied only in cases where there is a degree of culpability on the part <Col N="2397" /> of the taxpayer and I will be able to deal in greater detail with that matter when we reach the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 17, to delete &ldquo;£6,300&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£6,600&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We propose to increase the exemption limits for old people from income tax in these amendments.  The Minister proposes an increase in the exemption limit of only £150 and I wish to indicate clearly the effects of the ministerial proposal and the amendments which I am proposing. For those over 65 the Minister's proposal will mean a net income of less than £1 per week and for those over 75 it will mean a net income of marginally more than £1 per week.  We are satisfied that such a provision is totally inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of enabling our old people to provide for themselves in the secure and familiar surroundings of their own homes, the Government's taxation policies now being proposed to us bite into their income at the rate of 35 per cent of anything earned in excess of £60 per week.  Anything in excess of that figure will be taxed at the rate of 35 per cent. It must be remembered that in this context we are dealing with old people.  The Government's policy undermines in many ways the independence and security of old people and obliges them to turn to the State because their capacity to provide for themselves has been reduced. Not only is this approach unfair and uncaring, but it is also economic nonsense. The Minister for Health has been demonstrating throughout the year that the cost to the State of the geriatric services, for instance, in our institutions must be reduced.  Through his actions, in line with Government policies, geriatric <Col N="2399" /> facilities have been closed and be numbers reduced in many hospitals.  The cheapest institutional care, at the lowest possible level, will cost the State £150 per week for maintenance, accommodation and food.  However, instead of increasing the exemptions from income tax to a figure that will enable old people to provide for themselves at home or engage some help at home, the Government prevent them from achieving this independence by allowing them to keep less than two-thirds of anything they earn over £60 per week.</P>
    <P>The Government have consistently shown a lack of awareness for the problems of the poor and the old and have deprived those people of their most important right to dignity and independence. In our amendments we are proposing as a first step &mdash; I must emphasise that it is only a first step and a small step &mdash; that the tax exemptions for people over 65 be increased to £3,300 per annum, £63.50 per week.  We are proposing that a person over 65 should not come into the tax net until that person earns in excess of £63.50 per week whether single or widowed.  Accordingly, we are proposing that the exemption for married people should be £127 per week.  I acknowledge that even our amendments are not nearly adequate to meet the problems faced by old people and pensioners who are liable to taxation.  I acknowledge that an income of £63.60 per week is subsistence level, if it is even that.  I acknowledge that an increase to the exemption figure I have suggested does not meet the needs of many people but it is certainly a significant improvement on the Government's position.</P>
    <P>For those over 75 we are proposing to the Minister that he should increase the exemption limits further, by £175 per annum for single people and £350 for married people.  I do not have the figures as yet but I am satisfied with the order of them &mdash; the Minister may give the House the figures when replying &mdash; which is that the cost to the State of the extra exemptions we are proposing would be much less than £500,000.  But the saving <Col N="2400" /> to the State from reducing the pressure on already overcrowded geriatric institutions would be far more than the cost, if one wants to call it that, of the initial tax concession.  I should like to press the Minister, and the Government parties, to accept these amendments.</P>
    <P>It is time for the Government to approach taxation policy in a much more constructive and sensible manner.  Failure to apply minimal concessions such as we are proposing can cost the State very much more through institutional care and prolong the wasteful expenditure on drugs, medicine and institutional care, that is made necessary by shortsighted Government policies.  Whether one approaches this argument from the point of view of justice, equity, social concern or social stability on the one hand or, on the other hand, from the point of view of minimising the cost to the State of providing security and comfort for our old people, the answer can only be the same.</P>
    <P>What we are proposing is not only the better way but the only way from whatever point of view one looks at it.  Our old people can make a major contribution to the stability of the family and the broader community in which they live.  It is self-evident that, where there is a settled community with old people as part of the family or the extended family, one gets a stability that is not a characteristic of communities that do not have the influence of the old among them.  Many of the new housing estates in our cities that do not have an established and settled old element prove the contribution old people can make.  Where there are young families, without the advice, respect and patience of the old, tensions occur.  For that reason it is essential, in the interests of all, that we do all we can to encourage old people to stay in their own home particularly if they can support themselves.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a group of pensioners who are attempting to support themselves.  We should ensure that that is established as a matter not just of Government policy today but of consensus Government policy for many <Col N="2401" /> years in the future.  Those people are entitled to the dignity of independence and their pensions should not be savagely reduced by a Government who profess to care for them.  They have already contributed handsomely to the welfare of the State throughout their working lives and also to the revenues of the State through taxation.  The least they should get in their later years from any Government who care for them is to be allowed these exemptions.  We are talking about people who might be able from their own income to provide for themselves if they were not subjected to further tax attacks on their meagre incomes which, in turn, will force them to turn to the institutions of the State, the welfare and medical services of the State at much greater cost to themselves and to the general body of tax payers.</P>
    <P>Lest the Minister would make a case about exemptions or certain child benefit schemes, it should be remembered that, by definition, these people will not be entitled to the provisions of any child benefit scheme.  They will not benefit from the bonanza the Government suggested would follow from the initiation of the child benefit scheme.  Many of these are bread and butter people who have been very seriously affected by the cutback in food subsidies.  There is no compensatory element for them in anything this Government have done.  They should not be subjected to savage reductions of their very limited incomes.  Surely it would be much more sensible to allow them whatever they have earned themselves up to a reasonable figure &mdash; and I believe our figure does not go far enough. But instead, having taken money from them by way of extra taxation, they force them to turn to the State, costing everybody more, in institutions where they will be less happy and secure than they would be in their own homes.</P>
    <P>Coalition Governments have a very poor record in providing for the needs of our old people.  I am afraid we are seeing it again.  The Labour Party who, I understand, on this very day are paying lipservice <Col N="2402" /> to their founder, James Connolly, would do better, instead of honouring him just with words to do so through their actions.  Seventy years after the man they commemorate, they might begin to examine their consciences.  Rather than coming in here limiting the exemptions for the people they purport to represent, they might act in some way consistent with what they proclaim to be their principles by accepting our proposals. Indeed, it is no coincidence that Deputy Mac Giolla's amendments would have the same effect.  It has to be said that anybody looking at the position must come to the same conclusion contained in the amendments before the House.</P>
    <P>The winter we have just come through has been notable more than anything else for the horrific number of deaths of old people through malnutrition and particularly hypothermia.  Inadequate heating, food and housing have become major problems for all but particularly for the old.  Organisations such as The Simon Community, ALONE and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul who cater for the old will tell one that the biggest problem they have encountered this last winter has been lack of basic heating.  Are we now proposing to impose tax on anything these people earn above £60?  If we do, do we realise that we will be throwing them onto the institutional care of the State which is not very merciful these days and at much greater cost to everybody?</P>
    <P>I plead with the House to support the amendments in my name and the name of Deputy Mac Giolla.  They make social sense, ensure a sense of justice and economic sense.  I can see no reason why the Minister should not accept them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased last year when an increase was granted in the age exemption <Col N="2403" /> limit because there had not been any granted for a number of years previously, I think since 1982.  I am pleased to note that a small increase is being granted this year.  But I do not think last year's or this year's make up in any way for the failure to increase these exemptions during the previous few years when inflation was running at a high rate.  Even in an endeavour to make up for lost time at least a 10 per cent increase should be granted this year.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Kennedy that it is very strongly felt by many people that elderly people who have worked all their lives, perhaps 40 or 50 years, who paid their taxes in that period, should not have to pay any taxes in their retirement. Rather they should be allowed to take up work of some nature.  They should be allowed their pension from their job and whatever other pensions are going in addition to whatever they might earn from some light work for a couple of hours in the morning, afternoon or whenever. Everybody agrees, certainly all medical opinion, that work therapy is the only therapy for the elderly.  It keeps them mentally alert, gives them the will to continue and, once that is broken, they go into the institutions.  Once they see themselves as of no use, then the senility commences, then the institutional care is needed.  They no longer have the will to look after themselves.</P>
    <P>A job of any nature, earning a few pounds, doing something useful, can be the greatest therapy of all for the elderly. It keeps them out of institutional care, indeed rendering them useful in the community. The Minister for Health is now trying to get everybody out of institutional care.  He wants to empty them out of all the psychiatric hospitals and have them living in communities.  Presumably he has in mind taking elderly people out of institutional care as well.  Our hospitals are becoming more and more packed with geriatric patients, many of whom are in psychiatric hospitals, many just put into care which will not be of any real benefit to them.  Presumably, when the <Col N="2404" /> Minister sees the benefit of taking psychiatric patients out of institutional care, he must also see the benefit of keeping elderly people in communities, helping and working within communities.</P>
    <P>If the tax exemption limits are not sufficient to allow elderly people to go out and get some kind of job, part time or otherwise&mdash; because they lose through tax&mdash;then they will see it is not worth their while or is of no benefit to them. Certainly in respect of the over 75s there is a very strong argument for having no limits.  These amendments specify minimum exemptions in an endeavour to make up for lost time.  They are not really tackling the problem of taxation of elderly people and the effect taxation has on them.  For example, the deduction of £1 tax from their pensions has an extraordinary effect on many elderly people who have had tax deducted from their wage packets all their lives, who perhaps paid for a pension out of their wages so that they would have a pension when they reached age 65.  Then, when they get that pension, they see that tax is deducted. We hope the exemption amount will be brought up a little in an endeavour to give a rate at least equivalent to that which they received four or five years ago.</P>
    <P>Our purpose in these amendments is to try to provide some comfort for elderly people who have spent their lives working for the country.  We want to give them some comfort in their last years so that they will be able to think of, perhaps, enjoying a holiday, or relaxing in reasonable housing, and so that they will be able to provide themselves with a little heat. The present taxation system does not allow for those small comforts.  These amendments are an indication of our attitude to the elderly, our recognition of the work they have done throughout their lives.  The State should not be expecting them in their last years to contribute to the Exchequer in the same way as people still at work.  At the moment the State expects them to do that until the day they go into their graves.  The elderly should not be subjected to anything but minimal <Col N="2405" /> taxes.  The meagre increase given by the Minister does not allow for the small comforts these people need and we are asking for an increase of 10 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's change.  An increase in the exemptions represents a benefit in real terms to those people.  In regard to Deputy Mac Giolla's reference to comfort and care, in order to ensure that people outside institutions are given proper care the solution is to increase the dependent relative's allowance so that people can be looked after in their homes.  I would point out that those in hospitals and other institutions have their pensions taxed and therefore it does not matter whether people are in hospitals or not.  If we want to keep people in the community we should do so by ensuring that those who take care of them will be given some tax relief.</P>
      <P>I do not see the point in the age exemption. The retiring age should be reduced from 65 years.  This would be an incentive to people to retire earlier.  If we reduced the retiring age from 65 to 60 we would create 10,000 jobs.  That would be more relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The relief given here amounts to only £1 a week for people at 65 years and £1.20 for those aged 75 and over.  I appreciate funds are extremely tight but, under the DIRT, people have their tax deducted and retained for a year and yet they are given £1 or £1.20 per week.  It is a pity that we cannot get our act together on this.  Here we give them increases of £1 or £1.20 but in another section those increases are being taken back and cannot be reclaimed for 12 months.  The Minister may not be able to change the DIRT but he could improve the lot of the elderly by increasing the proposed allowance to £2 a week for all elderly persons.  It is not realistic to hand out these increases and to take the money back at the same time.  I shudder to think of the administrative cost of doing that and it leaves elderly people worse off than they were under the 1985 Act.  The Minister should try to tidy up the Department's <Col N="2406" /> work on this.  I cannot see any difficulty in doing that.</P>
      <P>I am not convinced about the need for the difference in the allowances at 65 years and 75 years.  Again I shudder when I think of the administration costs.  There should be a straight age instead of differing between 65 and 75 years.  I should not be surprised if opting for one age would not cost the State an extra penny and this would be far more efficient.  Instead of having lower bands of taxation, we should follow the example set by successive Governments in bringing in exemption limits.  In the pink document, &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo; issued by the Government at the time of the budget, I see that a single person on £3,000 a year is in the tax net, although for a very small percentage of the income, under Schedule D.  It is suggested that we should follow the example set by the old age limit here.  What must be the administration cost of charging tax to people with incomes of £3,000?  It does not make any sense.  Anybody earning under £7,000 or £8,000 a year should not be paying tax. The whole system of payments and claims and the administration cost is absolutely frightening.  The Minister would learn from these exemption limits.  Once the figure was ascertained, people under that income should not pay tax and they can then forget about the paperwork and go about their ordinary lives.</P>
      <P>How many taxpayers are now being exempted under this section in the 65 and 75 age groups?  How many are being exempted who before this budget would not have been exempted?  Is the figure very significant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, what the Government are doing should be appreciated by the Deputies.  I would point out that as a result of the increase in exemptions introduced, which would cost the Exchequer almost £1 million, or £0.9 million in 1986 and £1.5 million in a full year, a total of 2,700 people who previously were liable to tax will be able to leave the income tax net.  A further 5,900 people, almost 6,000, will have reduced liability as a result of the operation of marginal <Col N="2407" /> relief.  That is what the Government are doing against a background of 3 per cent inflation in the community.  It is instructive to compare the rate of increase of this allowance with the rate of inflation in previous years.  What is being done this year is far better than what has been done by various Government in the early part of this decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give the House an example. This year, the increase in the allowance is 5 per cent, which by early 1980 standards is not a great deal but it is 5 per cent against a prospective inflation rate of 3 per cent &mdash; in other words, a 2 per cent real increase in the value of the exemption limit.  Last year the increase was 7 per cent as against an increase in inflation of 4.9 per cent or almost 5 per cent.  Again that was a 2 per cent real increase in the value of the exemption limit.  Compare that with the situation pertaining in the earlier part of this decade.  I am not making a political point here because these budgets were brought in by both Governments.  In the year 1981-82 the value of the age exemption limit was increased by 15 per cent as against an inflation rate of 23.3 per cent &mdash; in other words, a reduction obtained in the value of the exemption in that year of 7.3 per cent as against an increase in the real value of the exemption limit this year of 2 per cent.  The following year, 1982-83, the exemption limit was increased by 8 per cent in value as against a prevailing inflation rate of 12.3 per cent &mdash; again a reduction in value of the exemption limit in that year of 4.3 per cent when inflation is taken into account. This year, when inflation is taken into account, the 5 per cent increase represents a real increase of 2 per cent.  Some people just switch off when figures such as these are quoted because the facts are expressed in figures and somehow lose their meaning.  However, the reality is that these exemption limits are being increased more generously now when account is taken of inflation than was the case in the earlier part of the decade when larger nominal increases were given <Col N="2408" /> which meant nothing because the inflation rate was far greater than they were worth.  Now inflation is less than what the increases are worth.</P>
    <P>I agree completely with the sentiments expressed by Deputy O'Kennedy about the role of older people in our community and the need to integrate older people as far as possible into residential areas where younger people are also to be found.  That is a matter primarily of housing policy and the policy of local authorities with regard to planning in regard to particular types of houses.</P>

      <P>This is becoming very convoluted altogether.  I have no intention of calling anybody's integrity into question, least of all Deputy O'Kennedy's. The cost of the combined proposals of Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Mac Giolla would be an additional £0.9 million this year &mdash; not £500,000 as Deputy O'Kennedy has said.  The combined cost would be £0.9 million for 1986 and for the full year £1.4 million.  That is in addition to the present expenditure of £0.9 million in 1986 and £1.5 million for the full year.  We are doubling the cost, essentially.  I should very much like to do what Deputy O'Kennedy has suggested for the reasons which he gave, which are not at all objectionable.  Everybody on this side of the House and in other quarters of the House would favour the idea of giving greater income tax relief to older people.  However, what we are giving this year is better than the rate of inflation whereas in earlier years it was considerably worse than the inflation rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is because some people will benefit from tax relief whose <Col N="2410" /> incomes will be very large and who will be paying a substantial part of tax at the maximum rate of 58 per cent.  An exemption in such cases is worth 58 in the £ whereas it would be only 35 for people at the standard rate and nothing for those without taxable income.  For that reason the Government are of the view that in general terms &mdash; this is not an absolute principle to apply to all cases &mdash; it is better to assist certain cases by means of direct assistance but that, essentially, would come within the responsibility of the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>We should like to do more but what we are doing now is ahead of inflation. We agree with the parties on all sides that it is best to assist people who live at home.  We will continue to do everything possible for old people by way of our housing policy, an area in which we have been especially successfully in providing flatlets for old people on a scale that has not been the case before.  In this way we are encouraging older people to live in their own neighbourhoods and in conjunction with younger people in the same estates.  These are all matters on which we find common cause on both sides of the House but, as Deputy Brennan said fairly, the Government have the problem of finding the money.  Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Mac Giolla have put forward many amendments but they do not have to add up the cost.  However, that is in the nature of the exercise in which they are engaged so I am not making the point by way of any disdain.  It is an exercise in which I have had to engage in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally this is a factor of 40 per cent.  The Minister gave the gross figure and that represents in net terms almost exactly what I said, that is, £500,000 though it could be up to £600,000.  For a figure in terms of taxation costs of £600,000 there would be a saving of considerably more in terms of the cost of institutional care, maintenance, drugs and so on that otherwise the State would have to bear as people would be forced to turn to the State for such help because of not being able to provide for themselves. That is why, as I said initially, the argument is not only sustainable but is absolutely incontrovertible either in terms of social or economic policy.  If the matter is approached purely in terms of the immediate cost or in terms of tax revenue foregone, one is ignoring the other consequences that arise by way of the alternative expenditure the State must undertake in respect of old people. That point cannot be overlooked.  We all agree that old people should be encouraged and helped to live in their own communities where they are a stabilising influence but the difference between us and the Government is that, when it comes to implementing those principles, the Minister seems to suggest these are matters of housing and social welfare policy and not of taxation policy.</P>

We are talking about a diminishing force in every sense of the word and certainly in terms of numbers but these old people should not be made a diminishing force in terms of their social impact, of their standing in our community, or of the contribution they can make.  The additional cost to the State of exempting a further 1,700 people would probably be in the region of £500,000 but in the long run a lot of money would be saved.  That is why I propose that the Minister accept the amendment.</P>

For his doubling of the cost, whereas we are exempting a total of 2,700 people, his proposal would exempt a further 1,700.  Is that superabundantly clear?</P>

      <P>Every taxpayer who is over 65 years of age will benefit &mdash; I am surprised Deputy Brennan is asking this &mdash; by either of the two proposals.  The position is that 2,700 people under our proposal will come out of the tax net altogether because their incomes are so low.  If Deputy O'Kennedy's and Deputy Mac Giolla's proposal were adopted, which would cost twice as much, a further 1,700 people on top of the 2,700 people who would be exempted under our proposal would also be exempt.  Our proposal increases the exemption limit by 5 per cent.  Inflation is 3 per cent.  In other words, the value of the exemption limit is up 2 per cent in real terms.  This compares with earlier years when the exemption limit was cut substantially after account was taken of inflation.  I quoted figures already which showed quite clearly that to be the case.  There was an increase of 15 per cent in the allowance in 1981-82 at a time when inflation was running at 23 per cent which meant a reduction in the value of the allowance of 7 per cent in real terms.  Therefore, this year instead of reducing it in real terms, when inflation is taken into account, we are increasing it.  That is something which needs to be borne in on the Deputies opposite.  It is worth repeating given that I have had to repeat some of the other things a number of times.</P>

      <P>There is something strange about these figures.  The Minister said that 1,700 people under our proposal would benefit to the tune this year of £0.9 million.  I have done a calculation on that figure and I find that means each of these would benefit by £530 net.  This £530 which otherwise would go to the Revenue Commissioners will now be in their pockets. I cannot square that figure if each of <Col N="2416" /> them is to get the £530 net.  Presumably, the Revenue Commissioners would be £530 worse off in respect of each of them. How can the Minister square that with the fact that our proposal is only to increase the actual tax exemption by £300 in the case of married couples?</P>

      <P>If the income to the Revenue Commissioners as a result of my proposal is to be reduced by £900,000 it follows as a consequence that the income of those we are speaking about will be enhanced by £900,000.

      <P>I am surprised in a way. What I said was that an additional 1,700 people would be totally exempt from tax under the Deputy's proposal.  That does not mean it is only those who will be exempt from tax who will benefit.  Others who are paying tax higher up along the line will pay less tax because they will have a larger exemption limit.  Therefore, there are two categories of beneficiaries: those who are totally exempt and those who pay less tax.  We have to take both into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The exemption limits for the people we are talking about will have no effect at all on the body of taxpayers who are not included in the exemption.  Therefore, when the Minister tells me that other people up along the <Col N="2417" /> line will pay less tax because of increased exemption limits, he is emphatically wrong.  I do not know where he gets that nonsense from.  He should spend a bit more time checking before he makes a statement like that.  The smaller number on marginal relief, and they are a very small number, will be affected but they are of such a small number that it would make no difference to the Minister's calculations. To say that the rest of the taxpaying public will have their tax bills reduced, is wrong.</P>

      <P>In page 9, after line 33 to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  Section 1 of the Finance Act, 1980, is hereby amended, as respects the year 1986-87 and subsequent years of assessment, by the substitution <Col N="2419" /> in subsection (2) of &ldquo;£5,800&rdquo; for &ldquo;£5,300&rdquo; (inserted by the Finance Act, 1985), of &ldquo;£2,900&rdquo; for &ldquo;£2,650&rdquo; (inserted by the Finance Act, 1985).&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This deals with the area of the general tax exemption limits.  For the first time in many years, certainly for the first time since I came into the House 17 years ago, the Minister for Finance has not increased the general exemption limits from income tax.  The Minister now proposes that all married couples, irrespective of the number of children they may have, with a weekly income in excess of £102 should be subject to tax.  At a time when the burden of taxation is hitting every section of the community it is abundantly clear that married couples with that level of income are unable to provide for themselves without assistance from the many voluntary and social organisations throughout the country.  Those voluntary and social organisations will testify to this.  It is grossly unjust that any State should exact tax from lower income families. The consequences of that reduction in their income will mean that those families will then have to turn to other organisations to restore what the State has taken from them so that they can provide for the most basic and fundamental needs of their families.  When this is taken in conjuction with the abolition of the £100 child allowance it is causing intense hardship on many families.  In addition, the Government have further aggravated the problems for these low income families by the reduction in food subsidies.</P>
    <P>It has been established by many reports, among them the NESC reports, that the level of indirect taxation impinges about 35 per cent of total income on low income families and only about 12½ per cent to 15 per cent of total income on higher income families who earn about four times more than those about whom we are speaking.  I ask the Minister to bear in mind that, even if he accepts what I am proposing, the indirect taxation will bite almost three times more severely on the low income groups than it does on the <Col N="2420" /> higher income groups.  The Government are aggravating the social tensions that are so widespread in our community at present.  They are directly and callously turning their backs on those in particular need.  I demand that the Government parties give us the reason and the justification for this.  When we see evidence of grinding poverty, reductions in food subsidies, problems of social tension, psychiatric disorders and everybody luxuriating in condemnation of the violent elements in our society, what we are doing is spreading the seeds of further tension.  We react in a typical, uncaring, high-handed fashion by demanding tougher penalties, more law and order, more supervision and more prisons.  It is the negative reaction of a Government who do not have any consistent direction either for economic policy or social concern. This is one area which should be tackled in an effective way.</P>
    <P>I want to address the absent Labour Party.  Nothing changes in a Finance Bill debate.  For the record, this is my fourth successive time addressing this House on Finance Bill debates, on matters of exemptions for the lower paid and the old and on matters of reduced taxation for the lower paid.  The benches of that shameless party have been in exactly the same condition as they are this morning. Not once in four years was any member of the Labour Party present to attempt to justify what they are supporting in the name of Government.  When the bells ring they come in here and do not want to know what they are voting on because it is too hurtful and too shameful.  They prefer to troop up the steps behind their masters and vote against everything they claim to represent.  I understand that today is a special day for them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

How can the Minister who is present, members of the Labour Party who, as ever, are absent, or any other Member suggest to the people of the country in the way they vote today that £102 per week is adequate to meet all the outgoings of a family or that an income of £56 per week is adequate for a single or a widowed person?  If that is what they assert by their vote the people should know it.  I will not be personal in respect of the Minister. At least we do not hear him mouthing protests of his constant concern for the section the Labour Party pretend to protect. The people they honour today, and their founder member, James Connolly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a disgrace that in 1986 we have not increased the tax exemption limits beyond £102 for married people and £51 for single or widowed people.  If I gave the figure of £56 earlier I wish to correct it to £51.  That amount is entirely inadequate.  As soon as a person <Col N="2422" /> receives in excess of that income he must pay 35 per cent to the State in respect of everything he earns.  In this year we should not repudiate by our actions the people we proclaim to honour, particularly James Connolly.  I hope the Labour Party, after four years of turning their back on the people they claim to respect, will face reality.  Their conduct in the past four years has been shameful.</P>
      <P>We propose that the exemption limits be increased to £5,800 per annum which works out at £111.50 per week for a married couple and to £2,900 per annum or £55.75 per week for single and widowed people.  I do not think our proposals go near to meeting the case but at least they are an advance and it is a direction that I hope will be followed by future Governments, irrespective of their political background.  Even if our proposals are accepted we will have in the tax net married and single people who would be well below income tax liability in any other EC country.  In terms of social concern and justice there is a crying need to do something for the people to whom I have referred.  There is also the economic argument which favours increasing the exemption limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net cost to the State this year if our proposal is accepted would be much less than £3 million out of a total tax bill of £6,000 million.  If we do not provide these exemptions a number of consequences will follow.  First, a person will be better off being unemployed, thus receiving rent relief, a waiver on water charges and many of the other allowances available for the unemployed.  In addition, the implications with regard to work are very serious.  We are talking about people who have the lowest level of income and we have to consider the implications with regard to their health, the tension and the various psychiatric disorders many of them suffer and the cost of medicines and drugs.  Neither can we forget the social rejection experienced by people who cannot provide for themselves. We force them to become dependent on the State for medical and other services.  As an eminent social scientist pointed out, we provide them with medicines <Col N="2423" /> such as valium and librium at a high cost but we do not provide them with the right to keep for themselves an amount that will enable them to provide for their own families.  Yet, it costs us much more when we force them to turn to the State for all their needs.  There is also the danger that young people may rebel against authority.</P>
    <P>I would have thought the Minister would have been aware of all these aspects.  I did not think he would be caught in the trap of merely considering figures.  I did not think his attitude would be just to get in the revenue irrespective of the consequences.  That is no proper policy.  The Minister has a great opportunity here at little cost in tax terms.  If he adopts the attitude we have recommended there will be savings in the Votes for the Departments of Social Welfare, Health and Justice.  Accepting our amendment is not only the right thing to do for social reasons but it is the right thing to do for economic reasons.  I hope that for once he will give the lead to the Labour Party who are associated with him in Government.  In that way we will get more economic sense and a greater degree of social justice.</P>

      <P>With the various rates of exemption there is also marginal relief from which many taxpayers will benefit. Most of them are senior citizens but not exclusively so.  Taxpayers in general will benefit from marginal relief because of their low level of income.  Such incomes may hardly exceed the exemption levels or they can exceed them by as much as £1,000 but because of marginal relief those affected can be better off than they would be on normal income tax allowances. Very few taxpayers are aware of this benefit.</P>
      <P>I have a higher proportion of people coming with tax queries than most Deputies. The area in which I have the highest success rate, if I can use that term, in being of assistance to my constituents is in pointing out the area of marginal relief, something of which they are not aware and of which the inspector of taxes may not be aware because they will not have filled out form 12.  I should like to see greater advertising of this relief because people who could benefit from it are not aware of it.  Most of them are senior citizens but there are also others who would qualify.  I would ask the Minister to make this information more widely available.</P>

      <P>That is a lot of money. It must be borne in mind that one cannot look at the exemption limits in isolation from other ameliorations in the tax position that are being introduced.  We have a substantial increase in personal allowances, a reduction in the top rate of tax and the abolition of the 1 per cent levy.  In the case of low income families at work, which I take to be a concern of Deputy O'Kennedy, we have the family income supplement, a very valuable assistance designed to help people out of the poverty trap and make sure that they are not worse off by being at work than being unemployed.  All these measures are designed to help the people for whom Deputy O'Kennedy is making a case.  If one shuts one's eyes to all the other things that are being done and hones in only on the exemption limits, I suppose it is possible to make quite an eloquent case. Nobody would accuse Deputy O'Kennedy of lacking eloquence in what he has had to say here.</P>

      <P>The real problem is the cost.  We have far too much taxation, as everybody knows.  If one begins to chip away at the tax base without chipping away at spending one ends up with a bigger gap. One cannot bridge the gap indefinitely by borrowing.  I do not want to go back over these time-worn truths but nonetheless they are true.  Perhaps at a later stage I will add up the cost of all Deputy O'Kennedy's amendments and ask myself what programmes would have to be stopped, what health and social welfare services would have to be stopped to make&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 10, in the Table, Part I, column (1) to delete &ldquo;£4,700&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£5,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is the only substantive amendment we are putting to the House for consideration on the income tax allowances and tax bands.  It is very much less than would be expected from any Opposition, and very much less than the Minister proposed when he was in this seat four years ago.  In one of his amendments when he was Opposition spokesman for Finance he called for an extra expenditure of £162 million in 1982 and the Official Report of the debate on the Finance Bill, 1982, records that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this amendment, which affects all the income tax bands, we are proposing to increase the 35 per cent tax band from £4,700 to £5,000.  The other bands will remain the same, but the tax liability of all taxpayers, particularly those on the <Col N="2430" /> lower tax bands, will be reduced by a reasonably significant figure.  I do not yet have the precise cost of this amendment, although I have an approximate figure, and it might be helpful if the Minister told me what this measure would cost in 1986 and in a full year, if adopted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1986 the figure would be £14.9 million and in a full year it would be £24.9 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it would cost approximately £15 million this year and the Minister has confirmed that.  The Minister's figure of £14.9 million is the gross amount and the actual loss to the Revenue in net terms would be of the order of £10 million.  I want to have it recorded that that is what it would cost to implement our proposal.  I do not want anybody on the Government's side saying during the debate that Fianna Fáil argue for spending money freely and without any sense of concern.  Before this debate ends I will be able to demonstrate that, if all measures we are proposing were adopted, the extra cost in taxation would not exceed £25 million, in many cases the Minister would get enhanced tax revenue and there would be a major boost to the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We put down this amendment because it is important that all taxpayers should benefit from our proposal.  Clearly we would like to achieve a position where two-thirds of taxpayers would be paying the standard rate.  That does not go quite so far but it moves in that direction.  In achieving that we would fall in line with the pattern of the other member states of the EC.  It must be recalled that, since this Government came into office, total taxation has increased two and a half times and income tax has more than doubled in the same period, and all that from a Government who, amongst other promises which they have blatantly ignored, promised to reduce or maintain the level of taxation.  Taxation is the base of the problems we have been experiencing for the past three years in particular. Some economic commentators have writ- <Col N="2431" /> ten the present Minister's name up in lights.  I refer him especially to editorials in the <i>Wall Street Journal.</i> Many of these commentators will prove conclusively that the policies pursued by this Government on tax imposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>With the growth of income tax here to two and a half times what it was when this Government came <Col N="2432" /> into office, and with the obvious example of the impact of taxation on our economy, it is time the Government made this minimal &mdash; as the Minister has acknowledged it is &mdash; adjustment towards equity and taxation and particularly towards reducing the impact on the higher tax bands.  A 35 per cent rate of tax is by no means a light tax burden in any other country.  In some EC States it is about the maximum that applies and, as the Commission on Taxation have pointed out, we should be moving in that direction. This proposal is meant to achieve at least the first faltering steps to attain that degree of balance in our tax code and that degree of equity.  It will be particularly beneficial to the lower paid but it will affect every other taxpayer through the other tax bands.  That is the way it should be.  The lower paid in particular should be encouraged.  The reasons are obvious.</P>
      <P>First, the work incentive has been absent from our country for the past three years.  The fact that people move into higher tax bands through overtime has caused major problems for productivity for many of our industries.  Very many businessmen must have told the Minister, as they have told me day after day &mdash; and he must have been in direct contact with many of these industries in his former responsibility &mdash; that when they get special orders to be fulfilled within a limited period they cannot arrange overtime with the workforce to meet those special orders because they move into higher tax bands.  As a consequence many market opportunities are being lost to this economy. That is one of the matters I am attempting to tackle in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, this affects our general level of taxation.  It is now established beyond yea or nay that our general level of taxation is the highest in all the democratic countries in the world and it is past time that we did something about it.  It has been the biggest single disincentive to investment in this economy, when outside the opportunities for expansion are unprecedented, when markets are opening and other economies show growth projections of a kind they have not <Col N="2433" /> experienced for the past 15 years and when the Federal Republic, Japan and all the leading economies of the western world are revising upwards their growth targets for 1986.  All these new markets are available to us provided we turn our backs on the policies of retrenchment that have been characteristic of this Government.</P>
    <P>We are not proposing here a spendthrift policy, far from it.  As will be evident from every amendment we introduce, we are proposing a modulated, prudent approach which is the signal for a total reversal of the policies that have been pursued for the past three years.  This Minister has had the unique opportunity while in Government of being given a new responsibility within the same Government.  In some instances I would be quite happy to acknowledge that in many of the things the Minister has been saying and some of the things he proposes in this Bill, he has shown a new sense of direction, which we welcome, to promote investment and to encourage incentive, but he will acknowledge that it does not go nearly far enough either to overcome the problems or to meet the potential that is there at this moment.  We must give a clear signal that at last we are beginning to tackle the burden of taxation which is the single major brake on our economic development now and has been for some time past.</P>
    <P>I do not want to extend the argument here.  The facts speak for themselves.  Our amendment has been very carefully framed after much thought and consideration. It has the merit that, while it will impinge particularly on the lower paid, it will have an effect on the other bands.  Fortunately, it does not reduce the total tax revenue even in tax terms by any significant amount, £10 million out of a total tax take of £6,000 million. I will be able to demonstrate in a more general debate that not only would we not lose revenue if this proposal were adopted, but because of enhanced economic activity, increased employment and lower social welfare payments, <Col N="2434" /> we would have a very much better return than the immediate cost of £10 million to the Revenue would suggest.  I press the Minister to accede to this proposal, major in terms of impact but not in terms of cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Standing Orders, not by any wish of mine.  I would be delighted to hear suggestions from the opposite side of the House as to how taxes could be raised.  I have a great deal of sympathy with Deputy O'Kennedy's point.  Of course the burden of taxation is too high and we would like to get it down.  Many people do not have an incentive to take on additional work and if they feel discouraged it has a bad effect on them.  I have no doubt that that is the case because we have a higher burden of taxation than most of our competitor nations.  We also have a higher debt than <Col N="2436" /> any other country and virtually every pound raised in income tax is used to pay interest on that debt, either to domestic bond holders or to foreign banks.  We have to run the country on VAT and excise duties and whatever other small taxes are collected.  Income tax revenue is not available to us because it is used to pay interest to banks.  That does not apply to other countries with which Deputy O'Kennedy unfavourably compared this country.  I wish it were otherwise and I am sure he does too, but no amount of &ldquo;blaming the Government&rdquo; changes that.</P>
      <P>Obviously we must try to reduce the burden of taxation and we are doing so in the budget.  Deputy O'Kennedy has adopted a form of tunnel vision, he is looking at his proposal and saying how reasonable it is.  There is no doubt that within its own lights it is reasonable and it would be great if we could adopt it. However, he has ignored the other steps taken by the Government to relieve the burden of taxation such as the reduction in the top rate of tax, the abolition of the 1 per cent levy, the increase in the PAYE allowance and so on which are all designed to improve the situation.  This year we are spending in the region of £120 million on tax reliefs whereas if we were simply indexing, as was done last year, we would be spending £65 million or £70 million.  We are relieving taxation in excess of indexation by a substantial amount.  Deputy O'Kennedy wants to do more and so do I but the problem is that, to do more, you must reduce expenditure. Deputy O'Kennedy's proposals would cost money in terms of the immediate loss even after taking into account&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This debate has not added much to the store of public wisdom because we all agree that taxation should be reduced, it is simply a question of what we can do in a given year.

      <P>The figure I propose in my amendments for the Minister's figures are ones which represent an increase of 7 per cent on the present figure.  The reason we chose the figure of 7 per cent was because that was the amount by which it is estimated wages and salaries will rise on average this year.  If those figures were accepted we would have precise indexation of the bands that are involved in section 2 for the application of the different rates of income tax.  I do not see what can be wrong with seeking to index those bands and those different levels.  The amounts concerned are modest.  I notice that the figures proposed are even less than the figures proposed by Deputy O'Kennedy.  The figures should be accepted and the Minister should not be hell bent on trying to increase substantially the amount of money which he will take from taxpayers this year by way of income tax.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair.  At the time of the budget the Government's figures indicated that they would get £253 million more from income tax this year, an increase of 12 per cent in the income tax bill.  What has to be borne in mind is that that increase of 12 per cent in the total yield from income tax is taking place in 1986, a year when the annual rate of inflation is estimated to be 3 per cent.  In other words, the additional yield of income tax is four times the estimated rate of inflation for the year.  Therefore, there is a very substantial increase in the burden of income tax on the taxpayers this year in real terms and not just in cash terms.  That explains the Minister's unwillingness to index the various bands, allowances and so on that would keep the burden the same in real terms as it was last year.  I do not think it is asking too much of any Minister for Finance to keep the burden of income tax in real terms the same in 1986 as it was in 1985.  In 1985 it was crucifying and it did enormous damage to our economy to have such rates of personal taxation and such a huge amount taken from each worker in tax. This year the amount will be substantially higher.</P>
      <P>I am seeking to achieve the same burden in real terms as last year and I do not think that is unreasonable.  Indexation is taken for granted in most other countries.  If there was a failure to apply indexation in any year in Britain there would be screams.  It would be rightly described as an insignificant increase in income tax in real terms.  Indexation takes place regularly in Britain but here it seems to be unthinkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I took a note of a sentence used by the Minister some moments ago, one with which I must inevitably take issue.  The Minister said that the various changes in income tax that were made in the budget <Col N="2441" /> and in the Bill were &ldquo;relieving taxation in excess of indexation&rdquo;.  I have given the figures which clearly show that with an increased take of 12 per cent in a year when inflation is running a 3 per cent and incomes are estimated to increase by 7 per cent &mdash; the latter is a very regrettable figure because it is more than double the rate of inflation and the Government were wrong to arrive at that sort of figure in so far as things were under their control but we are stuck with it now &mdash; the income tax take will be four times one of those figures and almost double the other one.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister argue, therefore, that he is &ldquo;relieving taxation in excess of indexation&rdquo;?  The position is quite the contrary.  There is a huge additional burden.  This happened in the past and the Minister is trying to apply the technique that his predecessor had of quoting figures in a way that would convince people in the short-term that they were going to be better off in some way.  It is only when they get their pay packet after the new rules are introduced that they realise that they are substantially worse off.  Their reaction to the 1985 budget was that it was great, that there were income tax cuts and that they would be better off but when April came they found they were worse off.  We are finding the same now.  The global figures from taxpayers as a whole show an increase of 12 per cent which is well above anything that could remotely be akin to indexation.  I am seeking, in these figures, simply to try to retain indexation as best I can.  That is something that would be taken for granted in any other country.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were to do that he would still have a substantial increase in his income tax take because this DIRT tax will bring in a huge amount of money, most of it coming from people who are not liable to income tax anyway but who will be forced to pay it.  If the Minister had any bona fides in regard to these matters that he has talked about often at such length, then here is his opportunity. Let him introduce indexation in so far as income tax is concerned.  He will still get <Col N="2442" /> a huge increase in yield, mainly as a result of the DIRT tax, but at least let him not increase substantially, in real terms, the payments that will be made by ordinary taxpayers who, as we all know, are more hard-pressed than any other income taxpayers in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy O'Malley wants would cost £15.9 million in a full year.  He does not seem to understand what is indexation.  Indexation is moving tax allowances and bands up in line with inflation, with purchasing power, not with average incomes.  If average incomes are increasing at twice the rate of inflation &mdash; which is the case, as Deputy O'Malley pointed out &mdash; the commitment to indexation is simply to increase the allowances and bands in line with inflation, not twice that amount which would be in line with average incomes.  Therefore, indexation is being adhered to.  That would apply in Britain or any other country where indexation is considered to be part of tax policy.  It is indexation by reference to the CPI, to inflation, not reference to average incomes.  In the latter situation we would have the trade union movement, pushing for higher wages for whatever group, determining tax policy.  If they were able to get increases at four times the rate of inflation, the Government would be obliged to increase the tax bands by four times the rate of inflation. That is not what indexation is about. Indexation is about keeping in line with the CPI, an independently-determined figure, which takes into account the cost of living as distinct from wage increases. For that reason I have to say that Deputy O'Malley's amendment is based simply on a false understanding of what is indexation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If people's incomes are going up beyond the rate of inflation, and allowances are being adjusted in line with inflation, people will find themselves in higher tax bands but that is because their incomes, in real terms, are going up. Some of that, not all, is being handed over to the State to keep services going and, as I pointed out in reply to Deputy O'Kennedy, to service debts, some of which date back to the time Deputy O'Malley was in Government.  Obviously that is a regrettable reality.  But indexation is increasing the allowances and bands in line with inflation.  We have done not just that.  We have done more than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is being unfair to the proposals of Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy O'Malley in trying to suggest that somehow one is seeking a £15 million giveaway and the other a £24 million giveaway.  That is the impression the Minister sought to create here over the last half hour or so.  We should put it in the context not so much of a giveaway to taxpayers but trying, somehow, to return to a little bit of normality rather than some sudden giveaway or handback of money to taxpayers.  That is what is behind the suggestions here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that the tax burden is too high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister acknowledges that.  But it is important in the context of the Minister trying to create the impression that both amendments, one involving a figure of £15 million and the other £24 million, somehow represented fresh money we would have to give to the taxpayer.  That is an unfair impression to give.  In effect what we are talking about in a very marginal way is a reversal of the drift which has taken place over the past couple of years.  For example, before the budget the income tax take was down as £2,260 million.  As a <Col N="2444" /> result of the changes proposed since the budget and contained in this Bill, the take, including the levies, I calculate will rise to a figure of £2,477 million.  I calculate that to be an increase of £217 million; Deputy O'Malley calculated it at £253 million.  Either way it still represents an increase of 10 per cent to 12 per cent in the burden of taxation and the receipts to the Exchequer from taxation.  The point has not been properly or clearly answered as to how one arrives at a situation in which the burden is increasing and yet inflation is not moving at anything like that rate.</P>
      <P>Indeed, there are some other things at which we should be looking.  It is all part of the theme being put across in this section, which is that we are not seeking something new, we are seeking a slight reversal of the nonsense that has been going on in recent years.  For example, in 1982 the share of income tax in relation to total taxation was 36 per cent.  It is now 41 per cent, and that in a couple of short years.  Perhaps I should be even more specific and say that out of every £100 paid in income tax in 1985 the PAYE sector contributed £87, and the previous year they contributed £84.  That is further evidence that the PAYE sector is supporting the whole tax structure to an unacceptable level.</P>
      <P>I welcome the abolition of the 1 per cent cent levy; that was a sensible decision. Nevertheless, it is still estimated to bring in £36 million this year.  That is a substantial income from something that is being abolished.  It points to this increased burden of tax that has been continuing.  I do not think the Minister needs me to dwell on that very much longer except to support the point being made from this side of the House and by Deputy O'Malley, which is that the increased burden of taxation is quite clear, of the order of 10 per cent to 12 per cent and, in that context, it is difficult to justify the Minister's approach to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I might take it down to the level of the man in the street, as it were, away from those global figures.  In the document accompanying the budget, the Principal Features of the Budget, we see <Col N="2445" /> that a married man on £10,000 would receive a reduction in tax of £100, that is, approximately £2 per week.  If one substracts from that the increase in the price of petrol, value-added tax and the abolition of the £100 child allowance, I calculate &mdash; and my evidence on the ground suggests &mdash; that the average family is much worse off under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I might revert to what I said on the last section: within the same Bill why do we, on the one hand, give some reliefs and, on the other &mdash; it should be remembered we are not running three or four different countries, it is the same country, the same people out there &mdash; in another page of the same Bill, affecting the same people, take back immediately, as in the case of the DIRT tax from elderly people and the age allowance in the Bill itself?  We must stop doing that in these Finance Bills.</P>
    <P>One of the reports of the Commission on Income Taxation contained the remark that our taxation system was unfair, muddled and complicated.  This section, indeed this Bill generally, is rendering it more unfair, muddled and complicated.  I might ask the Minister to consider this: the reports of the Commission on Income Taxation are something to which most politicians have paid some lip service in recent months.  I do not know if this is possible, outside the annual Finance Bill, but is it possible to bring in special legislation to deal particularly and specifically with the reports of the Commission on Income Taxation, section by section, or report by report?  Is that an option available to the Minister?</P>
    <P>The trouble is that everybody likes the reports of the Commission on Income Taxation but, when one begins inserting their suggestions in Finance Bills, they become mixed-up as part of Government policy, in the political sense and, as such, no real thought is given to what kind of progress we can make in that area.  The commission made some brilliant suggestions, with some of which I would have difficulty.  I should like to see a series of Bills bringing forward the suggestions contained in the reports of the <Col N="2446" /> Commission on Income Taxation.  I should like to see them debated in that atmosphere.  That would be very helpful in progressing the debate on Irish taxation which is an extremely complicated and muddled question at present.</P>

      <P>In fairness, when the Bill was introduced in the House by the then Minister for Finance, in very difficult circumstances the Minister went quite a distance in that respect.  Anybody advocating in the House today that we should implement the recommendations of the Commission on Income Taxation is really saying we should abolish income tax relief on interest paid on mortgages. I hope that is what will be recorded in the newpapers tomorrow when they quote some Deputies.  We cannot take part of the report of the Commission on Income Taxation and ignore the other parts.  In these amendments, if we are to take the points being made seriously, we are engaging in a Dutch auction.  Deputy O'Malley went only as far as £9,630, Deputy O'Kennedy has gone to £10,000 and we should be saying: &ldquo;Do we hear £12,000?&rdquo;</P>

We here <Col N="2447" /> have been advocating for a long time that an incentive has to be given to work rather than go on the dole.

      <P>I wish to give some figures supplied to me by people whom Deputy Mitchell might describe as better informed than I.  For the Deputy's information I will be quoting figures given by the Minister for Finance in reply to parliamentary questions over the years. In 1982, before the Government came to office, total tax was £4,000 million.  This year, after more than three years, total tax will have reached just short of £6,000 million, an increase of 66 per cent.  As Deputies have pointed out, the level of increase in income tax has been even more significant.  In 1982, the yield was £1,400 million, a little more than 11½ per cent of GNP.  This year the figure will be £2,351 million, 14½ per cent of GNP.</P>

    <P>Total taxation has been increasing at an enormous rate since the Government took office but the growth of income tax is especially worrying.  If the Minister acknowledges, as he said he does, that income tax levels are too high, and so are general tax levels, why in the 1983 budget did the Government decide to keep taxation at a level unprecedented here or elsewhere?  They were going to eliminate the current budget deficit, and a deliberate decision was taken by the Government to increase taxation.  In every sense we are suffering the consequences.  If I <Col N="2448" /> may be allowed to say it by one who knows more than I, for Deputy Mitchell's benefit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thought Deputy Mitchell said I was not sufficiently familiar with my brief and that I was not able to cope with it.  If I acknowledge his great personal knowledge it seems to hurt him. We will confine ourselves to the issues rather than have personal observations from Deputy Mitchell.  He is here long enough to have learned a little more. He should at least have learned that the beginning of knowledge is to recognise the extent of your ignorance.  That takes years.  The figures I have given demonstrate that the growth of total taxation, including income tax, is of very serious concern.  My figures go marginally above those of Deputy O'Malley but we are both proposing that the Minister should take the first faltering steps, at very little cost having regard to the total tax in a year.  When you take total taxation of £6,000 million and the total cost of what I am proposing, £10 million, the Minister would be showing that new sense of direction if he accepted our proposals, and we would all finish in front.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think what I say will make any difference to those on the other side because they have decided to follow a particular line.  There are a few things I must repeat.  Our scope for reducing income tax is less than elsewhere because all our income tax revenue is used up on debt servicing.  We are doing better than under indexation which means increasing bands and allowances in line with inflation, which is 3.3 per cent this year.  Let us compare what is being done in the budget with indexation.  Let us take a single person on £6,000 a year. Under the Finance Bill provisions he will be paying about 18 per cent of his income in tax.  On the basis of full indexation, he would be paying 19.75 per cent of his <Col N="2449" /> income in tax.  Therefore, he is paying 1½ per cent less in tax than he would be under an indexation system.  A married person on £6,000 a year, on the basis of full indexation, would be paying 6.8 per cent of his income in tax but under the budget he is paying 6.76 per cent.</P>
      <P>If one wants to go a little higher in the tax bands, take a married couple with one spouse earning £15,000 a year.  Under the budget scheme he will be paying 24.6 per cent of his income in tax, but if we had full indexation in line with inflation he would be paying 26.2 per cent of his income in tax.  So he is paying less under the budget scheme than he would under indexation which is being vaunted by at least one of the Opposition Deputies.  I have sheaves of illustrations to give, but they all indicate one thing, that we are doing better than indexation in this Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy O'Malley want to do even more, and so do I.  It would be highly desirable that we should give even greater income tax relief, but we are not as free to do that as we should like.  This is, first, because practically all our income tax revenue is used up in servicing our debt and, secondly, because we have not been able to introduce sufficient economies in expenditure and, after all, we are raising the taxes in the first place to pay for things.  We have not been able to reduce our spending enough to reduce income tax further.  If Deputy O'Kennedy does not already know, reducing expenditure is not an easy task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extremely easy to stand up at a meeting of hard pressed taxpayers and say with brilliant sincerity and perspiring intensity: &ldquo;I believe in reducing public spending.  I want to reduce taxation.&rdquo; Anybody could say that.  It is another matter to take the hard decisions and make the cuts where you actually hurt people directly, and in many cases the expenditure cuts involve people losing their jobs who have mortgages and who are counting on a particular scheme or activity being continued by the Government, but find that as a result of the <Col N="2450" /> Government's economies it is no longer continuing.  The situation is not that the tax burden is being slightly increased. It is that they have no income where previously they had one.  That is what you are talking about much of the time when you are talking about cutting spending. While it is easy to get applause for calling in general terms for cuts in spending, it is not quite so easy when it comes to making the specific decisions.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we have a capacity in this House to keep things general&mdash;keep talking in general terms and you will never go too far wrong.  That is something of which we are all guilty from time to time.  It is easy for all of us to be in favour of reduced taxation; we all are.  The problem comes about in making the expenditure cuts to pay for it.  Certainly there is one thing we should not do&mdash;and this is where I would make as earnest an appeal as possible to Deputy O'Kennedy, his friends, and others who have influence on public debates&mdash;we should not promise increases in spending over the next year or two.  We shall be coming into the season when this sort of speech becomes fashionable.  If we are to have any hope of implementing reductions in income tax in next year's budget, the budget of the year after, or the year after that again, the one thing we must start with is promising not to promise more public spending.</P>

      <P>I want to deal with the point about the burden of taxation and the last point made by the Minister about speaking in generalities.  The Minister and other Deputies have been speaking for the past hour about the burden of taxation being too high.  That is a very general statement and I am sure the Minister will agree that, while the burden of taxation on some people has been too high, the burden of taxation on others has been too low and on others non-existent.  The burden of taxation on personal incomes is too high and this could be narrowed down further by saying that the burden of taxation on the <Col N="2451" /> PAYE sector is too high because they are the only people who pay full legally imposed taxes and have no way out of it. On this section we are talking about the burden of taxation on personal incomes and, in particular, on the PAYE taxpayers. I am sure the Minister will agree, although he may not want to say it publicly, that one of the reasons for taxation being too high on these people is that the taxation on personal incomes had to be increased to take up the slack for the loss of other taxes which were abolished on property, such as rates, or wealth taxes, and that the taxes on incomes other than personal earned incomes had been reduced.  There are areas even in this budget where this has been reduced under the heading of capital gains tax and various other items.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley says the tax burden increase is four times greater than the rate of inflation.  He is talking about a particular sector on which the tax burden has increased four times.  Some of that is due to inflation, some due to increased incomes, but some also due to the fact that they had to take on the burden dropped from other sectors.  That is the unfair burden of taxation which should be spoken about, not the generality that taxation is too high.  Everybody knows the actual burden of taxation on farmers has been falling&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The reform of company law is a matter which is kept under constant review in my Department in order to identify and legislate for any shortcomings in existing legislation, to implement changes resulting from EC Company Law Regulations or Directives, and to ensure that company law is as up-to-date and as effective as possible.  There are a number of proposals to change company law being processed in my Department at present.  Among these proposals are a Bill to tackle abuses of limited liability, and legal measures to implement various EC Company Law Directives.</P>
      <P>Among the EC measures awaiting implementation in this field are the Third and Sixth Company Law Directives dealing, respectively, with certain types of mergers and divisions of public limited companies, and the Eighth Directive dealing with the qualifications of auditors.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, the draft Fifth Company Law Directive has not yet been adopted by the Council of Ministers. Indeed, the proposal is still at a very early stage of negotiation at official level in Brussels, and it is likely that it will be quite some time before this initial examination of the proposal is complete.  Thus, the question of legislation to implement it in Ireland does not arise at the present time.</P>
      <P>Finally, of course, I should refer to the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1985, which has just completed Committee Stage in the Dáil.  This Bill is intended to implement into national legislation the requirements of the EC's Fourth Company Law Directive dealing with the content and publication of annual accounts of public and private limited companies. As this matter is currently before the House, I do not propose to comment any further on it at this stage.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce in view of the fact that the unemployment figures for Gorey, New Ross and Enniscorthy, County Wexford, are above the national average, if he is prepared to lift the embargo on the building of the advance factories, as no such factories exist in those areas; and if, because of this policy the three named areas are at a serious disadvantage in trying to attract new industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Government policy on industrial land and buildings was set out in the White Paper on Industrial Policy published in July 1984. This policy requires the IDA to reduce the amount of available factory space at any one time to two million sq. ft.  The rationale behind this was to rectify the position where the supply of these facilities had greatly outstripped demand.</P>
      <P>There is not an embargo on construction <i>per se</i> which continues to be undertaken by the IDA in accordance with their existing plans and commitments.  In this regard, the IDA have provided four incubator units of 1,000 sq. ft. each in Gorey, two of which have been allocated to specific projects.  In Enniscorthy, the IDA have been promoting the three small industry units of 3,378 sq. ft. each provided by a private developer, two of which have been allocated.  In addition, the IDA will actively promote any factory units which become available either through private investment or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA have also available land banks of 12 acres in Gorey, 27½ acres in New Ross and 19 acres in Enniscorthy which are being promoted for suitable industries.  Accordingly, I would not concede <Col N="2460" /> that the areas mentioned are at a serious disadvantage by virtue of Government policy on advance factory construction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is side-stepping the question.  I am not talking about incubator units.  I am talking about a major advance factory for each of the three towns.  The Minister has no other alternative but to concede that those three towns are at a serious disadvantage when the IDA bring itineraries into those areas.  We have no major advance factory and it is a well known fact that people pass through those towns&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It was reduced by over one billion square feet last year.  It is somewhere above two billion square feet now.  Availability of empty factory space is not the only attraction for industry.  In the areas the Deputy mentioned not only have the IDA this incubator space which attracts in small industry with a potential to grow, but they are also promoting actively the land banks which they have.  Some companies much prefer to build a system designed factory rather than coming into an advance factory.  I would not agree that there is a serious disadvantage there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would have to concede that having advance factory space in Kilkenny or Dublin is of no advantage to the unemployed in Wexford. The unemployment figure in the <Col N="2461" /> Enniscorthy, New Ross and Gorey areas is in the region of 20 per cent.  The national average is only 17 per cent.  We should be given special priority in relation to building advance factories.</P>

    <P>Official statistics in respect of the period January to April 1986 are not yet available.</P>
    <P>Fertilisers are freely traded in the EC Community and, as an agricultural nation, we are open to imports of marginally priced products.  In an open market, it is only in cases where dumping from third countries or unfair trading practices on the part of EC countries can be proved that action can be taken to prevent such practices.  It would, of course, be a matter for the Irish industry in the first instance to produce evidence of dumping or unfair trading practices if it felt that such practices obtained and that corrective action was called for.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the present attitude of the management of NET towards the pricing of <Col N="2463" /> nitrogen products and especially urea?  It is a matter which is causing concern as it is creating much importation.  Irish farmers and the agricultural industry in general are quite disturbed about this.  It will create job losses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am keenly aware of the substantial imports of frozen chipped potatoes and of the desirability to substitute, by home production, as much as possible of these imports.  These imports are regarded as a major challenge and considerable assistance has been made available to different companies in an effort to create and support competitive home producers of chipped potatoes, capable of making major inroads into imports.  The IDA and other agencies are continuing these efforts to foster an Irish production capacity capable of not only significantly displacing imports but of gaining a foothold on export markets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree it is time that special measures were taken to rectify the scandalous situation applying in the chip potato and the processed vegetable sector?  The assistance available in the past has been patently <Col N="2465" /> inadequate to encourage investment and to encourage the building of the necessary plant and facilities for the processing of potatoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to reject the allegation of the Deputy that the assistance given was inadequate.  Quite clearly it was adequate.  There is a major problem regarding throughput.  There is a dilemma here in relation to the industry. With regard to future developments, the IDA consider the greatest barrier is the cost of Irish potatoes at around £80 per tonne as against £30 per tonne in Holland. This has obvious implications for the industry, particularly in regard to export potential.</P>
      <P>It would seem that unless we can produce good quality potatoes for chip manufacturing on a consistent basis and also ensure a consistently high throughput, we will not be able to compete with imports.  With the best will in the world, it may be necessary for companies to become involved in joint ventures with foreign companies in order to maximise the potential of this sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the industry has fallen between two stools because responsibility for ware potatoes and fresh vegetables is with the Department of Agriculture while the processed sector is the responsibility of the Minister's Department?  Will he not agree there is a great lack of co-ordination in this sector?  This was clearly identified by the horticultural development group established by the Minister for Agriculture in 1979.  Subsequently they drew up a report on the processed vegetable sector that clearly identified the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 9 together.  A ministerial statement of 16 July 1985 set out the assessment by the administrator of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland plc of the company's financial position.  Briefly, the estimated net balance sheet deficiency of the company amounted to £164 million after taking into account the profit on the sale of the Insurance Corporation Life subsidiary in June 1985.</P>
      <P>The administrator is at present preparing the accounts of the company for the 24-month trading period to 31 December 1985.  The exact up-to-date financial position of the company cannot be ascertained until such time as these accounts are completed and audited.  I am given to understand that the administrator expects to publish the audited accounts of the company by 31 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financing arrangements for the administration of ICI were announced by the Central Bank on 4 October 1985. These arrangements involved an advance <Col N="2468" /> of £100 million to the Insurance Compensation Fund for a period of 15 years. The cost of the advance, amounting in aggregate to £9 million per annum, is being met in full by Allied Irish Banks, the other licensed banks and the administrator. The Exchequer is not contributing to these financial arrangements.  This is entirely in line with the Government's objective that none of the costs of the administration should be borne by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the content of the RTE &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme of 20 March last on the Insurance Corporation of Ireland plc.  I do not propose to deal with individual statements made during the course of that programme, other than to emphasise that in general they were totally at odds with the best information available to the administrator from all his investigations to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply.  Will he agree that the survival package agreed between the Government, the bank and the Central Bank was to accommodate a debt of £164 million?  Will he indicate if the account as given by RTE on 20 March is accurate or even near accurate in that the amount might be £500 million?  Will he reaffirm that the guarantee will still be in place, that the taxpayers will not have to incur any losses?</P>

      <P>I do not wish to make any comment on any of the statements by the people in the insurance industry who were interviewed on that programme other than the statement of the administrator of the ICI.  I refer the Deputy to the statement of the Central Bank issued on 4 October 1985.  I should like to quote briefly from it:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has signified the Government's agreement to these arrangements and is satisfied that they will meet the Administrator's cash requirements and ensure that the company can trade on a solid basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have every confidence in the administrator and in the arrangements made for the <Col N="2469" /> underpinning of the ICI.  I am satisfied that the figures given in this House regarding the shortfall will be in the region of being correct, but I must await the administrator's accounts at the end of May.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>All I want to establish is that the guarantee given by the Minister at the time of the package is in place and will stay in place in guaranteeing the taxpayer against any losses, should it happen that the alleged difference between the figures turns out to be a fact after 31 May.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree from his knowledge of the insurance industry, for which I understand he has responsibility in his Department, that it is of the very nature of the insurance business that the liabilities of an insurance company on risk take quite a number of years to come to fruition and to be determined and that consequently it is not possible to say at this stage what the ultimate liabilities of the ICI may be? Consequently the provisions which have been made could be regarded as no more than provisional.  What has been the cost to the taxpayer via the Central Bank, which is the taxpayer, either in payments out or exposure of this issue to date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take issue with the Deputy.  The administrator has taken all necessary professional advice for examination of the figures within the company &mdash; actuaries, accountants, legal advisers, reinsurance experts.  The accounts for the two years will also be audited.  I do not accept the Deputy's contention that we cannot estimate what the liabilities are. We are dealing with quite a number of <Col N="2471" /> insurance companies, year in and year out, who publish annual accounts.</P>

      <P>I reject that and I object to it.  We have had two difficult cases, the PMPA and the ICI.  I object to the Deputy's trend of questioning as if he is undermining confidence in the insurance industry.  It is most undesirable that these types of irresponsible statements should be made in this House.  They have effects abroad.  I have confidence in the administrators of both the ICI and the PMPA in doing a professional job.  I also have confidence in the other insurance companies operating within this country. My Department operate under EC directives. We have reserving policies and we have the accounts examined quite closely on an ongoing basis.  This is a serious matter and I am entitled to reply in whatever manner I wish.  I take objection to Deputies undermining confidence in the Irish insurance industry.  There is no need to do so.</P>

      <P>I refer the two Deputies who have just asked questions to the statement of the Central Bank, on 4 October, regarding the financial arrangements for the underpinning of ICI.  As I said at the commencement of my reply, I will not pass comment on the statements made by the interviewees on the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme.  This House will be fully informed of the affairs of ICI when their accounts for the two years are published, which should be by the end of this year.  The administrator has taken the best advice possible from actuaries, accountants, lawyers and reinsurance experts and the accounts will be audited. That is the most professional way of dealing with this matter.  It is very easy to spin home-spun stories and exaggerate multiplying losses.  I am prepared to wait for the professionally produced account under the aegis of the administrator.</P>

I fully accept that the administrator is a competent person and we look <Col N="2473" /> forward to his published report on 31 May.  Will the Minister now agree, since he is relying heavily on the Central Bank's statement on 4 October and has reconfirmed the guarantee that the taxpayer will suffer no loss, that the RTE expose on 20 March was irresponsible?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Government's strategy for industrial development is set out in the White Paper on Industrial Policy, which was published in July, 1984.  The principal elements of the strategy are:</P>
      <P>(a)  increasing emphasis to be placed on the development of indigenous industry;</P>
      <P>(b)  greater inter-industry linkages between foreign-owned and indigenous industry.</P>
      <P>(c)  the continued attraction of projects from overseas, particularly those projects performing key business functions;</P>

      <P>A range of initiatives is being taken to implement the Government's strategy and these are constantly refined in the light of changing industrial and economic circumstances.

We are a very small nation depending more than any of our neighbours on trading internationally and we should be careful not to inhibit international trade.

Currently there are measures in the Finance Bill which will help industrial promotion.</P>

It also enables people to take their grants in terms of <i>per capita</i> payment for employees which will enable them to buy secondhand machinery and get the cashflow available from a grant paid <i>per capita</i> employee as soon as the employee is taken on which gives the flexibility which some investors require. The National Development Corporation Bill has now passed all stages in the Seanad.  We are in the process of appointing a board that will appoint a managing director and I propose to have the vesting date at a very early date.  That fills in another area which required attention where promotion will be conducted in a different way with the provision of another source of venture capital and expertise.  So there are initiatives which this very week are current and coming on stream and give the development agencies <Col N="2477" /> both old and new a greater portfolio of incentives to offer to indigenous entrepreneurs and those attracted in from outside.</P>

If one looks at the change in the leasing arrangements, they do not seem to help.  Also in regard to export-orientated industry section 84, which was a major incentive, has been tampered with and that will cost about £12 million.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> While I am generally satisfied that the majority of goods coming into this country are of an adequate quality for the purpose for which they are intended, I recognise that the quality of certain categories of goods coming onto the Irish market is such as to give rise to concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under EC rules I am not empowered to set down specific requirements for imports.  There are, however, a large number of regulations, introduced by various Departments, with which products must comply before they can be sold. <Col N="2478" /> These are primarily regulations implementing EC Directives for specific products or specific types of products, for example, regulations on electrical equipment, cosmetic products, dangerous substances, and so on, and enforcement is a matter for the Department with specific responsibility in each case.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have made a number of orders setting out safety standards which products must meet.  These orders are enforced by my Department's safety inspector.  I am currently reviewing the arrangements for the monitoring and policing of these orders with a view to making the system more effective.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> First, there are no checks on products at the point of importation into the country.  All Departments have their own inspection procedures for the enforcement of directives coming within their responsibility. There is a full time safety inspector employed in my Department to enforce section 44 orders and the European Communities low voltage electrical equipment regulations.  That is the European mandate which allows me and my Department to operate through the safety inspector.  Proposals are currently being examined to transfer responsibility in this area to the Director of Consumer Affairs.  I do not have the information the Deputy requests in his second supplementary. I will inquire and forward an answer to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the steps he has taken to date to implement the recommendations of the inquiry into the cost of motor insurance (details supplied), the measures he proposes to take in this area in the future; the estimated number of uninsured motorists driving on our roads; the number and cost of claims arising from accidents involving uninsured motorists; the reason, in his view, we have such a poor record in so far as uninsured motoring is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government press release of 11 October 1983 outlined the steps which would be taken as a result of the Prices Advisory Committee Report of Inquiry into the cost and methods of providing motor insurance (1982).  These steps included increased fines under road traffic law; revised rules for learner drivers; introduction of windscreen insurance discs; reduction of legal delays; changes in the system of assessing damages in civil actions for injuries and increased surveillance of uninsured driving. Of the measures mentioned in the press release, practically all have been implemented or are in the process of being implemented.</P>
      <P>The Government last year established an inter-ministerial working group to monitor and ensure the earliest possible implementation of the measures announced in October 1983.  As a result of that group's deliberations further measures in relation to motor insurance were announced in August 1985.</P>
      <P>In so far as the level of uninsured driving is concerned the only reliable data are the number of proceedings taken by the Garda which in 1984 was just under 108,000.  The Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland, which is under the aegis of the Minister for the Environment, paid out £8.9 million in 1984 in respect of claims for personal injuries against uninsured drivers.  The number of claims reported in that year was 1,513.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of uninsured driving is <Col N="2480" /> obviously dependent on a number of factors. Undoubtedly, the cost of insurance and the level of fines imposed when offenders are caught are important influences.  The Government have acted in both these areas by bringing forward measures to stabilise costs and improve the insurance environment, and by increasing the maximum fines which can be imposed for uninsured driving.  I am glad to note from the information available to me that the courts appear to be making use of the new levels of fines which they are permitted to impose.</P>

      <P>We had some discussion about this during Private Members' Time this week.  I would like the Minister of State and the Minister to correct the impression given by Minister Noonan here last evening so far as fines on uninsured motorists are concerned.

While the most commonly imposed fines were £50 and £100, considerable numbers of fines were imposed for amounts ranging between £200 and £500. Indeed, 1,446 fines out of 4,128 were imposed in respect of driving without insurance, the maximum fine of £1,000 was imposed in 87 cases and prison sentences were imposed in 599 cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Insurance Compensation Fund is maintained and administered by the accountant of the High Court, acting under the control of the President of the High Court.  An abstract of the accounts of the fund for each year is required to be furnished to the Minister by the accountant.</P>
      <P>The latest year in respect of which such accounts have been submitted is 1984. These accounts show that the fund recorded a deficit of over £23 million at 31 December 1984, as a result of borrowing £30 million during 1984 for the purposes of the PMPA administration.</P>
      <P>Contributions to the fund are being made by all non-life insurers at a rate of 2 per cent of gross premium income.  To date, a total of nearly £26 million had been collected in this manner for the years 1984 and 1985.</P>
      <P>Under the separate funding arrangements for the administration of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland involving the banking sector generally, announced by the Central Bank on 4 October 1985, the fund received a sum of £100 million in December 1985 for immediate on-lending to the corporation.</P>
      <P>Advances from the fund during 1985 totalled £118 million, comprising £100 million to the administrator of ICI and £18 million to the administrator of PMPA.  These advances were approved by the High Court.</P>

There will be deficits on the fund which, in turn, will, be funded by the levy because the moneys needed by the PMPA may be in large blocks, but the incoming money, since it is by way of a 2 per cent levy which averages roughly £12 million per annum, will over the period offset the loans to the PMPA fund.</P>

The recommendations in the White Paper are now being implemented by my Department and their related agencies.</P>

    <P>CTT as the State export agency have primary responsibility for improving the export marketing potential of small firms. They too are doing this through their regional offices with the provision of seminars, advice, information and group marketing schemes.  Accordingly their resources have been increased from <Col N="2486" /> £17.747 million in 1984, the year of the White Paper, to £25.336 million this year. Other agencies such as the Irish Goods Council also engage in activities aimed at developing the marketing potential of small manufacturing firms.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 10, after Part II of the Table, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2513" />&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in the Tax Acts, Part II of the Table to section 8 of the Finance Act, 1980 (inserted by this section) shall apply to persons with dependants who are widows, widowers or single parents.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The effect of this amendment would be to ensure that widows, widowers and single parents get the same tax allowance as married persons and would be regarded as married persons for the purposes of the Finance Bill.  Widows, widowers and single parents with dependants have the same problems, responsibilities and expenditure as married persons. They may have one mouth fewer to feed but they have the same problems with regard to housing, mortgages or rents depending on accommodation, expenditure on education of children, clothing, fuel, medical care, and so on, for their dependants and themselves.  The case of deserted husbands is probably even more anomalous than that of any others because deserted wives and single parents have a special provision not made for deserted husbands.</P>
    <P>Single parent families, whether widows, widowers or single parents for some other reason, have enormous problems.  Indeed, it could be said that they have even greater problems than two parent families because they have to try to get a job to provide for their dependants and, in many cases, they must also provide care for their children which must be paid for.  This can be very costly or it can mean they they can only work in the home or in a part time capacity.  Therefore, they have greater problems than two parent families and should be regarded under the tax laws as having similar expenditure to two parent families and should get similar treatment. We are asking the Minister to consider the very difficult position of single parent families and if he could agree to having them treated in the same way as two parent families in regard to tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <Col N="2514" /> The amendment proposes to extend the double rate bands, applicable to married persons, to single and widowed people. One of the consequences of increasing the rate bands for single or widowed parents would be that married couples with children, where each spouse has an income, would find it vastly to their advantage to be assessed for tax purposes as if they were single which is possible under section 193 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  If each spouse accepted responsibility for one or more of the children, they would be able, under Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment, to get the benefit of two sets of increased rate bands compared with a married couple with only one source of income who would only have one set of rate bands or, if assessed on joint income, would be taxed on a less favourable basis than that proposed in the amendment.  If the wording of the amendment were to be revised in such a way that married couples would be prevented from availing of it under section 193 of the Income Tax Act and thereby claiming two sets of increased rate bands by splitting themselves into two single people for tax purposes, then the measure would be regarded legally and constitutionally as repugnant to the Constitution following the decision of the Supreme Court in the Murphy case.  For example, if a widow and a widower, both with children, wished to marry, under the proposed change they would be discouraged from doing so by the fact that as a married couple they would be entitled to only one set of doubled rate bands whereas if they remained unmarried, notwithstanding the fact that they might be living together, they would be able to claim, under Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment, two sets of doubled rate bands.  A man and woman living together who have care of children would, under the proposals in the amendment, be accorded two sets of increased rate bands instead of two sets of single rate bands which apply at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the advantages that would be conferred on people living together, so to speak, other than being married, I would have to conclude &mdash;<Col N="2515" /> and I think the court would also have to conclude &mdash; in the case of a constitutional action that the amendment would be contrary to Article 41 of the Constitution in that it would provide a disincentive to marriage.  For these reasons, apart from the cost involved, I reject Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment.  The cost of giving double rate bands to single parents would be £2 million in 1986 and £3 million in a full year.  However, it would not be sustainable anyway because it is repugnant to the Constitution and even if it were not, it would be bad policy as it would create an artificial discrimination against married people.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply was extraordinary from the point of view of single parents.  He did not deny the justice of the measure.  I thought his argument might have been that there was no just reason why they should be allowed these tax bands but he did not argue that line at all.  The Minister's argument is that the amendment would give an unfair advantage to married couples because they could fiddle the books.  The second part of his argument was that it would be unconstitutional to give a fair deal to widowers, widows and single parents.  The Minister referred to the Murphy case and said that it would discourage people from marrying and that it would be better for them to live together under the present laws.  In other words, the Minister's laws are so framed that if you give a fair deal to widows, widowers and single parents, it would be unconstitutional because it would discourage them from marrying at a future date. It is an extraordinary argument and the Minister did not even develop it in relation to costs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that there were cost factors involved but the basis of his argument is a legal and constitutional one.  They are extraordinary laws if they prevent us from giving <Col N="2516" /> justice to people in regard to tax laws. The reason I thought it was only fair was that such people must face extra costs and the same responsibilities.  Therefore, it is only fair that they should have the same benefits in our tax laws and the Minister did not deny that.  Perhaps the wording I have suggested is not the best, but the Minister for Finance is the person who can put forward wording that would be constitutional, legal and give justice in the taxation system.  It is his job to do that.</P>
      <P>There is no case that I know of where a Minister who wanted to give a benefit to a person, group of people or company did not do so. He has been able to do that in all cases within the Constitution and within our laws but I wonder why he says that in this case it is not within the Constitution or our laws to give just and fair treatment to widows who have dependants, may be six children, and extraordinary expenses.  If they get a job to build up their income, they do not have the same tax allowances as they would had their husbands been alive.  The same applies in regard to single parent families.  The justice of my case is so obvious that the Minister has no argument against it.  Will the Minister tell the House if it is possible to produce wording that will allow the benefit to go to such people without constitutional or legal problems arising?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to go on at great length about this matter but I wonder what concept of justice Deputy Mac Giolla is advocating.  In the case of two people who are living together, have children but are not married they would, in line with the amendment, be able to get double tax bands but, if they got married, would lose them.  That is not just to them or the children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the problem that would be caused by Deputy Mac <Col N="2517" /> Giolla's amendment.  Under Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment as long as they did not get married a widow and widower who had children by their first marriages would have two sets of double rate bands but if they got married they would lose them.  That runs contrary to the Constitution and to a good concept of public policy.  I do not think we should build into our tax code any arrangements that make marriage something that is fiscally onerous for people.  I accept that is not Deputy Mac Giolla's intention but I am not concerned, nor are the courts, with people's intentions but with what the law says.  What the law says has the meaning which I described.  Deputy Mac Giolla may say it is up to me to draft the amendment so that it will not have the problems that are contained in what he is proposing, but I must say to him that it is his job because he is the person who is making the proposal.  I am not making a proposal.  Essentially, it is a matter for him to devise a method which would enable one to help people who are single parents in a manner that would not be negative towards their interests in the event of their getting married.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The tax laws as they exist are immoral, in the Minister's term, because they apply to all single people. Will an unmarried mother who is living with somebody else lose her unmarried mother's allowance?  Why is there not a special provision to the effect that once an unmarried mother is living with somebody she is not an unmarried mother even if she does not get married?  The same system could apply in the case of a widow who is living with somebody else, if the Minister wants to retain the moral stance he is making on our tax system.  It is easy to avoid that by defining &ldquo;widow&rdquo;, &ldquo;widower&rdquo;, &ldquo;unmarried mother&rdquo;, &ldquo;deserted wife&rdquo; or &ldquo;deserted husband&rdquo;. Will a deserted wife who is living with somebody who is not her husband be regarded as a deserted wife any more? Are they entitled to the tax benefits or not?  I could produce different wording for Report Stage if the Minister suggested that it might be worth my while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2518" /> The burden of my argument does not have anything to do with the morality of the tax system or whether people get married or not, but whether a widow who genuinely remains unmarried or unattached, or whether deserted wives or deserted husbands, are entitled to benefits under our tax laws as they were when their spouse was alive or before the desertion. The cost and the problems are the same. The only difference is that there is one less mouth to feed.  Everything else in regard to housing, accommodation, clothes, food, education and health is the same, if not greater.  If the Minister says he sees justice in the case I am making I will consider tabling an amendment for Report Stage which would eliminate the possibility of benefit being gained by remaining unmarried but living with somebody else, the main burden of the point the Minister is making.  If the Minister does not accept the justice of the case I would be wasting my time trying to produce a wording which would eliminate what the Minister has said in regard to illegality, unconstitutionality and immorality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not use the word &ldquo;immorality&rdquo; at any point and I do not want that word to be put in my mouth.  I never use that word.  I am not making any judgment because it is not my place to do so.  The point made by the Deputy relates to the additional expenses on people who are single parents.  They are recognised in the tax code already by the fact that single parents get double tax allowances.  The granting of a double tax allowance to a single parent has never been tested in the courts.  Although it has never been tested in the courts it is considered that the granting of a double tax allowance to a single parent is not inconsistent, although if a single parent were to get married, if they were both single parents before they got married, so to speak, they would lose one set of those double allowances.  But it is considered that the granting of allowances which relate to actual expenses incurred and are supposed to provide a tax cushion against actual expenses <Col N="2519" /> incurred, is not inconsistent with the Murphy case and is already being done. The tax code already recognises that widowed persons and single parents, by virtue of their having separate establishments to maintain, incur extra expenses. On the other hand, what Deputy Mac Giolla is proposing is that rate bands as well should be doubled right up to almost any level of income regardless of expenses, in other words, that two people with very substantial incomes would be enjoying right up their tax ladder, so to speak, double bands&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by virtue of their situation.  The view being taken is that to give not only the allowances which are, if you like, a recognition of actual expenses which are common to all, but also separate and special treatment to single parents in the form of double rate bands would be contrary to Article 41 of the Constitution which would be considered, for the reasons I have already set forth, discriminatory against marriage. Obviously if they were to marry and live in the same establishment, they would save some of the expenses.  That saving, if you like, could justify the removal of the allowances which would follow on their getting married.  If, in addition to that, they were to lose the double rate bands, which Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment would grant them but which they would lose if they were to get married, it is the considered view that that would be repugnant to Article 41 of the Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the Murphy case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also to be recollected that in the Government White Paper accompanying the proposed amendment of the Constitution, which is to be considered here shortly, the Government did make reference to the need to conduct a review of the situation in regard to various aspects of our law which might be argued to be inimical to marriage or creating artificially disadvantageous situations for <Col N="2520" /> people who get married relative to others whose circumstances are otherwise similar. That is the context in which the entire case made by Deputy Mac Giolla and others can be considered.  It is an extremely complex matter.  Nonetheless it is important that legislation should be framed within the spirit of the Constitution and, in particular, Article 41 &mdash; I am not able to quote it exactly from memory although I suppose I should &mdash; which says that laws shall not be introduced which are inimical to marriage.</P>

      <P>We appear to be covering the same ground and not getting anywhere.  I still cannot understand why the Minister keeps talking about when people are living together.  Surely the Minister can understand that that possibility can be eliminated?  What we are talking about are people who are widows, widowers or deserted wives and husbands, not living with anybody else except their dependants.  Surely that status could be seen to cease by the insertion of a simple phrase agreeing that when that status would cease the benefits would cease.  Can the Minister not see that special provision can be made simply for those who are single parents and remain single parents?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appears to be looking at this solely from the point of view of the benefit that would be given. He must also look at it from the point of view of the benefit that would be lost, if it were first given, to those people if they got married.  It is that that is the concern of Article 41 of the Constitution.  One could maintain that allowances are to cover expenses and there are larger expenses incurred if one is a single parent.  If, in addition, to that there were to be double rate bands right up the tax code which would bear no necessary relationship to expenses at all, but simply to the fact that the two people concerned had large incomes, if then they were to get married and would lose all of that, that would be considered to be creating a fiscal disadvantage from the point of view of those people getting married.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2521" /> It may be argued by Deputy Mac Giolla and others that these are all slightly unlikely circumstances, that they would not happen in the generality of cases.  That is probably all true.  But I listened to the Attorney General recently discussing some other matter &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 10, after line 17, before the Table, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  For the purposes of section 138B of the Income Tax Act, 1967, the child of a self-employed person or partnership shall be regarded as an employee for purposes of qualification for the £700 allowance as provided in the Table following.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to restore the PAYE allowance of £700 to the children of the self-employed.  The Government deliberately decided to exclude these children from this benefit.  This decision is both unsustainable and particularly inappropriate at this stage.  No case can be made in fact or on the basis of reasonable justice to support that decision.  If a family business proprietor has two employees, one outside the family and another a member of the family, being paid at the same rate, is there any justification, in a country which purports to put the family in a special position under the Constitution, for denying to the family member the same PAYE allowance as applies to the employee who is outside the family?  Perhaps this decision could be sustained in countries which do not have a provision in their Constitution proclaiming the fundamental position of the family as being the essential unit in our society upon which all our laws and social order are based, but that is the proclaimed position in our Constitution. There is a certain amount of apprehension these days that that proclaimed constitutional position may not be vindicated in every sense in further actions proposed by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister can give me reasons, in terms of equity, constitutional justice, or on any other ground, why he should not apply the PAYE allowance to children employed by the self-employed, I am prepared to be persuaded.  I suspect what is <Col N="2526" /> on the Minister's mind is that, while the vast bulk of the self-employed are not in any way abusing the allowances available to their children, or their children are not abusing such allowances, the Minister and his advisers have found that in the nature of things there is a minority, as there will be in every category of taxpayers, who are perhaps engaging in some avoidance or evasion measures through this allowance.  Some may pretend that they are paying what they are not paying; some may pretend they are paying more than they are; some may pretend they have employed someone in the family who is not so employed.  There may be some such cases but, if there are, that is no justification at all for withholding the allowance from the vast bulk of bona fide genuinely employed children of either self-employed people or partners.</P>
    <P>In addition, when one considers that the manufacturing industry is not able to generate extra employment to use the growing labour force and sees the increasing growth of unemployment and the constant drain of emigration, is it not outrageous to suggest that where there is one element accounting for over 30 per cent of total employment, namely, the self-employed, they should be penalised in this way?  Incidentally, this is including the secure public service.  If they employ their children in their family business they are being victimised by this Government for so doing.  The only consequence of this is that it is better to disengage from employment with one's parents or for parents to ensure that their children will not be employed by them and to take on somebody else instead or, more than likely, not take on anybody.  I cannot see any justice or validity in the Governments approach.  I am proposing that the Minister should do what all Governments have acknowledged for a long while, restore the £700 PAYE allowance and also restore some degree of support for what is, or has been claimed to be, the fundamental unit in our society, the family.  If the Government persist with this proposal they will be ensuring the further undermining of the family and of employment generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say how many children are involved in this respect as employees and how much this amendment would cost?  The policy of the Government for some time has been to encourage the growth of small industry.  I can recall many of the Minister's speeches along those lines.  Would he not regard the philosophy he is pursuing as making it necessary for him to agree to this amendment because that philosophy is on the lines that we should encourage the greatest number possible of small firms and the greatest number of families being involved in their own businesses?  What better way is there of doing that than by encouraging people to work in their family firms?</P>
      <P>Apart from that important argument about the philosophical side of this provision, there is the agrument of equity because people who do not work in family firms can avail of this allowance while it does not apply in the case of people working for family firms.  Perhaps the Minister could give us some indication of the administration cost of excluding these people and sorting out the differences?</P>

      <P>While we must all live with our past, it is interesting to recollect that Deputy O'Kennedy, as Minister for Finance, introduced this discrimination against the self-employed in 1980.  Now he is trying to make political capital by endeavouring to undo that damage.  He may be entitled to do that but it is only right to remind him that he was responsible for introducing the measure.  In the Seanad on 24 June 1980, by way of reply to the late Senator Alexis FitzGerald, he undertook to find some way around the problem.  Though he was Minister for Finance for some time he did not produce any solution in that respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is surprising that the Deputy should be trying to make political mileage out of undoing damage for which he was responsible.  It is interesting to <Col N="2528" /> recall also what we spent 15 minutes doing a short while ago, namely, voting against section 2.  If Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats had their way in defeating section 2, the allowance for those in the 35 per cent band would have been reduced by £200 and people in the 58p band would have reverted to the previous higher bands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In some instances where the self-employed have their children working for them there is a reasonable case to be made for applying the same tax treatment as applies to other employees but there are opportunities for abuse.  The question was examined in depth when the provision was introduced in 1980 but no satisfactory means were found either then or in the meantime of identifying cases to which the allowance should be extended and distinguishing them from abuse situations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The diversion of revenue resources to such work would be quite difficult.  However, I am prepared to consider this matter between now and the 1987 budget with a view to ascertaining whether anything can be done in this area, but I am making no promises nor <Col N="2529" /> am I offering any prospect in that regard. I will examine the question, not because of the urgings of Deputy O'Kennedy who, after all, was the person who introduced the measure, but because I appreciate that in some cases there is a genuine and justified sense of grievance about the way in which employees who happen to be children of self-employed are treated for tax purposes.  I know of some such cases in my constituency.  On the other hand, there is a genuine fear on the part of the Revenue that by making the concession sought there would be considerable abuse.  Assuming that 25,000 or more people would benefit if the PAYE allowance was extended in the way proposed, it is estimated that the cost would be £3.6 million in 1986 and £6 million in a full year.  That is the answer to Deputy Brennan's case.  I can only promise to examine the matter between now and the 1987 budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not something strange about the Revenue assuming that there is a very high level of abuse in this area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue assume that a considerable number of people would be declared employees for the benefit of this allowance though that would not be the case.  Obviously this is a matter of some difficulty.  The danger is that in finding a solution we might complicate further an already complicated tax code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is an advance to hear the Minister say he will examine the matter.  However, I must not let the occasion pass without referring to his outrageous statement that the Revenue are assuming that people would claim tax allowances in respect of children who would not be employed.  If that is the way the Revenue Commissioners operate, it is a serious indictment of the <Col N="2530" /> general assumption of guilt they attribute to the public generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are realists and they know that sometimes people make use of tax allowances when they are not entitled to do so.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to note that when people who were employed formerly by the Revenue Commissioners embark on acting as consultants outside they seem to change their general view as to whether people are bona fide.  In other words, it is a matter of which side of the fence one sits on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem with any proposal which is restrictive generally on the basis of the consideration that a substantial number of people might abuse the provision is that it affects adversely some people who would be operating legitimately.  I presume that is what was in Deputy O'Kennedy's mind when he introduced the provision in 1980.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>(2)  The dependent relative allowance shall be increased to £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is in relation to an <Col N="2531" /> increase in the dependent relative allowance in respect of people being maintained by their children at home.  These are mostly aged parents or grandparents. I am not going to take advantage of Deputy Yates.  I know he genuinely meant what he said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was not here for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I equally know that he is genuinely not in a position to vote in accordance with what he knows to be the case.  The reality is that if we win the argument, there may be some progress. On the basis that I can assure Deputy Yates that he will not have a vote on this issue I would enlist his support for the argument that he has already made.</P>
      <P>A £500 tax allowance would not be adequate to cover the cost of maintaining a dependent relative at home, a parent or grandparent.  In net terms of enhanced income it would probably represent for the person contributing an extra £130 to £150 per annum, perhaps up to £200, which works out at a sum of between £3 and £4 a week.  That would be the effect on the person maintaining the dependent relative.  The consequence of not having a dependent relative allowance of this nature is very obvious.  Many young married couples who are obviously suffering the consequences of the recession, are encouraged &mdash; it is regrettable to have to state this &mdash; to try to find another place for their parents or grandparents outside of the home.  They are not encouraged to look after them at home under our taxation system.</P>
      <P>The truth is that the older people who have been the mainstay of the family feel either unwelcome or unwanted in their own homes.  The only alternative for them &mdash; and incidentally it is an alternative which will come to all of us in our time &mdash; is to depend on an institution, hospital or geriatric centre.  Some of these are very comfortable and well serviced in terms of nursing and medical facilities; some are not so well serviced and not so comfortable, and some are overcrowded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2532" /> It is regrettable that many of them are now being closed.</P>
    <P>What are we trying to achieve?  In the interests of dependent relatives, particularly old people about whom we are concerned here, we are trying to ensure that they have stability and security in their own homes where they belong. Apart from tax collection there is another element in the Minister's responsibility to which he referred this morning, which is to save public expenditure.  The more people we can maintain in their own homes the less will be the burden on the Exchequer.  It makes great sense economically and socially, that the dependent relative allowance be increased to £500. I could argue this for days on end but I want to allow Deputy Yates the oportunity to add his voice in support of the amendment.  If the Minister tells him that he will look at it in 1987, he is talking about me and not himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned this matter this morning because I felt when Deputy O'Kennedy was arguing for an increase in the age exemption allowance and drawing in the geriatric institutional care argument it was not relevant, but it is relevant here.  This debate took place on the Finance Bill last year and the Department of Finance and the Minister's predecessor had strong views against it.  The argument goes beyond what Deputy O'Kennedy argued because if I send my father-in-law or father to a nursing home or hospital I can claim tax relief, whereas if I keep him at home I cannot.  That strikes me as anomalous.  Whatever about the £120 to £400 a week which it may cost for State geriatric care for someone with a hospital services card, it is more simple than that in terms of cost effectiveness, because of the choice people have in putting someone into a private nursing home and the tax relief they can claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nature of the prescribed relative allowance and the home help schemes from the Department of Health are restrictive for these types of family situations. I ask the Minister to look at this <Col N="2533" /> in the future in a sympathetic light.  What we are trying to do here is more than to talk about tax and money.  We are talking about the evolvement of community family solidarity.  In other countries they do not have a need for State geriatric care or tax incentives.  The Department of Finance have a rigid view that some people are kept at home anyway and therefore, this is going to cost money.  That is a negative attitude to take.  There is a positive attitude.  How many people could we keep at home if we extended this?  I am not saying it should or can be done this year as the budget arrangement is set. From the point of view of policy, helping families and elderly people to have some comfort in the last few days, I feel this would be a much better way of dealing with it than talking about age exemption allowances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember making all these arguments in favour of an increase in the dependent relative allowance when I was on the Opposition benches.  I have a great deal of understanding of the case which is being made.  Since then the incapacitated relative allowance has been increased substantially.  This allowance is concerned with the worst type of case about which the Deputy is concerned, situations where the relatives are so incapacitated that somebody has to be full time employed to look after them.  There is a considerable allowance of £2,500 against tax for such a case.  That is addressing the worst type of case and this is an important provision.  Of course, substantial additional benefits have been given to older people in our community through the social welfare code, free travel, free electricity and so forth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this item.  The actual question I put down was to ask the Taoiseach if, in view of the serious injuries and loss of life in volved in the Chernobyl disaster and the threats which have arisen from it to the safety of large sections of the population of Europe, he will outline for the House the state of preparedness of this country to deal with the fall-out from any such nuclear incident which could occur at any time.  I was prompted to put this question down as a result of an article in today's <i>Irish Times</i> headed, &ldquo;No Civil Defence plan on Nuclear Leaks&rdquo; which really makes the reading and the script for a Gate farce.  It says:</P>
      <P>A senior Civil Defence officer admitted yesterday that they had &ldquo;no plan to deal with a Sellafield situation &mdash; it's as simple as that&rdquo; and the only advice they could offer to people in the event of a radioactive cloud heading here was to &ldquo;stay indoors until it passed over&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That is not good enough.  In relation to Chernobyl, people in the USSR are worried that the cloud has contaminated water and that certain areas may not be habitable for up to 300 years.  This view was expressed yesterday on a &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme by a TCD professor. Somebody should tell the Civil Defence that a nuclear cloud does not pass over.  It contaminates, especially if it is mixed with rain.  A further farce element was that the Civil Defence officer said:</P>
      <P>...they would be taking orders from the Government on how to deal with the situation.  However, a spokesman for the Department of Defence said they would be relying in the first instance on Civil Defence mobilising their trained warden service to monitor radioactivity levels throughout the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2535" /> While we are all subject to a nuclear cloud we have Civil Defence ringing the Department of Defence asking them what to do and the Department of Defence replying that it is up to them. The situation would be farcical if it was not so serious.</P>
    <P>Along the west coast of our neighbouring island there are 26 nuclear reactors including four at the Sellafield complex plus, in Sellafield, the world's largest reprocessing plant.  This is within 60 miles of the Irish coastline.  We are consistently asked by this Government and again by the Tánaiste today to believe the British guarantees of safety at Sellafield.  Can we believe them, given that the British authorities were less than up front about the leaks earlier this year and on previous occasions?  It was bad enough to have to worry about the word of British Nuclear Fuels who have consistently been proven to lie and, when found out, try to cover up.  Our own Nuclear Energy Board are making statements which are tantamount to collusion with British Nuclear Fuels and they are attempting to mislead the Irish people.  We cannot have faith in an Irish organisation the chief executive of which says:</P>
    <P>A Chernobyl-type disaster at one of Britain's nuclear reactors would be &ldquo;almost an incredible situation which I would find impossible to conceive&rdquo;. This was because they were of a totally different design, with a much higher level of safety than the Soviet reactors.</P>
    <P>In regard to his statement that they are at a totally different level of safety, the key difference was that the British reactors were insulated with promary as well as secondary containment areas.  Even if there was a melt down of the core very little radioactivity would escape.  In Chernobyl it was not a matter of insulation. The roof blew off and even the Russians admit that.  No matter how good the insulation if there is an explosion, as apparently happened, the roof will blow off and the radioactivity will spread <Col N="2536" /> throughout the adjoining areas.  The chief executive of our Nuclear Energy Board does not have any concern about that. He is quite prepared to listen to British Nuclear Fuels.</P>
    <P>Dr. Nolan said that the British and American reactors were fitted with an automatic shutdown which could be activated in the event of an emergency.  We have had continuous leaks from Sellafield. Where are the higher standards there?  Those are only the leaks we are aware of but do we know the full story? On all occasions the information had to be dragged out of British Nuclear Fuels and the British Government.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed with the Tánaiste's statement today in the Seanad when he said that, on the question of access to information it is very alarming that the Soviet accident was not disclosed until some days after it happened and then only after high levels of radioactivity had been detected in Scandinavia.  I would remind the Tánaiste that we have been suffering the same type of treatment from British Nuclear Fuels time and time again.  Even then they deny that accidents take place and they deny the extent of them.</P>
    <P>The most damning statement by Dr. Nolan was that Ireland's east coast was at least 60 miles from the nearest British nuclear power plant and consequently we would not expect severely damaging radioactive fallout to effect us here in the event of a major accident.  In view of the internationally recognised facts, as far as I am concerned that statement is dangerously complacent and he is bordering on the criminally irresponsible in his attitude as chief executive of a board whose responsibility it is to protect the interests of the Irish people in nuclear matters.</P>
    <P>According to Greenpeace the situation as far as the Russian disaster is concerned is that it would cause around 10,000 cases of cancer over a 20 year period within a radius of 620 miles of the Soviet reactor, not 60 miles.  Approximately 4,000 square miles of land would be severely affected for agriculture and 1,200 square <Col N="2537" /> miles might have to be evacuated.  The National Institute of Radiological Protection in Sweden, who are 700 miles away from the incident, estimated that for that country there would be 2,000 to 4,000 cases of cancer over a 30 year period as a result of the Chernobyl disaster.</P>
    <P>I ask the Tánaiste to examine the whole operation of the Nuclear Energy Board as far as protecting the Irish people is concerned.  We do not have to wait for disasters from Sellafield.  We already have one.  A report of the all-party committee of the House of Commons shows that the Irish Sea is the most radioactive sea in the world thanks to the Sellafield processing plant.  The Tánaiste talked about the need for a European inspection force.  In my view and in the view of my party, there is only one solution to the Sellafield issue and that is to close it down as soon as possible.  Given that Sellafield is only 60 miles from this House and that there is a network of reactors along the west coast of Britain, we cannot trust our lives and those of our children to the halfhearted request by this Government. They should not request that Sellafield be closed; they should demand it.  They should unite the Irish people with them on this issue.  Everybody will join in demanding the closure of Sellafield.  One might ask: what is the point in demanding the closure of Sellafield if we have no control over it?  The moral pressure by a united country calling for the closure of Sellafield being put on the British Government must count for something. I ask the Tánaiste to join with us in calling for the closure of Sellafield.  In the meantime we badly need a national plan to deal with a nuclear accident.  We need greater information, education and coordination of our efforts and those of the Civil Defence in this area.</P>
    <P>I am horrified by the type of mentality which evidently prevails in the Irish Nuclear Energy Board as was displayed in the article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today.  I call on the Minister immediately to investigate that situation.  I re-echo our call for the closure of Sellafield and for the Government to join with us in that call. <Col N="2538" /> An inspectorate is not good enough.  As I said before in this House, an inspectorate will merely show the blue flash in the sky when the explosion takes place and tell us what has happened.  That is not good enough.  We need the closure of Sellafield and the sooner the better.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The accident at the nuclear power station at Chernobyl brings home forcibly to us our vulnerability as a nation to the risks from a nuclear accident.  As a country which does not have any nuclear installations, that sense of vulnerability is particularly acute.  One of the major lessons to be learned from Chernobyl is that accidents of this kind have international implications.  We now know that, while contamination is greatest in the accident area, radioactive fall-out has occurred in Scandinavia and in eastern European countries &mdash; mainly Sweden, Denmark, Austria and north eastern Poland.</P>
      <P>The Meteorological Office have informed us that the air around Chernobyl is expected to drift slowly south west during the next few days.  Their forecast for the next week indicates that the drift is unlikely to come near Ireland.  It is some consolation that experts in those countries have indicated that the levels of radioactivity were not a hazard to health but we do not have the consolation of a guarantee that this kind of accident could not happen again.  We can only hope that the lessons to be learned from it and the measures which the nuclear industry worldwide must take, will make the risk of a recurrence extremely remote.</P>
      <P>The loss of confidence in Sellafield has resulted in our Government repeatedly calling for a European inspection force to ensure the safety of nuclear installations. I want to reassure the House that we are steadfast in our resolution to pursue unrelentingly our request for the establishment of such a force.  It is worth repeating that the accident at Chernobyl has graphically illustrated that nuclear accidents respect no national boundaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2539" /> What has happened has illustrated our need to be in a position to assess independently the possible effects on this country, no matter where in the world such an accident might occur.</P>
    <P>The following arrangements were made and have been available for some time.  First, it is necessary to identify if fall-out from any nuclear incident reaches Ireland.  This is being done by the Nuclear Energy Board in conjunction with the meteorological service in the following ways: by continuously sampling the Irish atmosphere at two monitoring locations, one on the east coast at Dublin and the second on the west coast at Valentia, County Kerry; secondly by sampling fall-out at six monitoring stations strategically located around the country.  These are at Dublin, Rosslare, Roches Point, Valentia, Belmullet and Mullingar and, thirdly, drinking water supplies are also checked.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that we would be aware if any unusual radioactive contamination were present in our environment. If we detected or even suspected increased levels of radioactivity we would immediately determine the extent and significance of this increase.  The frequency of monitoring would be stepped up and additional monitoring systems would be brought into service.  These additional facilities would be made available by our Irish universities who are, in fact, assisting with the current monitoring.</P>
    <P>The question arises: what would happen if significant levels of contamination were detected in the air or from fall-out? The levels of contamination on the ground and in our food would be immediately determined.  Advice would be issued to the public, in consultation with the Nuclear Energy Board, on actions to be taken by the public to minimise the risks to health.  These actions might include advice to remain indoors, the issue of iodine tablets to minimise the effects of any radio iodine, and control on the distribution and sale of foodstuffs likely to have been contaminated.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, arrangements are in place to monitor any individuals who <Col N="2540" /> might have been significantly contaminated by fall-out.  This would be carried out in our major Irish hospitals and, if necessary, at universities.  Moreover, some time ago discussions were initiated by the NEB with the Department of Health to establish regional centres for the treatment of patients suffering from radiation injury.  Specialist services and expertise would be made available to assist these centres.</P>
    <P>A committee has been set up consisting of representatives of the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Energy Board and the Departments of the Environment, Health and Defence.  Other Departments or agencies would be called upon should this be necessary.</P>
    <P>In relation to the point made by Deputy Burke about confusion between Civil Defence and the Department of Defence, if people have any uncertainty as to what action might need to be taken, they should direct any inquiries to the Nuclear Energy Board and to the Department of Energy who will give them proper directions.  Other Departments or agencies will be called on should this prove necessary.  The purpose of the committee is to ensure co-ordinated action here in the event of a serious nuclear incident affecting us.</P>
    <P>I would add that the risk of an accident occurring at a British nuclear power station which would have severe effects on this country is very low.  I do not think we should highlight fears among the Irish people with regard to future possibilities. The future is unpredictable and no one can guarantee with absolute certainty what will happen.  I have to dispute the suggestion by Deputy Burke that we do not have access to information.  On the last occasion there was an incident at Sellafield we got the information within two hours.  This is the kind of access to information we sought at the first meeting in 1984 of the inter-departmental group.</P>
    <P>I repeat it is the intention of the Government to pursue the matter of an independent inspectorate.  I differ from Deputy Burke in relation to the purpose <Col N="2541" /> to be served in calling for something to be done in another sovereign State.  Sellafield is in the United Kingdom and it is a matter for the United Kingdom Government. We have made our views clear and will continue to do so, but we should be very careful in relation to stating the facts with regard to radioactivity and the possibilities and risks that exist at the moment. <Col N="2542" /> I can assure the House and the public that, in the event of any danger occurring, sufficient procedures are in place to outline a course of action to the Irish people without delay.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Industrial Development Authority, which is the body responsible for industrial development in non-Gaeltacht offshore islands, considers that the general inaccessibility of these islands makes it difficult to promote them for industrial projects.  The authority believes that the most realistic prospect of creating industrial employment on the islands will arise from local initiatives which would be considered for grant assistance in the normal way.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I would urge the island communities to familiarise themselves with the range of incentives that is available for small industry, a sector whose potential is becoming increasingly clear since the regionalisation of the IDA's small industries activities during 1985.  Comprehensive information on these incentives, and on the assistance that can be provided by all the State's industrial promotion agencies, may now be obtained from the one-stop-shops being operated by the agencies in each of the IDA regions.</P>

      <P>The Irish citizen in question was arrested in the Canary Islands in August 1984 and was held in connection with investigations into a murder there.  The citizen in question was not himself in the Canaries at the time of the alleged offence.  It was alleged to him that he was implicated in preparations for the alleged murder.</P>
      <P>The Irish citizen has since been detained in custody, pending formal charges. Magistrates have authorised his continued provisional custody pending the completion of the investigations.</P>
      <P>As I stated in my replies to the House on 5 November 1985, I was then concerned at the length of time the citizen was being held in custody pending completion of the investigations.

      <P>Since November the Embassy in Madrid has continued to press for progress on this case.  On my instructions the Ambassador at Madrid went to the Canary Islands in mid-February of this year to speak with the relevant authorities there.

      <P>The Air Pollution Bill, 1986, when enacted, will enlarge the powers available to local authorities to deal with air pollution problems generally, including those caused by coal dust.  Two specific complaints regarding coal dust in Dublin have been reported to my Department since January 1985.</P>

      <P>Legislation which is at present being prepared in my Department in relation to the programme for the general reorganisation of local government structures will provide for the making of new arrangements for the review of all urban boundaries (including county borough boundaries).  The case for the further extension of the Waterford city boundary will fall to be considered when these arrangements come into operation.</P>
      <P>The special assistance to Galway referred to by the Deputy relates to the fact that Galway County Council can no longer demand a contribution from Galway County Borough for the provision of countywide services as a result of the upgrading of Galway city to county borough status and is unrelated to the boundary extension.</P>

      <P>Rates support grants of £2.4 million have already been notified to the corporation for 1986.  When account is taken of the lifting of the supplementary welfare allowance levy this allocation represents an increase of 8 per cent in the corporation's cash resources this year. This, together with a lower rate of inflation and the fall in interest rates should considerably enhance the financial capacity of Waterford Corporation to provide services in the current year.</P>
      <P>I might also mention that, thanks to increased financial allocations by my Department, most of the major services provided by Waterford Corporation have been expanded since the Government came to power.  For example, the number of local authority houses built in that period averaged 136 compared with 83 in the 1979-82 period.  State road grant payments to Waterford Corporation 1983-86 inclusive averaged £4.4 million annually compared with £1.0 million in the 1979-82 period.  Over the past three years £700,000 has been granted to the corporation under the environmental works scheme.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the taxpayer's appeal against a 1984-85 assessment was listed for hearing before the Appeal Commissioner for 22 April 1986.  On reconsideration the inspector decided that the case could be settled without recourse to the appeal proceedings provided the taxpayer supplied to him certain outstanding information. The taxpayer was so advised on 16 April 1986 or about a week before the date fixed for the appeal hearing.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of statements made by a tax officials' union that over £700 million is outstanding in collectable taxes, he will state (a) the source of this information and if there is a breach of the Official Secrets Act; (b) the actual amount of tax outstanding for the year 1985-86 which, at the most accurate and professional assessment of the Revenue Commissioners and his Department will be due to be paid and collected; and if, in view of public concern, he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) The information contained in the statements attributed to a tax officials' union that over £700 million is outstanding in collectable taxes conforms with information contained in the tables in paragraph 18 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the Appropriation Accounts for 1984 (Pl. 3179).  That paragraph contains a table for each of the taxes, contributions and levies, the collection of which is entrusted to the Revenue Commissioners.  Each table contains an estimate of the amount likely to be collected and the aggregate of those amounts is £706 million for all years up to and including 1984 or 1984-85 (1983-84 in the case of PAYE and PRSI).  It is not possible to predict the period of years over which the aggregate <Col N="2503" /> in question will, for whatever reason, be capable of being collected.  As the amounts from which the aggregate is derived are published, there can be no question of any breach of the Official Secrets Act having arisen.</P>
      <P>(b) The task of compiling an estimate of the tax outstanding in relation to any year by reference to a particular date is a large and costly one and is undertaken annually for publication in the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the Appropriation Accounts for that year, by reference to the position at 31 May following the year in question in relation to assessed taxes and by reference to the same date a year later in respect of PAYE and PRSI.  The corresponding estimate for 1985-86 will not be completed, by publication of the figures for PAYE and PRSI, until after 31 may 1987.  I will not, therefore, be in a position to supply the information requested until the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the Appropriation Accounts for 1986 is published, probably towards the end of 1987.</P>
