      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Communications reported progress on amendment No. 3.  Amendment No. 3 and substitute amendment No. 4 are being taken together for the purpose of the debate.</P>
      <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, after line 51, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) provided always that such revocation or suspension may be appealed to the High Court.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Wilson.)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon) Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had made the point that I accept the principle of the amendment proposed by Deputy Wilson that there should be a right of appeal against a decision of the Minister to revoke or suspend a licence.  I think, however, there should also be provision for an appeal against a refusal to grant a licence.  There is an appeal provision in <Col N="557" /> the EC regulations on admission to the industry which would apply where the Minister refuses or revokes a licence on the ground that the applicant or the licensee, as the case may be, does not comply with the requirements of those regulations.</P>
      <P>On reconsideration I feel it would be better to have the appeal provision in the Bill.  I am moving an amendment to include a section covering appeals against both refusal to grant and revocation or suspension of a licence.  I hope my alternative proposal will be acceptable to the Deputy.  It is, of course, wider than his amendment and covers the refusal issue as well.  I think it would very adequately cover the provision sought in Deputy Wilson's amendment.  My amendment, which I understand will be dealt with later, is not, as far as the courts are concerned, the same as Deputy Wilson's.  It embodies very much the same idea and the same spirit and is more comprehensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate very much what the Minister has said with regard to my amendment to section 5 and his proposed amendment to section 6. Nobody likes to admit that his or her amendment is less effective than the one proposed.  I wish to ask the Minister why he thinks his amendment is better than the one which I put down which is more succinct than the Minister's.  My amendment states, &ldquo;provided always that such revocation or suspension may be appealed to the High Court.&rdquo;  I know that in the EC regulations the District Court is mentioned.  In the normal course of events the District Court is the cheaper court.  I do not mean that in any derogatory sense.  It is a court where the citizen will not be exposed to as high a cost as he would in the High Court.  My idea of putting down the High Court in the first place was to cut one stage off in case the person is refused so that he will not have the cost of the District Court and the case will go straight to the High Court on the matter.  In what he has just said and in what he said immediately before progress was reported, the Minister referred to <Col N="558" /> European Community regulations.  If I could have the reference to that from the Minister I would be grateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I think my amendment is more desirable, that is in no way, as Deputy Wilson implied, reflecting on his amendment which is succinct and to the point.  This is a more general provision which covers the refusal. We thought it should be embodied in the Act.  As regards the District Court, one of the main considerations is the fact that it is financially cheaper as far as the applicant is concerned.  It would certainly be quicker for getting a decision and would be very much in the person's area on a constant basis.</P>
      <P>There will be provision for appeal but only on a point of law in which case it could go ahead to a higher court.  Even though the High Court would be a totally suitable area in which these things could be decided, and even though I see the point raised by Deputy Wilson of removing one step along the line, we hope the District Court will be the one step.  The European Community regulations mentioned &mdash; the statutory instrument &mdash; are European Communities Merchandise Road Transport Regulations, 1977, code No. SI 386/1977.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want some information from the Minister on the question of appeal.  In a case where an applicant is waiting over a year for a decision from the Department as to whether a transfer would be made or not, is there some mechanism in operation whereby the failure of the Department to make a decision can be challenged?  Does the applicant for the transfer of a licence have to wait for over a year for the Department to make a <Col N="559" /> decision?  What appeal mechanism exists in that case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">

There will be no transfers under the new system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the point about an extra layer of costs, the Minister has made a fair attempt to meet the problem which arose from very naked powers being taken by the Minister in the original version of the Bill.  I appreciate that.  I also take the point that the provision in relation to refusal and suspension should be comprehensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Statutory Instrument mentioned by the Minister is a bit confusing.  It is referred to under the 1972 Act, the original and empowering Act.  I have a copy of Statutory Instrument No. 386 of 1977 <Col N="560" /> and I have read the very substantive section on appeals.  Arising out of that, and what the Minister has said, I should like to get an assurance from the Minister about a matter raised by the Confederation of Irish Industry in the submission sent to the Minister and myself on the provisions in the Bill.  In the course of their submission they stated that the Bill allows the Minister to revoke a licence for reasons other than the three specified in the European regulations &mdash; competence, sound financial standing and good repute.  The CII hold the view that some of the reasons are duplicated in the European Communities Act, 1972.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be cutting in unduly on the Deputy but as I see the Deputy's amendment it provides for appeal to the High Court and if we could get rid of that we could move on to a wider topic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is being taken with the Minister's amendment and what I am dealing with is relevant to the Minister's amendment.  I understand that it was agreed on the last occasion to take the two amendments together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The CII submitted that the provisions also leave it open to individuals to recommend to the Minister that the licences of another company should be revoked for reasons not directly connected with the provisions of the European Communities Act, 1972.  The CII indicated that they believed that this would be counter-productive and would leave too many discretionary powers with the Minister.  Will the Minister comment on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The CII contend that if licences are to be granted to all who satisfy EC requirements, then the EC regulations should be the criteria in this respect.  The CII hold the view that licences should only be revoked where the <Col N="561" /> licensee ceases to satisfy the EC regulations. I can see the logic in their argument. Our grounds for the revocation of a licence have been in operation continuously since 1933 but we have the addition that a licensee must meet EC admission requirements.</P>
      <P>Under the new licensing regime there will be no quantitative restriction.  We are liberalising the process and everybody thinks it is a good idea to do that.  Where there is no quantitative restriction or where the qualitative requirements are the only criteria to be met, we think it is necessary to retain the conditions that have existed since 1933.  It is also necessary that the Minister should have the power to revoke a licence when he is of the opinion that the holder of a licence does not abide by the law, including any condition attached to the licence.  We are not generating any new conditions of our own and we are embodying with the 1933 conditions the EC regulations.  I accept the point made by the CII, that as the operation will be under the EC it should be governed by EC regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am intrigued by all this. If the Minister is satisfied with the professional competence of an applicant, that he is sound financially and is of good repute, what other qualities is he demanding that are covered by the 1933 Act?  It appears to me that he is looking for the paragon of animals if he is requiring qualities and qualifications and so on which are not covered by the three EC provisions.  Will the Minister indicate the areas that are not covered by the three EC provisions and tell the House how they are desirable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The extra provisions relate to conditions that may be applied by the Minister in the granting of a licence. There is a variety of them.  For instance, the display of a plate could be included in the granting of a licence.  Most of the conditions attached to a licence are of a general nature and will not cause any problem.  It is stipulated that a licensee may not loan, rent or hire or temporarily transfer the licence or any vehicle plate <Col N="562" /> issued under it to another person.  Licensees are not required by law to own the vehicles operated under the licence and may plate other vehicles on their licence within the authorised capacity provided they are responsible for the carriage.  This enables hauliers to expand their business without having to invest capital in additional vehicles.  This has been abused without any doubt by some hauliers renting out plates to unlicensed persons for considerable monetary reward.  This increases the incidence of illegal haulage as well as the number of illegal operators. The increase in the vehicle capacity authorised under the Road Transport Act, 1978, increased the opportunities for abuse and the removal of any limit on the number of vehicles a licensee may operate which is provided for in the Bill will provide more scope for the unscrupulous licensee.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the conditions attached to licences will not cause any severe problem.  It is thought right that, because the quantitative restriction is being removed and the qualitative provision being the only requirement necessary under the liberalised system, we should preserve the conditions that have been in operation since 1933.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The display of the plate could be included under &ldquo;professional competence&rdquo; and the transfer, contrary to the purpose and the letter of the law, could be covered under the heading, &ldquo;good repute&rdquo;.  The point I am making is: why extra verbiage if the three provisions which the EC have stipulated seem to be comprehensive enough to cover the whole field?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State will agree that the problem in the haulage area down through the years has been that the conditions and regulations were not implemented and enforced.  This created real problems in the haulage area generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this will create any grave difficulties as such.  It <Col N="563" /> would be unwise at this stage to remove regulations which have survived through a multiplicity of Acts and which have caused no difficulties in the past.  We are incorporating the EC regulations which are very reasonable.  I do not think anyone could object strongly to them. This is a wise provision.  It is not new and it is not as if it is untested.  It is something which has been with us since 1933.  Therefore, it is on our Statute Book for 53 years.  There is no need for the removal of it on this occasion.  I have been advocating very strongly the consolidation of all these Acts.  I am sure Deputy Wilson, who has wide experience in dealing with them as a Minister and as spokesman for the Opposition, will agree with me.  That might be an occasion when this could be looked at.</P>

      <P>Section 5 as it stands reads as follows:</P>
      <P>The following subsection is hereby substituted for subsection (2) of section 24 of the Principal Act:</P>
      <P>(2) The Minister may at any time on his own motion and at his discretion revoke or suspend for such period as he shall think proper a merchandise licence&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  on the ground that, in his opinion, there has been a breach of or a failure to observe or comply with a condition attached to the licence,</P>
      <P>(b)  on the ground that the holder has been convicted of an offence (whether under this or any other Act) in relation to the business to which the licence relates or a vehicle used in such business,</P>
      <P>(c)  if the holder ceases to comply with any relevant requirement specified or referred to in regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972, or</P>
      <P>I think that Statutory Instrument No. 386 of 1977, the one to which I have been referring entitled the European Communities Merchandise Road Transport Regulations 1977 derives its validity from that Act&mdash;</P>

    <P>The Minister's amendment to section 6 does not make any reference back to section 5, in which the Minister is given very wide powers which are almost absolute. Consequently, I am worried about the effect of his amendment to section 6. Can we take it that in the absence of a reference back, section 6 will qualify the powers given in section 5?  This is important in the light of my agreement to withdraw my amendment to section 3.  If the Minister's amendment to section 6 is aimed at modifying the powers in section 5 and will provide for a District Court appeal it would leave me easier in my mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was thought that there is no case in the context of qualitative control for the establishment of an independent licensing authority.  Attempts to balance supply and demand are not on because of measurement difficulties.  We had a supply and demand provision since 1944 but it was found to be completely unworkable.  Under a qualitative licensing system there is no correct distinction by which the Minister could make fish of one and flesh of the other.  There is already a cross between the provisions through which licensed hauliers can engage in own account transactions and own account hauliers can carry for reward if they have licences.  That will be coming up in later sections.  No one in future will be entitled to hold a licence without holding the appropriate qualifications and continuing to hold them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke of an attempt to fit supply to demand.  The market will settle it in the future but a number of people are worried about it. Professional hauliers now have more room for optimism than at any time.  I have figures here from the Eastern Regional Development Organisation which show the change from 1964 to 1983.  There was 83 per cent own account in 1964 and it was down to 59 per cent in 1983.  Hire reward was 17 per cent in 1964 and it reached 41 per cent in 1983. Therefore, there are grounds for optimism though there may be some bruising in the intervening period and mercy will have to season justice in certain circumstances.</P>

    <P>(2)  Whenever the Minister having considered any representations made by the applicant for a licence maintains his decision to refuse such licence, or decides, having considered any representations that may have been made by the holder of a licence, to revoke or suspend the licence, he shall notify the applicant for or, as the case may be, the holder of the licence of the refusal or decision and such applicant or such holder may within twenty-one days appeal in the prescribed manner to the District Court against such decision.</P>
    <P>(3)  On the hearing of an appeal under this section, in relation to a refusal to grant a licence under this Act or a decision of the Minister to revoke or suspend a licence granted under this Act, the District Court may either confirm the refusal or decision or may allow the appeal and, where an appeal is allowed, the Minister shall grant the licence or shall not revoke or suspend the licence.</P>

    <P>The phraseology &ldquo;the Minister shall grant the licence or shall not revoke or suspend the licence&rdquo; is inelegant to say the least of it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The thrust of the Bill is to liberalise.  Two years after the placing of the measure on the Statute Book the three European criteria will apply, with the minor additions the Minister has mentioned in our context which have obtained since 1933.  I wish to know the reasoning behind this obligation to notify.  Subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>The holder of a carrier's licence shall notify the Minister in writing of any change which he desires to make in the number or type of authorised vehicles to be operated under the licence and shall return the licence to the Minister for the purposes of subsection (2) of this section.</P>
      <P>I am sure there is a good reason for doing that but in the context of liberalisation some explanation is needed.  For example, is there any intent to confine any company to a specific number of vehicles or will there be any inhibition on the size or the development of a company? Subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>Where a carrier's licence has been returned to the Minister in compliance with subsection (1) of this section, the Minister may either issue a new licence in substitution for the licence so returned or amend the licence so returned, to take account of the change notified under that subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is this purely a matter of notification?  Is there any competence in the Department to sit in judgment on this notification? <Col N="572" /> What is the reason behind this provision? Subsection 3 states:</P>
    <P>A person who fails to comply with the requirement of subsection (1) of this section relating to notification shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100.</P>
    <P>There must be a reason, although it may not be a grave one, seeing the fine is set at £100.  I would like the Minister to tell me the reasoning behind the section and to enlighten the House.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Wilson said, this is liberalising legislation as far as road haulage is concerned, something for which people have been calling for a long time, and there is no question of curtailment of numbers of vehicles.  When a haulier is getting a licence he will have to specify the vehicles he has, and the numbers which will be recorded on his licence.  If he wishes to have further vehicles added, they too must be recorded on the licence and if he reduces the numbers the same procedure applies.  The idea is that there should be some documentation, first, as far as tax and insurance are concerned and second, and more important, the haulier would not be in a position to give away one of his vehicles to another person who did not have a licence to operate as a haulier.  In other words, the numbers are recorded on his licence and there has to be a record of all the vehicles he has.  That will be the main control and will stop a haulier from giving one of his vehicles to another person to set up as a haulier when he has not complied with the regulations.  As the Deputy pointed out, the fine is relatively moderate in current money terms, even though inflation will be down to zero by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Most hauliers would give <Col N="573" /> £100 away as a tip.  The Minister mentioned car tax and insurance.  Am I to take it that the Department of Communications will have some competence in this regard?  Or, was he referring to the existing powers the Department of the Environment have?  Will the vehicle in action be compelled to show a plate or some notification indicating that it is licensed under this legislation?  In other words, will there be a plate or some notification on a truck, for example, giving the information corresponding to the register in the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department check the car tax books when they are sent in &mdash;there is nothing new in that&mdash;and the vehicles have to be insured before the tax is issued.  There will be plates on each truck.  One of the reasons it is important that we should keep this register is that a haulier could give a plate to somebody else who could set up his own operation giving the Garda the impression that they were fully licensed.  These plates will be displayed on all vehicles which are appropriately licensed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that at present plates are displayed on all such vehicles?  Is it not true that there will be a curtailment of the number of vehicles? involved because the business available will determine the number of vehicles? Last year a fleet of trucks in my area were taxed and insured for the year but the southern firm with which they were doing business collapsed and the vehicles were lying idle.  In such a situation, it should be possible for these firms to get a tax refund when the vehicles are not on the road.  This gentleman I was speaking about took the cars off the road for a number of months but because of the bad weather he got six months' work delivering straw and hay.  Cognisance should be taken of all the circumstances in cases like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said, plates are currently displayed.  As regards the <Col N="574" /> last point, this is another unfortunate result of the knock-on effect of a business collapsing.  This is a point many of us may not appreciate unless it happens in our own area.  As regards a tax rebate, that would be for the Department of the Environment to decide.  As regards the curtailment or loss of business, there are two schools of thought.  Deputy Wilson outlined the case that after initial difficulties the hauliers will get a larger section of the market.  The trend has been from own account transport because under the régime which we are introducing there will be the possibility of some of these firms becoming larger and more efficient.  There will be difficulties for some but my personal view is that the road haulage business will increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Co-operatives, Roadstone and other firms are not going from own account to hauliers but from own account to their own staff, and they are selling the trucks to them.  This has become very evident over the last number of years.  I worked in a co-operative and the GNR transported most of the butter from the south, the fertiliser from Gouldings in Dublin and so on, but with the closure of the railways and the problems of handling, firms were compelled to go into own account in a very big way.  Own account transport does not pay at present and instead of giving it back to hauliers, firms are selling it to their own drivers.  That trend will develop very much in co-operatives in future and must be taken into consideration in the matter of transportation.</P>

      <P>This re-enacts in a modified form section 8 of the Road Transport Act, 1971 as amended by section 4 of the Road Transport Act, 1978.  Here again we come across the difficulties of referring to other Bills.  The <Col N="575" /> purpose of the modification is to confine the grant or restricted road freight licence to non-resident operators.  It is proposed that the section will not be brought into operation for two years.  In the meantime qualified resident operators will, as now, be granted road freight licence.  After that time such operators will be entitled to the new carrier's licence, so that the provision for non-resident operators to get the restricted road freight licence would then be of no value.</P>

      <P>This is a fairly comprehensive section and a fairly comprehensive area in transport.  I would like to ask the Minister a question in regard to the phrase &ldquo;a restricted road freight licence&rdquo;. Is this a new term in transport legislation? We had the type of &ldquo;restricted to area&rdquo; licence, freedom from licence, at one stage for definite areas.  Do I take it that we are talking here about a foreígn operator who comes into this country, picks up a load and brings it back out of the country?  Is a restricted road freight licence really a way to allow someone from a foreign country to come in, pick up a load and go out, and is he not allowed what we call in air transport a fifth freedom right?  Must he take the load out of the country to his own country or can he drop it somewhere else?  The Bulgarians were operating here for a while.  Would they be allowed to pick up in Ireland and drop in Germany <i>en route</i> to Bulgaria and drop at home if they had a section of their load then?  I would like a general statement on the whole international area, the bilateral road transport arrangement, how it affects them, how it affects the licences I have mentioned on Second Stage and earlier on Committee Stage of this Bill, the ones issued by the EC Council of Ministers for Transport. For example, is there any area to which this is confined or is it an open-to-the-world type of thing?  Is it open to anyone to ask for a restricted road freight licence? I would like general clarification of the section.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy has said, <Col N="576" /> this deals with international activity.  In the Road Transport Act, 1971 the restricted road freight licence was introduced. It has nothing to do with the restricted areas.  It has to do with international activity with a view to allowing international hauliers to come in, pick up goods at one specific point and bring them abroad.  That was then expanded in 1978 to include Irish hauliers who wished to involve in international transport, picking up goods here and going abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain how it has developed.  It is rather complicated.  They can do precisely what they wish abroad but, of course, they are governed by the various permits they have.  They can go anywhere in the world, they can drop off anywhere but the regulations of other countries, bilateral and multilateral regulations, come in.  So far as we are concerned this licence does not allow them to operate point to point unless authorised by their permits.  In regard to the current development we are reverting to the 1971 Act under which people outside this country can come in here to pick up or deliver, but it is not needed for own hauliers because now they will get the general licence which will entitle them to undertake this activity as well as the other activity.  We are getting rid of the new provision of the 1978 Act and going back to the original 1971 Act.  However, I want to qualify that.  In the two year period before this becomes generally operative the people who have this restricted road freight licence may continue to use it. Qualified resident operators, as now, may apply for and be granted restricted <Col N="577" /> road freight licence.  In effect the restricted road freight licence authorises the national stage of an international journey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important section.  I mentioned the EC and the ECMT because, as the Minister and the House know, the whole transport question is perturbing the EC.  The EC Parliament took a kind of action against the Council of Ministers&mdash;and won it&mdash;to try to prod them along into developing an EC transport policy.  How do I relate that to this section of the Bill?  The Minister has outlined what is meant by a restricted road freight licence.  Is he empowered to have this section in the Bill and to put it through the Oireachtas without reference to or without making a distinction between other EC countries and countries outside the EC?  The European Conference of Ministers for Transport covers countries other than EC countries.  Is the Minister quite sure that he is entitled to restrict as far as the EC is concerned and, if so, could he say if there is a distinction between the countries in the EC and those outside it? Among those, I make a distinction between those outside the EC and members of the European Council for Ministers of Transport and those who are not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy pointed out, there is a move to liberalise transport haulage within the EC and, naturally, there may be developments in that area which will totally liberalise transport point to point pick-up in different countries. There are varying opinions on the advantages and disadvantages which that will bring to us.  It is a matter which must be discussed but, as the Deputy will know from his experience, the rate of progress within the transport council can be extraordinarily slow.  Section 8 (2) (a) of the Road Transport Act, 1971, states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may by order declare that a licence or class of licence (as specified in the order) issued in pursuance of an international multilateral or <Col N="578" /> bilateral agreement to which the State is a party by the competent authority of another State, an international organisation or a person or body acting on behalf of such an organisation, shall be deemed to be a restricted road freight licence.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Wilson said, there is an EC and ECMT quota and there are also licences issued under bilateral agreements.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked about the ECMT quota.  There are 19 countries involved and I understand that a list of those countries has been made available to the Deputy.  The new section dealing with the point raised by him re-enacts this provision and extends its cover to any licence issued under an international agreement to which the Government are a party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have statistics relating to 1986, which are subject to confirmation by the Minister as he has up to date information, which indicate that Ireland's allocation of authorisations under EC regulations totals 204 and a total of 31 ECMT licences operating within 18 of the 19 ECMT countries.  Obviously we have made deals with 18 countries in this connection.  The nub of the question is whether the Minister is satisfied that the 204 authorisations under EC regulations and the 31 licences under the ECMT are not injured, so to speak, by this section. In other words, if an operator from France comes into this country he will do so under a restricted road freight licence. If he insisted on his rights as a citizen of a country forming part of the EC to pick up Murphy's stout in Cork to transport it to Dublin <i>en route</i> to Liverpool or Holyhead, how would that square up to what the Minister said in regard to the limitation he was putting in this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>He cannot operate within this country under his licence with regard to transporting goods from one point to another.  His restricted licence allows him to pick up a load for delivery internationally but, if there is a bilateral agreement to drop it in Liverpool, that is all right as <Col N="579" /> far as we are concerned.  I do not know whether such facilities are available. They may be under certain bilateral agreements but in regard to this country he would be operating under his permit which would be deemed the operative element for this restricted licence.  He can pick up or deliver a load but he cannot operate from point to point in this country. This section re-enacts the provision which existed heretofore and extends the cover of any licence issued under an international agreement to which the Government are a party.</P>

      <P>We do not anticipate any difficulty in that regard.  We have sent a copy of the Bill to the Commission and there is a move in regard to the liberalisation of transport.  However, looking at the other side of the coin, we could not move goods from one part of France to another as they have restrictions in that respect.  I do not know when or if full liberalisation will be introduced but if there were difficulties and a case in the European Court succeeded it would have done what the European Ministers for Transport have not done so far and would be welcomed by many people.</P>

As regards Deputy Wilson's point, where there are two sections in a business they can have licences in each area but they obviously would not be in a position to engage in distribution activity which might involve picking up goods in one part of the Republic and delivering them to another.

      <P>This is interesting in that it seems to expand the area covered by the Bill.  I do not know why there is a distinction between the Government and the State. What scale of fees is the Minister thinking about?  What is the position regarding other countries, either EC or ECMT ones, in which we may be operating? What scale of fees have they?</P>

The Minister mentioned a scale of fees.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The general criteria to be used are the elements of cost of administration and issuing of these licences.

      <P>As I understand the Minister's reply now, it is only to cover the administrative costs of organisation and administration in his Department rather than to raise revenue.  Would it not perhaps be appropriate that there should be a revenue raising element in this scheme in respect of these multilateral operations? If these operators operate here, why should they not make some revenue contribution also over and above the administration costs?</P>

      <P>Administration costs are the basis for it.  I did not rule out other elements as well.  But we must also take into consideration charges levied on our own hauliers in other countries.  We need to be as flexible as possible in that area. I have no doubt that the fees will change from time to time but we will use, as the general basis for the operation, the cost of administration.  The possibility of raising revenue is still there because these would be users of our road structure and other facilities.  But our charges must be in relative conformity with the charges imposed by other countries for the same type of service or the authorisations.</P>

      <P>Before we leave the international aspect of the Bill I would like to ask the Minister about an anomaly which might occur.  As the Minister knows, the EC Transport Ministers agreed on a 40 tonne axle weight and both Britain and Ireland got a derogation and are allowed to adhere to the 38 tonne weight.  The restricted road freight licence will be given up to the time we and Britain feel that we are ready for the 40 tonne weight. Will the Minister be in a position to put a provision in his licence that only a 38 tonne axle weight load can be taken? There is no point in a haulier having a licence if he falls through the bridge at Skeheenarinky and is not able to get any further.  If we in our wisdom specify 38 tonnes as the maximum load acceptable as of now, even that type of operation will hammer our roads, some of which at the present time are barely able to take an ass and cart in places.  Will the Minister <Col N="586" /> be in a position to indicate that that type of load is all that we can cope with at present, if we can cope with it?</P>

The same situation arises as far as the councils are concerned and our representation there. It is not proposed that there be any specific mention of or provision for this in the licence issue.  The question raised by the Deputy is already fully covered under regulations of the Department of the Environment so that the heavier trucks will not be able to come in during the derogation period.  That is very adequately covered already under those regulations.  It is not proposed as being appropriate to this area of licences.  The House need have no fear; it is covered.</P>

      <P>This section provides for a technical amendment to section 5 of the Road Transport Act of 1978 to cover the agreements made by the Government.  In addition to that amendment, the section in question had to be amended to take account of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill, 1985.  The two amendments were affected by section 29 of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill, 1985 which was passed by the Dáil on 19 March 1986.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would help the house by spelling out in detail why section 29 of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill as passed by the Dáil forced the deletion of section 8 which went as follows:</P>
      <P>Where an international agreement relating to international transport by road to which the Government or the State is a party, or an agreement, arrangement or resolution relating to such transport to which the Minister is a party so requires, the Minister may by order exempt from the provisions of section 7 of the Road Transport Act, 1932, sections 9 and 34 of the Principal Act (as amended or extended) and sections 6 and 7 of the Road Transport Act, 1935 (as amended or extended) or from any of those provisions any specified class of vehicle or any specified class of such transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="588" /> Could the Minister spell out for us the original purpose of section 8 and in simple terms state why it is not now necessary in view of the Dublin Transport Authority Act of 1985?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The section empowers the Minister to exempt by order any specified class of vehicle or specified class of transport under certain provisions of the Transport Act.  It extends the provision relating to agreements to which the State or the Minister is a party to certain agreements to which the Government is a party.  Modification was consequential on amendment of section 8 of the 1971 Act being effected under section 7 of this Bill. This was in two Bills, both the present one and the Dublin Transport Authority Bill.  That was questioned and the advice was that it should not be incorporated in the two.  As the Dublin Transport Authority Bill was the first to pass through the Dáil, it was felt that it should be incorporated in that Bill.  The amendment was effected to the Transport Authority Bill and passed in the Dáil on 19 March 1986.</P>

      <P>My memory of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill is that it referred to the area covered, in the old terminology, by Dublin Corporation, Dún Laoghaire Borough Council, Dublin County Council &mdash; new areas now.  Is the Minister saying that a provision in the Dublin Transport Authority Bill which was delimited in area, admittedly with powers in it for the Minister to extend the area, in the context of a Bill which referred to those limited areas that I have mentioned, is now to be applied in the wider national context?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very much a technical amendment, as the Deputy will be aware, of section 8 of a previous Act. This is in order to include a reference to agreements made by the Government in addition to agreements as already specified made by the State and by the Minister. It is possible that some of the various agreements would be between Governments.  It is in order to cover that <Col N="589" /> technical aspect.  The provision in the Dublin Transport Authority Bill was an amendment to a previous Transport Bill which has already covered it.  As the Deputy will be aware, many of the provisions that we are making here are for incorporation with or insertion in earlier Transport Bills.  The particular activity that we were seeking to accomplish here has already been accomplished by the Dublin Transport Authority Bill.</P>

Does that tie this Bill?  The fact that it was in the context of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill will not mean that it relates only to the areas that I mentioned, but to the whole country?</P>

      <P>That is right.  The Dublin Transport Authority Bill also had to incorporate the extra element whereby licences issued by the Dublin Transport Authority would also be covered as well as licences issued by the Minister.  The incorporation that we are referring to does precisely the same thing, with no limitation as regards the area covered by the Dublin Transport Authority, as we would have done had this been the first Bill.  It would have been unnecessary in that respect to include the amendment with regard to the Dublin Transport Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This section has been slightly controversial:</P>
      <P>Section 112 of the Transport Act, 1944, is hereby amended by the addition of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6)  Where a vehicle (being a mechanically propelled vehicle or a vehicle drawn by a mechanically propelled vehicle)&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  is hired to a person under a hire-purchase agreement (within the meaning of the Hire-Purchase Acts, 1946 to 1980) or is otherwise rented or leased to the person under an agreement, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the owner of the vehicle neither provides a driver nor causes a driver to be provided,</P>
      <P>then, the person to whom the vehicle is so hired, rented or leased shall, in relation to subsections (1) to (5) of this section, be deemed to be the owner of the vehicle.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from that that subsections (1)  to (5) refer to the Transport Act, 1944.  We would be able to have a more intelligent discussion on this if the Minister would give us information on subsections (1) to (5) of section 112 of the Transport Act, 1944.  As the Minister has very pointedly stated, the sooner we have <Col N="591" /> a consolidation of these Acts the better. There is such a maze of sections and subsections in the various Acts that we have to strive to keep our minds clear on what exactly is happening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 112 (2) of the Transport Act, 1944, is an exceedingly long subsection.  It states:</P>
      <P>Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  merchandise, which is supplied by a person in the course of a trade or business carried on by him is, for the purpose of delivery to the customer, carried in a mechanically propelled vehicle owned by that person or in a vehicle drawn by a mechanically propelled vehicle owned by that person, or</P>
      <P>(b)  merchandise, which is to be or has been subjected to any one or more of the following processes, namely, repairing, cleaning, laundering and dyeing, by a person in the course of a trade or business carried on by him is, for the purpose of collection from or delivery to the customer, carried in a mechanically propelled vehicle owned by that person or in a vehicle drawn by a mechanically propelled vehicle owned by that person, the merchandise shall, for the purpose of the Act of 1933, be deemed not to be carried for reward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new provision for section 112 we are proposing here provides that where a person leases or hires a vehicle without a driver to carry his own goods he shall be deemed, for the purpose of section 112 of the Transport Act, 1944, to be the owner of that vehicle.  In other words, where he has hired a vehicle without a driver it is treated in the same way as if he is the owner of the vehicle.  The new provision and repeal of the Road Transport Act, 1956, will in effect extend to own account operators.  It will give them the facility to lease or hire vehicles which is at present enjoyed by licensed hauliers. People who can do that are users of vehicles of 2.5 metric tonnes unladen in <Col N="592" /> weight.  The Road Transport Act, 1956, in order to close a fairly obstruse loophole in the legislation, effectively imposed a requirement to have a merchandise licence when using a hired or leased vehicle other than a vehicle hired under a hire purchase agreement to carry own goods. As people familiar with the trade will know, there is a desire to lease or hire vehicles without actually owning the vehicles.  This will facilitate that and will be regarded by many people as good business and the most appropriate way to run their affairs.  Provided there is no driver with the vehicle the person shall be deemed to be the owner of the vehicle. It is treated in the same way&mdash;the non-requirement of a licence &mdash; as the own account operators.  However, if they wish to operate in haulage in addition to their own account then they would be required to get a carrier's licence as would any other carrier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been various views on this section.  The Confederation of Irish Industry welcomed this provision. If an own account operator wants to lease five trucks for a season or six months, must those trucks already have from their owner a licence and plate?  Why is the distinction made between the leasing of a vehicle without a driver and the leasing of of a vehicle with a driver?  What is the <i>raison d'etre</i> for that distinction?  I am aware that own account operators have been very anxious to have this facility while others have expressed doubts about companies that are involved in very heavy seasonal work and then have a largish fleet under-utilised or not utilised at all for other periods of the year.  Will the Minister say what he thinks of the fears being expressed by owners of large fleets that are fully occupied seasonally but are available for lease or hire for long periods of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment a person using leased trucks must have a licence in order to operate those trucks legally even though he is operating them on own account only activity.  The effect of this provision is to remove that requirement <Col N="593" /> so that an own account owner leasing a vehicle in the future for such an operation will not require a licence for transporting his own goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that such a person will not have to have a licence at all?  Will he not have to have a base licence for one truck before he can go into leasing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not if he is an own account operator.  An own account operator, provided he does not get involved in haulage outside his own activities, will not need a licence.  Previously he did not need a licence as such but he needed one if he was using a leased truck, not a truck on hire purchase.  We are removing the necessity for a person to get a licence when he leases a truck.  An own account operator up to now did not need a licence provided he was operating his own trucks or had trucks on hire purchase but he did need a licence if he leased trucks.  We are removing the requirement to have a licence when he leases trucks.  That movement is taking place within the industry and many people find it more profitable to lease than to have their own fleet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  An own account operator is confined to his own business with the leased truck as well as with his own truck.  However, if the own account operator wants to get involved in haulage outside his own activities, as happens, it is up to him to apply for a licence like anybody else.  If he meets the various conditions he will be granted one.</P>

Is he still confined to own account operations or can he use such vehicles for more general trading?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>He can lease one of those licensed trucks but it is of no advantage to him to do that.  The fact that the plate is on display will not be of any advantage to him.  It is important to note that he cannot lease such a truck with a driver; he has to lease it in the ordinary way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  He would not be bringing in an outside driver.  If one leases a vehicle with a driver one is engaging a person to carry, and carriage for reward is then involved.  A licence is necessary for that.  Trucks can be leased in but that does not confer any advantage over trucks that do not have plates.  A difficulty would arise if the truck and driver were leased in.  Different rules apply in regard to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that we are meeting a kind of supremacy of artificiality in draftsmanship in this case.  It appears to me that in respect of the one vehicle we will have (a) the person who is the owner of it and (b) the person who is deemed to be the owner. Is it not possible for the parliamentary draftsman to find a simpler way of dealing with this?  I can see the point in having the section but if the section ties up one loophole is there not a possibility that it might open up another?  Will it enable a person to carry on a haulage business if he has the right contacts without a licence? That person may have the truck but instead of entering into a haulage contract with a firm he can lease the vehicle for three days a week and while he does <Col N="595" /> not put a driver with it he can say to the firm that the driver does not go with the vehicle but a Mr. Joe Soap is available for work.  There could be a succession of arrangements under which the vehicles could be let for a short term to different firms.  It appears that that arrangement would be perfectly legal because the haulage operations would be done by the lessee of the vehicle.</P>
      <P>What is envisaged I would assume is that the operator of own goods would have a vehicle for a long term and not for a short term.  If that is the intent, would it not be necessary to provide for that kind of situation?  Otherwise, it might open up a possibility under which a truck owner could carry on a haulage business without any licence because the running would be done on an own goods basis on a series of short lets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the difficulties which arises.  There is nothing to stop a person who may be an own account operator and who has his own trucks from engaging in extra activity in bringing in a licensed haulier &mdash; this would not be leasing as such &mdash; for a particular consignment or for a busy period.  The haulier in <Col N="596" /> that case would be operating under his own flag.</P>
      <P>It would not be practicable to provide forever against short term leasing once long term leasing has been allowed.  The question of phasing between long and short term leasing has been considered but on balance it was thought better and more realistic to deal with the whole matter in one provision.  There was removal of control on smaller vehicles in 1978.  Because in the exempted areas, control on haulage operations never existed the leasing question is marginal. There was never any restriction previously on long or short term leasing by own account operators in the exempted areas.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>We already had a slight discussion on this with regard to keeping a list of licences and the wearing of insignia, so to speak, by the actual trucks and the importance of this to law enforcement, information etc.  This section covers the register of the licences.  From what the Minister of State has said and from my own study of the Bill I can see the need for this.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>the Register shall at all reasonable times be open to inspection by any person on payment of a fee.</P>
      <P>This is true, and I speak as one less wise on these matters, of wills also.  There is general access to wills and it is easy to see why that should be so.  I am not all that sure as to why it is necessary in the case of the register of carriers' licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The register should be open to inspection by the law enforcing authorities and, possibly, by customers.  I am only trying to speculate as to the reason for a general inspection being available to the public. This is probably a good thing.  It is not the usual kind of thing but one can go <Col N="597" /> and pay a fee and look at the register to see who is on it.  I can see the reason in the case of law enforcement or in the case of a major customer in the context of ensuring that one is dealing with a haulier one can trust.  The very fact that he has a licence covering the areas we have mentioned several times already &mdash; good character, sound financial standing and so on &mdash; should be an insurance and consolation for the person who is employing him.</P>
    <P>One of the general regulations is that any person shall be entitled to obtain from the Minister a copy of any entry in the register on the payment of a fee of such amount as shall from time to time be prescribed.  Subsection (5) is the usual one about proof that it is a true copy etc.  I am in general agreement with the provisions of section 10.  Perhaps the Minister of State would indicate briefly the reasons for open inspection?  Is there a special reason for this with regard to the register of carriers' licences?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>

      <P>I would accept immediately what the Deputy says about their situation not being directly comparable. It is very valuable that this should be there as a provision.  There will be a question of people in one area wishing to know how many licensed carriers there are in that area, perhaps, with a view to setting up a business or seeking a carrier's licence and if there was a proliferation of carriers' licences in the area, backing off from the idea.  It would be valuable for them to know what the extent or the saturation was before they go into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can also see the Irish Road Hauliers' Association seeking this type of information on a regular basis, seeking information <Col N="598" /> also as to the number of vehicles licensees have.  Naturally, the association will be interested to see if there is any breach of the law.  Overall, it is a wise provision and if it were not included, the Deputy might be putting forward the point as to why it should be there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would regard it as absolutely essential that such a register be maintained and that the fullest possible information be made available to the public so far as these hauliers are concerned. The control of information should be considerably tightened up.  The way these licensed hauliers with these articulated trucks operate is that they have the tractor unit and they will enter into a contract to haul a trailer for this owner or that owner.  The tractor could have a different trailer behind it every day of the week.  Those people have a nasty little habit of putting the critical registration number on the front of the tractor but then when the trailer is attached it hides the number at the rear of the tractor and you might find a number chalked on the back of the trailer which would have no connection whatsoever with the real owner &mdash; the vehicle might have changed hands three years before. That is just too bad for anybody who is hit by one of those vehicles which disappears in the distance, because all he can get is a number which might have belonged to another person months or years before and, of course, damages cannot be recovered.</P>

    <P>The control of these things is inadequate. It should be made compulsory to have proper registration numbers on all of these vehicles front and rear, and there should be a proper enforcement system. The registration numbers should be clearly displayed on both tractor and trailer units.  As well, it should be made clear to <Col N="599" /> licensees that they have a strong obligation to show these numbers, that registration numbers should be updated and that, on a change of ownership, the number should be switched to the new owner so that it will be checkable easily.  I know people who have suffered severe damage and when trying to trace the number were told: &ldquo;Ownership changed three years ago&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Identification by registration should be easily ascertainable.  With this in mind, there should be indexation and cross-indexation of registration numbers in the proposed register, giving the names of owners, the regions or areas in which they operate, etc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree about the need for indexation and easy accessibility to information.  I will bring these points to the attention of the people involved. Now that we are in the computer age there is no reason why this information should not be stored in computers so that there could be cross-references in regard to actual ownership.  It is not the intention that the plates would be displayed on anything but the tractor units, but I accept the point made by the Deputy. The Department of the Environment have regulations, but as far as enforcement generally is concerned, we will be dealing with it in later sections of the Bill. We all have an obligation to make as much information as possible available about the working of all services, with certain limitations in certain areas.  I would not regard this Bill as breaking any new avenues towards that.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 11.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 11 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important part of the Bill which relates to what will happen if a licensee dies or becomes physically ill and incapable.  An attempt has been made to deal with the problem <Col N="600" /> reasonably compassionately, though we are not used to compassion in the law. This section is geared to individual owners of transport companies.  I am in agreement with the provision that the Minister will be notified in writing of the death or incapacity of the company owner and in regard to relatives.  This is contained in subsection (1).  Paragraph (d) of the subsection provides that:</P>
      <P>the Minister is satisfied that the relative has, prior to the death or incapacity of the holder, had not less than three years' experience in the day to day conduct of the business to which the licence relates, and complies with the requirement as to good repute referred to or specified in regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972,</P>
      <P>I find this very difficult to understand in regard to coming to the aid of a family bereaved by death.  There could be a sudden death and the wife may not have been involved in the running of the business and perhaps the family may be too young to have been involved or to have gained the necessary three years' experience of the running of the company. There is, therefore, an implied hardship for such an individual family business.</P>
      <P>As well, a limited liability company may be involved but that is not provided for in this section.  A provision for a named individual who need not necessarily be connected with the owner of the company should be made &mdash; perhaps section 12 deals with it.  Does the Minister think that in this section he could modify the three years' experience demand in regard to a company owned and developed by an individual, as many of these companies are.  A company is started by one person who because of his arduous efforts to build it up, is probably likely to suffer a heart attack, leaving a wife and family.  Can the Minister modify that to make it easier for such a family to continue in business by taking in a competent person to run the enterprise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The new provision empowers the Minister to take into <Col N="601" /> account the special circumstances that may arise from the death or incapacity of the holder of a carrier's licence.  It is transferring a hardship clause already existing in the certificate to the licence, because there will be no need for certificates in the future.  With regard to the central point made by Deputy Wilson, the problem is this is an EC regulation and we are not in a position to modify it. The regulation specifies that allowances can be made.  The requirement to provide financial standing and professional competence established by experience is waived in such a case and the Minister is empowered to grant a licence to the relative of a holder of the licence if that person has had three years' experience in the day-to-day operations of the business and is of good repute.</P>
      <P>I regret we cannot accede to the suggestion of Deputy Wilson with regard to modification.  I appreciate the points raised by the Deputy, but the experience of the Department has been that generally the accounts and the business dealings of a firm are dealt with by the wife while the husband drives the trucks or other vehicles.  While I appreciate the point made by the Deputy, I must point out to him that it is an EC regulation in force throughout the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In pursuance of my thesis that there should be some modification, I advance the argument that until comparatively recently transport management was not a highly structured career but in the past few years it has been seen as a profession.  Now there are studies leading to qualifications in transport management and now outside expertise is available.  That is something that was not true in the past.  Because of this outside expertise it makes it easier for a family in the circumstances I have mentioned to get somebody who is reliable and competent to run the business, even though that person may not be a relative.  For that reason I urge that consideration be given to a modification of the existing provisions in section 11 (d) and I suggest that this could be done on Report Stage or <Col N="602" /> during the debate in the Seanad.  Incidentally, if it were done in the Seanad it would escape the financial clause prohibition. It would be in ease of people who should command the sympathy of the House.  Many transport companies were started by enterprising individuals, many of whom worked long hours that would not be allowed now in the days of tachographs.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for having this section in the Bill but I am saying it is not wide enough.  I suggest that we should include a provision for the employment of a person, at least <i>pro tem</i> until the surviving spouse, member of the family or any of the other categories as defined by the Minister, could be available to do the work.  I can see cases where, with the best will in the world, the Minister will not be able to allow some businesses to continue because the provisions set out in the section cannot be met by the family.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Wilson in what he has said.  I have known a number of small haulage companies that eventually had to employ accountants to ensure that the businesses were run effectively.  I can foresee cases where small businesses could fail because of the death of the husband, where the wife and the children would not be able to take over.  I understand the point made by the Minister that it is an EC regulation but I urge him to reconsider the matter.  Many efficient and profitable businesses could be threatened if the regulation is adhered to strictly.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that we are tied to regulations.  I know of two instances in my area where there was a death in the family but they struggled on and now those businesses are thriving. Had this clause been in force these firms could not have continued in operation. Serious problems could be created by strict adherence to this provision.  I know the Minister is restricted by the conditions regarding competence and experience but I ask him to reconsider the matter seriously.</P>

      <P>I appreciate and accept the points made by the Deputies but, notwithstanding my concern, I must repeat that this section is as lenient as the EC regulations allow.  The three-year clause is inserted in EC regulations that govern the position of carrier throughout the Community.  This is being put into the licence as distinct from the certificate. However, there are ways in which we can achieve the desired effect.  Where a family business or organisation do not have a person qualifying under the three year rule, they can take in a manager, if he gets the appropriate certificate, and he can be the designated person.</P>
      <P>There is another point covered in section 12.  Firms can get temporary permission to carry on the business for a year &mdash; and this possibly can be extended to 18 months &mdash; until adequate arrangements are made.  In conjunction with section 12 it will be possible to meet virtually all cases either through bringing in a manager who gets the competency qualifications or operating for a period of a year or 18 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister said.  He said section 11 was drafted as widely as the EC regulations allowed.  The European Communities Act, 1972, is mentioned in section 11 (1) (d).  Could the Minister give a more specific reference to the EC regulations to which he referred?  I mentioned earlier the difficulties I had because the statutory instrument referred to 1972 although the date it carried was 1977.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This section has already been mentioned by the Minister and I would like to tease out a few points. Subsection (1) reads:</P>
      <P>Where the holder of a carrier's licence dies or becomes physically or legally incapable of carrying on or managing the business to which the licence relates, or where a person designated in pursuance of regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972, dies or becomes physically or legally incapable of carrying on or managing such business, the Minister may, notwithstanding anything in the Principal Act (as amended) if he is satisfied that it is necessary in order to avoid hardship, grant a permission under this section on an application being made to him in that behalf by or the personal representative of such holder or person.</P>
      <P>What exactly does &ldquo;holder&rdquo; mean?  Does it mean the licensed haulage limited company to which the Minister had accorded a licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) empowers the Minister, if he is satisfied that it is necessary to avoid hardship, to grant a temporary provision for the business under the licence to be carried on.  The person to whom the permission is given does not have to meet EC requirements. This provision caters for a number of circumstances.  Where the licensee dies it allows a certain amount of time to settle the affairs of the deceased.  The duration can be for a year and it can be extended by a further six months.  Where the licensee or the designated transport manager becomes physically incapacitated or dies, it allows time for another qualified person to be appointed to operate or manage the business.  Where a public company are granted the licence, the company are the licensee and they are the people referred to in the last part of this subsection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) reads:</P>
      <P>(2) A permission under this section shall authorise the business to which the permission relates to be carried on either by the person named therein or, as may be so specified, by such person subject to its being managed by another person so named.</P>
      <P>A surviving spouse can nominate someone and the directors of a company which are the holder of the licence can nominate somebody.  Is that so?  If the managing director dies, and he was the only person with the necessary qualifications, what is the position?  The individually owned company can specify somebody provided he or she has the necessary qualifications, but in the case of a company, who has to die or become incompetent before the provisions of this section can begin to operate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the company are concerned they are the designated competent person.  When they get a licence they then designate a competent person.  They will only get into difficulties when the competent person is incapacitated or dies.  Under this legislation they will be able to carry on the business with another designated person but he need not be a competent person, for a minimum of one year, and that can be extended to 18 months.  After that they must have a competent person in control. In the case of the family, the period of one year would give them adequate time for a person to become competent under this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This raises the question of the definition of the word &ldquo;competence&rdquo;. Does it mean that the examinations, which are a new feature for all applicants after the two year delay, will have to be taken by the person who is to benefit by this concession?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations are laid down and an examination is necessary as far as the licensee is concerned.  The important point is that a competent person will not be needed for the first year or 18 months but after that one will be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>They need not have done the examination.  After the 18 month period the person would be a competent person within the regulations and the main regulation covering a competent person is that that person has passed the examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Leas-Cheann Comhairle puts the section to the House I would like to summarise my query.  In both the case of individually owned companies where death or incapacity occurs and the case of a public liability company where a similar occurrence takes place with regard to the person who was designated originally when the licence was given, is the Minister satisfied that sections 11 and 12 cover the scene to the extent that the business can continue and that there will be no disruption pending, in the latter case, the end of the 18 month period and the appointment of a competent person?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am satisfied, as I explained earlier and as the Deputy accepted, that we have gone as far as we can under the EC regulations.  In addition, I am satisfied that we have covered all or practically all eventualities, I can see one difficulty where a small family business might not have the financial resources to employ some outside person or an appropriate person if there is a young family for instance.  Therefore, we cannot say that we are absolutely, down along the line, 100 per cent certain that everything will be covered.  As far as the EC regulations are concerned there is the <Col N="607" /> difficulty which the Deputy has pointed out strongly about the three years, but, taking sections 11 and 12 in conjunction, we have gone as far as we can go on virtually all of the cases.  A very exceptional hardship case may arise which is not within the EC regulations.  If we were devising it ourselves from the beginning without being constrained by EC regulations, I cannot say we could cover everything, but we have gone virtually all along the line to meet the difficulties the Deputy mentioned.</P>

      <P>Section 12 (3) (a) provides that a permission under this section shall remain in force for a period not exceeding one year beginning on the date on which it is granted.  Under section 12 (3) (b) the permission can be extended for six months.  Would it not be better to have a round figure of 18 months because, if there was a death, and an attempt to restructure and get a business back in operation, it would probably take that length of time to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Again that is the EC regulation but I am not so sure it is not a good idea.  After a one year period it might be very useful for some organisations who may have come through a traumatic period due to the death or disability of somebody to know in a very meaningful way that they had only a further 18 months with maximum extension.  There would be a spin off benefit in that respect but here we are incorporating the EC regulations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>A licence comes up for renewal every three years and financial standing becomes a relevant factor again in that respect.  As far as the transfers here are concerned that condition was fulfilled in the original application and these are a method of trying to get a <Col N="608" /> smooth transition when some difficulty has arisen in a firm through death or incapacity of one sort or another.  Therefore, the condition of financial standing would have been satisfied either a short period before or would be due to be satisfied again when the licence came up for renewal.  The matter has been well covered in that respect.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 13.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a long and important section.  A look at section 13 (1) (a) and (b) brings to the notice of the House the necessity for the consolidation of the Transport Acts.  As the Minister stated, it is nearly impossible to pick one's footsteps through the minefield of transport legislation, and there is so much reference and cross-reference backwards and forwards to all the Acts the Minister mentioned which are listed on page 1 of the Bill.  The Minister's reference to consolidation should be kept in mind.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a saying that possession is nine points of the law.  I am talking about the Minister's very apposite appeal for consolidation of the Transport Acts.  I would go further and say that the Finance Act is even worse but that does not justify the mix-up we have in the Transport Acts.  As the Minister put it succinctly, section 13 is designed to make provision for on-the-spot fines.  The procedure is humane and covers any kind of citizenship demands that might be made. If they have reasonable grounds for believing that a person is committing or has committed an offence to which this section applies, the Garda Síochána may deliver to the person a notice in the prescribed form stating that the person is alleged to have committed that offence. Then there is a 21-day notice:</P>
      <P>(b) that the person may, during a period of 21 days beginning on the date of the notice make to a member of the Garda Síochána at a specified Garda Síochána station a payment of an amount specified in the notice...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that the House approve of that and of the fact that a prosecution will not take place during the period specified.  In other words, if the person pays the fine within the period, it will avoid a court case, loss of time by the haulier and extra costs, as solicitors and barristers charge their clients for appearing for them in <Col N="610" /> court.  This side of the House approves of the section.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to my contribution on Second Stage regarding the difficulties Irish road hauliers have in Britain with regard to very large on-the-spot fines imposed on the haulier-driver.  In the past &mdash; and I complained about this &mdash; a haulier-driver was put into jail pending arrival of the money necessary to enable him to go free.  That point received publicity inside and outside the country when I referred to it previously.  As far as this section is concerned, there is enough time given to pay the fine.  I ask the Minister to examine legislation in countries in the EC and the ECMT to see if people are put in jail pending payment of fines.  Perhaps that legislation could be modified and made more civilised.  It has been alleged that there was discrimination against Irish drivers, although it is very difficult to get proof of this.  However, if there is any suggestion of that it is the Minister's duty to investigate it to ensure that such a procedure is not adopted in future. Subsection (3) states:</P>
    <P>Where a notice is delivered under subsection (2) of this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) a person to whom the notice applies may, during the period specified in the notice, make to a member of the Garda Síochána at the Garda Síochána station specified in the notice the payment specified in the notice accompanied by the notice.</P>
    <P>(b) the member may receive the payment, issue a receipt therefor...</P>
    <P>These are ordinary regulations which one would expect in connection with on-the-spot fines.  The Bill specifically lays down that a prosecution shall not be instituted during the period specified in the notice and that the haulier has rights which are also defined.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) states:</P>
    <P>In a prosecution for an offence to which this section applies, the onus of showing that a payment pursuant to a <Col N="611" /> notice under this section has been made shall lie on the defendant.</P>
    <P>In a way that derogates from the specific, clear and praiseworthy rights which have been incorporated in the section for the defendant.  As the chief superintendent, superintendent or inspector of the Garda Síochána will be prosecuting in court, the onus should not be on the defendant but on the State to check beforehand whether the defendant has paid the fine within the specified time.  It may be a minor point, but it is hard to justify putting the onus on the defendant in this matter.  The Bill clearly states that the individual garda will specify the amount and the station at which the fine is to be paid.  This being so, it would be a very easy for the State &mdash; the prosecutor &mdash; to check whether the money had been paid.  After all, there is a provision that a receipt should be issued.  Therefore, the State has the information and there is no justification for putting the onus on the defendant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty of referring to other Acts was alluded to by Deputy Wilson, and section 13 deals with the Principal Act, the Act of 1932, the Transport Act, 1944, the European Communities Act, 1972, and this Bill, so we have the same difficulties in regard to clarity and orderly procedure.  The important thing to note is that this gives the Minister the right to specify in the regulations the type of offences to which on-the-spot fines would apply.  The intention is that the offences so declared would not be serious.  The difference between this country and Britain, to which Deputy Wilson alluded, is that quite serious matters can be the subject of on-the-spot fines in Britain but it is not intended that offences attracting serious penalties would be involved in on-the-spot fines here.  The fact that this is so should be welcomed by everyone, including potential offenders, if I can use such a phrase, because it saves the time of the courts, the Garda and officials in the preparation of a case.  The kind of things which might be involved is failure of the driver to produce a copy of the licence, failure to have charts correctly <Col N="612" /> filled and failure to record correct information in relation to the tachograph.</P>
      <P>This section also enables the Minister to make regulations fixing the amount of on-the-spot fines for each of the offences listed.  We are dealing with minor breaches of the regulations which may be encountered.  With regard to the point made about the onus being on the offender to produce proof that the fine has been paid, this is already incorporated in the Road Traffic Act.  It is the same as the provision in that Act dealing with parking tickets, clearway transgressions and other offences for which on-the-spot fines are now in operation.</P>
      <P>One area in which there might be difficulty is in the case of a fee being posted but not received by the Garda.  The Garda would initiate a prosecution in the event of an on-the-spot fine not being paid.  They would have to check their records to see if it had been paid.  In the event of it not having being received by the Garda it would be necessary for the defendant to produce some kind of proof of having paid.</P>
      <P>The idea is to ease the burden on the courts.  If a defendant has to appear in court it may impose a cost in terms of loss of time which would be out of all proportion to the offence.  I do not anticipate any difficulties for owners or drivers who may have transgressed as far as fines are concerned.  We are not dealing here with serious breaches of the law because on-the-spot fines do not apply to offences of a serious nature.</P>

      <P>I agree with on-the-spot fines.  It does away with delay in litigation.  Is there a standard or maximum rate of fine under the European Communities Act, 1972?  Drivers are sometimes not in a position to pay such fines when they are abroad because most of them carry very little cash, and for good reason.  They sleep in the cab of the truck and arrangements are made for them to refuel at various stations. Hauliers claim things are made difficult for them on the Continent in regard to fines.</P>

      <P>The reason the European Communities Act is mentioned is because the various regulations under which on-the-spot fines can be applied under it &mdash; for example the tachograph &mdash; feature there.  The Minister can extract some offences and say that on-the-spot fines should be imposed for them.  What we are talking about are fines of the nature of £20.  Relatively minor breaches of the law would be involved.</P>

      <P>In his reference to my alluding to problems that have been encountered by drivers in Britain the Minister indicated that on-the-spot fines relate to a more serious category of offences.  The implication was that the case referred to at the annual general meeting of the Irish Road Hauliers Association was somewhat of a more serious nature.  I understand &mdash; perhaps this is covered by the Minister's definition of a serious offence &mdash; the offence concerned was one of overloading.  Sometimes a driver is not aware that a truck is overloaded.  He would not condone overloading but he is an employee and at the mercy of someone who may expose him to the danger of being overloaded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>In Britain the fines differ in many respects to our on-the-spot fines. A Magistrates Court can be set up quickly.  It goes through a court procedure. The case will be dealt with almost immediately.  The Deputy will be aware that there was a committee of judges who <Col N="614" /> examined the question of on-the-spot fines and their advice was they should only be used for offences of a minor nature.</P>
      <P>One of the major benefits of such fines would be that they would stop cluttering the courts with minor offences.  There is a difficulty in that there could be conflict as to whether a fine was paid but that is something which could be sorted out.  If such a dispute arose, the court would be involved, because it would arrive in court in the first place.  There will not be major difficulties.  There may be a difficulty with the post, but the Garda are unlikely to initiate proceedings immediately after the 21 days has elapsed.</P>
      <P>If proceedings were initiated immediately, because of the nature of these proceedings, it would be a long time before the case would come up in court and the difficulty caused by late posting would be irrelevant at that stage.  The same applies to difficulties with cheques.  The usual common sense would be applied in regard to payments or cheques that arrive one or two days late or even as much as seven days late.  The Garda are not known to be overly severe in these matters and I am sure the same will apply in this case. It is not possible to copperfasten all of these things in the legislation but I think it will work out to the benefit of everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the general conclusions of the committee which considered on-the-spot fines.  It is desirable that they should operate in regard to less serious offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to reiterate that the Department of Communications should be <i>au fait</i> with what on-the-spot fining involves in other countries where it obtains and such information should be available to our citizens who are involved in the haulage business.  I say that in the context of this section of the Bill because it would be only human to deduce that on-the-spot fines would be operated in much the same spirit in other countries as obtains in Ireland.  This may not be the case and it may have caused some of the incidents that I have already referred to. <Col N="615" /> A haulier could find himself in a position where he may be in a part of a country he does not know, unable to contact a legal adviser quickly and drawing the wrong conclusions based on the legislation we are putting on the Statute Book here and now.</P>
    <P>I understand that some of the professional associations are at the moment, through contacts with similar associations in other countries, drawing up points of reference whereby contact can be made with legal people and advice sought, apart from our diplomatic and consular representation in other countries.  I take the Minister's point that in dealing with such things the Garda, generally speaking, exercise their common sense and are not court greedy and are helpful in that regard.  In general I approve of the section.  I favour the provision that cuts out court costs for the unfortunate person who is caught contravening regulations which, although they are important in the general context of the Bill, are not very serious offences but simply attract a fine of about £20.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Wilson that our drivers going abroad should have an easy reference to all the regulations that exist and the possibility of fines in the countries to which they are going.  Some arrangements should be made in that respect.  I got some of the documentation on the British situation in regard to on-the-spot fines and there seems to be a two-tier system there whereby for the actual on-the-spot fines there are fines for endorsable offences of about £20 and for non-endorsable offences of about £12.  There seems to be another type of case in which they are referred to the Magistrate's Court quite quickly on the same day; that goes through the ordinary court proceedings and it deals with other activities.  So the on-the-spot fines there are dealing also with relatively minor offences.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 14 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides for increases in the penalties for various offences in the Road Transport Acts.  The new section increases the maximum fine on summary conviction to £1,000 and provides for a maximum fine not exceeding £5,000 on conviction on indictment. The fine of £1,000 is the maximum which the District Court can, at present, impose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 14 is very long and will need a bit of teasing out.  Again, the question of consolidation raises its head at the very beginning of the section.  What we are talking about is something in substitution for section 9 (2) (a) in the Principal Act inserted by section 2 of the Act of 1978.  As the Minister has mentioned, every person who carries merchandise in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or on conviction on indictment, not exceeding £5,000. These are very substantial fines.  I would like a little more from the Minister in regard to what, in his mind, justifies fines of £1,000 or £5,000 respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like a little more information on this, to indicate what, in the Minister's mind, justifies the £1,000 and £5,000 fines, respectively.  The people involved in the haulage business are very keen on enforcement of the provisions of whatever legislation is on the Statute Book. There is a grey area in transport at the moment, where people pay VAT and taxes and so on but have made complaints to me that they may be outside the law <Col N="617" /> in some ways and that we as legislators are to blame in that we have done nothing to update the law substantially to cope with and cater for the very much changed times from when the laws were enacted originally in the thirties.  I would very much appreciate if the Minister would flesh out the argument in justification of the large rise in the fines as indicated in section 14 (1).</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy rightly points out, the key section here is section 14 (1).  This provides, where a person engages in the carriage of merchandise for reward without a licence, in other words illegal haulage, for the maximum fines laid down in this legislation.  In the 1978 Act the maximum fines were £250 for a first offence and £500 for the second or subsequent offences.  As the value of money has moved since 1978, although that is not so long ago, the leeway has been taken up between the £500 and the £1,000 fine.  What we are doing here is setting down the maximum fine.  These will not necessarily be the penalties imposed by the court.  Naturally, the court will take into consideration the various circumstances, arguments and pleas put forward for amelioration in the case of a person who is found guilty before the court.  As Deputy Wilson no doubt is aware, there have been very strong representations from many people for an increase in the fines, considering the type of operation which haulage has now become, the kind of loads that carriers bring and the revenue that it is possible to earn.  Fines of £250 for the first offence and £500 for the second and subsequent offences were considered too low, in these representations.  I understand that these were quite low fines as far as many of the hauliers were concerned and could be paid without any difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present maximum fines of £1,000 and £5,000, respectively, constitute a deterrent.  Of course, a fine of £1,000 is the maximum which can be imposed in the District Court.  These fines are quite substantial and are intended to be.  Now that we have liberalised transport, everybody would be anxious, under the new <Col N="618" /> regime, that the law be enforced and that there should not be constant breaches of it.  The purpose of the legislation was to get rid of the chaos, or the grey area as Deputy Wilson described it delicately. The Deputy and all others who have been seeking proper facilities for ensuring that the law is enforced will agree with that. They will be a very substantial aid in ensuring that the law is kept.  The previous fines, if re-enacted in this legislation would not be a major deterrent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, I agree with the Minister that the purpose is to remove the grey area to which I referred.  There are good, solid arguments in criticism of us as legislators for having allowed the legislation on the Statute Book to slip out of kilter with the developments up to 1986.  One of the good things about the effects of this Bill must be that that area will be removed and that people who are anxious to make a living for themselves and to contribute at the same time to the economic development of the country will have an opportunity to become fully licensed and effective operators of transport in the community.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 5 which involves a new section is in the name of the Minister.  To that amendment, amendment No. 1 has been put down by Deputy Wilson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 11, before section 15, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>15.&mdash;(1)  The Minister may appoint any of his officers to be transport officers for the purposes of section 16 of this Act and may revoke any such appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Every transport officer shall be furnished with a warrant of his appointment as a transport officer and, when <Col N="619" /> exercising any power conferred by section 16 of this Act, shall, if requested by any person affected, produce the warrant to that person.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to include provision in the Bill for the enforcement of the laws relating to transport of goods by road and passenger bus.  It provides for the appointment of transport officers in my Department for the purpose of carrying out inspections in relation to road transport operations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>After subsection (2), to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) There shall be established six regional squads of transport officers for a 24 hour per day, seven days per week operation.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My amendment to the Minister's amendment No. 5 seeks to make enforcement effective.  I do not know if the full effect of enforcement could date from before the two year period lapses or after, but one of the important points made by those involved in the haulage business is that enforcement is essential, to the extent that one association in that business indicated that they were willing, if necessary, to form a fund to pay for officers.</P>
      <P>I do not think I need to go into any further detail with regard to the amendment. The idea behind the regionality is so that the operations would not take place in a certain part of the country to the neglect of other parts.  That is the thinking behind the six regional squads. The seven day a week, 24 hour a day operation is also essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered Deputy Wilson's amendment.  The establishment of regional squads of transport officers as proposed in this amendment implies the establishment of regional, administrative and supervisory units.  I am not convinced that such an arrangement would be cost effective.  Unlike other Departments, such as the Department of Social Welfare <Col N="620" /> and the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Communications does not have a regional presence.  It has been necessary to organise premises for the transport officers involved.  There is need to provide support staff on a regional basis.  This would involve increased costs. There will be full-time transport officers employed.  It will not be a question of designating someone who is working in the Department of Communications. From a purely operational aspect it would be desirable that transport officers should have a nationwide rather than a regional remit.  Experience in the enforcing of the tachograph regulations shows that it is often necessary to follow up the inspections at checkpoints by more detailed checks on the operator's premises.  These could be located in an area very far removed from the checkpoint location. Follow-up action would best be undertaken by an officer who undertook the checkpoint inspection.  I can understand Deputy Wilson's concern that the enforcement measure should be applied throughout the State.  I can assure him that that is the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the deployment strategy has not been completely devised, it is important that we should have maximum flexibility. As Deputies will appreciate, it might be very productive to concentrate the entire force in a particular area for a limited period so that a blitz type of operation would be carried out.  It might become known that a substantial number of offences were taking place in that area. It might be the most effective way to avoid evasion of checks if they were being carried out by a single officer in the area. If, as suggested by Deputy Wilson, a regional policy turned out to be the best and the most effective way of doing this, we have no hang-up about a regional system.  I am giving the various arguments whereby we would not be inclined to support this measure at present.  We are trying to make this as cost effective as possible and to have the best detection organisation.  It is valuable to have all of these operations on a nationwide basis. They can be transferred from one area to another.  There are substantial costs <Col N="621" /> involved, not only for regional offices but also in making the operation nationwide.</P>
    <P>On the question of a seven day a week, 24 hour a day operation, I do not think this would be possible with the resources available.  As well as the regional concept, this whole area would be an organisational matter.  It would not be necessary to put them in the Bill.  If this is found to be desirable and to be the most efficient way of doing it as regards the working hours and the disposition of the officers who will be carrying out the work, there is nothing to stop it from being done in an organisational manner.  We will endeavour to have enforcement as extensive as possible.  I am ruling out operations outside the normal hours, subject to financial and personnel constraints.  It would quickly become known if the operation did not take place or if it took place within strict time limitations.  In that way the desire to get everybody within the law would be frustrated to a limited extent.  We will learn from experience, and working arrangements will be kept under review in consultation with the Garda to ensure that the new measures are as effective as possible.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment has a number of desirable traits.  I am a great advocate of decentralisation and of moving as many of the activities as we can into provincial areas.  In this case it could militate against effective operation. Therefore I appeal to the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.  One thing in the Deputy's amendment which appealed to me very much was the absolute necessity for the occasional blitz operation in the early stages to ensure that any area where there might be constant and regular transgressions of the new legislation would be thoroughly checked out.  The effect of a blitz operation would ensure that people in other areas might be afraid of a similar comb out.  While they might be able to circumvent the tic-tac operation or the passing along of one type of operation or another and while they might be able to circumvent a single person seeking to enforce the law, it would be very much more difficult for them to evade the presence <Col N="622" /> of the entire force of transport officers in any one area.</P>
    <P>I accept the thinking behind the idea of the 24 hour a day, seven day a week operation.  Work will have to take place outside the normal working hours. Nobody can accept it as a nine to five operation.  The enforcement of the law, whether through the activities of a transport officer in conjunction with the Garda or by the Garda themselves, cannot be on the basis of office hours.  Unfortunately, people who wish to break the law do not operate within office hours.  Therefore, the officials who are trying to counteract that must be available outside those hours.  Generally speaking if it is found that the contents of amendments put forward by Deputies are desirable, they can be incorporated without being included in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Nuclear Energy Board have advised me that, should a nuclear accident occur which would have significant radiological consequences for this country, then it might be necessary to take action of a kind which was not necessary following the accident at Chernobyl.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In such an event the advice of the board would have as its basis the relevant standards and recommendations of the various competent international bodies in the field of radiological protection such as the International Commission for Radiological Protection and the European Community.  Broadly speaking there are two levels of dose at which counter measures should be introduced. These levels are not precise but are ranges of projected dose based on local monitoring.  Should the projected dose for the duration of the accident which, if averaged over a year would exceed five millisieverts/(mSv), sheltering might be recommended together with the distribution of iodine.  Should the projected dose exceed 50m Sv then evacuation would be considered.  The precise point at which the two main counter measures would be <Col N="624" /> executed would depend on local conditions.</P>
    <P>If emergency procedures were being put in hand children and pregnant women would be given preference and priority.</P>
    <P>I understand that 3,500 Civil Defence wardens are particularly trained in the use of field monitoring instruments for high level radiation and in wartime operations such as the evacuation of contaminated areas.  Consideration is being given to adapting this training to other types of emergencies such as serious contamination from a nuclear reactor accident.</P>
    <P>I am also having all other relevant matters coming within the area of the Deputy's question comprehensively examined by the relevant Departments and agencies with a view to maximising the effectiveness of our preparations for disasters of this kind.  I must emphasise, however, that the causes of any such disasters and the determinants of their nature and intensity are not within the control of this State.</P>
    <P>Emergency planning must only be considered as a secondary line of defence. The primary protection of the public lies in good engineering design and good plant safety procedures.  The emphasis must be on full and proper monitoring of nuclear installations and the prevention of nuclear accidents.  This is why the Government have emphasised the need for an independent nuclear inspection force, and are pursuing this matter vigorously.</P>

Is the Minister aware that it was impossible for the NEB to give atmospheric radiation levels for areas other than Dublin and Valentia because they were the only places where samples were taken?  Is the Minister aware that there is serious concern about the fact that the NEB had adopted 1,000 becquerels per litre as the maximum allowable level for milk while the European Commission had adopted a figure of 500 becquerels per litre?  Is the Minister aware of the serious concern of biological scientists about the effects on the health <Col N="625" /> of the population of a buildup of radioactivity in the food chain as evidenced by a study carried out by Norman Lansdell of Columbia River in the US where what was termed as an insignificant amount of radioactivity in the water led to a level of radioactivity in plant that was 2,000 times greater, a level in fish that was 15,000 times greater and a level in ducks that was 40,000 times greater than the level in the water?

      <P>I should like to assure the Deputy that I will make as much information as possible available to the public.  The concern he has expressed was expressed in no uncertain manner during the immediate aftermath of the Chernobyl incident.  I have had discussions with the Nuclear Energy Board and reviews are taking place within my Department as to the effectiveness of the whole operation. Later, in reply to other questions, I will be dealing with the staffing of the board and the resources available to them.  I should like to inform the Deputy that we have to distinguish between the level of radioactivity and the amount of the dose. The latter is very important and the Deputy should keep that in mind.  I am satisfied from the monitoring that took place in the aftermath of the Chernobyl incident that the necessary safety procedures were invoked by the Nuclear Energy Board.

Will the Minister inform the House of the efficiency of the methods and equipment used here for testing the levels of radiation in the air, the water, milk and food <Col N="626" /> as compared with that used in other countries?  How often are these sampled to monitor radiation in the environment under normal circumstances?  Is the Minister aware of the comment of a former chairman of the NEB to the effect that random samples should be taken on a daily basis?  Will the Minister provide the NEB with the resources to do so?</P>

If the Deputy is concerned about specific points &mdash; for example, in relation to the efficiency of the instruments being used here <i>vis-à-vis</i> those in operation in other countries &mdash; I am not in a position to clarify them now but I was satisfied with the level of monitoring.  Monitoring is an ongoing process and is carried out on a regular basis irrespective of disasters or incidents such as the Chernobyl incident. I am satisfied from the monitoring that no danger exists in relation to radiation here.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that a major part of the problem here was that, notwithstanding the various statements and counter-statements issued by various agencies, the person in the street was confused at the end of the day and did not know if it was safe to let children out in the rain or if it was safe to eat the vegetables that were on sale. Will the Minister agree that more attention should be given to advising the public about mundane, everyday matters of that nature?  Will the Minister assure the House that, in the event of it becoming necessary to issue iodine tablets in an emergency on a countrywide basis, they will be available for distribution?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the first part of Deputy Taylor's question, if it was considered at any time that it was unsafe for children to be allowed to go out in the rain or for consumers to be consuming vegetables, a statement would have been made to that effect.  It was not necessary to make that statement.  I would have thought that until such statement was <Col N="627" /> made it was not necessary to clarify it specifically.  If the Deputy is making the point that we were not specific enough in telling people what they were and were not allowed to do, that is something that we can bear in mind.  In relation to the provision of health resources, I am sure the Government would make available to the public whatever health remedies or methods as were seen necessary in any situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that if an emergency plan existed there were no ways or means of activating it fast enough in relation to the Chernobyl disaster?  Would the Minister also accept that the Nuclear Energy Board who work ordinary office hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., in the event of a disaster at the weekend or late in the evening would not have anyone available to monitor the situation? Was that not the major contributory factor for the misleading statements which went out, that we were not in possession of the facts to be able to give them to the public?  Both the Minister and the Nuclear Energy Board differed from time to time over a matter of days as to what the reality was.  Is there an emergency plan and what are the provisions of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy as a former member of the Cabinet is aware of the emergency procedures which exist. They were revised somewhat after the great snow-in of 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>They have been revised and updated.  In a nutshell, the Department responsible for activating an emergency plan are the Department with responsibility in the area concerned.  In this case the Department of Energy were the Department involved.  An emergency plan does exist.  In relation to Deputy Reynold's remark that the Nuclear Energy Board work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. I assume that in normal situations they have regular working hours but I can <Col N="628" /> assure the Deputy that in the aftermath of the Chernobyl incident they were working far greater hours than the normal office hours.  I can verify that by the fact that on the Sunday week after the incident the Nuclear Energy Board were in contact with me at my home in Tralee during the afternoon at about 5.30 p.m. to inform me of the levels of radioactivity in some of the samples they had analysed.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of criticism proffered in the direction of the Nuclear Energy Board but I can say from my experience in working with the officials and the scientists of the NEB in the last number of weeks that they have given of their best.  A lot of personal and psychical strain was placed on them because of limited resources etc.  I could not fault any of the officials in the assistance they gave me and my officials and that was by night and by day.  They worked very hard and much of the criticism was unfair.  It was being made by people who were not aware of the efforts that were being made, of the long hours which were being put in or of the sampling that was going on.  I know that when I asked for assistance at any time of the day or night, the scientists and officials involved, at great personal inconvenience, were available and willing to come in to do the sampling.</P>

      <P>We have not had an unsafe level of radiation in the past number of weeks.  I am not going to claim to be an expert in this area but experts differ on what are acceptable levels.  We have to take the best guidance we can get both from within Europe and worldwide in relation to safety in this area.  The nuclear industry by its very nature poses a serious threat particularly in relation to health levels and the lack of information we have had in the past.  I am quite confident in stating to this House that we have not had any health hazards that we are aware of in the past number of weeks.  We can only say that on the basis of the monitoring that was done throughout the country.</P>

      <P>While the sentiments expressed by the Minister are laudable in relation to the members of the Nuclear Energy Board, that is poor consolation in the matter of the occurrence of a disaster. I would like to ask the Minister if he would agree that the response and information coming from the NEB is quite inadequate as has been proved by the answers to these questions?  Can the Minister correct the impression he gave to the House on 29 April when he stated that the NEB in conjunction with the meteorological service have an air monitoring programme which would indicate any airborne contamination?  We know that the meteorologial service monitor <Col N="630" /> rain samples and it is precisely the fact that air samples were only taken at two points in the country that has led to such concern over the efficiency of our system for monitoring radiation levels in the air.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In the area of radiation, radioactivity and the whole nuclear industry it is very difficult to be able to reassure people 100 per cent because there are those among the public who will not accept any reassurance from a layman not to mind an expert and I am not claiming for one moment to be an expert in this area.  I am satisfied that any of the statements I have made in relation to this affair I can stand over having regard to the information which was available to me.  I am satisfied that the monitoring we were doing was adequate. With the review taking place we will be well positioned if there is a repeat of this incident.  Let us hope that there will not be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he is aware of the very considerable savings accruing to the ESB in respect of exchange rate improvements; the low cost of oil and coal; the amounts of those savings; and the plans he has to ensure the benefits are passed on to the consumers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if his Department have an estimate on the reduction in the price of electricity as a result of the increased use <Col N="631" /> of coal in electricity generation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that significant savings are accruing to the ESB from exchange rate improvements and fuel prices.  I announced reductions in electricity prices arising from these savings in the House on 11 March.  I am keeping the question of possible further reductions under review.  It would not be appropriate to provide a breakdown of savings under individual headings especially since the price reductions were based on net savings after taking all other relevant factors into account.  Furthermore, the figures for individual headings fluctuate frequently in response to both international price and currency movements and fuel consumption choices.  All relevant developments are monitored on a continuous basis.  As I have stated previously, the total cost of the price reductions which I announced is estimated at £30 million this year and at least £36 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why the Minister cannot give some of the facts which were asked for in this question.  First of all, let me put to him a straight question in relation to savings on the foreign borrowings in dollars to the ESB.  It has been well established over the last six months what the depreciation of the dollar has been.  On average it would probably come out somewhere in the region of 30 per cent.  I cannot understand why a straight question such as that cannot be answered by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Even since the date of the reduction various fluctuations have taken place and to attempt to estimate the effect would be quite misleading because of the constantly changing position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking back over the last six months, would the Minister accept that any changes that have taken place would make for an improvement on the figures he gave earlier this year? <Col N="632" /> I find it unacceptable that the Minister cannot give me a reply to one item on the list I gave to him, that is, the savings in the devaluation of the dollar against the púnt.  That is a straightforward question and the information should be available. If it is not available I can only assume that if the Minister gave those facts it would be clearly shown that the benefits accruing are not being passed on to the consumer and are not being adequately provided for in price reductions given to industrial and commercial consumers in the past month or two.  Housewives will have to wait until September before they get any reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the plausability of the question put by the Deputy, I am not inclined to accept his proposal.  The decision that was announced on 11 March was the correct one at that time.  I said on a number of occasions since that if further improvements take place they will manifest themselves in a further reduction in the price of electricity.  We had a Private Members' Motion on this topic and I outlined in detail the reason for weighting the reduction in favour of the industrial area because of our lack of competitiveness in industrial costs.  I explained in great detail why the ESB had targeted the reductions in that area. The domestic consumers will be getting the benefit of the reductions in September. If further benefits accrue they will manifest themselves.  If present trends continue we can look forward to further reductions in electricity prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way I can monitor on behalf of the consumers and the taxpayers is by the information given in reply to my questions.  I am asking for the facts and I can weigh that against the reductions the ESB will offer.  In the absence of that information, because of the Minister's unwillingness to disclose it, I have to assume there have been very substantial savings that are not being passed on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to steer the Deputy in the proper direction.  He may not listen <Col N="633" /> to my advice, but he is making an incorrect assumption.  As a former Minister for Energy, the Deputy is well aware of the ESB balance sheet and the considerations that have to be taken account of. There is the balancing of the commercial and domestic interests by the ESB.  That is being done in the best interests of both the ESB and the consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give a timetable for the increased use of coal in electricity generation?  Does the reduction in oil prices in any way affect the ESB timetable for use of more coal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision by the ESB to put a major concentration on coal at Moneypoint will not be affected by current trends in oil prices.  Coal usage is about 60 per cent, and the reduction in price achieved was by virtue of the coal content of the fuel package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that 63 per cent of Ireland's electricity is now generated by oil and that in the last year there has been a 30 per cent to 40 per cent fall in the price of petroleum?  Putting those two figures together, will the Minister accept that the rather miserly figure of £30 million passed on to the consumer is only a fraction of what would have been possible?  Does he accept that the real solution is to restructure the ESB's balance sheet, which is now showing total borrowings of more than £1,000 million?  The real job is to restructure that balance sheet and pass on the 30 per cent to 40 per cent fall to the consumers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister if he had made a specific statement in public.  I do not want to hear what the newspapers reported.  Did the Minister make a specific statement in public that he would reply in public?  They were Government appointed directors.  The chairman and three directors resigned and criticised the handling of Dublin Gas problems.  They made their criticisms in public and the Minister made a public statement in Killarney saying he would reply to them in public.  Is there some reason why he did not reply in public?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he will publish a future gas allocation policy in view of the fact that the usage by the ESB is expected to fall by a third in 1986 and 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to publish a revised allocation policy at this time. The objective of Government allocation strategy remains the exploitation of the natural gas resource so as to maximise the benefit to the economy as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position regarding the supply of natural gas to the ESB is that, at the board's request, its gas allocation was rescheduled so as to enable it to take the <Col N="636" /> bulk of the allocation by the end of 1987, when the Moneypoint project would be operational.  It was always recognised, therefore, that gas takes by the ESB would drop from this year on.</P>
    <P>An examination of the long term development of the gas industry is underway and depletion strategy for the balance of the reserves will be decided in the light of this review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the allocation of natural gas last year was, 65 per cent to the ESB, 22 per cent to NET, 8 per cent to Dublin Gas, 1 per cent to the Cork Gas Company and about 4 per cent to industrial users? Are those figures roughly correct and would he agree that the fall-off from the ESB will be one-third lower in 1986 than 1985 and in 1986-87 there will be another one-third reduction, so that by the end of 1987 it will be a zero allocation to the ESB?  What plans has he to market the additional gas that is there to be sold? Will he accept that there will be a drastic reduction in Exchequer revenue from An Bord Gáis as a result of the big drop-off in demand by the ESB?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures used by the former Minister for Energy seem, by and large, to be accurate.  However, since the Deputy left office certain discussions have taken place with the ESB in relation to future usage.  I do not believe the drop-off in ESB usage will be as large as the Deputy mentioned.  At present discussions are under way between my Department and the ESB in relation to the allocation for next year and future years, but at this stage it would be premature to be more specific because a final decision has not been taken in relation to the amount of future gas allocations to the ESB.  That decision will not be made until the current allocation policy review has been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason there may not be such a large drop-off as I indicated &mdash; approximately one-third in 1986 and one-third in 1987 &mdash; is that Moneypoint is due to come on-stream.  Will the Minister <Col N="637" /> confirm that Moneypoint is on schedule and that the various stages will come on-stream as indicated earlier?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it will be as much as that, but obviously it is not possible to give concrete figures until the discussions have been completed with the ESB and until the allocation policy review has been completed. The other obvious consideration is that the ESB have the gas-powered stations and they are a national asset.  We should ensure we can use them in the overall energy programme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Tests conducted by the Nuclear Energy Board have shown that there is no necessity for concern about the consumption of the vegetables in Ireland as a result of the fall-out following the accident at Chernobyl and there is no need for any special procedures outside normal culinary preparation.</P>
      <P>The board have advised that to date, analysis carried out on a variety of vegetable types grown out of doors in locations around Ireland has shown that levels are very low and do not represent any significant hazard to health.  These levels are well within maximum EC recommended limits and are declining. Vegetables grown under glass or clothes in Ireland were not subject to any fall-out contamination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> To ensure that contaminated vegetables which could be a health hazard were not sold in Ireland, the Nuclear Energy Board conducted tests on vegetables being imported from all European countries at point of entry. Arrangements were made for any produce showing an unacceptable level of contamination to be impounded.  The EC ban which came into effect on 13 May and which prohibited the import into member states of fresh vegetables from seven eastern European countries was applied in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board have at all times kept the public informed on this matter.  As a reassurance to the public and as a safety precaution, testing of vegetables will continue and the public will be kept informed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I ask my supplementary question, I wish to point out that originally the question was tabled to the Minister for Agriculture.  At that stage that Minister should have made a statement in relation to the matter.  Will the Minister for Energy state if he is aware of a statement issued by the Nuclear Energy Board and if he accepts that it had an impact on the demand for the sale of Irish tomatoes in the market place and in retail outlets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to assess the impact of any statement on individual shopkeepers on the eastern or on the western seaboard.  The statements made were based on a factual assessment of the situation and on the knowledge available to the Nuclear Energy Board and they were on behalf of the Department of Energy and the Government. The statements were made to allay <Col N="641" /> public fears.  They were correct statements and were in the best interests of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that when the Nuclear Energy Board first made the statement they could have made clear that the danger of tomatoes being affected by radiation was considerably less than outdoor vegetables because the tomatoes were grown in glasshouses or in plastic tunnels?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy the EC grants and ESB support available for hydropower; and the savings on imported fuels each year if hydropower were further developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>At present the only grants available for the development of hydropower are from the EC's energy demonstration scheme.  This demonstration scheme provides for grants of up to 40 per cent towards the cost of energy projects including hydro projects, demonstrating a new energy technique, process or product or a novel application of a known technology.  Applications for grants are invited on an annual basis.  The final date for submitting applications for grant assistance under the 1986 scheme was 29 April last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a report of a survey of Ireland's hydro resources commissioned by my Department, the potential installed capacity of the hydro sites listed amount to 38 MW &mdash; megawatts &mdash; with an estimated annual output of 193,500 MWh &mdash;<Col N="644" /> megawatt hours.  Therefore, if all of these sites were developed and operated, the annual potential for savings on imported fuel oil could be up to 50,000 tonnes.  The development of any of these sites would, of course, be a matter of individual initiative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Has any consideration been given to the fact that in Northern Ireland hydropower turbines have been able to get markets in places as far away as California? Have the Department considered giving grants to have turbines manufactured here for sale on those markets?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, we will give up to 40 per cent towards the cost of energy projects, including hydro projects, demonstrating any new energy technique, process or product or a novel application of a known technology.  If the Deputy has any particular applicant or example in mind, perhaps he would let me know because I would like to give every assistance.

My officials, my Minister of State, who is taking a great interest in this area, and myself will be as helpful as possible where there is any potential for developing hydro projects.

That is in stark contrast to the statement the Minister has just made.  In this case the United States Naval Academy came to their assistance.

      <P>Since I became Minister for Energy I have taken a personal interest in the possibility of a zinc smelter being built in this country, particularly as one of the most suitable locations for such a smelter would be in Ballylongford, County Kerry.  However, it does not seem possible at this time and I have not heard anything to change the current commercial view in relation to a zinc smelter.  Circumstances have changed since the original assessment in 1976-77 of the possibilities of a zinc smelter being established here.  If proposals in that direction are made I assure the Deputy that the Government will consider them favourably because that would be of benefit with other factors being correct. Many factors must be taken into account, but I assure the Deputy that personally and politically I would be very much in favour of a zinc smelter being built in this country.</P>

In view of the fact that he is not prepared to answer that question, let me ask, since it is ten years since the last detailed investigation was done in regard to a smelter, if he believes that now, ten years later, with the various changes he has mentioned as taking place, it is reasonable that a further feasibility study should be done?</P>

If that is the case then the Government obviously will take a positive view of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy in regard to alternative sources of energy is to assess the potential of these sources and where appropriate to encourage their further development.  The main emphasis of the current programme funded through my Department is on the assessment of the potential of wind-power and on encouragement of the development of hydro power.  However, attention has also been given to other possible alternative energy sources, for example wave, solar &mdash; both active and passive &mdash; biomass and geothermal energy, and grants have been made available for Irish research projects in these areas.</P>
      <P>Individuals or bodies in Ireland can apply, and indeed have with some success applied, for grants under the EC Commission's Energy Research and Demonstration programmes.</P>
      <P>While it is necessary at all times to assess rigorously the benefits achieved by these expenditures, I believe that it will be in the national interest to continue this programme in some form in the years ahead.  While changes in the prices and availability of more common energy forms must obviously be taken into account, the longer term perspective relating to the alternatives to which the questions relate is probably still as relevant as it was some years ago.</P>

I believe, and the Government support the view, that we should, where possible try to maintain the level of funding available for these projects, and with the assistance of my Minister of State I will be endeavouring to ensure that funding is available in 1987 to continue with the experimental projects which have taken place and which we hope to encourage.</P>

      <P>Regarding hydro, following a competition for the design and construction of small scale hydro installations held by the Department of Energy in late 1980 and 1981, 13 projects were grant aided to the value of £98,800.  In October 1985 the report on the national hydro resource survey was announced and my Department have been asked to draw up guidelines for the establishment of a new scheme to promote the demonstration of small scale hydro developments.  The <Col N="652" /> Deputy will be aware that we have published a report on the national hydro resource survey indicating that over 3,500 sites were identified as suitable for development of hydro projects.  That report was published in October 1985 at a price of £10.  The Deputy also inquired about wind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1980 the Department initiated a wind power demonstration programme.  The Department erected eight wind turbines in co-operation with other bodies.  The purpose of the programme was to maximise the efficiency of these wind turbines and to establish the best energy costs that can be obtained from these machines.  The machines cover a range of sizes, locations and uses.  In 1984 the Department signed a contract with the EC in respect of a wind energy demonstration project under which the EC agreed to provide £158,000 over two and a half years.  This money is being used towards the cost of monitoring the performance of five of these machines together with carrying out routine maintenance and any modifications considered necessary.  The early results of the wind power programme indicate that it is difficult and expensive to maintain some of these machines in working condition and in some cases the isolated locations cause problems with regard to servicing and obtaining parts.  The items being monitored include the output from windmill, wind direction, wind speed at two different heights, air temperatures etc.  It is hoped to have some results by the summer of this year, but for a variety of reasons, for example, problems with the monitoring equipment and computer programmes together with down time with some of the windmills, results are not expected now until 1987.  The eight windmills are located at Inis Oirr in County Galway, Ballyferriter in County Kerry, Sligo, Ballinamore in County Leitrim, Fermoy in County Cork, Creash in County Mayo, Kinsealy in County Dublin &mdash; take note &mdash; and Malin Head, County Donegal.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17, and priority Question No. 27 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is aware that the Attorney General has advised that the EC Commission has competence under the <Col N="654" /> Euratom Treaty to set up an inspection force to examine the safety of nuclear installations.  A number of separate discussions with Commissioner Clinton Davis have been held at which the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Boland, TD, the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy E. Collins, TD and I have strongly expressed the Government's view that such an inspection force should be established.  This view was also expressed by the Taoiseach to the UK Prime Minister and the matter has been raised at various international fora.</P>
    <P>The Government's request for the establishment of an inspection force was formally conveyed to Commissioner Clinton Davis by the Irish Ambassador, Permanent Representative in Brussels on 11 April 1986.  The ambassador again wrote to the Commissioner on 15 May indicating that concern in regard to nuclear safety had greatly increased in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster and that this accident reinforced the need for an impartial international inspectorate. The Commissioner replied to the Ambassador on 21 May 1986 acknowledging the formal Irish request for the establishment of a Community Health and Safety Inspection Force under Chapter III of the Euratom Treaty.  He indicated, among other things, that Commission officials are looking into the request and that they will be contacting the Attorney General's office to organise a meeting between legal experts to discuss the matter further.</P>
    <P>The question of a European inspection force has trans-national implications. Therefore, the Government consider it appropriate that it should be raised with the European Commission in the context of the Euratom Treaty rather than with any individual member state.</P>
    <P>On the question of accidents or incidents at British nuclear installations, the UK Government informed the Nuclear Energy Board of 11 accidents or incidents which have occurred since October 1985 at nuclear installations in the UK.  The incident at Dungeness on 31 March 1986 was notified.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy that we have not got very far; it is a matter of judgment.  Procedures have been put in place for the matter to be dealt with by the European Commission. We have adopted the correct procedures and we must now await the outcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We should concentrate on the processing of our request for the independent inspectorate and it is the Government's intention to ensure that the matter is dealt with as quickly as possible by the European Commission.  I believe that, in the wake of the decision by the EC, other matters with regard to the attitude of the British Government in the case of Sellafield or other Governments in Europe in relation to their nuclear installations should be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is probably as aware as I am of the attitude of the British Government which is that they are taking adequate precautions and safety procedures in this matter.  However, as has been stated on many occasions in the House, given the number of incidents which have taken place in Sellafield &mdash; only one of the plants concerned &mdash; we need to know more about safety procedures regarding the obsolescence of such <Col N="656" /> plants.  We have stated our concern in this regard to the British Government and have told them about the lack of confidence not just at parliamentary level but among the public.  We want to see the British Government taking action and obviously we would prefer them to take a positive action in relation to our request to the EC.  However, we should not anticipate that decision and we will have to assess what action we propose when a response from the Commission is received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It now seems very clear that the British Government will not respond in a positive way because they do not want anyone to interfere with their nuclear industry.  Does the Minister agree that under the Euratom Treaty there is no authority for setting up the type of inspectorate to which we referred today and that the only authority under that Treaty is to set up an auditing system for the raw materials used in the nuclear industry?  Does he also agree that there is a distinct difference between that and setting up an inspectorate who can freely inspect safety standards and so on relating to the industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The advice available to the Government is that we are perfectly within our rights under Chapter III of the Euratom Treaty in asking the European Commission to establish a community health and safety inspection force to deal with the matters referred to.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that an interdepartmental committee were established on 30 April 1986 in the wake of the Chernobyl nuclear accident.  They made use of existing structures such as the Nuclear Energy Board, Civil Defence and the Meteorological Service to put into operation an immediate system of monitoring of levels of radioactivity in milk, vegetables and water.  The results of this continuous monitoring enabled the board to advise the public that radioactivity in these foodstuffs and in the atmosphere were within acceptable levels.  The committee also quickly established that there were adequate stocks of powdered <Col N="658" /> milk and iodine available in case of an emergency, which fortunately did not arise.  A system was put in train to notify the Nuclear Energy Board, in advance, of ship and plane arrivals from East European countries so that they and their cargoes could be monitored for radioactivity.  Foodstuffs from seven East European countries were banned under an EC regulation.  Monitoring of foodstuffs originating in other countries was also put in place.  All these monitoring procedures will continue for so long as is necessary.</P>
    <P>On the basis of this experience our preparations for coping with nuclear accidents are being stepped up and any further requirements of the Nuclear Energy Board will be examined.  The interdepartmental committee are considering in particular what further measures might be necessary in the event of nuclear accidents with more serious consequences for this country.</P>
    <P>Hopefully another serious nuclear accident can be avoided.  That is why the Government have placed such emphasis on the need for an independent nuclear inspection force.  The emphasis must be on the full and proper monitoring of nuclear installations and the prevention of nuclear accidents.</P>

      <P>The interdepartmental committee was established on 30 April. The Nuclear Energy Board worked through the following weekend analysing air and rain water samples which had been taken by the Meteorological Office. The testing of milk samples commenced immediately and the first samples were available on Sunday morning.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy the purpose of retaining a receiver at Dublin Gas Company in view of his statement that all creditors, secured and unsecured, will be paid in full; if he will give the cost of the receivership to date; and if he is considering the appointment of an administrator to run the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my statement in reply to his private notice question on 23 April last wherein I said that the objective of the receivership is to maintain the business as a going concern without interruption of supply and to put it on a viable footing.  The payment of creditors is a separate issue and I made my position on this clear on the same occasion.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to give the cost of receivership to date as the receiver has not yet completed his assessment of the situation in the company.</P>
      <P>The answer to the third part of the Deputy's question is no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the role of the receiver?  I am sure the Minister will agree that a receiver is appointed on the basis of a debenture or representing a particular creditor &mdash; in this case it was Dublin Gas.  The Minister has said that all creditors, secured and unsecured, will be paid.  In the light of that I suggest that the receiver has no further role to play. An administrator should have been appointed and not a receiver.  The appointment of a receiver could lead to very serious legal actions being taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Where proper claims exist they will be met.  The Deputy is well aware that the objective of the receivership was to maintain the business as a going concern and ensure the continuous supply of natural gas to all customers. This has been happening.  On 22 April the Government said the company would <Col N="661" /> be nationalised without prejudice to possible participation by workers and consumers. That is the situation, as I have already explained to the Deputy on three occasions.</P>

    <Title>Road Transport Bill, 1985 [Seanad]: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Amendment No. 5:</P>
    <P>In page 11, before section 15, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>15.&mdash;(1)  The Minister may appoint any of his officers to be transport officers for the purposes of section 16 of this Act and may revoke any such appointment.</P>
    <P>(2)  Every transport officer shall be furnished with a warrant of his appointment as a transport officer and, when exercising any power conferred by section 16 of this Act, shall, if requested by any person affected, produce the warrant to that person.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister of State at the Department of Communications.)</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 5:</P>
    <P>After subsection (2), to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  There shall be established six regional squads of transport officers for a 24 hour per day, seven days per week operation.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Wilson.)</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with section 15 and my amendment to the Minister's amendment.  The Minister indicated that the squad of transport officers he would have at his disposal might be deployed on a regional basis concentrating on different areas.  I prefer my version of the amendment with specified dates and hours.  The Minister, whether advertently or inadvertently, mentioned that he would not have the resources available to him for that eventuality. That is what inspired fear in the hauliers and gave rise to them making strong representations to ensure there would be an efficient, full-time group or squad of officers dealing with enforcement.</P>
      <P>As I said before Question Time, one association felt so strongly about this that they were prpared to collect annual subscriptions to pay for it.  This would not be desirable.  There is an obligation on us, on the Minister and his Department to carry out enforcement efficiently.  The Minister's amendment indicates a desire to do that but the framework is not as good as the one I suggest.  I would add that whatever day the Minister chooses to nominate as day one of this effort, he will probably have difficulties.  We adverted to this before Question Time.  There was what I would call a grey area which this Bill is designed to clear up.  There will be a problem of adjustment as there will also be in the business in general with regard to supply and demand.  But an efficient, effective and full time transport officers squad is needed when they go all out in their campaign.  That of course would be a matter for the Minister to decide.  That is my amendment to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I replied at very great length before the adjournment of the debate on this matter.  I have sought to respond to the various points made by Deputy Wilson.  Even if we were to have <Col N="688" /> a regional disposition of the people specifically involved in this, the transport officers, it would be unnecessary to write it into the legislation.  Equally, as far as working seven days a week and 24 hours a day is concerned, all I can say is that the intention in this is to have a very vigorous enforcement of the law to make sure that the difficulties that have occurred in the past will cease.  I believe this will be done and that there will be a lot of goodwill on the part of the legal operators to ensure that the breaching of the law does not continue.  As Deputy Wilson said, it would be undesirable to have a situation whereby the funding of the enforcement of the law was done by a section of the people legally operating within the system.  Naturally, there is no question of that.</P>
      <P>On the Deputy's amendment, I believe that it would not lead to a more satisfactory implementation of the law.  Indeed I am convinced that there are elements in it which would make it very difficult to exercise the blitz operation which will be necessary from time to time.  When I refer to the cost, I mean the knock-on effect which the setting up of regional offices and the back-up being provided would have.  I am not by any means against a regional disposition of the transport offices at some stage if that is thought to be the most efficient and cost effective way of carrying out what is required by the legislation that we are now passing and the other Acts that already exist. However, that having been said, all of these things can be done as an operational matter subsequently by the Minister, and it is unnecessary to write them into the legislation.  Therefore I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I have an objection, which I foreshadowed already, to this amendment. I indicated that the first time the House saw the word &ldquo;omnibus&rdquo; in the context of this Bill was in this amendment. The Minister, Deputy Mitchell, may have referred to it on Second Stage. It is out of place here and for that reason, among other reasons, I am opposing it. We dealt with road haulage, regulations with regard to trucks and lorries and their weight and the licensing of hauliers. Almost surreptitiously the word &ldquo;omnibus&rdquo; was inserted in this amendment, not having been in the original Bill. It is inappropriate because we did not debate or tease out the implications as far as coaches and omnibuses are concerned. As the section gives considerable powers to the transport officers, the House should reject the amendment.  No legislation has been brought to the House to regulate the operation of private coaches and omnibuses.  That legislation must come, particularly as there is a Bill before the Seanad at present dealing with the restructuring of Córas Iompair Éireann. The House should reject this amendment which, in my opinion, is not <i>ultra vires</i> in any way and which gives powers to the transport officers which they will need. As the word &ldquo;omnibus&rdquo; is included in a number of the subsections this vitiates the whole amendment and consequently I oppose it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment will put a new section in the Bill.  This new section will be in the Bill when and if this amendment is passed.  That will be section 16 of the Bill.  It is very important that the powers of transport officers should extend to the carriage of passengers in buses.  Everyone will accept &mdash; and it is not an issue in the challenge to this amendment &mdash; that the safety of passengers is of vital importance.  The EC expressed concern about the number of accidents involving coaches.  They specifically asked member states to increase inspection on buses under the tachograph regulations, the administration of which already comes under the responsibility of the Minister for Communications.  The tachograph laws are being enforced by the existing tachograph inspectors in relation to buses.  The Minister for Communications also has responsibility for administering the legislation in relation to the licensing of passenger road services. This comes under the Road Transport Act, 1932.  It requires updating and is being looked at at the moment.</P>
      <P>The Minister also has responsibility for administering legislation in relation to the occupation of road passenger transport operator, the EC requirements of good repute, sound financial standing and professional competence.  All persons engaged in the carriage of persons for reward in vehicles constructed to carry more than nine persons, including the driver, must satisfy EC requirements.  It would be illogical to think that the transport officers now being appointed should not have power to inquire into the manner in which legislation as regards buses is implemented.  To have a separate set of officials involved in the enforcement area, such as transport officers, exclusively for buses and another group to deal exclusively with transport vehicles with carrier licences would not be a very cost-effective way to operate.  It would not be an efficient way of ensuring that the law of the land is upheld.  It would lead to duplication and cause extra problems for the gardaí accompanying the transport officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the question of resources for <Col N="694" /> this service does not arise very often and that the number of officials appointed will be sufficient to carry out inspections. There is an obligation on us to make the best possible use of the finance given to us.  We should appoint as many transport officers as possible.  Our work should be organised in such a way as to get the best return for the money allocated.  The officials will be enforcing EC regulations. The new section will be beneficial for the proper organisation and implementation of the legislation before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made three points: safety, duplication and problems for gardaí.  I agree with him in regard to the importance of safety for those who use coaches and those involved in the road haulage business.  The root of my objection is the timing.  Without any attempt being made to update the legislation on private coach operators &mdash; this is a thriving sector of the road transport business because we have been left behind by developments &mdash; the Minister in the amendment is including coaches. He has not attempted to update the legislation on private coaches that operate throughout the country, particularly at weekends although he is well aware of what is going on.</P>
      <P>I did not imply in my amendment that there should be extra and different transport inspectors employed for the inspection of coaches.  The Minister should update the legislation in regard to coaches and, if he wishes, he should bring them under the new transport officers. The third point made by the Minister related to the work of the Garda.  That work will fall into place if the legislation is updated.  I find it strange that the word I have complained about is included at this late stage particularly when it was not envisaged as part of the Bill at the outset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Bus operators must conform with a number of regulations under the 1932 Act.  They must conform with regulations under the European Communities Act, for example, the tachograph regulation.  We must have <Col N="695" /> inspections of those buses.  We cannot allow buses to go without inspection until such time as the legislation is updated. Buses are already subject to inspection in regard to the tachograph and the hours of drivers and when the legislation is passed it will be possible for the transport officers of the Department to see to it that all regulations are being complied with.  We are not imposing any new regulations or suggesting that bus operators must conform to a more difficult regime. Any changes will have to be made through legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are proposing the most cost-effective system to enforce existing regulations in regard to road freight and buses. <Col N="696" /> There have been demands on the Department in regard to buses and it would be foolish to go through the House with this Bill without taking them into consideration.  I hope the transport officers will have the necessary resources to enable them to do their job properly. We should make it possible for them to carry out inspections on buses.  If changes need to be made in regard to the regulations on buses we will not hesitate to do so.  The House must bear in mind that we are acting under the oldest transport law we have, the 1932 Act.  I understand that a considerable amount of work has been completed in updating the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 11, before section 15, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;17.&mdash;The Minister may bring and prosecute summary proceedings for an offence under&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the Road Transport Act, 1932, the Road Transport Act, 1933, the Road Transport Act, 1935, the Transport Act, 1944, this Act and any instrument made under any of the said enactments,</P>
      <P>(b)  any regulation made by the Minister under the European Communities Act, 1972, relating to the carriage of goods by road or the carriage of passengers by omnibus, and</P>
      <P>(c) any enactment or any instrument made under any enactment relating to the carriage of goods by road or the carriage of passengers by omnibus or to any vehicle or class of vehicle engaged in such carriage as may be specified by order under section 18 (1) (b) of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment empowers the Minister to prosecute offences under specified legislation.  The Minister may take summary proceedings for offences referred to in section 6 in relation to the carriage of goods by road and of road passengers in buses, including legislation administered by other Ministers where an order has been made after consultation with any other Minister concerned specifying the legislation in question.  This means that the Minister can prosecute offences detected by transport officers under the powers of inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat what I said on the previous amendment that I am at one with the Minister in what he is trying to do to protect passengers and provide a structure for the enforcement of the law but, for the same reason I gave when opposing the last amendment, I am opposing this one.  In my view, in the absence of legislation with regard to coach operators, the inclusion at a late stage of this amendment, bearing in mind that it was not in the original Bill, vitiates this amendment and the legislation of which it would be part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot emphasise strongly enough that I fully agree with the general purpose of the amendment but I do not like the way the amendment has been introduced, <Col N="699" /> late in the day to cover coach operators.  I do not like it at all in the absence of an up-dating of the legislation on coach operators.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in reply to the previous amendment that it was intended to up-date the legislation, and he referred back to the 1932-33 legislation.  That, in itself, proves my point that the Legislature has not kept in step with developments in the transport world.  The Second Stage speeches we got on all transport legislation indicated that the purpose was to up-date the law.  That legislation served its purpose at a time when different premises were true of the whole transport system, but using ancient premises and drawing modern conclusions is what we are doing here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally I would prefer to have Deputy Wilson's agreement rather than his opposition because the best way to get legislation of this nature through is by agreement, if possible. What Deputy Wilson is trying to attain is, broadly speaking, what I am trying to get.  Unfortunately, that is not possible in this amendment as it was not possible in the previous amendment.  I have no reason to doubt the logic of the points I put forward in reply to Deputy Wilson on the previous amendment.  I said this is the proper way to proceed.  This amendment follows from the previous one. &ldquo;Passengers by omnibuses&rdquo; is a phrase which will be part of the section that will follow on the acceptance of this amendment. It is right to introduce this power for transport officers to deal with buses as with other road traffic.  Responsibility for administering the tachograph system is already with the Department of Communications, or inspectors from that Department, and there would be unnecessary duplication and it would lead to an unwieldy system in future to have two Departments dealing with similar offences.  It would increase the cost to have two separate organisations in the Department dealing with the same type of offences, albeit in respect of different kinds of vehicles.  The amendment is <Col N="700" /> valid.  It flows from the other amendment that has just been accepted by the House and I hope the Deputy will accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 11, before section 15, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>18.&mdash;(1)  Subject to subsection (4) of this section, the Minister may by order&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  specify any enactment or any instrument made under any enactment for the purposes of which a transport officer may exercise any power conferred on him by section 16 of this Act,</P>
      <P>(b)  specify any enactment or any instrument made under any enactment under which the Minister may bring and prosecute summary proceedings.</P>
      <P>(2)  Subject to subsection (4) of this section, for the purposes of giving full effect to an order under subsection (1) of this section, the Minister may by order make such further provisions as are necessary including adaptation of any enactment</P>
      <P>(3)  Subject to subsection (4) of this section, the Minister may by order amend or revoke an order under subsection (1) or (2) of this section.</P>
      <P>(4)  No order shall be made under this section in relation to any enactment administered by a Minister of the Government, other than the Minister, or in relation to any instrument made under any such enactment, save following consultation with that Minister and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5)  Every order made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if a resolution <Col N="701" /> annulling the order is passed by either such House within the next twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P>This enables the Minister by order to specify legislation in the area of responsibility of other Ministers in relation to which transport officers will exercise their powers and the Minister can prosecute offences.  Consultation with other Ministers concerned and with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána will be necessary before any such order is made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There are parts of this amendment so opaque that if there were an international competition in opacity it would win.  A certain element of lunacy would be a help in trying to interpret it. The amendment refers to certain things the Minister may do by order.  I have always been very sensitive about too much power being claimed in statute law for a Minister or a Department.  Above all, I have been concerned about giving powers to a Minister to do certain things by order.  There has been criticism of much of our legislation since 1922 on the basis that it incorporated too many powers that could be exercised without coming under the full spotlight of debate and discussion in the Dáil.  I will not make an issue of that: I am just indicating that it is a cast of mind.  For example, subsection (2) of the amendment states as follows, &ldquo;...the Minister may by order make such further provisions as are necessary including adaptation of any enactment&rdquo;. That seems a very strange power.  The word &ldquo;adaptation&rdquo; in ordinary language or even in technical language is very elastic. At times it could be argued that almost the direct opposite of something could be called an adaptation of it.  The other example I give is in relation to subsection (4) of the amendment which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No order shall be made under this section in relation to any enactment administered by a Minister of the <Col N="702" /> Government, other than the Minister, or in relation to any instrument made under any such enactment, save following consultation with that Minister and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly, until the Minister read his opening remarks of clarification I had not a clue what that meant.  I think I understand what it means now but looking at the subsection coldly it seems to be unnecessarily opaque.  I understand it now in view of what the Minister said about the involvement of other Ministers and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  The subsection refers to &ldquo;any instrument made under any such enactment&rdquo;. Has the word &ldquo;instrument&rdquo; a technical meaning or does the Minister mean a statutory instrument?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 21 together.  The recoverable reserves of gas in the Kinsale Head gas field, which I presume is what Deputy Mitchell is referring to are, on the basis of current estimates, expected to last at least until the end of the century.  Obviously, however, the life expectancy of the field will ultimately be determined by the rate at which the gas is actually depleted.</P>
      <P>The Kinsale Head gas field is of course our only commercially producing field at the moment and in considering questions about the prospects of further commercial oil or gas finds offshore Ireland, one must look at the geological and engineering aspects of hydrocarbon exploration and development in our offshore.  Exploration here is still at a relatively early stage and the major sedimentary basins are only partially explored.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, we have had numerous indications of commercial hydrocarbon potential even though many of the wells drilled did not test the deeper geological horizons which are now considered to be of the greatest interest.  Furthermore, the bulk of our wells have been drilled in the Celtic Sea and Porcupine Basins.  Apart from these, only a minimal amount of exploration has taken place in the Donegal Basin, the Erris Trough, the Slyne Trough and indeed in the Kish Bank Basin where the first exploration well to be drilled since 1979 has just been spudded. From the engineering side too, our offshore presents a variable picture. Water depts vary from 200 to 300 feet off the south and east coasts to 600 to 1,000 feet or more off the west coast. Accordingly it will not be possible to determine the commerciality or otherwise of oil or gas discoveries on the basis of field size alone, without taking water depths and proximity to shore into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible, therefore, to predict with any degree of accuracy the likelihood of finding commercial oil or gas <Col N="663" /> fields either in Ireland or offshore Ireland until exploratory wells drilled have actually proved the presence of movable hydrocarbon accumulations which on appraisal and delineation are proven to be capable of sustaining production commercially. The results of seismic work carried out and of the wells drilled to date have provided for the oil exploration companies and for my Department a deeper insight into the geology of our offshore basins than hitherto obtained and certainly show that there is considerable potential in the Irish sedimentary basins for future commercial discoveries and the number of significant flows and shows of hydrocarbons from the discoveries made to date are extremely encouraging. Nonetheless, it is not possible to say as yet whether any or all of the discoveries made so far will ultimately lead to commercial developments.  The companies concerned are continuing, in consultation with my Department, their assessments of some discoveries and of the areas in the vicinity of those discoveries with a view to establishing whether or not recoverable reserves of sufficient magnitude are in-place to support commercial production.</P>
    <P>Given the increased level of drilling in our offshore this year, I believe, along with the oil companies who are going to drill exploration wells for the purpose of finding oil or gas, that new discoveries could be made.  However, the timescale for a commercial development in relation to such future discoveries would, in the first instance, depend on when the discoveries are made and proved up.</P>

      <P>One of the measures taken by the interdepartmental committee established in conjunction with the Nuclear Energy Board in the wake of the Chernobyl accident was to arrange that the NEB would be informed by Customs and Excise and by shipping agents of all cargo vessels due to arrive in Irish ports.  Between 2 and 26 May 1986 the Nuclear Energy Board were notified of 21 ships due from East European countries.  Initially all ships were docked and their cargoes were examined by the NEB for contamination, but as the likelihood of contamination diminished with the passage of time vessels and cargoes were subsequently examined on a random basis.  A total of ten cargo ships were examined at ports around the country but no contamination was found on the ships or their cargoes. The cargoes were mainly coal, oil and machinery.  The examination procedure will continue in operation for as long as is necessary.</P>
      <P>Imports into Community countries of general foodstuffs such as meat, fish and milk originating in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and the Soviet Union were suspended by Regulation of the Council of the European Communities dated 12 May, 1986.

      <P>The expenditure incurred by my Department on energy conservation in the years 1981 to 1985 inclusive is as follows:&mdash; 1981, £2.132 million; 1982, £1.274 million; 1983, £0.678 million; 1984, £0.351 million; 1985, £0.276 million.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this expenditure was to encourage the carrying out by energy users in all sectors of measures to improve the efficiency of energy use.</P>
      <P>While there has been a considerable improvement in energy efficiency since the 1970's there is still scope for further improvement and it is my belief that an appropriate energy conservation programme will continue to be necessary.</P>
      <P>As regards experiments on alternative energy sources the National Board for Science and Technology publishes annually an inventory of energy research, development and demonstration projects. Information on projects grant-aided by my Department is set out in the following tabular statement:</P>

      <P>I understand from the board that the measurement of radioactive contamination in food is still in progress at the board's laboratories, and that it is intended to publish detailed results of analysis carried out after verification procedures have been completed in all cases. In the meantime preliminary results have already been published in press releases by the board.  These indicate that the levels in milk, air, rainwater and various vegetables have not exceeded acceptable limits.  As a reassurance to the public and as a safety precaution, the monitoring programme will be continued and extended, and the public will be kept informed of results.</P>

For the current year the total provision for the scheme was increased by £500,000; and this has resulted in a substantial increase in the allocations to individual health boards which, in turn, should have a significant impact on the number of cases that can be dealt with this year in the functional area of the South Eastern Health Board, including south Tipperary.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer is in receipt of a retirement pension and a social welfare old age contributory pension both of which are chargeable to tax. The social welfare pension is paid gross and it is standard practice in such cases to collect the tax attributable to it under PAYE from the other income by reducing the tax free allowances by the amount of the social welfare pension.  This pension is shown as &ldquo;other earnings&rdquo; on the certificate of tax-free allowances.</P>
      <P>Official records show that the taxpayer had been in receipt of interest from monies on deposit for a number of years and this source of income is chargeable to tax.  As the taxpayer's return of income for the current year, which he completed recently, did not indicate whether or not this particular source of income had ceased, the inspector of taxes will now communicate with the taxpayer in the matter.  The inspector is unable to trace any previous representations from the Deputy or the taxpayer in this case.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £24.55 based on means of £33.80 up to 20 November 1985, when his wife died.  After that date he ceased to be entitled to an adult dependant increase.  The revised maximum entitlement in his case was £33.80 which equaled the weekly means assessment. Consequently he was not entitled to payment and his claim was disallowed.</P>
      <P>He made a further claim from 2 December 1985 and following investigation of his claim by a social welfare officer his means were assessed at £27.30 weekly, derived from profit from his holding.

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a claimant must be available for and genuinely seeking work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question as to whether a claimant satisfies the condition of being available for and genuinely seeking work is decided by statutorily appointed deciding officers and appeals officers.  The criteria they use are broadly whether a genuine desire and intention to obtain work in present, whether commitments exist which might limit the person's freedom to accept, or might prevent acceptance of, full time employment which would normally be suitable and whether restrictions are being imposed by the person on the kind, place or hours of employment acceptable, any of which would unreasonably diminish the person's prospects of obtaining work.  The decisions on availability are made through the interpretation and application of any or all of these broad criteria in the light of, and in relation <Col N="682" /> to, the whole facts and evidence in each particular case.</P>
    <P>The person concerned was last employed in September 1985.  When she claimed unemployment benefit she indicated that she left her employment voluntarily and she made no genuine efforts to obtain alternative employment.  She claimed unemployment benefit on four separate occasions: from 9 September 1985, from 23 October 1985, from 2 January 1986 and from 20 February 1986. Her first three claims were disallowed by a deciding officer on the grounds that she was not available for work.  She appealed against the deciding officer's decision on each occasion but an appeals officer also decided that she was not available for work in connection with two of the claims and in the third case she failed to attend the oral appeal hearing.</P>
    <P>Her claim from 20 February 1986 was also disallowed by a deciding officer on the grounds that she was not available for work.  She appealed against the disallowance and following a hearing of her case on 3 April 1986 the appeals officer allowed her claim to benefit from 20 February 1986.</P>
    <P>The person concerned is in receipt of social assistance allowance and her unemployment benefit claim was allowed at £19.75 weekly, the appropriate weekly flat-rate unemployment benefit payable to a person in receipt of the maximum rate of social assistance allowance.  In addition pay-related benefit is also payable at £25.28 weekly.  Arrears due from 20 February 1986 have been paid to her and further weekly payments of £45.03 are continuing.</P>

      <P>Newmarket Development Association received assistance from my Department in 1984 and 1985 to carry out environmental improvement works in the Newmarket area.  However, projects providing work of the nature proposed by the association under its recent application are now given low priority under the revised teamwork scheme and sponsors have been advised that no grant will be approved for them under that scheme in the current year.  They have, however, been advised to submit an application under my Department's social employment scheme.</P>
