      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>There are 3,554 persons employed in the field force for the 1986 Census of Population of whom 2,503 are women and 1,051 are men.  Field staff were recruited at three levels, that is 35 senior supervisors, 298 field supervisors and 3,221 enumerators, separate procedures being involved in each case.</P>
      <P>The details are as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1878" /> A.  Senior Supervisory Posts (whole-time)</P>
    <P>Applications were invited by public advertisements.  To be eligible for consideration it was essential that candidates</P>
    <P>(1)  be not less than 30 years of age on 1 July 1985.</P>
    <P>(2)  be free to take up a whole-time post for a period of about 10 to 12 months.</P>
    <P>(3)  have had considerable experience in a managerial or executive position, preferably one which required a high degree of initiative and involved the organisation and supervision of substantial numbers of staff.</P>
    <P>(4)  be able to drive a car, hold a current full driving licence and have the full-time use of a car for the period of employment on the Census.</P>
    <P>(5)  possess the requisite knowledge and ability to undertake the duties of the post.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it was desirable that candidates should have a good secondary education with leaving certificate or an equivalent or higher qualification.  It was also an advantage to have practical experience in supervising or conducting household surveys, market research interviewing or practical social work.</P>
    <P>Appointment to these posts was on the basis of open competitive interview and was offered to the highest qualified candidate at interview.  Among the 35 persons filling the posts are 18 who indicated that they were unemployed; a further 3 unemployed persons declined offers of appointment while 2 unemployed persons who accepted employment, subsequently resigned.</P>
    <P>B.  Field Supervisor Posts (whole-time) Applications were also invited by public advertisements.  To be eligible for consideration for these posts it was essential that candidates</P>
    <P>(1)  be not less than 24 years of age on 1 November 1985.</P>
    <P>(2)  be free to take up a whole-time post for a period of about 7 months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1879" /> (3)  be able to drive a car, hold a current full driving licence and have the full-time use of a car for the period of employment on the Census.</P>
    <P>(4)  possess the requisite knowledge and ability to undertake the duties of the post.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it was desirable that candidates should have a good general education; some experience in the organisation, training and supervision of staff; and practical experience in supervising or conducting household surveys, market research interviewing or practical social work.</P>
    <P>In making appointments following competitive interview, priority was given (subject to location constraints) to persons qualified by the interview board and who were on UB/UA and to those who, on the basis of information coming to light at interview, seemed to be in economic need although not on UB/UA.</P>
    <P>Of the total of 298 posts, 187 are filled by persons on UB/UA and 59 by other persons &ldquo;in economic need&rdquo;&mdash; a combined total of 246.  In addition 48 persons on UB/UA and 3 &ldquo;in economic need&rdquo; declined offers of appointment; while 6 persons on UB/UA who accepted offers of appointment subsequently resigned.</P>
    <P>C.  Enumerator Posts (part-time)</P>
    <P>A notice of recruitment of part-time enumerators, indicating the necessary qualifications, was placed in the public press on 13 November 1985, stating that preference would be given to suitable persons who were unemployed.  It also indicated that application forms could be obtained through the local offices of the National Manpower Service who had the task of nominating suitable persons for competitive interview.  To be eligible for consideration it was essential that candidates</P>
    <P>(1)  be not less than 21 years of age on 1 January 1986.  In exceptional circumstances consideration could be given to persons aged between 18 and 21 years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1880" /> (2)  be able to devote about 25 hours per week to Census work (including training) for a total of about 10 weeks during the period early March to end of May 1986.  A considerable amount of evening work was required.</P>
    <P>(3)  have a good general education.</P>
    <P>Furthermore to qualify for appointment in Gaeltacht areas fluency in Irish was required; while in rural areas a candidate should, if at all possible, have a full driving licence and the use of a suitable means of personal transport.</P>
    <P>In making appointments, priority was given (subject to location constraints) to persons on UB/UA and to persons who, on the basis of information coming to light at interview, seemed to be in economic need although not on UB/UA; in both cases subject to being qualified at competitive interview.</P>
    <P>Of the total of 3,221 enumerator posts, 1,123 posts are filled by persons on UB/UA and 494 by persons &ldquo;in economic need&rdquo;&mdash; a combined total of 1,617.  An additional 312 persons on UB/UA and 56 persons &ldquo;in economic need&rdquo; who were offered posts either declined the offer of appointment or resigned having initially accepted the job offer.</P>
    <P>Thus of the overall total of 3,554 serving field staff, 1,881 persons were on UB/UA or in &ldquo;economic need&rdquo; when appointed.  In addition a further 430 persons on UB/UA or in &ldquo;economic need&rdquo; refused offers of appointment or resigned having initially accepted a job offer.</P>

      <P>The procedure used in recruiting the field staff was in accordance with the wishes of the Government as conveyed to the Central Statistics Office in minutes dated 28 May and 19 October 1985 from the Department of the Taoiseach.  These procedures were as follows.  First, following competitive interviews offers of appointment to the liaison officers and regional supervisor <Col N="1881" /> posts were to be strictly in accordance with the order of ranking on the basis of overall suitability.  Second, following competitive shortlisting and interviews, appointment to field supervisor positions was to give absolute preference, subject to location constraints, to qualified applicants of UB/UA or to persons who appeared at the interview to be in economic need.  Third, a permanent civil servant, ranked HEO or above would chair each interview board.  Fourth, notice concerning the recruitment of enumerators would be placed in the newspapers in November 1985 inviting applications and informing people that enumerator positions would be filled by interviewing persons nominated by the National Manpower Service and preference would be accorded to the unemployed. The notice was to indicate specifically that no canvassing would be allowed for the enumerator posts.</P>

      <P>Deputies should listen because this makes good reading.  For the purpose of carrying out the 1986 census the State was divided into 3,221 enumeration areas and for each of these areas only one enumerator was appointed, even though there may have been two or more suitable persons available for appointment in any one area.  In making these appointments absolute perference was given to persons on UB/UA and to persons in economic need, subject to their being deemed qualified at a competitive interview.  Since the object of the census is to obtain a complete and accurate count of the population of each enumeration area, it is essential that the enumerators have a good knowledge of the area to which they are appointed. Persons appointed as enumerators, therefore, are generally residents of their <Col N="1882" /> own enumeration areas and thus are familiar with their localities &mdash; the names of streets, townlands and so on &mdash; and are aware of isolated and out of the way habitats.</P>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he is aware that average Irish industrial electricity costs are still some 20 per cent higher, and 40 per cent higher for some industries, than our EC competitors despite a recent reduction; and the plans he has to narrow the gap further as a result of the collapse of oil prices and falling currencies such as the US dollar and sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the ESB that the gap between Irish and European industrial electricity prices has narrowed significantly. Since the report of the Inquiry into Electricity Prices was published in January 1985, industrial electricity prices in Ireland have been reduced by an average of over 12 per cent.  For certain industrial users the reductions were up to 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>As I indicated last week in the course of the debate on a Private Members' motion relating to this matter, the full savings accruing to the ESB from the factors referred to by the Deputy are being passed on to electricity consumers.  Any opportunity for further reductions which may arise from favourable trends in costs will, of course, be availed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the fuel input cost into electricity generation is approximately 20 per cent, and the gas fuel input represents about 50 per cent. Will the Minister agree that the two factors governing the world price of oil &mdash; the price of crude which is at the same level as it was before the 1973-74 oil crisis and the depreciation of the dollar which in recent years has been by as much as 30 per cent &mdash; represent a very substantial fall in the price of oil to the ESB?  Will he not accept that it is time that more <Col N="1885" /> generous saving were passed on and not alone to the industrial consumer?  Every day we hear calls from the Government to be more competitive.  It is time that the Government were competitive where they can be competitive in passing on the benefits of falling oil prices to the industrial user and the domestic consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in the debate in this House less than two weeks ago, I am satisfied that the savings from oil price reductions are being passed on to the consumer.  Also we must bear in mind the fact that less than 20 per cent of the ESB's electricity generation is derived from oil.  I have said to the Deputy, and publicity since the debate, that if scope or opportunity arises for further reductions they will be availed of, but at present the decision of the ESB is that this is as far as they can go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept from me also that the fuel input cost to the ESB in relation to natural gas represents 50 per cent, and that this is an area where the Government have their own ways and means of reducing the price of electricity if they so wish?  Will he agree that it is time he took a lead in this area?  Many industries are coming under extreme pressure in the international market because of the recent alignment of currencies, and this is a way in which a contribution can be made to making them more competitive.  Will the Government consider reducing their pricing of natural gas to the ESB so that a significant reduction of ESB prices could come about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I accept what the Deputy is saying.  The question of reducing the price of natural gas to the ESB to reflect market reality is under consideration and we should have an early decision on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>A final supplementary. Will the Minister agree, therefore, that <Col N="1886" /> we can expect more reductions in electricity prices during the next three, four or six months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered and made statements on that at least five times in the past two weeks and the position has not changed.  If a more favourable position occurs then obviously we will have further price reductions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister had representations from the CIF concerning job losses in industry because of high industrial prices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fairly certain that I have received correspondence from the CIF at regular intervals over the past three and a half years.  We should be aware of the healthy trends also.  When the inquiry into electricity prices took place there was a gap, a difference of 20 to 30 per cent more expensive for industrial users.  We have narrowed that gap significantly since that time and my intention is to try to narrow it further still to make sure that we can be as competitive as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about a range of around 20 to 24 per cent.  It was much higher than that.  The trend is favourable from the Irish economy's point of view and we hope to continue to keep it going in that direction.</P>

It would be in the interest of everybody on all sides of this House to await the final report and then have a discussion in this House and allow some time for the Members of the House to consider the report and its implications. It is reasonable to say that there are differences of opinion throughout the country as to the best possible uses of cutaway bogs.  I hope when we get the report to have a full discussion in this House to which all Members can contribute and then to outline policy for the future of cutaway bogs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Drilling operations, initiated by a potential investor in the Slieveardagh Coalfield, which commenced in the coalfield in February 1986 as part of a feasibility study, are not yet completed.  Accordingly, the findings of the study, the release of which would be a matter for the company concerned, are not available.</P>
      <P>The drilling operations have been suspended for the time being pending resolution of issues arising between the company carrying out the feasibility study and the receiver of Flair Resources (Ireland) Ltd., holders of the State mining lease.  My understanding is that, while considerable progress has been made on the matters at issue, they have not as yet been resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of Deputy Seán Treacy I would like to ask a couple of supplementary questions on this.  The Minister said that the feasibility study, commenced in February 1986, has not been completed and has been suspended.  Will he agree that the reason the feasibility study was suspended was that the receiver, Mr. Somers, sought certain moneys from Kelvin Resources, who were doing the feasibility <Col N="1889" /> study, in the middle of the operation without giving them prior knowledge? Were his Department aware of this conflict between the receiver and Kelvin Resources?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is, to a certain extent, correct.  The receiver of Flair Resources (Ireland) Ltd, insisted on some condition being met by the potential investor who apparently started off his feasibility study in early February, but the receiver was not satisfied that the conditions he required were met and he demanded that the potential investor stop the feasibility study and laid down certain conditions.  My Department were fully aware of the difficulty that had arisen and officials from my Department met with both parties on 6 March last and impressed on all sides my desire to have the difficulties resolved and a decision made on future involvement in the field.  Negotiations are continuing between the receiver and the investor but as yet a conclusion has not been reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the main condition sought by the receiver, Mr. Somers, from the potential investor, Kelvin Resources, was an allocation of moneys?  I accept that the Minister's Department and the receiver have been in consultation about this.  In effect has any contact been made by either the Department or the receiver with Kelvin Resources and has there been any response from Kelvin Resources since those representations were made to them by the Department and by the receiver?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations are going on between the receiver and Kelvin Resources.  The conditions laid down by the receiver also involved matters other than money.  He maintained that his consent should have been sought for Kelvin's drilling contractor to enter the leasehold area.  He also required details of the proposed drilling programme and wished to be allowed to engage expert assistance to enable the receiver to assess adequately Kelvin's exploration programme and to <Col N="1890" /> monitor their operations if necessary. Because the receiver had inadequate funds, he also wished Kelvin to cover any expenses incurred by him in connection with the feasibility studies.</P>
      <P>He also felt obliged to be provided with evidence that the consent of the relevant landowners had been received for drilling to be carried out on their land and to be provided with evidence that adequate public liability insurance was in place.  These are matters solely for the receiver and he was acting as receiver. My Department continue to be made aware of the developments in the negotiations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been very fair in his replies.  He stated that the Department of Energy held the lease of the mines but does he accept that there is a major dispute in this regard which has caused problems in relation to feasibility studies and future investment?  The dispute is between the Department and Mr. Conneely who claims to own the head lease and, in view of the controversy regarding the true ownership, can the Minister say if there has been any report from the examiner as to determination of the true owner?  If not, when is the report due?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are, of course, aware of the Ballingarry coal field and in particular of the mine for which Flair Resources hold the licence but who are now in receivership and liquidation, and of Tipperary Anthracite Ltd., a part of Flair Resources, which is in liquidation. Our involvement has been very benign and we have indicated to the receiver that the Minister will have no objection to the study carried out by Kelvin Energy and that he is prepared to assign the lease to them provided the company wish to mine and can convince the Minister that they have the necessary financial, managerial and technical resources to establish and maintain viable mining operations at Ballingarry. It is our primary responsibility to issue a mining licence and we do so when our conditions regarding management, technical viability and finances are met.  In this case we have gone quite a distance in giving some comfort to Kelvin in regard to the Minister issuing mining licences, assuming that certain criteria are met.  However, since there are legal problems in the matter I do not wish to comment further except to say that my Department have been most helpful and are concerned to have this matter brought to a successful conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Production of all forms of peat is very dependent on suitable weather during a short season and 1985 was an exceptionally wet year in that context.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna have traditionally had a policy of high stocks, particularly of milled peat for briquette manufacturing and electricity generation.  This policy has been vindicated in recent months as they have been able to produce record quantities of briquettes while maintaining reasonable supplies of milled peat to power stations.  As a result of the necessary draw down of stocks, their stocks are now relatively low.</P>
      <P>The level of production which can be achieved this year is determined, apart from weather considerations, by the number of harvesting machines available.  Given reasonable weather, it should be possible to rebuild stocks.</P>

      <P>I do not have a specific answer to that question but I might be able to help the Deputy.  Obviously, a major factor in relation to the production levels and the production season for Bord na Móna is the availability of harvesting machines from within their resources. That will have a major bearing on the amounts of milled peat available for briquettes and for the peat burning stations. I will come back to the Deputy on the question of extra men being taken on but I am inclined to believe that it is not a <Col N="1897" /> question of manpower but the availability of machinery and having that machinery producing at optimum capacity.</P>

The notice of the Minister's intention to grant this licence was published on 11 May 1985 and no objections were raised.  Over the past 40 years, since the enactment of the Minerals Development Act, 1940, we have not been aware of any damage done to sites of archaeological interest in the course of exploration work.  I should add that exploration work is totally different from mining and we will have to look at the matter again.  We are in touch with OPW on this matter and we have asked them to sit down and discuss the matter with the company to ensure that damage is not done to any archaeological treasures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 11, 12 and 17 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment of a receiver to the Dublin Gas Company is a first step in the restructuring of the company prior to nationalisation.  It is our objective to maintain the company as a going concern and to put the company back on a viable footing, supplying gas to consumers efficiently and at a reasonable price. Where proper claims exist they will be met in due to course.  It is not possible at this stage to give an estimate of the cost <Col N="1900" /> of nationalisation or of the time scale involved until such time as the receiver has had the opportunity to assess the situation in the company.</P>
    <P>Mutualisation is hardly a realistic option in view of the heavy State investment which has already taken the place and the further investment which will be required.  However any arrangements which involve a contribution to efficiency by consumers and employees can be considered as part of the nationalisation process.</P>
    <P>As regards employment, there should not be any reduction in numbers arising exclusively from nationalisation; improvements in efficiency through more realistic manning levels would have been required regardless of the form of ownership.  The interests of employees and of the other parties involved in Dublin Gas will be respected in accordance with their respective rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister to confirm that the actual recorded Government decision has been taken to nationalise Dublin Gas?  Second, is he satisfied that the role of the receiver is now proper, and given the circumstances of the decision to nationalise Dublin Gas, and the announcement already made in this House that all creditors will be paid, would he say what is the role of the receiver? Furthermore can he explain how he foresees no reduction in employment levels in view of the fact that the conversion programme is supposed to be completed by July-August?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be a loss of jobs or not?  Would the Minister please confirm that there will be a loss of approximately 300 jobs when the conversion programme is supposed to be completed in July-August?  How can the Minister say there will be no loss of jobs thereafter in view of the fact that the unit cost of production compared with any other gas utility is much higher as are the manning levels in Dublin Gas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, the improvements in efficiency through more realistic manning levels would have been required regardless of the form of ownership, and that I intend to see through.  The Deputy is aware that the ending of the conversion programme in the month of June or July obviously will lead to the loss of approximately 200 jobs which were temporary of their very <Col N="1902" /> nature.  Then it is a matter for the receiver to look at the whole question of efficiency and improvements in efficiency to bring about more realistic manning levels in the Dublin Gas Company.  In reply to the Deputy's second question: yes, the Government have decided to nationalise Dublin Gas.  A receiver has been put in place to keep the company trading at present and he will be communicating with the Government in due course.  I said that publicly on at least two occasions previously.  The role of the receiver, as the Deputy said and as I stated publicly, is to start the restructuring of the company prior to nationalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister now confirm that the banks are back funding Dublin Gas as an on-going business operation because that is what he announced here last week?  My information is that the banks are not honouring cheques, that they are confiscating the total cash flow of the receiver.  That is why I ask: what is the role of the receiver at present?  I know pensioners still have unpaid cheques in their pockets.  We were led to believe here last week that the banks would be back funding this operation, that full and final arrangements have been made for funding this company.  Is the Minister aware that on Thursday last there was no money available to pay the wages in Dublin Gas, that the banks refused to pay them and that, at the last minute, Bord Gáis had to come to their assistance?  Would the Minister say whether the banks have yet accepted the fact that nationalisation is taking place and why they are not going on to fund this operation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

      <P>I want to try to tease out the same matters as Deputy Reynolds.  I asked, in question No. 12, when it is proposed that the process of nationalisation will commence.  I am still not clear.  The Minister when replying said that putting in a receiver was the first step on the way to nationalisation.  That is not a satisfactory answer to the question of when actual nationalisation will commence.  Putting in a receiver is not a normal process of nationalisation; that can be done for many purposes.  Could the Minister clarify when the actual process of nationalisation will commence. The second question I wanted to ask was in regard to job losses.  The Minister has said that there should not be any reduction in jobs arising exclusively from nationalisation.  The purpose of my question was really to find out how many job losses there would be in the Dublin Gas Company from the time the receiver moved in.  Could the Minister clarify what job losses will arise as a result of the appointment of the receiver and the nationalisation process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in reply to the Deputies, and Deputy Mac Giolla in particular, it is not possible at this stage to give an estimate of the cost of nationalisation or of the time scale involved.  The question is somewhat premature in that respect.  To some extent the nationalisation process has commenced by the appointment of the receiver and it is my intention to see that process through as quickly as possible.  The receiver is looking at all aspects of the Dublin Gas Company at present, will be reporting in full, and then the question of the steps to be taken will be outlined.  I am not in any way seeking to be disrespectful to the Deputy when I say that the question is <Col N="1904" /> somewhat premature.  Obviously there has to be a certain time span until the receiver is in a position to make a full report on the on-going situation in Dublin Gas.  At that time I shall come back to the House and outline the steps which will be taken as quickly as possible.  In relation to the job losses, I have clarified the situation &mdash; there will be some demanning when the conversion is complete. In an effort to improve efficiency it will be necessary to have more realistic manning levels in the Dublin Gas Company. That is a matter which will be finalised as well when the receiver has completed his preliminary reports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say if the appointment of the receiver is an interim measure pending the implementation of the nationalisation process or is it that the process of nationalisation will take place following a report from the receiver?  As the Minister is aware, in many cases when a receiver moves in he dictates the time scale within which he will be in command of the whole structure. In those circumstances would the Minister take the necessary precautions to ensure that the receiver does not remain almost <i>ad infinitum</i>?  Has the Minister set a time scale within which the receiver must report to the Government? I would remind him that that is the largest problem he will face.  Furthermore, if the receiver recommends redundancies, will they be implemented by the State when it takes over?</P>

    <P>Of course, I am not satisfied that, as of now, the level of drilling commitments for 1987 is satisfactory in absolute terms, but I am realistic enough to recognise that the next year or so may be a valley period for Irish and, indeed, world wide exploration given the present oil price situation.  Current low oil prices are, of course, bringing their own considerable benefits to the economy as a whole.

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he will make a statement on his progress to date with the British Government on the future position of the Sellafield plant; if an EC inspectorate to monitor and report on its continued operation will be set up; and, if not, if he will demand its closure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 16 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>I am advised on matters of radioactive contamination by the Nuclear Energy Board.  The board recently presented to me their report on radioactivity monitoring of the Irish marine environment during 1982-1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report shows that radioactive contamination decreases rapidly with increasing distance from Sellafield.  The report also shows that the levels of contamination of the Irish Sea have decreased in recent years probably reflecting the reductions in the annual discharges from Sellafield since they were at their highest <Col N="1909" /> in the seventies.  The report assesses the possible radiation exposure of Irish consumers of fish and shellfish and concludes that in the case of the average consumer of seafood, the dose would be about 1 per cent of both the annual dose limit for the public recommended by the International Commission for Radiological Protection and of the dose from naturally occurring radiation.</P>
    <P>The board have advised that there should be no concern about eating fish and shellfish from the Irish Sea.  Copies of the report have been placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>The board, with the assistance of the Meteorological Service and the Department of Communications, also monitor radioactivity levels in air, rainfall and drinking water samples.  I am advised by the board that the levels of artificially produced radioactivity in the atmosphere are low and do not constitute a health hazard to the Irish public.  The monitoring programme by the NEB enables the levels of radioactivity contamination to be kept under review.  Although the primary objective of determining the impact on members of the public is being achieved, I am considering the possibility of more extensive monitoring.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that the Government are totally opposed to any discharge of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea and want to see these discharges minimised and eliminated as soon as possible, using the best technological means.  Any radioactive discharge, even if the level of radioactivity is small, is undesirable and should cease.  While the discharges themselves have negligible radiological significance for the Irish people, the frequency of recent incidents has caused a loss of confidence in the Sellafield operation.  The view of the Irish Government is that this is an international issue which must be resolved by the European Commission under the provisions of the Euratom Treaty.  The Government consider that a European inspection force is necessary to determine independently whether Sellafield can operate safely or whether operations should be suspended or cease until it can be rendered safe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1910" /> The Minister for Energy, the Minister for the Environment and I have had separate formal discussions with Commissioner Clinton-Davis about this matter. Following these discussions the Government formally requested the Commission to establish a European inspection force and I am awaiting a response.</P>
    <P>The concern of the Government and the Irish public at the operation of Sellafield, particularly in relation to the recent incidents at the plant, has been conveyed to the UK authorities on a number of occasions, most recently by the Taoiseach to the British Prime Minister, and at ongoing meetings of the Ireland-UK Contact Group.  The Government will continue to take every opportunity to press for an end to discharges from Sellafield both in contact with the British authorities and at all international fora, including the Paris Commission for the prevention of Marine Pollution from Land Based Sources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State agree finally that the legitimacy of our position in calling for the closure of Sellafield is now more evident than ever? Following the horrific disaster in the Soviet Union, will the Minister state now if this Government are going to await a recurrence of such a horrific disaster on our doorstep before the clarion call is sent out to the British Government that we want Sellafield closed, that it is a danger and a risk to the health of our people and our environment and that all Ireland, North and South want this closure?  The Minister might avail of the opportunity to give some news on the Russian disaster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact that Fianna Fáil started the process for the establishment of a nuclear power station at Carnsore Point.  I stated quite clearly in my reply that the Government consider that a European inspection force is necessary to determine independently whether Sellafield can operate safely or whether operations should be suspended or cease until the station can be rendered safe. We cannot wish the nuclear industry to disappear from Europe; it is there.  It forms a major part of the power supply in many EC countries.  We do not have jurisdiction over the Sellafield plant, but we have made our views known quite clearly both to the British Government and to the EC Commissioners.</P>
      <P>My Government are committed to seeing all discharges from Sellafield cease.  That is our objective.  If we fail in our call for a European inspection force, we will take whatever action is necessary to protect our environment which we hold so dear.  We are going through the proper channels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take both questions together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been advised by the Nuclear Energy Board that the early reports of the Soviet Nuclear Power Station near Kiev indicated that the effects of the accident are not likely to be detected in Ireland. The board, in conjunction with the <Col N="1914" /> meteorological service, have an air monitoring programme which would indicate any airborne contamination.  The programme will continue to monitor the situation and the board will keep developments under review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>What arrangements, if any, have been made to provide protection for the population of this country in the event of a similar or more serious leakage from a nuclear power plant in either Britain or continental Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to be advised on that matter by the Nuclear Energy Board.  In the event of a major nuclear incident affecting this country there would, of course, be the fullest collaboration between the Nuclear Energy Board, civil defence and other organisations in taking measures to protect the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that this threat is not just to Ireland but to the whole European Community, would the Minister arrange to raise at Community level with the USSR the concern which has been expressed in the House today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course this matter will be taken up at Community level.  I understand that the European Commission have already sought information under Articles 35 and 36 of Euratom 3.  This disaster, which is very regrettable, reinforces my Government's call for a European inspection force which would monitor on an independent basis the whole of the nuclear industry in the European Community.  That is a proper position for this Government to take.  The cloud mentioned seems to be going over the Baltic Sea area and there are no detectable traces of contamination over Ireland at this time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister ensure that the Irish Government will press, through every international channel available to them, for the fullest disclosure of all the details and implications <Col N="1915" /> of this nuclear disaster which has taken place in Russia?  Furthermore, would he not agree with me that this accident totally confirms the view of all of us who are demanding the closure of Sellafield? Would he not agree that the only legitimate position for the Irish Government to take up now &mdash; a position that should have been adopted before now but certainly after this recent accident &mdash; so as to ensure that they discharge their responsibility for the safety and welfare of the Irish people is to stop pussyfooting about monitoring and inspection, and demand the immediate closure of Sellafield?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the first part of the Deputy's question, we will of course seek as much information as possible about what is apparently a most serious accident.  The Nuclear Energy Board and the Government will take every step necessary in seeking such information.  Regarding the closure of Sellafield, I have replied comprehensively to the Government position on that matter.</P>
      <P>This question has been raised at the highest level possible both by the Taoiseach and by the British Prime Minister, but the present accident reinforces the policy of this Government in seeking the establishment of a European inspection force for the whole of the nuclear industry throughout Europe.  It is only by having such a force that we will have an independent assessment of the safety of all nuclear power plants throughout Europe.  That is the logical process with regard to this industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the dangers that could be posed to this country by the present type of disaster could arise not only from a nuclear power plant in Great Britain but also from nuclear plants on mainland Europe? In that context will the Minister take immediate steps at international level to press for the establishment of an international early warning system requiring immediate notification of such an incident by the country in which it takes place to all those countries that could be affected by the resulting radioactivity? Would the Minister agree also that, in the event of such a tragic accident, there is an onus on the country in which the accident occurs to be forthcoming and to make as much information as possible available to all the neighbouring countries? Would the Minister agree, too, that in the present instance the Soviet Union has been remiss?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Soviet Union appears to have been very tardy in informing its neighbours of the major accident.  This country is at risk from any major accident at a power plant within the EC countries.  The European Commission have the responsibility to ensure that adequate and the highest safety standards possible are in place.  We have requested the establishment of a European inspection force so as to ensure that as a country without a nuclear industry we would not be affected because of inadequate safety standards in other countries.  We will continue to press for the establishment of such a force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that the Chairman of the Nuclear Energy Board, Mr. George Duffy, expressed grave concern recently about <Col N="1917" /> the safety of the reactors at Sellafield and given that there is a massive expansion taking place at Sellafield, a matter to which the Minister regrettably did not refer, surely he should make it known to the House now that as a nation we will make an immediate protest and not become entangled in the bureaucracy of a pro-nuclear industry which is vested in Europe?  The Minister has the power now to make an individual protest to the British Government for the closure of Sellafield. There is no point in phoning for the fire brigade if one's hair is on fire.</P>

We continue to have contact with the British Government through our contact group.  We have made our position clear.  We have made it clear that all radioactive emissions from Sellafield should cease as soon as possible. That will remain our position.  As I have said, we have called also for a European inspection force.  Should such a force be established but fail to take adequate action, we will continue to press to ensure the complete safety of the Irish environment.</P>

      <P>One of the points I am asking the Minister to accept is that there is a broad political consensus across the political divide in Northern Ireland on the importance of this matter.  In view of that, would he agree that an executive decision by a Northern Minister, a British Minister in fact, to allow this encroachment on this vitally important site would be a gross abuse of executive power and even at this late stage would he take whatever action is open to him to impress on the Northern Ireland Executive that no such planning decision should be given?</P>

      <P>The advice I have is that it is fundamental to this system of public inquiry that the decision-making authority does not accept post-inquiry representations without going to the parties involved in the inquiry and giving them <Col N="1921" /> the opportunity to comment on these representations.  Once the public inquiry is closed it would not be helpful to the decision which both I and Deputy Haughey wish to see reached if further representations were made at this stage. All those representations should have been and were made by me 18 months ago before the public inquiry took place.</P>

      <P>Rathfarnham Castle is protected by the temporary preservation order made by the Commissioners of Public Works on 24 December 1985 under subsection 1 of section 4 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1954.  The effect of the order is that it is unlawful for any person to demolish or to remove any part of the monument or to interfere with it in any way without written consent of the commissioners. The commissioners' staff carry out regular and frequent inspections of the castle.  Since the castle is private property, the commissioners are not free to instal resident security staff, but their own employees and the Garda Síochána are co-operating to ensure that the provisions of the temporary preservation order are fully complied with.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann endorses the Minister for Agriculture's defence of Irish agricultural interests during the recent agricultural price negotiations and recognises that the outcome safeguards the essential elements of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that normally the report on discussions such as these is made in the form of a statement.  I would like to point out to the House that I proposed that this debate take the form of a motion because it came to my notice that certain people <Col N="1986" /> in the media insinuated that the Government were trying to avoid a vote on this issue.  I would like to let everybody know quite specifically that the Government welcome the opportunity to debate and vote on it.</P>
    <P>I wish to inform the House of the outcome of last week's meeting of the Council of Agricultural Ministers held in Luxembourg.  First of all, I would like to set out briefly what was put forward by the Commission in its original price proposals and to outline what was agreed in the sectors of main interest to us.  The Commission had proposed: first, in the case of beef, the termination of permanent intervention by November 1987 and the complete elimination of carcase intervention and the different premium systems this year; second, in the case of cereals, they proposed a 3 per cent co-responsibility levy together with average price cuts of over 10 per cent as a result of changes in quality standards for feed grain.  In all, those price reductions, when added in with the co-responsibility levy, would have been in the region of 12 per cent to 15 per cent; third, in the case of milk, the introduction this year of a cessation scheme leading to a 3 per cent cut in quotas.</P>
    <P>These proposals were made against the background of enormous Community stock levels and a critical budgetary situation&mdash;a background which called for urgent remedial action even if that involved some costs, at least in the short term. While the proposals were understandable in these circumstances, I never attempted to deny that they represented a real threat to Irish agriculture.  Therefore, I set out to negotiate a substantially improved package, especially in relation to beef where the greatest risk existed. That is exactly what I have achieved. Much of the comment made since Friday morning completely ignores what has been achieved.  It is as if the comments related to the Commission's proposals and not to the Council decisions.  I will now outline what these decisions were exactly:</P>
    <P>On MCAs&mdash;Following the EMS realignment there was scope for a green <Col N="1987" /> pound devaluation to eliminate the negative monetary gap which had been created.  During last week's meeting the Commission proposed a uniform devaluation of 1.98 per cent for the livestock products, that is milk and beef, and 1 per cent for plant products, and stuck rigidly to that position.  Following very strong pressure from us, the final agreement gave Ireland a 3 per cent adjustment for livestock products and 1.5 per cent for the others.  This is a major gain and represents increased income of about £75 million a year for Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>On beef the proposal to phase out permanent intervention has been left aside for the present and longer term issues in the beef sector are to be decided before the end of this year.  The possibility of carcase intervention this year is reinstated and all the beef premium arrangements&mdash;calf subsidy, variable premium, and the special Irish element in the suckler cow premium&mdash;are retained.  By far the most important element of that retention is the possibility of full carcase intervention in the autumn.  Ireland and Northern Ireland are the only regions in the Community which benefit from all three premium systems, their value to us being about £30 million a year.  These were not included in the original set of proposals put forward by the Commission.  The final phasing in of the beef classification scheme involves a beef price increase which should be worth some £10 million or so per year while the green currency change is worth close to £40 million to beef producers.</P>
    <P>On cereals the co-responsibility levy is adopted but it will be repaid to all small scale cereal producers on deliveries of up to 25 tonnes.  This will, in effect, exempt 70 per cent of all Irish grain growers. Intervention will be available on normal terms from 1 October instead of 1 December as proposed.  Most importantly the price reductions are significantly less than those proposed by the Commission, especially in the case of barley where they amount to about 5 per cent.  We must bear in mind the additional 3 per cent co-responsibility levy.  Taking <Col N="1988" /> all the elements together the cost in terms of farm incomes to grain growers is about £10 million a year after allowing for the green currency change.  The cost in national terms is much less since the vast bulk of cereals grown here are consumed domestically and so the lower prices are reflected in lower costs for the Irish users concerned.</P>
    <P>On milk the agreement means that quotas will be unchanged this year but that farmers will be invited voluntarily to cease milk production in return for a payment of 14p per gallon for each of seven years.  National quotas will be cut by 2 per cent for the 1987-88 marketing year and by a further 1 per cent for the 1988-89 marketing year.  Individual farmer's quotas will not, however, be affected unless the quantities bought up under the cessation scheme fall short of the required national reductions.  That is unlikely.  I believe that the voluntary take-up on that scheme will be sufficient to cover the overall 3 per cent.  I do not see that there will be any necessity for compulsory reduction of milk quotas. The agreement also provides for the restoration of FEOGA investment aid for milk processing projects involving non-intervention products, and the Commission have agreed to propose changes in the rules which would allow co-ops to run their own cessation schemes in order to facilitate restructuring of milk production.</P>
    <P>These two elements are extremely important.  First, up to now we have not had any grant aid for milk processors who wanted to diversify into products which are not causing problems on the milk market.  The products which are causing problems are butter and skim milk powder.  The Irish delegation got the Commission to agree that grant aid would be made available.  Secondly, and this is extremely important, as regards the restructuring of the milk industry we could not get the co-operatives to agree to a national cessation scheme over the past couple of months.  We have now got the Commission to agree that cessation schemes can be set up within a co-operative area.  The reason we could not get <Col N="1989" /> an agreement on a national scheme was that some of the smaller co-ops in the north and the northwest were afraid there would be an outflow of milk in their areas into the six larger co-op areas in the south.</P>
    <P>We can now have internal cessation schemes within a co-op area.  That is a very good thing and it will allow the restructuring, which we have been seeking so badly, to take place.  Furthermore, where the Community expenditure provided for the cessation scheme in any member state is not required in full, the balance can be used for restructuring. The loss terms of milk output arising from the reduction in quotas could be put at about £33 million over the two years concerned.</P>
    <P>At farm income level the net loss is probably about £10 million, partly offset by the £5 million a year compensation under the cessation scheme.  In the longer term, there will be benefits from the better market prospects that should result from lower production throughout the Community.  The green currency change will, of course, mean an immediate improvement in returns in the milk sector of about £35 million per annum.</P>
    <P>Separately from the price negotiations despite strong opposition from myself, the Council adopted arrangements which would permit reductions in Community recoupment of the storage and interest costs incurred in intervention operations. The savings will be used to assist the disposal of intervention stocks and in that respect will benefit us.  However, the decision has some Exchequer implications, the precise extent of which cannot be estimated until later in the year.</P>
    <P>All in all, the final prices agreement represents a major improvement for us over what was proposed.  Over the next year, even allowing for the losses in cereals, it will means about £70 million to Irish agriculture or £100 million if the premiums are included.  While the milk quota reduction will tend over time to offset the impact of the green pound devaluation on the value of dairy output, the impact of the devaluation on dairy farmers' incomes will far outweigh the <Col N="1990" /> consequences of the loss of quota.  In addition, and most importantly, the immediate threat to the beef intervention system has been eliminated and decisions about longer term beef policy can now be taken in a calmer and more rational atmosphere.  In the short term, carcases, as well as hindquarters and forequarters, will remain eligible for intervention.</P>
    <P>This package was the best which could be achieved and in many respects compares well with those negotiated in more favourable times.  In virtually every year since 1977 the price increase negotiated was less than the rate of inflation &mdash; in some years specacularly so.  For instance, in 1979 the increase was 2 per cent when inflation was 13 per cent; in 1980 it was 5 per cent when inflation was 18 per cent. This year the price increase is about equal to the expected level of inflation and above the expected rate of increase in farm costs.  Thus, the price levels negotiated will not be outweighed by inflation as happened in earlier years.</P>
    <P>We would have preferred to have been able to avoid the cut in cereal prices and to have held on to our existing milk quota but because of the critical budgetary situation and the massive surpluses this was not possible.  The vast majority supported the Commission line on cereals and milk and were particularly adamant that there could be no exemption for Ireland on the milk issue.  The Ministers from the other important milk processing countries have come under severe domestic criticism over the past two years because of the special treatment given to us in the 1984 super-levy settlement.  Even after the 3 per cent cut, Community milk production will still be some 10 million tonnes above normal consumption.</P>
    <P>Prior to the advent of Spain and Portugal into the community the following situation existed with regard to milk output. In the base year 1983, milk output in the Community was 105 million tonnes.  As a result of the introduction of the super-levy the other countries had to cut back by seven million tonnes, leaving production at 98 million tonnes.  The community consumes 85 million tonnes of milk and milk products; therefore, there is an <Col N="1991" /> imbalance of 13 million tonnes.  The latest proposal will bring that production in three years time down to 95 million tonnes, leaving a surplus of ten million tonnes of milk.  One can see from that that there is a major problem in the milk sector.  It would not be a problem for any country that could get rid of its milk products on the open market but for any country selling into intervention there is a problem.  We sell into intervention a large degree.  Incidentally, the position with regard to Spain and Portugal is rather irrelevant in this context because their production almost matches consumption. Thus, it will not be a factor in the overall calculation.</P>
    <P>The result of not reaching agreement last week would have been market chaos because of the action which the Commission would have taken, just as they acted last year when Germany vetoed the cereals proposal.  That did not do anything for the German cause at that time because a few days after the veto being invoked the Commission just came along and said they could not afford to pay extra for cereals and they cut the price to the same level as in the original proposal.  We have no doubt they would have taken exactly the same action on this occasion.  Incidentally, Irish farmers would lose £10 million per month in the next few months in the absence of the green rate and other changes.  These are the months of high milk production, our farmers would lose £10 million per month and that situation could continue through the year until the next price fixing session.</P>
    <P>To vote down the Commission's proposals, even if that could have been done successfully, would have been immediately politically popular with a view to appeasing public opinion at home.  However, it would have been totally dishonest and, in my considered view, would not have led to any improvement in the proposals before us.  In fact, quite likely it would have had devastating effects on Irish agriculture.  It is all too easy to say we should not have accepted but the damage to agriculture here could have been catastrophic.  We must weigh up the <Col N="1992" /> facts and try to do the best thing in that situation.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that there was overwhelming consensus among the other delegations that tough action would have to be taken and there was a common line among them that no exemptions would be tolerated.  That was the theme running through the price talks since they started last February.  Every country outlined quite clearly that there would be no exemptions.  They had suffered too much because of our exemption in the original super-levy deal.</P>
    <P>In most comments made here in recent days any acknowledgement of the realities of the budgetary and market situation has been conspicuous only by its absence. It is as if 0.75 million tonnes of beef, over 1 million tonnes of butter and 15 million tonnes of cereals in intervention stocks do not exist or can be wished away. In the past few days we have heard much loose talk and stupid comment.  What most of the remarks have in common is a reluctance to face any unpleasant facts. Instead, the nonsense has been trotted out that we are not responsible for the surpluses and, therefore, should not have to bear any of the burden of coming to terms with them.</P>
    <P>We live in a real world, not cloud-cuckooland. We live in a community that has considerable over-production in a number of sectors and all who produce within the community contribute to that. Our heavy dependence on intervention &mdash; for which we can, of course, advance some valid arguments &mdash; tends to disprove the &ldquo;we do not contribute to the problem&rdquo; argument.  Of course we contribute to the problem but we have specific difficulties and we need intervention in certain circumstances because of the seasonal nature of our production. For instance, our beef comes on stream in the autumn months and we need intervention to take the massive amount of beef slaughtered at that time in order to relieve the pressure.  We also have the problem that we are distant from the market and it is not always possible for us to sell at the instant the product is produced.  We need a little time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1993" /> We produce 6 per cent of Community beef, yet we hold 16 per cent of its total intervention stock.  Last year we sold about 15 per cent of our total beef production to intervention as against 5 per cent sold by other member states.  We sell proportionately more beef into intervention than any other member state, yet we have people telling us we do not contribute to the surpluses or to the huge expense of storage.  That is a falsehood and it is about time we faced up to the truth.  We have improved considerably in that area because 12 years ago our reliance on intervention of beef was as high as 30 per cent.  We have reduced that amount because of aggressive marketing by a number of brilliant operators in the beef industry.  We produce 5½ per cent of the Community's milk, yet we hold 10 per cent of its total intervention stock of butter.  Last year we sold 40 per cent of our butter production to intervention while the figure elsewhere was 25 per cent.  Against this background it is ridiculous to suggest we have no responsibility for the surpluses.</P>
    <P>Nobody knows better than I that a curb has to be put on concessionary imports and cereal substitutes which have been largely the cause of the difficulties we face.  For the past four years I have demanded that these imports should be curtailed but there has been little support. Only France has supported our line. However, at my behest, this year for the first time concessionary imports of beef will be reduced.  This advance is only a beginning and we will be pressing for further cuts in the future.</P>
    <P>Imports of cereal substitutes are also beginning to decline from 16 million tonnes a few years ago to 13 million tonnes now.  Again, this is due to pressure we have applied and, again, the only country that supported us on that issue has been France.  It is very difficult to reverse procedures and practices when one is in such a minority.  The bulk of the other countries want the importation of cereal substitutes and beef because they export large quantities of consumer goods.  They exist by trading and the only things they can take from third countries <Col N="1994" /> who import their products are beef and cereal substitutes.  One cannot veto that kind of activity.  One must have a majority on one's side but we are in a minority of two.  The House will be interested to know that Ireland is not blameless regarding the use of cereal substitutes. We are now using 600,000 tons a year and our usage is rising, whereas it is falling elsewhere in the Community.  Thus a &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; attitude here may not be any more appropriate on this issue than on the question of surpluses.</P>
    <P>The blatant dishonesty of statements made over the weekend is very annoying. The facts are quite different.  We do abuse the intervention system; we do use cereal substitutes.  We are responsible for a disproportionate amount of these stocks which are causing this major problem.  The paymasters of the Community have let it be known quite clearly that they are not prepared to continue to finance production of food which cannot be consumed in the Community or sold abroad, except at huge losses.  I made the point recently that it would be cheaper to take the butter being produced in this country and dump it in the Atlantic Ocean than to store it and sell it off at 10p or 12p a pound.  A number of people would like to evade that reality.</P>
    <P>These imports come into the Community under international trade arrangements, particularly GATT, and they cannot be stopped unless there is bilateral agreement.  There is a legally binding agreement between the two countries involved, the importers and the exporters. It is not easy to secure bilateral agreement between the Community and the supplying countries, so one must get voluntary agreement between the two countries concerned.</P>
    <P>I would like to lay to rest another of the inaccuracies regularly repeated over the last few days.  We did not lose most of the super-levy benefit secured in 1984. The original agreement fixed the definitive quota for most of the other member states at 1981 levels plus 1 per cent.  In our case it was fixed at 1983 level plus 4.6 per cent from the Community reserve. This represented 22 per cent more than <Col N="1995" /> the quota we would have had on the basis used for most of our partners, the milk-producing members of the Community, The 3 per cent reduction to take place in the next few years leaves that position completely unchanged in relative terms. We will still be over 20 per cent better off than if we had been treated on the same basis as other member states.  That fact appears to have been missed in some of the hysteria of the last few days.</P>
    <P>There have also been the suggestions that we should renegotiate our terms of accession to the Community.  I am not against that issue being considered if people generally want it, but I would point out that there is nothing in the price agreement concluded last week which goes against the terms of our accession. I would also point out to farmers what is at risk if we call into question our membership of the Community.  Payments from FEOGA since our accession have amounted to over £4,500 million. Last year alone they amounted to some £900 million.  This year they will probably be of much the same order.  This is massive expenditure to support Irish agriculture, far beyond our own resources were we not in the Community.  As well, Community price levels for all the main commodities are well above those applying on world markets &mdash; two and one half times higher in the case of butter, close to twice as high in the case of beef and grain.  Are people aware that the price of milk in New Zealand is as low as 22p per gallon?  That is the type of situation we would face if we were not in the Community.</P>
    <P>Even though circumstances have changed, the CAP will continue to serve us well in the future compared with any conceivable alternative.  The deal last week safeguards the essential elements of that Common Agricultural Policy.  It will help towards restoring market balance for the main products of concern to us and so improve the longer term prospects for Irish agriculture.  At the same time it leaves the beef issue for calmer consideration later, it assures us of an immediate and valuable price <Col N="1996" /> increase, and it maintains our relative advantage in milk production.  While it involves reductions in cereal prices, it has to be remembered that all member states had to accept some sacrifices and this includes the Mediterranean countries for which price reductions for some important products were even greater than for cereals.  This point is being conveniently ignored.</P>
    <P>Personally I would like a quota system for cereals.  It would be far more acceptable to us than price reductions of the magnitude with which we are faced this year, but not one other country in the Community will support us on this issue. Ironically last year the Commission proposed a quota regime in the Community but not one other country supported it and some of them were quite violent in their opposition to a quota system for cereals.  It may be possible to do it in the future and if we have to press any issue it is that we should have a quota system for cereals.  At present we have not a mechanism for setting up a quota system and there are 11 countries against us on the issue.  It is not possible at this juncture.</P>
    <P>Regarding the overall agreement, much of the criticism has been very hurtful. Words such as &ldquo;treachery&rdquo;, &ldquo;betrayal&rdquo;, &ldquo;sell out&rdquo; and &ldquo;defeatest attitude&rdquo; have been used by members of the Opposition, including their Leader. The dishonesty of these people who ignore the fact that there is a financial crisis and a major crisis of over supply is unacceptable to the people.  I do not believe the public will think well of the Opposition party or of any irresponsible people in the farm sector who try to ignore the realities.  If we do not face up to those realities the Common Agricultural Policy will be destroyed.  That is what I am there to safeguard.</P>

They wanted a 5 per cent reduction in milk output.  We must face the reality forced on us by the public outrage at huge food mountains which cannot be disposed of.

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  rejects the agricultural price package agreed to by the Minister for Agriculture on 25th April, 1986 in Luxembourg;</P>
      <P>(2)  requests the Minister for Foreign Affairs to demand a special meeting of the Council of Ministers to review the farm price package;</P>
      <P>(3)  requests the Taoiseach to undertake forthwith a major initiative at Heads of Government level to explain why Dáil Éireann rejects this agricultural price package and</P>
      <P>(4)  calls for the resignation of the Minister for Agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the Minister speaking on this motion one would be forgiven for thinking that it was the Agriculture Commission who were here making the case as to why we should be involved in the price negotiations and why we should be subject to the treatment that has been meted out to this country because of the inadequate approach by the Government and by the Minister for Agriculture.  I said in this House on 20 March last that if Cabinet promotions and demotions depended on performance there would surely be a different Minister across the floor.  The Minister got into a huff and tried to mock me.  Today it is he who is to be mocked.  He has let his country down, and he knows it.  His pathetic attempts this evening to justify the unjustifiable add insult to injury.  Nobody can <Col N="1998" /> accept the provisions of the Luxembourg agreement.  Fewer can accept that our Minister actually voted in favour of the package, that he failed even to register his disapproval.</P>
    <P>This is not just a case of Fianna Fáil opposing for the sake of opposition.  We are opposing this package because it is nothing short of a national disaster, a betrayal of our good faith in Europe and a kick in the teeth to our farmers.  Fianna Fáil are not alone in opposing this package. The Irish Farmers Association said last Friday, the day agreement was reached, that it was a black day for Irish farming with major implications for income and living standards.  The IFA leader, Mr. Joe Rea, believes cereals are no longer an option for Irish farmers.  He believes the Government have broken their commitment by accepting the 3 per cent milk quota cut and that the beef industry, despite the Minister's assurances, is now in a precarious position.  The president of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, Mr. Seán Kelly, said the Minister's acceptance of the milk quota cut was beyond understanding.  He said the net result of the deal was a 36 million gallon reduction in our national milk quota, without a common price increase.  Mr. Kelly also pointed out that the forced reduction of 4,500 cows from the national herd would lead to a £23 million annual loss of their progeny. Cattle producers have been left in disarray and the cereal sector has been devastated. Mr. John Tyrell of the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society predicted job losses in creameries, lower farm incomes for suppliers and higher industry overheads.</P>

      <P>The failure by the Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Deasy, to make even a gesture of dissent from yesterday's EC farm price package, is as astounding as it is deplorable.  As a result of his quiescent acceptance of the deal, the Irish farm and food sectors have been rocked to their foundations.

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> He even accepted a reneging on the written commitments of his counterparts in 1984 that there would be no future reduction in the Irish Milk quotas.  And the Minister made great play of that in the Dáil in the last two years.  Yet he acceded to a reduction on this occasion.  Why did the Minister <Col N="2000" /> do it?  In regard to milk, there is a cut in the quota of 2 per cent in 1987-88 and a 1 per cent reduction in 1988-89.  The Minister makes no attempt to explain why he accepted a 3 per cent cut.  Whatever he may say about increases in intervention stocks of butter and beef, whatever he may say about how well we did in 1984, whatever he may say about the budget, the simple fact is that he accepted a cut in our milk quota.  This was a vital national issue in 1984.  It is still a vital issue in 1986.  Why did the Minister not stand firm on this occasion?  Other countries took a firm stand.  Could the Minister not have taken a firm stand, alone if necessary, until, as in 1984, our vital national interest was respected?  I notice that the Minister is now quoting the milk price in New Zealand to justify his stand.  Where next will he go for support? Why did the Minister do this?  Was he even there when the decision was taken?  The lame excuse tendered by the Minister, that if the package was not accepted by the Agriculture Ministers it would be imposed by the Commission, has very serious implications for democracy and for Ireland.  Is the Minister saying that it is pointless for any Irish Minister to make a stand involving our national interest against the wishes of the Commission?  Is he saying that in future we must bow to the economic wishes of our partners?  If so, he has set us a very dangerous precedent and our future in Europe must be called into question.  We cannot afford to be whipping boys in a rich man's club.  We cannot afford to be subject to the whims of the more powerful nations in Europe.  The EC is supposed to be a partnership of equals.  But more and more it appears to be taking on the nature of George Orwell's <i>Animal Farm</i>, with some more equal than others.</P>

The defeatist attitude of this Government, which has permeated almost every action of the Minister for Agriculture, is evident in his handling of these negotiations.  It appears that he upset the establishment by invoking the veto in 1984, so it would not be correct for him to invoke it again. If that was his reasoning he has no business representing Ireland anywhere.  Our &ldquo;vital national interest&rdquo; is still as valid in 1986 as it was in 1984.  The withdrawal of the guarantee to impose no further milk quotas for Ireland was in itself sufficient reason for invoking the veto.  It is not for us to concern ourselves about how that would upset the Brussels bureaucrats. They are there to serve not to rule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> We in Fianna Fáil fully accept the need for a reform of the Common Agricultural Policy in order to eliminate the distortions which have been allowed to develop in the Community's farm policy and to bring it into line with its basic founding principles, that is, the preservation in Europe of the traditional family farm. Our people, our farmers, have a vital national interest at stake in this process of reform.  From an Irish and a European perspective, our attitude in seeking a return to the basic founding principles of the Community enshrined in the Treaty of Rome, is both positive and constructive. In their rigorous drive to rationalise the CAP, the European Commission are failing to abide by the statutes of the Treaty of Rome.  The latest policy and price proposals signal once again their failure to devise suitable and flexible instruments to achieve CAP reform within the context of the treaties.  In effect, the blunt approach of the Commission has made a mockery of Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome, which states that in the implementation of the CAP, account shall be taken of &ldquo;the particular nature of agricultural activity which results from the social structure of agriculture and from the structural and natural disparities between the various agricultural regions&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2003" /> Over the last two years, we have witnessed a lack of flexibility and discrimination in the application of the farm policy which undermines the Treaty and the basis of the CAP, and the CAP is in danger of undermining the very foundation of the European Community.  Let us not forget that the farm policy is the only fully integrated Community policy.</P>
    <P>The importance of agriculture to the Irish economy is widely acknowledged. Farming accounts for 14.2 per cent of GNP in Ireland.  This compares with 1.9 per cent in Germany, 2.1 per cent in the UK and 3.7 per cent in Holland.  Milk accounts for 33 per cent of gross agricultural output and 4.5 per cent of GNP. Dairy cows are vital to the beef industry, making up 80 per cent of the total cattle breeding herd.  The future of Irish agriculture is of crucial concern to all sectors of the economy.  The general economic situation with regard to unemployment and the crisis in the public finances dictates that our strategy must be one of exploiting our natural resources to increase output and generate economic growth.</P>
    <P>Therefore we must fight EC decisions which fail to reflect accurately the needs of Irish agriculture and its vital position in the national economy.  In this process, we are simply reminding the Brussels policy makers of the underlying principles of the CAP.  The founders of the Community's farm policy intended that a balanced expansion of agriculture should take place within the Community, taking into account the relative importance of the industry in the different member states, and its different stages of development. Why is it that countries like Holland and Britain, whose imports from third countries of artificial feed stuffs are the real reason behind the food surpluses, always get their way while Ireland, who under this Government play according to the rules, pay the penalty of quotas and restrictions.</P>
    <P>I have spoken up to now about milk because milk is what has been foremost in people's minds over the few days since the prices agreement was made, but there <Col N="2004" /> is also great concern about beef.  Here we are all in doubt about what is going on. The Minister for Agriculture has told us that the threat of major weakening of the beef intervention system has been removed but only for a time.  There is a risk that the EC Commission may take some action which would weaken the system.  Has the Minister surrendered on milk for an uncertain future about beef intervention?  The House and the country need an explanation.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of the prices agreement which are highly objectionable. The severe cut back in the cereals sector is going to hit very badly some of our most progressive farmers.  The zero price increase is very poor comfort to Irish farmers who suffered a 15 per cent drop in farm incomes last year. There is a 3 per cent gain in the green pound devaluation but this is a change which would have had to come anyhow, no thanks to the Minister, Deputy Deasy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I think this Government need very urgently to examine their conscience about their attitude towards agriculture.  Everybody in the agricultural industry believes that the Government have no interest in the industry and no regard to the importance of agriculture to the whole economy. Under the Minister's régime there has been no additional support for the industry.  Instead, we have had very substantial cutbacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government refuse to accept that agriculture forms the basis of this country's wealth and must be the basis for our economic recovery.  It has been clear for some time that the development of our agricultural industry will assume even greater importance in the context of our overall economic development.  We will have to rely on indigenous resources for the creation of new wealth and provision of new jobs.  The greatest economic challenge facing this country is in the creation of an integrated farm industry linking the <Col N="2005" /> producer to the processor, to the marketer and so to the consumer.</P>
    <P>The amendment tabled by my party reflects the genuine feeling of the whole country towards this Government's agricultural policy which has been highlighted once again by the performance of the Minister for Agriculture in Luxembourg last week.  The message to the Minister should now be quite clear.  He should now do the honourable thing and resign.</P>

In 1979 when we talked about farm prices and farm increases, inflation was running at 13 per cent and farm incomes were increased by 2 per cent from Brussels.  In 1980 inflation was at 18 per cent and farm income increases from Brussels under Fianna Fáil Ministers was 5 per cent.  In 1986 the increase is 3 per cent and inflation is running at 3 per cent.</P>
      <P>When the people over there criticise such facts they should think again about the damage they did during those years to farming here. They damaged the whole foundation of farming by lavish expenditure and, if they are re-elected, they will do the same again.  All the economists are saying just what they would do with the farmers.  It will be the way backwards for Fianna Fáil if they get back into Government.</P>

      <P>I have told them that and many of them are prepared to look into the details rather than criticise the overall dealing with this problem by the Minister over the past few months.  We must play a part in renegotiating the situation in view of the surpluses.  For too long we have said that Europe will not touch us, that we will get our £5 out of every £1 that we spend.  As long as that continues, we do not tackle any of the problems that have faced us in Europe over the past few years.  The farming organisations will tell us the type of support they got from the co-operatives in Europe over the last few years when these reductions were on the table.  They realise that the problem <Col N="2008" /> cannot be solved by just ignoring it and not trying to solve it.</P>
      <P>The fact that Europe has agreed to and the Minister has succeeded in getting a voluntary retirement scheme here is very important.  As a result quotas may not be affected.  I have not doubt that more than 3 per cent of people want to become involved in the cessation scheme and that as a result the quotas that we have and that this Minister won in 1984 of 4.6 per cent will not be affected. Remember the opposition of the ACOT committee in Meath and of Members here to the 4.6 per cent deal this Minister succeeded in securing in Brussels.  They said at the time that it was not a good deal.  Eight out of nine of the speakers yesterday said it was one of the best deals we ever got.  Because of last Friday it was the deal that everybody said it was.  It is incredible to hear the Opposition running down the overall package.</P>

    <P>I agree with the Minister that we need a quota system for cereals in the EC.  No other EC country except France supported us in this.  We should try to improve the situation and get quotas for cereals.  Until we get a quota system for our beef production also we will not have <Col N="2009" /> a proper income for farmers in that area. It is the way to ensure that people know where they are going and that we have markets for the producers of the various commodities in the State.</P>
    <P>I know from a large number of beef producers in my county that they have been prohibited over the years from making real profits because of the cost of the commodity &mdash; that is the calf.  We must consider the possibility of allowing the importation of calves straight into beef units in this country to enable beef producers to survive within the beef production systems we have in the State at the moment.  Up to the last 12 months our costs had been increasing rapidly, which took from the profitability in those areas.  However, there must be negotiations to provide safeguards in this regard and markets must be provided for our beef, which is the key to overall increases in income so far as beef producers are concerned.  We have had the worst weather in years over the last 12 months and the Opposition are inclined to blame the Government for that also&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Members of this House and rural organisations are seeking reductions in interest rates.  The increases which have been agreed because of the non-use of the veto last week will ensure higher incomes immediately for farmers. Coupled with a reduction in interest rates, farmers can and will flourish in 1986 because of the way the economy has been managed.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment in the name of Deputy Vincent Brady.  The debate so far has been somewhat heated, especially on the Government side, when discussing the most important industry in the country and the implications of what has taken place in Europe, not just last week, but over the last couple of years.</P>
      <P>It is suicidal for Ireland, because of the importance of agriculture to the economy, to sacrifice our right to develop our national asset, the agricultural industry. Over the last three years we have witnessed the Government going on our behalf to the Council of Ministers and we have seen decisions taken there which adversely affected the agriculture sector. At present our output is 65 per cent to 70 per cent as efficient as the average in the Community.  Yet in regard to beef and milk decisions have been imposed on our farmers which do not allow them to develop any further, including the super-levy on milk and the uncertainty in relation to beef.</P>
      <P>Deputy Farrelly said that the beef producers are happy, but he must not have been talking to very many because many of our major beef producers put in cattle in October and November last year at 101p per pound and in January and February, having fed them with tonnes of meal and silage, they got 101p per pound for their beef&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Farrelly must have been talking to people who do not produce beef.  The beef industry is very <Col N="2011" /> important.  Although the Minister mentioned great progress and the fact that there was no decision made in regard to carcase intervention at the end of the year, that option is still open to the Commission.  Why have the Commission and other member states taken the action which they have in recent years, especially against a small country like Ireland which is so dependent on agriculture, with 40 per cent of its workforce directly or indirectly involved in agriculture?  No other economy in Europe depends as much as we do on agricultural exports.  In exporting we must cross two seas, and no other country is in that position.  Serious decisions have been made since 1983 which adversely affect almost every farmer in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies may interrupt as much as they like but it will not change the decisions which the Government have taken.  It is as simple as that.  The imposition of the super-levy was disastrous.  We are now asked to take a further cut of 3 per cent while at the same time the Dutch farmer can pump out milk to the extent of 1,400 gallons per cow while the farmers in Connacht are allowed only 600 to 700 gallons per cow.  We know that there are surpluses and budgetary problems but we must ask how these surpluses are created and by whom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We produce most of our agricultural produce naturally from green grass.  No other country in Europe does the same, although France is closest to us in that regard.  Germany, Holland, Belgium and England are substantial importers of cereal substitutes.  There is a direct relationship with the surpluses in the Community and the importation of cereal substitutes.  We are told that there are 15 million tonnes of cereals in intervention, but this year the Community will import 15 million tonnes of cereal substitutes. What action was taken last week on that matter?  None.  Did the Minister not think that it was time for him to say that no <Col N="2012" /> more adverse decisions could be taken against our farmers or other small farmers in the Community while that situation continued?  More than 15 million tonnes are being imported from outside the Community while at the same time 15 million tonnes of cereals go into intervention.</P>
    <P>We have failed miserably to highlight these problems.  Surplus production of beef in the Community this year will be 400,000 tonnes approximately.  The concessionary imports, balancing sheets and all the other agreements with Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and other countries will amount to 430,000 tonnes.  We must ask ourselves: who is creating the surpluses?  Are the Community farmers creating them or are the farmers in Thailand, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, the US or New Zealand creating them?  What contribution are the farmers from those countries being asked to make?  The Council of Ministers in their decision did not deal with that.  A country like Ireland must continue to point out those matters.  Successive Governments, Fianna Fáil and Coalition, did so successfully up to 1983 but what has changed since then?  I suspect the answer is the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I recall that on Friday week the matter was raised at the European Parliament. I must point out that the Fine Gael representatives were with us in voting against this, but, unfortunately, their Government let them down the following week by voting for some of these proposals. However, on that day in a hail of glory the Government announced the establishment of a sub-committee, consisting of four Ministers, to fight these adverse proposals tooth and nail in Europe.  The following Monday the Minister went off to Europe.  Had the sub-committee met?  Had he been in contact with the members of the sub-committee? What guidelines was he given? Where was the tooth and the nail?  I do not know if such a sub-committee exists.</P>
    <P>From Monday to Friday the Minister was at the meetings on his own.  Over the weekend I read somewhere that he had been in touch with the Taoiseach but I should like to know if the sub-committee <Col N="2013" /> made any input other than to throw aside their tooth and their nail and leave the Minister to fight out the case alone and lose as he did.  I sympathise with the Minister who was left alone by a Government who do not seem to care one whit about agriculture here.  That is not surprising when one considers that the Government consist of Labour and Fine Gael.  The consistent attitude of the Government has been to undermine the agricultural community and, regardless of what Government Deputies may say, the Government are making a lot of progress in that regard.</P>
    <P>The EC in recent times have been preoccupied with budgetary and surplus problems but we must at all times plead our national interest.  What industry is more important to our economy than the agricultural industry?  I do not think any industry is more important, but no interest is being taken in it in Europe.  I shall give some reasons why that has developed. Reference has been made by the Minister, and others, to surpluses and the problems regarding price increases from 1979 to 1982.  However, there was no reference in those price fixings &mdash; the super-levy had been proposed but we would not have it &mdash; to the substantial packages of additional measures given to the Irish Government to help them because of our inflationary problems. Where are those schemes now?  We have seen by the action of our Government since 1983, not by the EC, the AI subsidy scheme being dropped.  The lime subsidy was stopped and the western package is at a standstill.  Work on western drainage schemes has virtually halted.  Farm modernisation was abolished by the Government in December 1983, six months before the EC decided to do so.</P>
    <P>We have lost hundreds of millions of pounds that should be in circulation for the benefit of Irish farmers and our economy as a whole.  What was done about that?  It was those facts that Deputy Farrelly was referring to earlier.  Decisions in regard to those schemes were taken by the Government.  When the EC were making decisions and our Ministers were in a position to plead a case because of <Col N="2014" /> the special circumstances here, we were given extra help but in recent years what has happened?  I am sure that on many occasions Ministers from other countries asked our Minister why he had abolished the farm modernisation scheme, why he had not implemented the western package and why he had not sought the AI, lime and silage subsidies.  The reason was that the Department of Finance had said no, they were not going to put up our IR£.</P>
    <P>It was evident last Friday that the other member states were aware that they were dealing with an Irish Government more concerned about being good Europeans than doing their job of looking after vital national interests at home.  In the areas of regional and social policies massive cuts have been proposed for this year. The time has come for the Government, not just for the Opposition, farming organisations, co-ops and those interested in agriculture, to realise that it is important for us all to have a meeting called of all interested parties to deal with this matter.  We have tried to strengthen the hand of the Minister in fighting the national cause in Europe.  Every time we open our mouths it is to help the Irish case and we were very disappointed to find, when we got some recognition in Europe, our Minister and our Government accepting Commission decisions.  If our production was uniform with other producers in Europe those decisions might be acceptable but at present I do not think we can tolerate them.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister said we produce 6 per cent of Community beef and yet we hold 16 per cent of its total intervention stock.  I do not think that is too bad when we have to export 80 per cent of our beef.  What other Community country has to export 80 per cent of its beef?  No other country has to do that and it is only logical to conclude that we would have more in intervention than other countries.  Last year we sold about 15 per cent of our total beef into intervention. We produce 5½ per cent of the Community's milk, yet we hold 10 per cent of its total intervention stock.  We sold 40 per cent of our butter into intervention. <Col N="2015" /> Why do we have to do that?  We have to sell into intervention because as a result of concessions New Zealand butter is displacing Irish butter on the British market.  How much action was taken last Friday against the importation of New Zealand butter?  I do not think any action was taken in regard to that.</P>
    <P>The Government seem to be more European as far as agricultural production is concerned than the Dutch, the Germans or the British.  They have thrown the interests of Irish farmers out the window and allowed this to develop to the extent that our farmers are to be penalised although they have not reached 65 per cent or 70 per cent of the productivity of the average farmer in the Community. That is a disgraceful indictment of any Government.  The Minister should resign and so should the entire Cabinet. The Government have put at risk the jobs of 40 per cent of the working population by their actions in the past three years, with the highlight coming last Friday.</P>
    <P>It is time for the Government, rather than playing politics with farmers and their livelihoods for the sake of getting a medal here and there from some European institution, whether it is the Taoiseach or some other Minister, to go to Europe when considering the CAP and ensure that the interests of Irish agriculture are protected.  That was not done last week or in the past three years.  The time has come for the Government to call a special meeting of the Council of Ministers to highlight once again what was accepted in the European institutions, and in the Council of Ministers up to November 1982 when Fianna Fáil left office.</P>

I <Col N="2019" /> cannot speak for Deputy Lenihan's frame of mind when, as Minister for Agriculture, he reached that agreement.  But I can say that he has shown an absolute, I will not say ignorance but a complete lack of knowledge of what is the process of decision-making in the EC.  I will revert to Deputy MacSharry's remarks in a moment.  There are a few other points I want to make&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It has been suggested that my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, should not have arrived at an agreement last week.  I should like to ask the Members of the Opposition benches to reflect on what would have been the results.  This is a perfectly fair and objective question to pose: what would have been the result of not arriving at an agreement last week?  The result would have been that the matter would have been postponed, to be considered by the Heads of State or Governments, meeting as a European Council in June.  By then we would have had two further months in which there would have been no green pound change, complete uncertainty about prices, complete uncertainty about all of the premia in the beef sector &mdash; and as Deputies Opposite know they are worth a lot of money to us on a daily basis.  One might well ask: what would have been happening in the meantime? In the meantime the Community would have continued having the budgetary problems it has now.  As a member of the European Parliament Deputy MacSharry knows all about them; he knows what is the situation there.  The rest of us know about them, some of us from our dealings with the Community, the rest of us should <Col N="2020" /> know about them from the discussions we have here and from what we read in the newspapers.  In June we would have reached a point at which the Community and the heads of State or Governments would have been even more conscious of the present budgetary difficulties.  I would suspect that we would have found then, had we been trying to arrive at an agreement on farm policies for the coming marketing year which has already commenced in respect of a number of products, that our last state would have been worse than our first.  The consequence of the delay would have been that we would not have got even the agreement we now have.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan has delivered himself of the usual diatribe about not using the veto and not voting against the package. Those are all kinds of buzz phrases people use when they do not want to talk about what goes on in the course of the negotiations. The fact of the matter is that in each one of the sectors my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, by a judicious combination with various of his colleagues in the Council, has rolled the Community back from where the Commission wanted to start off and, in so doing, has gained advantages for Irish farmers they would not have had otherwise.</P>
      <P>I want to say a few little words for some of the outside commentators who have been talking about the events of the last week on the media.  I will not name them but I know they will know about whom I am talking.  Some of those outside commentators, and I worked for some of them myself at one time, have negotiated as far as arriving&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Now we will look at the situation in relation to the main products. In relation to beef one might ask: what has been brought about?  We have at least deferred the main thrust of the Commission's proposals about intervention in beef with a view to decisions being taken by the end of this year.  The provision for intervention has been kept open for carcasses for the remainder of this year. We all know that means that once the Commission in their management function find that carcass intervention is required and that the provision for it is left standing in the regulations, we will have intervention for carcass beef.  Had the Minister for Agriculture not conducted the battle which he did, that would have been taken out.</P>

      <P>The beef regime rating remains unchanged in that regard.  We have also the benefit of a green pound change in the beef sector.  Let us look at the dairying sector, where we also had the benefit of a green pound change.  Having gained a net advantage in the super-levy negotiations, we are starting off in a far more advantageous position with a higher <Col N="2022" /> production base than any other country in the Community.  It was strange to hear Deputy MacSharry commenting on the CAP.  He is the man who claimed that he had killed the super-levy three years in a row.  We have heard of hydra-headed monsters, with one head after another being knocked off, but Deputy MacSharry must have the record in this House for having killed any European policy: he said he killed it three years in a row.  I had to come along, finally, and put the animal down and Deputy Deasy had to put a decent regime in its place, during the super-levy negotiations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>By what he achieved in those negotiations the Minister for Agriculture has saved Irish cereal producers £13 million this year, at a minimum, and probably a great deal more.  We have a green pound change of 3 per cent for animal products and 1½ per cent for crops. If Deputy Treacy would like to stray outside agriculture to make an argument I will do it with him happily, but it will have to be outside the Chamber because, as you know, I am a very orderly Deputy.</P>
      <P>As I said, we have a green pound devaluation of 3 per cent for animal products and 1½ per cent for crops.  I cannot remember the last time a Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture brought about such a situation.  In the last few weeks Fianna Fáil Deputies did not have the wit even to suggest that we might go about that.  Now they find it is not enough.  The Commission had proposed 2 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively, for these two sectors.  As a result of Deputy Deasy's work we will have an extra gain of about £75 million.  Added to the rest of what we have got, £75 million is a sizeable amount.</P>
      <P>In the light of all that, can any reasonable person accept any of the suggestions made in their amendment by the Opposition, least of all that the Minister for Agriculture, at the behest of Deputy Michael Noonan, who internationally never negotiated anything in his life, and at the behest of outside commentators, who have never been involved in international negotiations should resign? What madness could have led the Opposition to suggest that the Minister for Agriculture should resign?  That amendment obviously must be cast aside by the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. It was bad enough having the Minister for Agriculture capitulating in <Col N="2024" /> regard to the price package but it is even worse to find a failed Minister for Finance coming in here to hurl insults across the House with the two hands of the Department of Finance.  The Taoiseach ensured that the hands of Deputy Dukes would be kept well away from the Department of Finance before any further damage would be done to the Irish economy.  The Minister for Agriculture came back with his hands behind his back and it is a disgrace that the Minister for Justice came into the House and for 75 per cent of his time resorted to hurling insults at his fellow Deputies.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the price package was nothing but a capitulation by the Minister for Agriculture and abandonment of the farming community.  We are talking about at least 40 per cent of the population of Ireland.  All we want is that the CAP principles would be adhered to to ensure and maintain an adequate income for farmers.  Nobody can say that Irish farmers have that, particularly after this price package.</P>
      <P>Another part of the CAP is the maintenance of preference.  It is well known that the incomes of Irish farmers are less than their counterparts in other EC countries. We have many reports of surveys to support that.  Farmers in dairying, particularly, had hoped they would at least maintain their position and they felt secure because the Minister for Agriculture told them repeatedly that not alone had he secured a good deal for Irish milk suppliers in 1984, but in the Official Report for 4 April 1984, at column 1234, he is reported as follows:</P>
      <P>However, after some very difficult negotiations, we succeeded in reaching an agreement that gave us a basic entitlement of our 1983 level of deliveries, plus more than 4.6 per cent.  In addition, it was agreed that not only could this entitlement not be reduced in future years but that we would have priority in regard to the distribution of any additional quantities which become available, for examination, from production shortfalls or market improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2025" /> Against the background of the Community's serious financial difficulties and the surplus situation in the milk market, the arrangement achieved for this country is remarkably favourable. It starts us off on a basis well above that applicable in most of the Community. This is a satisfactory outcome indeed and goes well beyond what seemed possible throughout most of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>Either the Minister is dishonest now or he was dishonest then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>He told this House that we would be entitled to our 1983 production, that that would not be reduced in future years.  It has now been reduced by 3 per cent.  I do not know how the Minister crawled from that meeting without even a protest.  Spain gave notice that they were going to refer the matter to the European Court of Justice.  Why could our Minister not have made a similar stand?  The dairying sector of the farming community is devastated and, in particular, the new entrants into milk production, who I am sure visited various Ministers and Deputies on all sides of the House asking that their future be assured. They were looking for a milk quota of only 25,000 or 30,000 gallons.  What they wanted would not exceed in total 15 million gallons.  Yet the Minister let 36 million gallons flow out of our quota without a protest.  That spelled the death knell for these applicants.</P>
      <P>There are also the unfortunate farmers whose herds are hit by disease and who looked to the Government and the Minister to protect their interests.  They sought to ensure that the principle of maintaining a reasonable farm income &mdash; the fundamental bedrock of the Common Agricultural Policy &mdash; would be adhered to.  They looked in vain, because their future was not secured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A while ago the Minister talked about what he had gained for the cereal producers. He claimed that the present position would exempt 70 per cent of Irish grain <Col N="2026" /> growers, but did not refer to the fact that 70 per cent produce only 16 per cent of total production.  The 70 per cent about whom he is talking are farmers who grow a small amount of cereals for their own use, but the adverse effects of the price negotiations on genuine producers will be devastating and will put 40 per cent of them out of business.  The Minister could have been a little more honest and not given this distorted figure.  However, distorted figures are nothing new to the Government.  In 1984 the Department could not make up the figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>For the first year and a half of Coalition Government we were trying to recover from the humiliation, not alone in Europe but throughout the world, of not being able to tot up simple figures to secure a reasonable quota for our farmers.</P>
      <P>With regard to cereal production, the 3 per cent devaluation was also thrown in and the producers were allowed only 1.5 per cent.  They are twice as badly off as other sectors of the farming community. They were abandoned.  We were told that there were some advantages in the beef area, but with regard to beef intervention there is nothing whatsoever except a deferral of a decision.  That is very little consolation to beef producers who are already in serious trouble.</P>
      <P>There are some aspects of this package which may be of benefit if the Departments of Agriculture and Finance are serious about them.  The FEOGA grant aids are again allowed for non-intervention products.  If the Minister insists that products which do not contribute to the traditional milk lakes qualify for this grant aid, some good will ensue.  But, having regard to previous implementation of policy, I have some serious doubts about that.  This is a concession which could be of considerable benefit to the dairying industry, and to that extent I welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the cessation scheme we will lose 36 million gallons of milk.  We are <Col N="2027" /> not told how this scheme will be implemented. It could perhaps be from 5 per cent to 7 per cent reduction in some areas and nothing in other areas.  The probable outcome is that the farmers in the west will lose an inordinate amount of milk and that other areas will not be so badly affected.  If this cessation scheme must be implemented, I ask that it be implemented fairly across the board.</P>
    <P>These price negotiations will have serious repercussions on farmers already in financial difficulties.  The farming community owe £1,500 million to the financial institutions.  More and more farmers are going into receivership and liquidation, with financial institutions putting extreme pressure on them.  This is happening when the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank are allowing the banking institutions to charge exhorbitant interest rates of up to 17.5 per cent and 18 per cent.  These rates should at least be halved.  It is about time that the Departments of Agriculture and Finance took farming seriously.  The excuse was made that the Minister caved in at these negotiations because of the embarrassment of surpluses in Europe, but we contribute a minimal amount to these.  The reality is that New Zealand imports into the United Kingdom each year amount to more than our total butter exports. Our total exports are of the order of 75,000 to 80,000 tonnes.  If the principle of community preference were adhered to, surely Ireland, as a member state, would deserve priority in that area?  If we are being asked to reduce our milk production by 3 per cent, how many percentage points are the third countries being asked to cut back?</P>

      <P>The reality is that the third countries will increase their output, as they have been doing.  However long we continue to decrease our output, there will be no effect because the difference will be made up by the third countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importation of cereal substitutes contributes in a major way to increase in <Col N="2028" /> output by the major producing countries. Had the Minister any success in getting a curtailment of these exports?  The answer is that he did not.  I cannot see how any package can work if only those on one side of the equation make the sacrifices. Confining new entrants to milk production, throwing to the wolves farmers in severe financial difficulties and those with diseased herds would be bad enough even if third country imports were curtailed to the same extent.  I realise that there are GATT and other agreements, but we also have an agreement.  There is the Treaty of Rome and there are the principles of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Unless we have a Minister and a Government that will stand up for those principles, adhere to them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He was faced, in the case of beef, with the termination of permanent intervention by November 1987 and the complete elimination of carcase intervention as well as the different premium systems this year.

      <P>The Minister succeeded in achieving for Ireland a final agreement which means a 3 per cent adjustment for lifestock produce and a 1.5 per cent adjustment for other produce.  This is a major gain and represents an increase in income of about £75 million in the pockets of our farmers.  That is nothing to sniff about.  That is more than what the Opposition have done for the farming community.  As well as that, the Minister succeeded in retaining the calf subsidy, the variable premium and the special Irish element in the suckler cow premium. We are the only country in the EC who have received those incentives.  This will have a tremendous effect in restoring prestige, and what I would call initiative, to the agricultural industry.</P>

Maher, a man who led the Irish Farmers Association for many years and who said that it was high time that the critics should cut out the dillydallying and to call a spade a spade as far as agriculture is concerned.  Agriculture, as far as I can see, has been made a political football by political parties in this House and throughout the country down through the years.  I must say that what is needed now is a realistic approach for an agreed agricultural plan.  I would make an appeal to Fianna Fáil to cut out the nonsense and come back from cloud cuckooland and make sure that the agricultural sector of our economy is not forgotten.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The damage that this settlement, which has been accepted by the Minister for Agriculture, will do to our primary industry is clear and quantifiable. The impact it will have on the principle sectors, milk, cereals and beef, will be such that in many cases it will push farmers over the edge of survival.  The effect on dairying which is still the only way in which the great majority of our farmers can provide an adequate income for themselves and their families, the direct loss to grain growers and the uncertain and doubtful outlook for beef all combined will make this package disastrous in his implications and totally unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The truth is that the very words of this Government motion confirm the main thrust of the arguments which are being put forward by Fianna Fáil, by the farming organisations and their leaders.  The motion asks us to accept that the settlement made by the Irish Minister for Agriculture protects the principles of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Whether it does or not, and I certainly would argue that it does not, the real point for Dáil Éireann to consider is whether or not it protects the interests of Irish farmers. The Government are certainly not even attempting to claim that it does because it can be clearly proved that it does not. Dáil Éireann should not be asked to accept a price package of direct and immediate detriment to Irish farmers because, in some vague way, it conforms to an undefined set of principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our amendment sets out a very specific programme of action for the Government in the short term.  We are urging that the Government embark immediately on this programme.  Firstly, that Dáil Éireann, representative of all the sections of the Irish community and recognising that this matter affects all sections of the Community, rejects the Minister's package.  I think we can do nothing less than that. Secondly, we ask for a meeting of the <Col N="2035" /> Council of Foreign Ministers, the political body responsible for the affairs of the Community, to meet as a matter of urgency and review this package in its broad implications for the economy of this country.  Thirdly, we are asking the Taoiseach, whom we are always being told is such a great European and so widely respected by Heads of Government in Europe, that he now use that influence, if it exists, to defend Irish farmers when they clearly and urgently need to be defended.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Taoiseach went to a meeting of that strange and doubtful Bilderberg Conference in Glasgow last Saturday.  Before that, he went to Holland for a conference of his Christian Democrat friends, some of whom are Heads of Government.  We are asking that he now undertake a much more relevant and necessary trip.  Let him go to the heads of the Christian Democratic parties with whom we are told he has such good relations and mobilise them now in defence of Ireland's deepest economic interests.</P>
    <P>Our motion firmly calls for the resignation of the Minister for Agriculture.  We have good sound solid reason for making that call.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no one to replace him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, we believe that he cannot claim that he has discharged his responsibilities on behalf of Irish farmers or protected their interests by his agreeing to this particular package.  His sell-out is of such an extent that it must call for his resignation.  But we are basing this call for his resignation on another ground.  This particular Minister for Agriculture solemnly told this House in April 1984 and I quote:</P>
      <P>Furthermore, it was agreed that not only could this entitlement not be reduced in future years, that we would have priority in regard to the distribution of any additional quantities which became available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2036" /> That was the famous 6 per cent increase in milk.</P>
    <P>That undertaking, of which so much was made at the time, has now been shown to be worthless.  It has been torn up.  I submit that any Minister, in any democratic parliament, who so clearly made a specific claim of this nature affecting a vital national interest and is now prepared to accept its being reneged upon must agree that his personal ministerial position is intolerable.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture attempts to justify this disastrous package and this discarding of Ireland's interest in the Community by pointing to the level of food surpluses that now exist.  Dáil Éireann should not accept that argument, nor should the Minister have accepted it in Brussels.  Despite what the Minister has suggested, Irish agriculture is not the culprit where these surpluses are concerned and it is incomprehensible to us that the Minister for Agriculture would not point out cogently and consistently again and again where the real trouble lies in the accumulation of those surpluses.</P>
    <P>That real trouble springs from the imports into the Community: dairy produce from New Zealand, beef from Eastern Europe, cereals and substitute foodstuffs from around the world.  The Community is at present importing 80,000 tonnes of New Zealand butter and that concession has been extended.  The Community is at present importing 400,000 tonnes of beef.  The Community is at present importing 10 million tonnes of cereals and 25 million tonnes of cereal substitutes.  That is where the surpluses are coming from.</P>
    <P>Ireland is responsible for 2 per cent of the production of fresh dairy products in the Community and the Netherlands, with only two-fifths of our land area, produces three times the quantity of milk that we do.  Before any disastrous price-cutting production-limiting regime is imposed on Ireland these imports should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>For some time I have been calling for this country to prepare a balance sheet of our position in the European Community. We should draw up that balance <Col N="2037" /> sheet to determine the facts about our relative performance in the Community and the impact of membership on our economy at this stage.  It should include among other matters an examination of the following: what is the present overall economic situation in Ireland compared with other EC countries?  Have disparities between this country and other member states increased or decreased since we joined?  What is the net result in regard to job losses and gains as a result of our membership of the Community in so far as this can be reasonably accurately ascertained?  Who gains most and who loses most by the Community's liberal trade policy <i>vis-á-vis</i> the rest of the world?  The extent to which manufacturing industry here has seriously declined over recent years is due to free access to our markets by our Community partners. They are just some of the things which we should set out in black and white.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of such a balance sheet would be to have a basic document on which we would base our claim for renegotiation of our terms of membership. That is the main argument I want to put forward in the course of this debate, that we must now, as a matter of national urgency and priority, seek a renegotiation of our terms of membership.  It is totally legitimate for us to seek a renegotiation at this stage.  We joined a certain kind of Community.  That Community has now been radically altered in one of its fundamental elements, namely, the Common Agricultural Policy.  That radical change in that Common Agricultural Policy transforms our position and our prospects in the Community.  We are entitled, as a result, to have that basic position of membership reviewed to the extent to which it can be shown, justified and revised.  That should be this Government's stance.  It is not an irresponsible one.  It would not be unique. There are clear precedents for it.  It is something that the balance sheet to which I have referred, when prepared, will clearly show to be absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>I have emphasised again and again that the state of Irish agriculture and its future prospects are not something that affects <Col N="2038" /> Irish farmers only, but that it is of major significance for the entire national economy. In the deepest sense of the phrase, the prosperity of our agricultural industry is a vital national interest for Ireland. This is a time for us to go back to first principles.  There were many reasons which influenced our decision to join the European Common Market in 1973 but, beyond any doubt, the most clear-cut, definite and quantifiable reason was the benefits that we would gain for Irish farmers and consequently for the Irish economy as a whole from the operation of the Common Agricultural Policy of the Community.</P>
    <P>If the Common Agricultural policy is to be dismantled as now seems to be the case, &mdash; if Irish agricultural production is to be severely restricted and cut back, if the natural expansion of the industry is to be prevented and Irish farming reduced once again to a subsistence level, then the very validity of our membership of the European Community is eroded. That is the crucial factor that must dominate our approach and our thinking in the crisis situation with which we in Dáil Éireann are dealing in this debate.  It is a national crisis.</P>
    <P>Our economy is basically different from that of most other European member states.  Our population structure is different and our society has a different composition.  Our vital national interests are, therefore, different.  Something which may be of only marginal importance to one of our more developed partners in the Community can be of crucial significance for us.  This is the situation in regard to agriculture in general and dairying in particular.</P>
    <P>There is no other member state of the Community for whom agriculture is such a vital economic factor as it is for us.  It is all very well for some of the developed industrial countries to press for certain budgetary policies, knowing full well that the impact of the implementation of those policies on agriculture will be of only marginal significance in their overall economies.  For us that is not the case. We are different.  Agriculture for us is an essential, important element of our entire <Col N="2039" /> economy.  I believe that the fact that our Minister failed to put this case on this occasion was a crucial mistake and a crucial missing part.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that we in Fianna Fáil are asking Dáil Éireann, as the national Parliament, to take a clear and decisive stand on this issue and to reject this price settlement which, to the consternation of farmers, has been so supinely accepted by the Minister for Agriculture.  This settlement will have serious implications for our farmers immediately this year, direct implications for their income and the viability of their farm enterprises.  But something even more important still is involved.  If we do not take a stand now, if we do not hold the pass, it is my view, the view of this party and I think the view of most serious and impartial observers, that we are facing into the decline of Irish farming and Irish agriculture as we have known it.  I believe that these changes in themselves, and more significantly in what they herald for the future, are leading to the elimination of a large segment of the Irish agricultural industry and a new wave of de-population in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Things are difficult in Irish farming today.  There have been restrictions, cutbacks and price reductions over the past three years, with various important productive schemes discontinued.  The general economic recession has affected farmers as it has affected every other section.  There was a disastrous season in 1985 with 17 per cent overall fall in income.  There has been a cruel, harsh spring this year.  It is absolutely true that farmers throughout the country, especially small farmers and small western farmers, have their backs to the wall and that their very survival as farmers is at stake.  Into that situation, there is now thrown this disastrous price package with all its implications for farm output and incomes.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot seriously ask Dáil Éireann to accept their whitewash motion.  It is not in accordance with the economic realities that confront the farmers of Ireland today.  I believe it would <Col N="2040" /> be a sickening exercise in hypocrisy if Dáil Éireann were to accept it.  Whatever about the Minister, we should not be seen to be subserviently accepting this contemptuous treatment of our national interests by the Community.  I am convinced that the Minister for Agriculture made an historic mistake in Brussels this year in accepting this package, not voting against it and not using the veto.  We still have not heard the full reason why he did not vote against it.</P>
    <P>I am appealing to Dáil Éireann not to compound that mistake by this Minister but, as the national Parliament, to stand up for our national interests.  We were elected by the people to protect their interests at just such times as this and we must discharge that duty by compelling this supine Government to act in defence of our agricultural industry and thereby in the interests of the Irish people as a whole.  If we do not and if Dáil Éireann accepts this whitewash motion and refuses to stand by its responsibilities to Irish farmers, then this will certainly be regarded as a black day for our parliamentary democracy in so far as Irish farmers are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying to the debate. If the truth is bitter that is unfortunate, but the Deputy should get his facts right. The latest figures indicate that the Community has approximately 13 million tonnes of cereals and that is a reduction over the amount in the past few years. That reduction is due to our insistence that the quantities be reduced.  For the first time in many years there has been a reduction in beef imports.  Again, this has been done because of our insistence and we have had the support of only one country, France.  This week we have heard people say they will not accept the agreement, but they do not realise the situation.   Most of the imports of cereal substitutes and beef are unfortunately, covered by the GATT.  Such agreements are legal bilateral agreements.</P>

      <P>We did not get it automatically. The Commission proposed last week that Ireland would get 1.98 per cent on animal products, not 3 per cent, and only 1 per cent on cereals.  We had to fight exceptionally hard to get the full 3 per cent devaluation for milk and beef and 1.5 per cent for cereals.  In the recent realignment the French got a 6 per cent devaluation in the green pound.  Were they allowed 6 per cent automatically, as Deputy Noonan would have us believe? No, they got 3 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not from Doneraile. What would have happened with a 3 per cent devaluation in the green pound?  We would have had a net 7 per cent tax on every agricultural commodity leaving the country.  Yet people like this are lecturing us on how we should run the country and devalue.  It would have really crippled agriculture.  Everything would be subject to a 7 per cent tax.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey said we are doing badly out of our membership <i>vis-á-vis</i> agriculture.  When I became Minister in 1982 our net take from the Commission in regard to agriculture was £400 million. Last year it was £890 million.  We expect it to be at least the same in the current year.  I do not consider that to be a basis for renegotiation on the grounds that agriculture is doing badly.  It is quite an achievement.  Deputy Haughey at the end of his statement was on the point of blaming me for the bad weather.  We have had a misfortunate year.</P>

I explained in my opening statement that we have an arrangement with the Commission whereby co-operatives in the poorer parts of the country will not lose any extra milk under the new arrangement.  We will be able to operate a cessation scheme within the bounds of each co-operative area and that will enable us to bring about a rational restructuring of the milk system. It should not cause any problems for Deputy MacSharry, the co-operatives or the farmers involved.</P>

      <P>Molaim an tairiscint in ainm Deputy V. Brady, I move the motion put down in the name of Deputy Vincent Brady:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann requests the Government to take whatever steps may be necessary to ensure that insurance cover for motor vehicles and motor cycles is made available to all members of the public under conditions and at premium rates which are fair and reasonable.</P>
      <P>It is obvious from the Government amendment to this motion that they are supporting the motion as put down by the Fianna Fáil Party.  While I am pleased that is the case, I feel that the Minister will be at some pains to justify the steps he refers to in his amendment in support of this amendment.  While the Minister obviously takes on board the thrust of our proposal, I must criticise him immediagely for not having taken the appropriate steps to ensure that insurance is made available to motorists and motor cyclists at reasonable costs.  I do not have to wait for the 1984 blue book, the summary of insurance company activities, to provide evidence to the House and to the country of the cash crisis that exists now in the general insurance sector of the insurance industry.  We are all aware of the premium increases and the restrictive cover in all the areas of general insurance, public liability, employer's liability, motor insurance, household business and fire damage.  Every one of those areas of insurance is a loss maker for the insurance industry.  There is general agreement both in the House and outside concerning the major causes of high insurance costs. They are as follows: court and legislative procedure for claims processing, the rising crime wave, escalation in the number of uninsured drivers and poor safety precautions in industry, in public places and on our roads network.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal specifically with the question of motor insurance costs and motor cyclists' insurance cost and if the Minister could confine himself to that area it would be of considerable benefit to the hard-pressed motorist rather than widening the debate as indicated in his amendment which refers to improving the insurance environment generally.  I request the Minister not to do this in the debate and to give us details of the steps which the Government have taken over the last few years to ensure the provision of insurance at a reasonable cost.  However, no steps have been taken and the Minister will be at some pains to prove his point&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The long suffering motoring public are demanding cheaper motor <Col N="2055" /> insurance and fair play for all categories and classes of drivers.  Action is needed from the Government in dealing with uninsured drivers and in simplifying the legal system.  Action is also needed from the insurance companies in the method of premium pricing, bonus flexibility and the elimination of restrictive practices. Action is required from the motorist in higher standards of driving, road safety and car maintenance.</P>
      <P>The cost of car insurance is not about to come down despite the fact that certain agencies and interests have been predicting this for some time.  Insurance losses were about £25 million, that is the difference between premiums and claims in 1984.  It is expected that that figure might well be in excess of £52 million in 1985, therefore, it is nonsense to suggest that no matter what changes are brought in by the Minister in the short term we will have reduced motor insurance costs.  We are ranked as the most expensive country in Europe for motoring costs, including those of petrol, repairs, tax and insurance. The Irish insurance industry has had a pretty dismal decade in so far as these matters are concerned and many brokers have gone into liquidation over the past ten years.  The Government have had to come to the rescue of two major motor insurers, the PMPA and ICI, with possible total losses escalating to anywhere between £400 million and, if we believe the recent &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme, in excess of £600 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have indicated their awareness often enough in so far as the crisis in general insurance, in particular motor insurance, is concerned, but we are all well aware of their reluctance to take effective action, which is unforgiveable as far as the motoring public are concerned.  We are talking about somewhere in the region of 800,000 motorists who have indicated, not just to Members of the House, but by way of action through their insurers, that they are not satisfied that the Government have taken any worthwhile action to resolve their problem.  We are a claims-conscious <Col N="2056" /> society and greater vigilance and investigation must be exercised against overstated and often fraudulent claims.  There is a need for a more efficient claims settlement procedure which could help to reduce costs.  I can give the Minister an instance which indicates how it pays to sue.  In the recent past a burglar who was caught in the act coming out of a premises not far from this House caught his hand on the window glass which he had broken to get in.  Although he was caught in the act he has now sued the company and has stated that the place was unsafe.  He is claiming under their public liability insurance that he should be compensated. That is an indication of how things have developed here over the years.</P>
    <P>The statistics and analyses from all the reports over the years show that dangerous driving, failure to use safety belts and driving with drink taken have contributed greatly to the numbers and costs of claims.  It means, in effect, that in some way motorists are also responsible for high insurance costs.  The motor insurance sector is a major problem for the non-life market and is described loosely as the insurance industry's biggest headache. In Dublin, about half the motor claims lodged are crime related and those excluded uninsured cases.  That gives some idea of the problems which have to be faced.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the greatest single thing to which people refer when they talk about motor insurance costs is the number of uninsured motorists.  Motor insurance continues to have huge underwriting losses.  Let us consider the menace of uninsured drivers.  We have an appalling record in relation to remedying the situation; 20 per cent of motorists are uninsured. The average in Europe is about 4 per cent and two European countries have statistics of less than 1 per cent.  How can we justify the fact that 180,000 uninsured motorists are using our roads?  This is a disgraceful statistic and the Minister must show how he proposes to deal with it. It puts law abiding citizens at a huge disadvantage as they are paying their own insurance costs and those of their neighbours. They pay the claims of the victims <Col N="2057" /> of accidents involving uninsured people. The Motorists' Insurance Bureau, which was set up in 1955, provides a scheme of compensation for victims of uninsured motorists in respect of injuries to the person.  It simply means that in respect of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, which says that having no motor insurance cover is a statutory offence, the victims of those with no insurance should not be deprived of compensation.  Who has to pay the compensation?  The insurers contribute to it but everybody realises that if the insurance companies are contributing to the Motorists' Insurance Bureau it means that the policy holders and those who pay their insurance premiums are paying towards the upkeep of that bureau.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that £70 of every motor insurance policy is as a direct result of insurers having to fund the MIB.  It is also estimated that the outstanding claims liability, direct and indirect, with the Motor Insurance Bureau at this time is in excess of £80 million.  That is a staggering total for uninsured drivers, those defectively insured and for hit-and-run cases.  That accumulation of debt as far as uninsured motorists are concerned has to be met and paid for by those of us who pay our insurance premiums.  It is about time the Government decided to do something to change that disgraceful statistic which puts us at the head of the European league as far as such drivers are concerned.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are not just concerned with the question of uninsured motorists but to stop uninsured driving by making it financially practical for all motorists to obtain reasonably priced insurance cover.  That is the thrust of the motion before the House.  We are trying to impress upon the Minister the importance of supporting us in our efforts to reduce the number of uninsured motorists using our roads.  We are satisfied that if that occurred there would be a substantial saving on motor insurance costs.</P>
    <P>The Government and insurance companies will have to adopt new measures. Motorists will have to participate in these measures.  Fianna Fáil are proposing measures that may assist the Minister in <Col N="2058" /> this regard.  We believe that our motoring laws are adequate at this time but their enforcement is lacking.  Fines for deliberate offences, particularly in the area of no insurance, should be more severe and there should be wider use made of the suspension of the licence of drivers found guilty.  Many of these recommendations were contained in the report of the inquiry into the cost of methods of providing motor insurance issued in 1982 but, as yet, virtually nothing has been done to accommodate those recommendations.</P>
    <P>It is important that consideration is given to channelling all fines for motoring offences back into the Motor Insurance Bureau so as to reduce premiums. If the fine on every person convicted for an offence of driving without insurance in the past 12 months was averaged out at £300 per person and that money was given to the bureau it would have meant in the region of £12 million in the coffers of the bureau.  If that amount of money was used to reduce motor insurance costs it would not just reduce premiums but would decrease the final reserve requirements of the Motor Insurance Bureau in so far as the other insurers are concerned. There is no doubt it would have resulted in a substantial saving as far as motoring costs are concerned.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believe that there should be more on-the-spot fines for failure to produce insurance certificates because we are satisfied that too many escape the net even when confronted by gardaí. Substantial sums of money could be collected in that area.  Such a procedure would reduce the number of uninsured motorists on our roads.  We believe that there should be compulsory testing of vehicles over five years of age and such a scheme of compulsory testing would be self-financing.  Certainly, many of the vehicles on our roads, whether it is because of the recession, loss of disposable income or other Government measures, leave a lot ot be desired.  The Minister should immediately set about establishing vehicle testing stations. Well-known garages should be appointed to carry out that service.  There is no <Col N="2059" /> doubt that such testing would help to reduce the number of dangerous &ldquo;jalopies&rdquo; being driven on our roads.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the question of fines and the statistics in relation to them.  I have drawn evidence on this from surveys undertaken by the Irish Insurance Federation who have been carrying out surveys on fines imposed on uninsured drivers in recent years.  That body recently published their second such survey which shows that more than 60 per cent of the fines imposed were less than £100 and more than 25 per cent were under £50.  Those fines have been handed down by the courts despite the fact that a former Minister introduced a measure increasing the maximum fine to £1,000 for driving without insurance cover.  The number of fines in excess of £100 has more than doubled from 1984 to 1985, from 19 per cent in October 1984 to 39 per cent in March 1985.  We regard that as totally unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>The majority of cases brought before the courts for driving without insurance cover were dealt with by the judges who did not impose fines at the level envisaged by the Oireachtas which increased the maximum from £100 to £1,000 in June 1984.  While the Irish Insurance Federation are recommending very strong medicine in this regard we would hope that the courts will bear in mind that imposing a fine of £50 or £100 on a person driving without insurance cover who would be asked to pay between £800 and £1,000 for that cover will not do anything to reduce the number using our roads without insurance.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the Government should introduce an insurance disc from 1 July this year and that people should be obliged to display that disc on their vehicles from that date was adopted and it will be an offence to fail to display that disc from that date.  I would have thought that by this time all motorists would have been issued with these discs by the insurance companies but my information is that discs have not been forwarded to all motorists.  If that is the case, then the Minister and his agents, have not taken <Col N="2060" /> the necessary steps to guarantee that that measure, which was proposed by Fianna Fáil some years ago, will be implemented. It is our belief that that measure will go some way towards reducing the number of people driving without insurance cover.  At least for the first time in the history of the State one will be able to walk through a car park or along our streets and identify the culprits who are driving without insurance cover and are costing the average motorist a lot of money in the form of huge premiums to meet claims arising out of accidents in which those people are involved.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil feel that the Government should carry out an emergency programme of low cost improvements at accident black spots which are readily visible to everybody travelling up and down the country.  We are all aware of the accidents which occur at such places. We cannot understand why the Government, as an emergency measure, do not improve the road surface at those accident black spots.  I have no doubt that such work would result in a reduction in the number of insurance claims which, in turn, would mean a big saving on insurance generally.  We recommend that there should be better security and locking systems on all cars.  Better locking devices should be fitted as standard at the point of manufacture.  Those who have a better locking mechanism installed on their cars should be given relief on their insurance policy.  I hope the Minister will consider making it mandatory on motor manufacturers to have such devices fitted as standard at the point of manufacture.</P>
    <P>The jury system change was not recommended in the 1982 report.  That is outlined fairly clearly in chapter 7 of the Report of Inquiry into the Cost of Methods of Providing Motor Insurance in 1982 in so far as that report stated there was inconsistency and unpredictability in awards.  Therefore, it has not been recommended that that be altered.  Certainly something will have to be done. The Minister has legislation before the House.  For some unknown reason he had great enthusiasm when the matter was introduced some time ago, when he was <Col N="2061" /> giving everybody to believe that it was a matter of urgency and priority with the Government.  But for some strange reason, or perhaps for some lobbying reason by some sectional interest, it has been relegated to the second list of priority.  While the Taoiseach indicated to me last week that it was proposed to introduce it this session, there is still no clear indication from the Whips that they propose to do so this year.  I will have more to say about that later.</P>
    <P>Whatever the result of the Government measure with regard to juries dealing with personal accident claims, it will not reduce car insurance premiums.  It is as well to get that matter clear here this evening because many people believed that if we did away with the jury system somehow, overnight, car insurance premiums would be reduced.  That will not be the case and that has now been accepted by the insurance companies.</P>
    <P>We think there is a need to deal with legal fees.  Legal fees and expenses contribute to the overall cost of motor insurance claims and, where cases go to court, we contend that fewer lawyers should be required.  Provision should be made for the presentation of agreed medical and other professional evidence without the need for expensive personal attendance of professional witnesses.  We believe the Minister could do something in that respect. In addition, we believe that court procedures could be simplified and periodically we would like to see him revise lodgments and jurisdictions.  That does not take place often enough.  An ideal opportunity is afforded to the Minister to do that, which would be helpful also.</P>
    <P>We believe there should be an amendment of the Administration of Justice Act 1914 which provides that, irrespective of what is the maximum fine by the Legislature&mdash;and we know £1,000 is the current limit in so far as uninsured motorists are concerned&mdash;the judge has to take into consideration the ability of the individual to pay.  Consequently most justices are saying: &ldquo;He is not able to pay the £1,000 and it would be inequitable to ask him to do so.&rdquo;  It should be remembered that 80 per cent of the fines are under a couple <Col N="2062" /> of hundred pounds.  Until that Act is amended the problem will not be tackled because people will just contend that it is cheaper to pay the fine than to pay the insurance.</P>
    <P>We believe also that considerable progress could be made to remove uninsured motorists from our roads which would result in very large savings in insurance motor costs, for example, if there was a link-up between registration, taxation and insurance.  All of these elements are now computerised but there seems to be some reluctance to tackle collectively the whole problem of uninsured motorists.  It should be remembered that our personal injury awards are the highest in Europe, inflicting crippling losses of up to £100 million in the general insurance area. These, together with high legal fees, contribute to equally high levels of insurance dodging and to high premiums for those who pay.</P>
    <P>As far as we are concerned, barristers are generating restrictive practices in their profession and in court appearances in personal injury claims.  It is agreed universally that four legal representatives pleading a case is an unnecessary legal involvement.  It must be understood that legal costs contribute up to 20 per cent of the liability claims payments.  These are the stark facts that must be faced.  Many of the practices are decried by the barristers themselves and they can and should be significantly reduced.  If they were it would have a very large bearing on reducing motor insurance costs.</P>
    <P>We should like to see speedier trials, fewer delays in High Court actions and less legal representation.  We are asking that the legal and administrative costs be substantially reduced thereby assisting in the stabilisation of insurance premiums. It is now generally understood that there is an application at present in the Department for a sizeable increase in motor insurance costs.  It has been suggested to me that it might be up to 15 per cent.  I shall be very pleased to hear the Minister say that that is not so.  However, in the market place it is being suggested that one company has lodged an <Col N="2063" /> application for an increase of that magnitude.</P>
    <P>We are all aware from experience that, if a company requires such an increase to remain solvent, the Minister will grant it and once granted, it will be applied across the board to all other insurance companies. We should like the Minister to say he will guarantee to the motoring public that there will be no such insurance cost increase, that anything of that nature will be kept below the inflation rate which I take to be, in accordance with what the Taoiseach said, nil in 1986.  Therefore we can look forward to negative increases in insurance costs this year.  Those are matters we should like the Government to take on board.</P>
    <P>Additionally we believe that the motorists themselves have a responsibility because there is reckless driving on our roads.  Many of our motorists are guilty of and can be charged with anti-social behaviour in the way they drive. Half a million prosecutions took place last year.  They included offences of parking, tax defaults, no licences, a whole range of offences under the provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  In the serious offences category there were 65,000 people before the courts for no insurance last year, some 13,000 for dangerous driving and approximately 9,000 for drunken driving.  One might well ask: how many evaded the law?  If one were to add the number who evaded prosecution or being caught at all, then one arrives at a staggering total, clearly illustrating the number of people who have a total disregard for law and order as far as motoring is concerned.</P>
    <P>We understand that 46 per cent of the drivers killed on Irish roads last year had an unlawful blood alcohol level, which must be of considerable concern to everybody. The Minister must realise that something has to be done to alleviate this appalling situation which has resulted not merely in motoring accidents but hardship for so many innocent families. In tandem with that alleviation will come the reduction of motoring insurance costs.  Dangerous driving and careless <Col N="2064" /> driving are causing great suffering and hardship to the community at large, to families, to business and to industry. Road accidents were estimated last year as costing our community in excess of £200 million.  We think that money could be put to better use.  We should like to think the Minister would take some initiative in bringing about an alleviation.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of safety belts and the number of people who do not bother their barney to concern themselves with that facet of the law: two out of three of the motorists on our roads break the law in that regard.  Only when one sees photographs of the enormous bodily damage in even minor collisions, without the use of a safety belt, does one get some indication of why it is important to press home this matter and ensure that more people take note of the law.  It can be spelled out quite simply like this: the force of an impact at just ten miles per hour is the equivalent of catching a 200 pound bag of cement thrown from a first storey window &mdash; that is without a safety belt.  If some of these statistics were brought to the attention of the general public it might go a long way to bring about a recognition of the law on the part of the public generally.  That law became compulsory for drivers in 1979 but there has been a success rate of only 35 per cent.  In the UK, 94 per cent of motorists wear their safety belts and it has resulted in a reduction in the number of deaths and serious injuries in that jurisdiction. That is why their insurance costs are much lower than here.</P>
    <P>The person who does not wear a belt in his car is six times more likely to die in a collision, according to a recent Foras Forbartha report.  The consequence of car occupants not wearing safety belts for insurers generally works out at about £1 million per week in claims.  Of course it is a considerable drain on State resources in the provision of ambulance and medical services and police patrols.  Therefore, the Minister should take the initiative, get on to the road safety people and have a campaign.  Even if it were expensive, one decent campaign would be much less expensive than the cost to <Col N="2065" /> the community and to a family of one serious accident, particularly when safety belts are not used.</P>
    <P>There must be a thorough prolonged advertising and educational campaign by the National Road Safety Association, first to shock people and then to encourage them to belt up, thus reducing the numbers of deaths and serious injuries on our roads.  Such a campaign would help to reduce the frustration and hardship consequent on serious accidents. It would also encourage a reduction in motor insurance costs.</P>
    <P>A reduction in the number of claims for motor accidents is one sure way to reduce the cost of motor insurance.  Insurers who get licences from the Minister should not be allowed to discriminate against young Irish drivers.  Some insurers refuse to take certain types of drivers and certain age groups on their books; others charge enormous premiums and apply heavy loading for certain categories. Others operate group schemes for certain classes in society, operating in the cream of the business and leaving the high risk business to a few well known insurers.  Legislation might be the last resort, but the Department should use pressure to ensure fair play in the industry.  There is no justifiable reason why all insurers cannot be persuaded to take on their books young motorists in numbers proportionate to the total number of motorists on their books.  That should be mandatory in the licences granted by the Minister.  If that were so, we might get a better spread than leaving it all to one or two.</P>
    <P>Young motorists have a real problem. Statistics show that more than half of those killed on our roads are younger than 30 years&mdash;the young are more likely to be involved in motor accidents than older persons.  The persons most at risk are between the ages of 19 and 23 years. I suppose they use the roads more during the high accident periods at night.  A 17-year-old can get a provisional licence to drive without having received basic instruction.  We should make it more attractive to get a full driver's licence by <Col N="2066" /> offering generous premium discounts to those who have formal instruction.</P>
    <P>Ireland is the only country where a person can drive without being licensed or qualified.  The most inexperienced driver can take a car on Irish roads capable of top speeds of 150 m.p.h. and the only legal requirement is a provisional licence with front and rear &ldquo;L&rdquo; plates. That is totally unacceptable.  As many as 16.5 per cent of car drivers involved in fatal and serious injury accidents in 1983-84 were between the ages of 20 and 24 years.  This was the highest percentage of all groups of drivers and it was due to drivers being allowed on the roads without full licences.</P>
    <P>We believe that learner drivers should not be allowed to take out cars over a certain capacity until they have qualified for a full licence.  We believe it is morally wrong that young drivers should be fully loaded at the outset because of their inability to pay, causing major social and economic hardship and inequality. Therefore, we suggest a no-blame premium for young drivers so that they would be loaded in the event of claims rather than at the inception.  If we had that we could offer young people reasonable insurance costs at the start.  That would encourage them to be more careful because they would have the sure knowledge that if they were not insured they would be loaded with considerable excess costs after every accident.</P>
    <P>I will finish by talking about motor cyclists.  They have a particular problem. We disagreed with Deputy Kavanagh when he was Minister for the Environment on his attitude to motor cyclists. There are about 70,000 of them here.  We believe there should be a new code disc for motor cyclists, clearly displayed on all cycles.  There should be two discs, one carrying the cyclist's liability, excluding cover for pillion passengers, and one covering pillion passengers, in different colours.  Those carrying pillion passengers should have full drivers' licences and there should be a no-claims bonus for that type of cover.  There should be an increase in the ratings in regard to brake <Col N="2067" /> horse power.  We suggest maximum liability for pillion passengers as a possibility. There should be greater police surveillance for all types of road offenders.  We do not think it is an option to debar motor cyclists from carrying pillion passengers.  If we did we would be taken before the European Court and we would lose our case.</P>
    <P>There is a case to be answered on why motor insurance costs are so high here <i>vis-á-vis</i> the UK and the rest of Europe. The Government, the insurers and the motorists can achieve the results we want, the provision of reasonable insurance costs for all Irish motorists.</P>

      <P>I listened in silence and with curiosity to the speech made by Deputy Flynn on this very important matter &mdash; with curiosity if we go back and look at the root causes of our present high insurance rates.  I have not been able to find any legislative initiative by that wonderful Fianna Fáil Government who served the country from 1977 to 1981.  During that period all our economic ills were initiated and exacerbated.  In the years between 1979 and 1982 the net underwriting losses for the whole motor market rocketed by more than 500 per cent.  There was a huge inflation rate, activated by the economic wizards on that side of the house.</P>

Deputy Kelly was the Minister responsible.  Since that report came to us, we have taken further action. That was outlined in a press release of October 1983, when a specific 20 point action programme was established.  That solid action taken by this Government stands in stark contrast with the inaction and ineffectiveness of the Fianna Fáil Government during that period and in 1982.</P>
      <P>We live in a very claim-conscious society and must recognise that.  We have come through a highly inflationary period.  That inflation is reflected in the rapid upward adjustment in motor premium rates.  In response to this, we set up that inquiry and since then an inter-ministerial group have been established and have reported to Government on two occasions.</P>

      <P>The indications now are that the underwriting losses under the motor insurance heading are continuing to reduce from a high in 1983, when there was an underwriting loss of £50 million. We are hopeful that that beneficial trend will continue.  However, it will continue only because of the positive policies undertaken by this Government in a wide <Col N="2069" /> number of areas, some of which I am about to go into in some detail.  The actions taken affect not only the Department of Industry and Commerce but also the Department of the Environment and of Justice.  I should add that the Ministers of State from those three Departments formed the inter-ministerial group on motor insurance which I had the honour to chair.  We first reported to Government in August 1985 and a second report is at present before Government.</P>
      <P>I intend, for the benefit of the Deputies present and particularly the Opposition spokesman, briefly to outline the progress made in the various measures taken by Government which are intended to improve the motor insurance environment. The measures taken by the Government can be categorised in a number of ways.  All these are designed to improve the insurance environment in general and ultimately to reduce the cost of motor insurance.  The measures focus on improved road safety and on reduction of the number of accidents and hence the number of claims which arise and on the reduction in the cost of claims by, <i>inter alia,</i> abolishing jury trials in civil injury cases and clamping down on uninsured motoring generally.</P>
      <P>In the Government's view the actions already taken, together with those measures which are currently to hand, will have a considerable beneficial effect on the level of premiums charged by insurance companies.  Already the indicators are that premium rates have stabilised and there has been an indication of a possible continuation of that stabilisation and, it is hoped, reduction.  There has been a reduction in the number of claims and also an indication that the heavy underwriting losses which were incurred are declining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall now outline in more detail some of the principal measures to which I have just been referring.  First, I should like to mention the measures which are designed to reduce, where possible, the number of claims.  A vital ingredient in reducing the cause of claims &mdash; and thereby the number &mdash; is the active promotion of road <Col N="2070" /> safety.  In this respect the Department of the Environment are undertaking an active campaign to eliminate all accident black spots and to pay special attention to those aspects of road maintenance which contribute most to improved road safety. Deputy Flynn was aware of this when making his contribution.</P>

      <P>Priority continues to be given to the national and other heavy traffic routes.  The National Road Safety Association's publicity programme for 1986 will highlight the aspects of themes selected by the EC Transport Council as appropriate to the year.  These will include drunken driving, the wearing of seat belts, speed, child safety and the safety of two-wheeled vehicles.  The programme will include the publication of a road safety textbook for primary schools.  Its major feature, however, is a scheme devised by the NRSA in partnership with local authorities designed to secure the active involvement of local communities in road safety projects during the year.  The Garda will commence a special vehicle defects campaign in May of 1986.  Obvious vehicle defects will be pointed out to the motorist who will be asked to correct them within a time specified by the Garda.  If these defects are not corrected within that <Col N="2071" /> time, prosecution will follow.  In addition, I understand that the European Commission intends to make an announcement this year with regard to the community-wide harmonisation of car testing schemes.  That will, of course, receive my full support.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations made by the Minister for the Environment in August 1985 revised rules for learner drivers were introduced.  These regulations apply to persons who are granted a provisional licence for the first time for car or light commercial vehicle.  The new rules stipulate that such persons must be accompanied during the period of the validity of the first provisional licence by a person who holds a full driving licence for those classes of vehicles.  There are additional provisions for the accompaniment of learner drivers at subsequent stages.  L plates must be displayed at all times on vehicles being driven by all learner drivers.</P>
      <P>I am happy to note that the trend in motor accident statistics is improving.  In February of this year the Minister for the Environment announced that the number of road deaths had dropped from 628 in 1974 to 465 in 1984 and to 416 in 1985. The 1985 figure represents a reduction of 34 per cent on the 1978 figure.  Total annual road deaths are now lower than at any time since the present system of accident reporting was introduced in 1968, when there were only 500,000 licensed vehicles compared with the present day figure of over 900,000.  I would attribute the significant improvement to the ongoing programme of road improvement, road safety and the other measures that I have outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Improved Garda traffic law enforcement has also made major contribution. Prosecutions in 1984 numbered 798,000 compared with a figure in 1983 of 684,000.  I should like to record my satisfaction at the improvement in the numbers wearing seat belts.  A survey carried out by An Foras Forbartha following the conclusion of the major NRSA seat belt campaign last autumn showed that over <Col N="2072" /> 60 per cent of drivers and front seat passengers are now wearing their seat belts. These figures are very low by international standards but the improvement over the previous wearing rates in Ireland has to be welcomed.  I fully agree with what Deputy Flynn said in this regard. We should be far more careful to wear our seat belts because the damage which ensues from not wearing them is horrendous.</P>
    <P>The motoring public have their own very positive contribution to make in complementing the efforts undertaken by the Government in improving our national road safety record.  In this context I would again state the obvious, that we should all be aware that the surest, ultimate way of reducing motor insurance premiums and making insurance available at prices affordable by all our citizens, is to reduce the number of accident rates against the number of claims.</P>
    <P>In addition to reducing the overall number of claims, another very pertinent factor in the reduction of motor insurance premiums, is reducing the average cost of claims.  Earlier this year the Minister for Justice introduced the Courts Bill, 1986 which will give legislative effect to the abolition of juries in High Court actions for personal injuries.  I am quite satisfied that the jury system in Ireland resulted in awards which were significantly higher than in other European countries.  Indeed, studies undertaken in my Department indicated that awards are three to four times higher in Ireland than in the United Kingdom in serious injury cases.  This situation combined with the unpredictability of awards not only poses serious provisioning problems for insurance companies but ultimately of course results in higher premiums to the consumer. Notwithstanding the fact that a minority of cases are settled in the High Court, it is held, quite validly I believe, that the levels of out of court settlements are affected or influenced by the High Court, it is held, quite validly I believe, so to speak &ldquo;in the shadow of the court&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A number of other measures have been considered in detail in the second report to Government of the inter-ministerial <Col N="2073" /> working group on motor insurance.  As this report is at present on the Government agenda I am not a liberty to disclose its contents fully at this stage. However, I can inform the House that the measures considered include the examination of the high level of legal fees pertaining to insurance claims and the necessity for the establishment of a quantum of damages in relation to awards made.</P>
    <P>There has been widespread recognition that uninsured driving has contributed in no small way to the increasing cost of motor insurance premiums.  In the past few years there has been a growing disregard by a minority of motorists for compliance with this aspect of the law.  I condemn out of hand this very anti-social attitude.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated by the Irish Insurance Federation that the impact on the premiums of insured drivers is £70 per premium on average.  It is difficult to gauge the full extent of the problem. However, the most reliable statistic available to us is the number of prosecutions by the Garda.  In 1984 these prosecutions numbered 108,000.  In the same year the number of claims reported to the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland was more than 1,500.  These claims by the victims of uninsured drivers resulted in claims paid by the bureau amounting to £8.9 million in 1984.</P>
    <P>I am aware that suggestions have been made that the level of uninsured driving is in the region of 20 per cent but from figures available in my Department I do not think the level is that high and that perhaps it is between 10 and 15 per cent. The enactment of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 1984 provided for higher penalities for offences under the road traffic code.  The passing of that legislation seems to have escaped Deputy Flynn's attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <P>I am glad to note from the information available to me that the courts appear to be making use of the <Col N="2074" /> new levels of fines they are permitted to impose.  A survey undertaken in the Dublin Metropolitan Area revealed that in the second half of 1984 there was a distinct upward trend in the levels of fines imposed.</P>
      <P>Under regulations made by the Minister for the Environment, provision has been made for the introduction of a requirement to display a windscreen disc for insurance as from 1 July 1986.  The discs are now being provided by all insurers. Deputy Flynn may not be aware of that.  It will not be compulsory to display these discs until 1 July next.  The long period of introduction was to allow for the rolling on effect of renewals.  People whose insurance falls to be renewed are being provided with these discs by the insurers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The motoring public suffered as a result of the Fianna Fáil Government's inability to make decisions between 1977 and 1981.</P>
      <P>Garda surveillance in respect of motor tax and insurance offences has been increased in recent years.  The number of insurance offences in which proceedings were taken has increased from 48,000 in 1981 to 108,000 in 1984.  The inter-ministerial working group have recommended that the increased monitoring by the Garda should be maintained and where possible intensified.  Furthermore, they recommended that the results achieved by the Garda in the area of uninsured driving in particular should be publicised separately from the general crime statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2076" /> Some concern has been expressed in recent years about backlogs arising in both Circuit Court and High Court cases. In response to this, the Minister for Justice has investigated the situation and appropriate action has been taken. Delays in Circuit Court cases are not significant except in the Cork area.  In response to this the Government have appointed an additional Circuit Court judge and it is understood that this judge has been assigned to Cork.  In addition extra sittings of the court have been arranged in Cork to cope with the backlog.</P>
    <P>In respect to High Court actions, the average time taken to dispose of cases is about 12 months but again, with the exception of Cork.  The President of the High Court has arranged extra sittings in Cork to reduce the arrears and a significant improvement is expected in 1986. The recent appointment by the Government of an additional High Court judge will also allow for more flexibility in arranging additional sittings both in Cork and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the question of motor cycle insurance, it is important to set out the facts in relation to this area of insurance.  The motorcycle accident statistics for this country make frightening reading.  Sixty-one motorcycle riders and eight pillion passengers were killed in 1983.  Eight hundred and seventy-nine motorcycle riders and 173 pillion passengers were injured in road accidents in 1983.  That is a total of more than 1,100 people killed or injured and the really frightening aspect of this figure is that more than 900 of those were aged between 15 and 30.  That means that one in every 25 people who travel by motorbike will be injured or killed.  The comparable figure for car travel is one in 200 people.  It is patently obvious, therefore, that motorcycles are infinitely more dangerous than cars and the cost of insurance for motorcycles reflects this.</P>
    <P>Norwich Union insure more than 90 per cent of all motorcycle risks in the country.  In 1984, despite receiving approval for an increase of 17 per cent in their premiums, the company incurred <Col N="2077" /> an underwriting loss of £697,000 on its motorcycle account.  This represents a loss of 16.8 per cent of its earned premium income.  In 1985 that company held its increase in premium down to 10 per cent even though it anticipated a loss of over £1 million in that year which represented some 28 per cent of its earned income.  The company has not increased its premiums since May 1985. Third party cover is, therefore still available at £67 for motorcyclists of 25 years and over for bikes up to 100cc in Dublin and £51 in the country.  Because of the accident figures I quoted earlier, insurance cover for younger motorcyclists is more expensive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>£600.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being faced by those who need motorcycle insurance, especially young people who find that the premium is beyond their means.  But my main concern as the insurance supervisory authority must be to ensure that companies remain solvent and meet their solvency and reserving requirements.  Companies cannot meet claims costs, which in the case of motorcycle insurance are astronomical, if they charge uneconomic premiums and they are not in business to provide a social service.  It is a legal requirement and they are there to ensure that they make a profit on it.  They are not there to have substantial underwriting losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said the biggest barrier to keeping motor insurance premiums stable or even to reducing them is the cost of claims.  A great many of those claims are caused by carelessness and a complete disregard for the rules of the road.  Basic knowledge of road safety could reduce the numbers of accidents significantly and thereby improve the insurance environment dramatically.  If car drivers could be made more aware of other road users such as motorcycles and cyclists, if motorcyclists could recognise the need for less speed and more caution and if cyclists could understand that the rules of the road apply to them too, there <Col N="2078" /> would be fewer accidents, fewer claims and eventually lower insurance premiums.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister received a claim for 15 per cent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not interrupt the Deputy and I am finishing my speech.  I feel sure that the above measures, which I have outlined briefly due to time constraints, must suffice to assure Deputies that the Government are taking every step possible to improve the insurance environment.  It is the earnest desire of the Government that the continuing beneficial effects of the measures taken, together with the further impact of those yet to be introduced should ultimately be passed on to the insuring public in the form of actual reduction in premium rates.</P>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy I should point out that it is intended to reduce the permitted blood alcohol level from 100 milligrammes to 80 milligrammes in the road traffic legislation under consideration.  I have not received an application for a 15 per cent increase but I understand I may very well have one on the way.</P>
      <P>I want to conclude quite sharply but quite simply that Fianna Fáil have a gall to put down this motion on motor insurance rates because when they were in power from 1977 to 1981 they did sweet Fanny Adams about the whole area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1982 they repeated that inactivity.  They were absolutely scandalously at fault in neglecting their responsibility to the motoring public by their inactivity.  The Government have take this matter in hand.  We established the PAC and acted on their report.  The Government established the inter-ministerial group who have made substantial recommendations.  The Government have taken substantial decisions which will reintroduce an environment in which savage underwriting losses incurred because of Fianna Fáil policies between 1977 and 1981, and premiums for our <Col N="2079" /> motoring public can be substantially reduced.  We have done so on a broad number of fronts including action by the Department of Justice, the Department of the Environment and, where necessary, by my own Department.  We will continue to be active in this area.  Our action will stand in stark contrast to the inaction and uselessness of the Fianna Fáil regime between 1977 and 1981 and again for a short period in 1982.  People are lucky Fianna Fáil are on the Opposition benches as far as motor insurance is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall raising the question of the difficulty for young people in getting insurance cover about 11 years ago when the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who was Justin Keating at the time, sanctioned a 40 per cent increase in motor insurance premiums for the PMPA.  At that time young people were shocked at this massive increase.  Of course, other companies, including foreign companies, joined in with their claim for 40 per cent. All those companies received their increases.  We had the National Prices Commission at that time.  This increase was sanctioned by the Government and it was a major blow for our young drivers. If you look at the situation in 1986, it is far worse.  Drivers, particularly those under 25 years of age, are quoted massive premiums.  Many of them cannot get a quotation as a result of which we have too many people driving on our roads without insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This had led to many serious problems, one of which the Minister of State did not refer to and which I believe is the most serious.  This is the fact that bogus motor certificates of insurance are being issued by what you might call plausible types of criminals who are taking advantage of these circumstance.  This type of certificate is being produced by people at Garda checkpoints, by people who are playing along with the situation, or by gullible people who pay £300 to £400 to these con <Col N="2080" /> men who claim to be reputable brokers. They are using these bogus certificates which are worthless when investigated.</P>
    <P>One of the areas which we should look at and discuss here tonight is the fact that there is a need in the motor insurance industry for a uniform type of certificate. It would be most advisable for the Minister of State and his Department to look at this because of the fact that young people cannot get certificates of motor insurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt, but if the Deputy has concrete evidence of bogus certificates the matter should be referred to the Garda Síochána, or if the Deputy brings it to my attention, I will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that, but I would like to point out that this has been highlighted by detectives in the fraud squad. I ask the Minister of State to look at the evidence which has been submitted to the Department particularly by the detectives who are dealing with it.  The Minister of State may have different figures but we are given to understand that some 20 per cent of the drivers on our roads have not got insurance.  Where a person is injured by an uninsured driver the injured party can seek compensation from the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland. The various insurance companies are obliged to subscribe to the bureau.</P>
      <P>All of us who hold policies contribute to the bureau in one way or another.  In other words, we are paying for the fact that we have so many uninsured drivers on our roads.  I should like the Minister of State to take up the suggestion made by Deputy Flynn concerning what he called a no blame insurance premium, particularly for our younger drivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State highlighted the fact that only one insurance company are giving cover for motor cycles &mdash; the Norwich Union.  The Minister of State will recall that last year we had a convoy of motor cyclists in the city of Dublin protesting at the expensive cover and protesting that cover could not be procured <Col N="2081" /> for pillion passengers.  The Minister of State should look at this matter also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): I move:</P>
      <P>That notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders the following arrangements shall apply in relation to the debating of the Estimates for the year 1986:&mdash; (1) (a) The first speech of the member of the Government or of the Minister of State opening the debate on an Estimate and the first speech of the first speaker from a group [as defined by Standing Order 85 (1) (a)] in Opposition shall not exceed 45 minutes in each case.</P>
      <P>(b)  The first speech of any other member shall not exceed 20 minutes;</P>
      <P>(2)  When no further members entitled to make a speech in accordance with paragraph (1) offer, there may be further interventions by members, provided that any such intervention shall not exceed five minutes, and a member of the Government or Minister of State may, by way of interventions not exceeding five minutes in each case, reply to points raised earlier in the debate;</P>
      <P>(3)  The speech of the member of the Government or Minister of State replying to the debate shall not exceed 15 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion proposes the introduction of new procedures for debating Estimates for the Public Service.  They are designed to improve the quality and exchange of information in such debates by bringing them closer to a &ldquo;committee style&rdquo; examination. The new procedures will take effect immediately, on an experimental <Col N="2082" /> basis, for the 1986 Estimates and have been approved by the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>The traditional format for debating Estimates is not conducive to the type of searching scrutiny that should be made by this House.  The practice of making &ldquo;set piece&rdquo; speeches means that, while general policy issues are often addressed, not enough interest is shown in the specific details of Estimates provisions. Far too often, an entire Estimate's debate can be a series of monologues which are overlong and repetitive.  Furthermore the Minister responsible, in reply, need not address in detail any of the points made during the debate, some of which may have been made weeks before, thus leading to unco-ordinated and superficial debates.</P>
    <P>The present proposals have been formulated with a view to remedying these defects in the actual procedure and conduct of Estimates debates at present. Under the new procedures the time available for individual speakers to make &ldquo;set piece&rdquo; speeches will be greatly reduced.  At the conclusion of speeches, Members will be allowed to make a series of short interventions which should result in a &ldquo;question and answer&rdquo; or committee style debate.  I believe that this approach will encourage Deputies to probe more deeply into the detailed provisions of Estimates.</P>
    <P>It was agreed, in the course of consideration of the new procedures at the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges, that the party Whips would arrange, where practicable, that a minimum of one and a half hours would be reserved at the end of each debate for the interventions to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House today is a practical step in overcoming the defects in the present procedures and it is my belief that it will lead to a form of debate which is more businesslike and cohesive. The new form of debate will be based on contributions, which because of the limits on their duration, will be succinct and to the point.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House. <Col N="2083" /></P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is presumably part and parcel of the Dáil reform that was promised by the Government on coming into office four years ago.  This motion is very paltry.  The fact that the Minister used only two pages in recommending the motion speaks for itself. This is only the second proposal, as far as I can recall, for Dáil reform which has come before the House.  The first was the proposed change a year ago on the new Question Time.  That change was recommended by all sides of the House and was welcomed in particular by the Opposition. We saw it as a very major and constructive change towards making Question Time somewhat more relevant and more interesting.  The whole purpose of Question Time is to seek information. We felt that the new system would succeed in doing that.  Alas, that system has not worked too well.  It is difficult to know why.  It is obvious that one of the main reasons is that too much time is taken up with various questions.  Some, such as supplementary questions, are irrelevant.  This is a matter for the Chair. We are quite pleased with that proposal but obviously it needs some changes.  I hope and expect that they will be made very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated, this motion is the second proposal to come before the House.  It is rather ironic that this motion should deal with Estimates.  Three and a half years ago one of the major platforms of the new Government coming into office was that Estimates would be introduced in the House in September and that the House would have an opportunity of having full debates on the contents of each Estimate.  That has not happened. We are just about to commence debating the Estimates at the end of this week. The Estimates as far as I can recall, were published at the end of January, four months after the date promised by the Minister responsible at the time, Deputy John Bruton.  That is very unsatisfactory. I agree with the Minister of State that the whole question of not only debating Estimates but introducing them to the House is most unsatisfactory and does nothing whatever for the House or for <Col N="2084" /> the information of the Members.  It is obvious that a major change is necessary. That change is not the type of change that is proposed in this motion.  The change that is needed so badly is the introduction of the Estimates at a much earlier date, as promised by the Minister for State's predecessor.  Unfortunately, it was never carried through.  The Minister has not made any reference as to whether there will be any further attempts in the future to bring Estimates into the House at an earlier stage.</P>
    <P>Some of what happens in the House has at times been described by the public as being irrelevant.  I regret that very much as I am sure all other Members of the House do.  As far as we are concerned as elected members it is very important that we discuss relevant and topical matters as they arise.  The Ceann Comhairle is only too well aware of the problems and difficulties which arise on a daily basis on the Order of Business.  It is impossible for Deputies to raise very important and very urgent matters in the House.  It is impossible to seek information or to have particular reports clarified in any respect.</P>
    <P>Recently there was serious violence in Northern Ireland.  It was debated in the House of Commons within a matter of hours.  When we, on this side of the House, endeavoured to raise it on the Order of Business or to seek a debate we were ruled out of order.  The Ceann Comhairle had no option but to rule it out of order because he acts in accordance with Standing Order.  That is the relevancy of the position as far as topical and urgent matters are concerned.  There were also serious issues such as Dublin Gas, Irish Shipping and other areas which were reported in full in the newspapers. We get quotes from Ministers through the media but we cannot get them here in the House.  That is one of the reasons which makes this House somewhat irrelevant as far as debates on matters of interest and urgency are concerned.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, no real reform has been attempted so far.  What we have here is a very minor type of reform.  I do not call it reform at all because it is totally <Col N="2085" /> unnecessary.  We all know that debates on Estimates have over the years been organised by the party Whips.  We would have only two hours to debate the Estimates of a particular Department.  We have had to come to an agreement, for instance, to allow the Minister to speak for 20 minutes or 30 minutes, with other contributors being given ten minutes. That has been the reality and, as a former Chief Whip, the Minister of State knows it.  Not long ago we had to make such an agreement to debate the Estimates.  That is no real reason to have this kind of motion before the House.  What we have here is an endorsement of the type of arrangements and agreements made in the past but the reality is that when we come to debate the Estimates the Whips will have to come together once more and agree on arrangements, notwithstanding what is contained in Standing Orders.</P>
    <P>That is why I say this motion is irrelevant and unnecessary.  If it is being put forward here as part and parcel of Dáil reform it is very misleading to the House because it is anything but that.  It is meaningless and nothing will really change. The situation will be much the same in the future and I am sure that what will happen next Friday will also be the same notwithstanding this motion.</P>
    <P>I should like to see much more co-operation between the Government and the Opposition parties, particularly the main Opposition Party, in bringing forward various measures to reform the Dáil.  At the Committee on Procedure and Privileges we have occasionally discussed some proposals.  I regret that on a recent occasion a proposal which we considered was not of great value to the House was forced through on a division at that committee.  If the Minister responsible for reform of the Dáil intends to carry out his business in that way, I do not think it is the best way of obtaining the co-operation of everyone in the House.  This is essential if we are to have proper reform and to make changes to Standing Orders that would be beneficial to all.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to ask the Minister responsible for Dáil <Col N="2086" /> reform what will be the back-up facilities and what number of civil servants will be available to investigate the type of Dáil reform that should come before the House?  As I have pointed out, nothing has happened and I am interested to know what has developed in the past three to four years, particularly with regard to the Estimates.  There was a positive promise made by the Minister at the time but like many other promises it has been shelved and forgotten.</P>
    <P>We all accept that, for instance, where Estimates and other moneys are concerned good accounting methods and systems are necessary.  There is little point in this House debating moneys already spent.  During the years this has been a very serious charge made in this House, irrespective of the party in Government.  I do not think moneys should be spent until the House has had an opportunity of looking in detail at the major proposals.  We were told three years ago it would be possible to do this if the Estimates were introduced in September and it was promised that they would be brought forward then.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House is irrelevant and will do nothing for Dáil reform. It will change nothing but a Standing Order and that change will not be adhered to because the Whips will have no alternative but to come to their own agreements and arrangements when it comes to discussing the Estimates.  Normally this House concludes at 8.30 p.m. on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and does not sit on Friday.  Considerable publicity was given to a statement by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, some time ago that the House would sit on Fridays to discuss Estimates.  In the past the House has occasionally sat on Fridays in order to get the Estimates through in a hurry.  That is no way to do business.  Estimates are part and parcel of our business and it is bad for any Government &mdash; or for an Opposition who have no alternative &mdash; to rush through Estimates allocating perhaps one hour to the various Departments.  We should use the time on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings between 8.30 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. to discuss Estimates and, <Col N="2087" /> if necessary, to sit on Fridays.  However, it is necessary that the Estimates be published and produced in sufficiently good time to give the House an opportunity of digesting what is contained in them and to examine them in detail.  In this way we would have a much better debate and one that would be more relevant.</P>
    <P>I repeat that as far as we are concerned this motion is totally irrelevant and unnecessary.  I cannot see any point in agreeing to a meaningless motion.  I cannot see any point in agreeing to a motion just for the sake of changing a Standing Order when I know only too well it is absolutely unnecessary in view of our past experience and unnecessary in that it will be totally irrelevant in future unless positive changes are made to bring Estimates forward at a much earlier date for full discussion.  In those circumstances, we do not intend to support this motion.  Therefore, we have no alternative but to oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been my experience during the long time I have been a Member of this House that invariably Estimates are rushed through this House, mainly in June and July.  Millions of pounds are voted through on the nod or with very little debate.  Many of them are voted through in a block vote.  Our Chief Whip has pointed out the practice up to now.  We have also established the committee system.  The committee dealing with legislation have not met at all this year.  I do not know whose fault it is. Some members of the committee want to know whether they are quietly being pushed aside.  I was a member of the committee and I can tell the House what they did.  The Radio Bill was brought before the committee.  Members of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil discussed it in great detail and met many interested parties.  They reached a consensus on the matter and presented their report to the Minister for Communications. He subsequently introduced a Bill which was completely different to the one discussed by the committee and many good suggestions made by members of <Col N="2088" /> his own party were thrown out.  There was a tug-of-war between the Labour Party and Fine Gael on the issue and the Bill will never see the light of day in this Dáil.</P>
      <P>Some of the other committees have also been meeting.  I suppose the most successful was the Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  The Committee on Public Expenditure has been interesting but all they have been able to do is point out defects here and there, many of them in the semi-State arena.  As a public representative I cannot ask a direct question relating to a semi-State body at Question Time.  Today two questions relating to Bord na Móna were disallowed under the rules of the House.  Any other person in the Chair's position would have had to make the same decision.  I cannot ask about negotiations concerning pricing, staff or the rental of buildings where any semi-State body is concerned.  I am told that these matters are the responsibility of the board, but there is also the responsibility to the taxpayer to be borne in mind.  We cannot ask any questions about An Post or Telecom Éireann.</P>

      <P>It could lead to other things which we could couple in as well. <Col N="2089" /> The matter before the House means nothing much to me.  It is a procedural matter to do with the Estimates debates. It is the same as screwing off a nut and putting it back again.  What is the difference? I understand that procedure because I have been a long time in this House.  We must look at ways of raising matters of major importance.</P>

It must have been abandoned.</P>
      <P>This motion means nothing.  It is a piece of window dressing.  In previous years we have been voting millions of pounds at the end of term following very little debate.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire):</i> I am extremely disappointed at the negative attitude adopted by the Opposition to this motion.  Of course it is not changing the world.  Nobody suggested that.  What disappointed me was the type of contribution.  First, I was criticised for the short delivery.  I believe that one should say what one has to say and not waffle for a long time just to clock up <Col N="2091" /> time.  I think I dealt with the motion and presented the motion adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to things like Question Time, of course we can meet and discuss the difficulties that have been experienced.  We are due to review that.  Various allegations have been made that nothing has been done and that committees have not been meeting and so on.  When one introduces Dáil reform and introduces a committee system it is a reflection on the members of the committee if they do not insist that the committee meet.  We lay out the conditions under which the committee can meet &mdash; they can meet as often as they like.  We set out their terms of reference and they are entitled to discuss and debate and examine certain proposals and it is up to the members of the committee.  I would suggest to Deputy Connolly that if he feels the Committee on Legislation has not met he should report this to his Whip and insist that the committee meet.  There is a procedure for that.  It has nothing to do with Dáil reform.  We introduced the committee system as a reform.  Some of these committees are working extremely well; others are not.  But again, when this new system was introduced, it was introduced on the basis that it would be experimental to see how it would work and I can see straight away, in my short time in office, that there is a need for some changes and, with the co-operation of all parties in this House, we can change this structure. We have also dealt with the Order Paper. We have proposals before CPP &mdash; Deputy Connolly is a member of that committee &mdash; in relation to Private Members' Bills, and the production of explanatory memoranda for Bills.  Broadcasting of the Dáil proceedings will be coming in shortly.  In relation to this proposal I am sorry that what went on at CPP was raised in this House because my understanding was that the workings of CPP were traditionally held in private and that the proceedings of those committees were confidential.  But since certain statements were made it is only right that I should answer those statements.  I <Col N="2092" /> would point out that this motion went through CPP and was accepted without a division.  Here we have the Opposition coming into the Chamber this evening and opposing it despite the fact that it was with CPP for nine months for consideration. So it is rather unfair for people to say that there was no consultation or that something else was rammed through CPP.  At the end of the day if the proposals are brought forward one would always try to be reasonable and get agreement and resolve problems.  We cannot avoid having some reforms because, as Deputies Connolly and Brady pointed out, many things need changing.  I bow to the experience of Deputies Connolly and Brady because both are longer in this House than I am but I would remind the Deputies that they were in Government for a long time and no changes took place either.  So the change we are bringing about should not be criticised because it is small.</P>
    <P>This motion does not deal with the length of time that should be devoted to Estimates.  That is a matter for the Whips and when I was Whip we dealt with that. What we are talking about is the quality of the debate, not the length of the debate.  All this motion is trying to do is to help Deputies extract from Ministers further information so that we do not just have long speeches with nothing at the end of the debate.  At least with this procedure a Deputy can make his or her point; the Minister can make his point; the Opposition Spokesmen can make their contributions and when they are finished we can then have across-the-floor debate and questioning on the various points on the Estimates to deal with the very thing that Deputy Connolly is complaining about.  If a Member of the House wants to know why money is being spent here and has not got a satisfactory answer he should be able to ask the Minister. What is wrong with changing the procedure to enable a Deputy to do that?  It certainly is not in the Government's interest that that should happen.  It would be far easier if the present system continued. But it is affording every Member of the House the opportunity of finding <Col N="2093" /> out more and questioning the Minister.  I cannot see the logic of opposing a measure that gives greater power to a Deputy to ask questions and get answers on the floor of the House, the very thing that the Opposition have been complaining that they could not do on other occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> I will deal with that issue in good time.  I can see a situation in the future where the debates on the Estimates would take place before they come into the House to be formally passed.  I have not examined the matter in detail but I am considering that perhaps the Committee on Public Expenditure should look at these. If we are going to have a viable committee system operating here the committees must be seen to have real teeth and be debating important issues.  Why should everything come onto the floor of the House?  We can use the committee system and I am looking at that proposition and will be discussing it with the Opposition as soon as I have some concrete proposals to put.</P>
      <P>In relation to matters of special importance, I am surprised that the Deputy should say there is no co-operation on the part of the Government to allow the Opposition to raise matters of urgent public importance.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> Only today the Government agreed to a three <Col N="2094" /> hour special debate on the farm situation. That was not business that was agreed last week.  It was done at the request of the Opposition.  The Government immediately gave time.  In my time as Whip I always agreed to give special time if a request was formally made.  Indeed, I recall on one or two occasions when time was offered and the Opposition said they had changed their minds and they did not really want it.  So the Deputies cannot complain that they have not been given an opportunity to raise matters of urgent public importance while this Government are in power.</P>
      <P>In regard to time afforded to Estimates, it is a matter for the Whips to decide what time they allocate for a particular Estimate.  I would remind the Deputy of the time spent on Estimates, including Votes on additional Supplementary Estimates. In 1977, 18 hours were spent; in 1978, 65 hours; in 1979, 51 hours; in 1980, 113 hours; in 1981, 41 hours; in 1982, 42 hours; in 1983, 77 hours; in 1985, 94 hours.  The latter was the second highest in ten years.</P>

        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> The highest was in 1980.  But it is fairly miserable to think that in 1977, 1978 and 1979 we had 18 hours, 65 hours and 51 hours. It is not all on this side of the House that time was not given.  We gave 94 hours last year for Estimates and it was one of the few occasions when all Estimates were debated on the floor of the House even though some of them did not get adequate time.</P>

It is up to the Whips to decide whether it is ten hours, two days or a week.  I fail to see how the Deputies can oppose a motion which <Col N="2095" /> went through the CPP; it was not divided on and it affords Deputies an opportunity of extracting more information, getting answers to their problems and so on.

I will be bringing in new measures on many other items which we are examining at present.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brady asked if I had the staff to back up my efforts and I am glad to say I have probably the best staff available at this time.  We have people with practical experience in the Whips' office and I am sure their expertise can be availed of. This is not an inter-party dispute.  This measure is being introduced to make this House more relevant and more important and to give Deputies an opportunity to ask questions.  It is important that we have staff with qualities who will be able to bring forward constructive proposals, but ultimately it is the Members who should decide what they want.  It should not come from the Government side only.</P>
      <P>I am asking Fianna Fáil not to sit back and wait for me to bring forward all the new proposals.  If they have constructive suggestions on how to change procedure I will be only too delighted to meet with them any time to discuss them and, if we can get agreement, come in here and change procedure.  I will be delighted to discuss such matters with any Opposition speaker at any time because this is vitally important.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Sellafield Nuclear Plant.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to convey my sympathy to the relatives of those who lost their lives in the nuclear power disaster near Kiev yesterday. Unfortunately, we do not have the exact facts or figures of that accident since the information is coming through in a very scant manner.  However this raises very pertinent questions for this country for a number of reasons.</P>
      <P>We are very close to an extensive and massive power plant at Sellafield.  No one can argue about the possible effects of what has come to be known as trans global pollution where deadly matter, depending on the prevailing winds, can be transmitted vast distances across continents to cause damage and possibly deaths to innocent people living in other countries.</P>
      <P>It is close on three years since I first raised this matter in the House and I seem to be repeating a lot of what I said in that Adjournment Debate, but a number of other issues must be stated as new evidence becomes more apparent at the Sellafield plant.  It is a shame that this Government continue to show an ambivalent attitude towards the Sellafield plant despite the fact that the head of the Nuclear Energy Board, Dr. George Duffy, recently expressed concern about the possible danger from the nuclear reactors at Sellafield.  In a very thorough interview Dr. Duffy made the point that he was less concerned about the possible environmental or health risks from the actual discharges into the Irish Sea than he was about the nuclear reactors.  He said that some of these had passed their accepted span of life, close to 30 years, and he was concerned about the possibility of these either breaking down or going on fire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That warning must be expressed in the <Col N="2099" /> loudest possible terms in this House in the hope that it will fall on the ears of the Government and that they will take a strong stand with Britain in this regard and not just accept the British point of view, as stated by Mrs. Margaret Thatcher, &ldquo;You know, there is nothing really to fear from Sellafield.&rdquo;  I do not know if it was just for amusement or what the British Minister for the Environment intended in stating that our fears were akin to those of medieval people talking about witchcraft.  We are dealing with a deadly menace quite close to this nation, a menace which is going to increase over the next ten years, some people say threefold or fourfold, others say tenfold, a moneymaking industry which will be a continuing menace to this country for many many years to come.  A £3 billion expansion is about to take place at the Thorpe expansion plant at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>I suppose we are fortunate in a sense that in Ireland the prevailing winds tend to be south-westerly.  The Minister realises that this is not always the case. He represents a maritime constituency and he is well aware of the anxieties and fears that people living along the eastern seaboard have, particularly in the light of what happened in 1957 when the winds were north-easterly and brought the result of the fire at Sellafield over along the Irish coast.  In this nation we do not want to arrive at the stage where our excellent monitoring stations tell us that the levels of radiation are increasing and something must be happening across the water, and waiting for our information to come in secondhand to us when some major accident has taken place.</P>
    <P>It is our duty as a nation, and particularly the Government's duty, to sound the warning to England that we want this plant to cease its operations.  How on earth can this Government accept the point of view of the British when their own agency, the Nuclear Energy Board, have stated that the nuclear reactors are not safe?  What type of logic is that?  It is tantamount to engaging in very dangerous dealing with the British in this regard.  A very strong case could be made <Col N="2100" /> to take Britain to the European Court on this matter.  All the evidence is there: the facts are there.  The Black report was discredited by lack of information from British Nuclear Fuels.  In the House of Commons the all-party committee report on the question of Sellafield safety indicated that the plant was not safe.  The European Parliament overwhelmingly rejected information coming from the Sellafield plant and called for its closure. It is regrettable that on 12 March this House turned down a motion by the Opposition calling for the closure of Sellafield.  I felt at the time that that was a lost opportunity.  I could not understand for the life of me what the Government were engaging in in that debate because a strong call from Ireland to England, a united voice, in this regard is needed.</P>
    <P>Did the Minister see the headlines in the British papers the next day, in which they said, &ldquo;Irish Government votes down call for closure of Sellafield&rdquo;?  It was an absolute let-off for them.  I sense a slight change of attitude on the part of the Irish Nuclear Energy Board in that I think they are beginning to put this whole question into perspective, putting the Irish nation first.  They are beginning to see themselves as having a very important role in the future of nuclear radiation measurements in this country.  That board were established for a purpose different from that in which they find themselves engaged now.  It is critically important that we as an independent nation are prepared to take a firm stand on this issue in relation to the closure of Sellafield.</P>
    <P>What has happened in Russia is just an example of what can happen to this nation.  Given the appalling safety record in this plant, it is now not unreasonable to assume that there will be a serious accident at Sellafield.  I do not know how the Government can come into this House and stand up and defend their inactivity in this respect.  We have been told about the lack of safety of the reactors how they are positioned and structured, and that they do not meet the safety requirements.  What of the possibility of seismic activity?  There has been a fair degree of seismic activity in the Irish <Col N="2101" /> Sea and it is continuous.  Just a couple of years ago we had the undersea earthquake which measured quite a strong reading on the Richter scale.  If it had been close to the Cumbrian area it could have caused a great deal of damage and possibly started some serious fires at that plant.</P>
    <P>We all know the old saying about a little knowledge being a dangerous thing and that people, who profess to set themselves up as experts in a particular field when they have not the in-depth knowledge, can be misleading, but how can this nation, given the inaccurate information from British Nuclear Fuels, stand over this plant as we seem to be doing as a nation at present?  We seem to be defending the British point of view; that is the way it is perceived by our nation at present.  I have read the account of the Minister, Deputy Spring, of what is going to be done and the safety measures that are to be taken at Sellafield, etc.  I have read it all <i>ad nausem</i>, but we must guard against a serious accident taking place in Sellafield such as occurred in Russia yesterday.  It could happen.  I want the Minister to address himself to the possibility of an accident taking place at Sellafield and not to engage in speaking about the dangers to our marine environment or the radiation levels in the air or anything like that.  I would like him in this House to give a guarantee, or at least state that in his opinion an accident will not take place, given the information that has been given to him.  If he does that he will relieve the anxieties of many people because he will have information given to him that many of us have not got.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy about this whole question of a European team of investigation. It is just a kick for touch.  The EC have vested interests in the development of the nuclear industry.  I am not opposed to the question of an inspectorate taking place at the Sellafield plant but I am suspicious of it because I cannot see how countries who have these plants will be able to engage in an impartial manner in inspecting a plant like that.  As I said before, it is a bit like the police investigating themselves: they will not come up <Col N="2102" /> with objective criticism or anything more positive in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his earlier contribution referred to the expansion which will take place at Sellafield.  Many people are unaware of the fact that there are massive expansion plans to reprocess the waste of other nations to make money for Britain. It is a money making industry with waste coming from Japan, Germany and all over the world to be reprocessed at that plant.  What is in it for Ireland?  Nothing, except health and environmental hazards on a massive scale.  Ships will be carrying deadly cargoes up and down the Irish Sea and there will be constant withholding of information to this nation.  The Minister will have to go further than talking about an inspectorate to monitor Sellafield because that is just not enough.  The objective at present, given this awful record of 300 accidents over the past 30 years and those chronicled earlier this year and the fact that British Nuclear Fuels have been fined large sums of money, is to obtain more information. British Nuclear Fuels have paid out very large sums in compensation &mdash; I know without admission of liability &mdash; to widows of former employees in the firm and there is circumstantial evidence to support the view that the plant is unsafe, even deadly.</P>
    <P>Beaches have been closed and medical doctors in the area agree that there is a tenfold increase in cancer within the plant environs.  The Minister would earn the respect of the House if he made it clear to Britain that if they are not prepared to accede to our demands we will take them to the European Court.  There is nothing to be ashamed of in that as the Minister's duty &mdash; I am not speaking personally &mdash; as a member of the Government is to future generations and not just to ourselves. We enjoy a relatively peaceful environment, although we live with the continuing risk of an accident taking place at Sellafield.  What of future generations? We should seek to protect the environment, given the fact that some of these deadly man-created elements like ceasium and plutonium will take thousands of years to disappear, if they ever <Col N="2103" /> do.  How will future generations view the Irish Government for not taking a stand on this?  Regrettably, a stand has not been taken and there has been no firm directive given to Britain on this issue, which was raised first in this House three years ago and on subsequent occasions by other Members of the House.  We had a full-scale debate on it last month and now this accident has taken place.  Increased levels of radiation at Sellafield have also been raised by way of Private Notice Question and yet the Government have gone along with the British point of view against what the rest of Europe said.  This is a shame.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Government feel that by so doing they would injure Anglo-Irish relations.  Is that the case?  If so, it is indirect blackmail, equally shameful and should not be tolerated. I will listen very carefully to the Minister's reply.  I hope it will not be a repeat of what he said earlier today: that the best way is to have a European inspectorate and hope that something will come out of that.</P>
    <P>Given the rapidity of the accidents which have taken place at Sellafield over the past few years, it is reasonable to assume that more will occur and that, as the plant expands, more and more accidents will take place.  We must make a clean break from the British point of view and hold to the view that the vast majority of people have in this country. We want the plant closed.  It is situated in the worst possible place for a nuclear reprocessing plant and is now a military target as it is refurbishing nuclear warheads.  It puts us in the front line as a neutral nation.  All the evidence supports a call from the Government to close the plant down and there is no point in taking an ambivalent view of the matter.  I do not want to be alarmist, although when I raised the matter three years ago I was accused of being so.  We have a duty to future generations and it is our firm wish and demand that the Government should call on the British Government to close down Sellafield once and for all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not accept that and I will refute it at any time.  There is no ambivalence in the Government's policy in relation to the Sellafield question. That policy is well known and has been stated here on a number of occasions. It is a matter of concern to me that in the course of the recent debate in Private Members' Time on Sellafield Opposition Deputies made hysterical contributions about that question.  It frightened people, particularly those who enjoy eating fish.  In my view it did unnecessary damage to the fishing <Col N="2105" /> industry along the east coast.  It was a pity that the Opposition made wild and unfounded allegations on that occasion. I am trying to treat this subject seriously and impart the expert knowledge that has been passed to me by experts in this area.</P>
      <P>As has been stated time and again, the Government are totally opposed to any discharge of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea and want to see these discharges minimised and eliminated as soon as possible using the best available technology. Any radioactive discharge, even if the level of radioactivity is small, is undesirable and should cease.  I have made that clear before.  The concern of the Government, and the Irish public, at the operation of Sellafield, particularly in relation to the recent incidents at the plant, has been conveyed to the UK authorities on a number of occasions right up to the level of Heads of State and through the Ireland-UK contact group.  The last of the contact meetings was held in February and at that we pressed for improved notification procedures.</P>
      <P>The Government recognise that the incidents at Sellafield are, in themselves, of little radiological significance to the Irish population.  Clearly, a balanced view of the situation must be maintained. The recent incidents have caused the Government, and the Irish people, to lose confidence in the safety of the plant. The safety record at Sellafield has been less than satisfactory and the frequency of recent incidents poses the possibility of an accident occurring in the future which could have consequences for this country.  We must look at what happened in Russia and take it into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This concern of the Irish Government is reinforced by the report of the House of Commons Environment Committee which was published recently.  The Government find several aspects of this report particularly disturbing.  There is a suggestion that nuclear waste management is inefficient, that there is uncertainty about dilution and dispersal behaviour of radioactive substances released into the Irish Sea and there is, in addition, continuing uncertainty about accidental discharges.  Furthermore, the <Col N="2106" /> report refers to the Irish Sea as the most radioactive in the world, and this situation is, of course, totally unacceptable to the Government.</P>
    <P>However, it is important to keep the question of radioactive discharges from Sellafield in perspective.  The Nuclear Energy Board who advise my Department are engaged in an ongoing monitoring programme which measures radioactivity levels in the environment. The board recently published a report on radioactivity monitoring of the Irish marine environment during 1982-84.  This report shows that the most significant source of contamination of the Irish Sea is the discharge of radioactive effluents from the Sellafield re-processing plant. This radioactive contamination decreases rapidly with increasing distance from Sellafield. The report also shows that the levels of contamination of the Irish Sea have decreased in recent years, probably reflecting the reductions in the annual discharges from Sellafield since they were at their highest in the seventies.</P>
    <P>The report assesses the possible radiation exposure of Irish consumers of fish and shellfish and concludes that in the case of the average consumer of seafood, the dose would be about 1 per cent of both the annual dose limit for the public recommended by the International Commision for Radiological Protection and the dose from naturally occuring sources of radiation.  The board have advised that there should be no concern about eating fish and shellfish from the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>The board, with the assistance of the Meterological Service of the Department of Communications, also monitor radioactivity levels in air, rainfall and drinking water samples.  I am advised by the board that the levels of artificially produced radioactivity in the atmosphere are low and do not constitute a health hazard to the Irish public.</P>
    <P>This House will be aware of reports of a recent accident at a Soviet nuclear power station near Kiev.  The Nuclear Energy Board have been advised by the Meteorological Service that prevailing weather conditions are unlikely to carry contamination in the direction of Ireland <Col N="2107" /> in the immediate future.  The board have indicated that there is, therefore, no reason for the Irish public to be alarmed. The board will continue their monitoring procedures and will keep me advised of developments.</P>
    <P>The board have also advised me that a serious leakage from a nuclear power plant in Britain or continental Europe would be likely to have severe effects only in the immediate area, up to a five or ten mile radius.  In such a situation the Nuclear Energy Board, through their ongoing environmental monitoring programme, would measure the levels of radioactivity and advise on whatever action was necessary to safeguard the community.  In the event of an accident of major significance for Ireland, the national emergency plan would be implemented and the board, in close liaison with the Civil Defence, would monitor and assess the situation and issue advice on what action to take.  The Government would, of course, take whatever action is necessary.</P>
    <P>I have said that monitoring indicates that the radiation exposure of the Irish public from Sellafield is negligible.  But, as I said in this House today, we are being exposed to a potential hazard from an operation outside our jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>I should like to repeat that we do not have jurisdiction but, as a member of the European Community we can view the matter as being of international importance.  Sellafield is not the only reprocessing plant in Europe.  There is also one in France at Cap de la Hague and the German Government are about to erect a reprocessing plant.  We must also take account of the fact that France, Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands are nuclear energy states.  We sought the assistance of the European inspection force, a legal move, because we believe the European Commission have the power to establish such a force so as to ensure that there will be an independent examination of nuclear safety throughout the nuclear industry in Europe.  I do not believe that those who will be carrying out this inspection will lean to the vested interests. Surely they will have enough integrity to have regard for the safety of all the people in the Community.  That is the reason we have asked for a European inspection force and it is the logical international action the Government should take.</P>

      <P>The Lakes of Killarney form part of Killarney National Park.  The major objective in designating an area as a national park is to preserve it from material interference by man.  It would not be in keeping with recognised international criteria for the management of national parks if the Commissioners were to allow the development of man-made beaches on the lakes.  An official of the Office of Public Works has explained the policy to members of Killarney UDC.</P>

      <P>Every private nursing home is required to comply with the provisions of the Health (Homes for Incapacitated Persons) Act, 1964, and the Homes for Incapacitated Persons Regulations, 1985.  The nursing home in question has been inspected by the Eastern Health Board on a number of occasions and the proprietor is now in the course of making alterations and installing additional fittings as required by the health board.  When this work is completed the home will again be inspected and a decision will then be made as to whether it will be placed on the list which the health board maintains of nursing homes in its area.</P>

      <P>A.H. Robins Company Limited wrote to me on 3 January and informed me that the US Federal Courts had established 30 April 1986 as the final closing date for the filing of claims against the company in respect of any alleged injury arising from use of the particular intra uterine contraceptive device known as the Dalkon Shield.  This device was withdrawn from the market more than ten years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A.H. Robins Company Limited had been directed by the American Courts to conduct an international campaign to advise women, who might wish to pursue a claim for compensation, to make an appropriate application to the US Courts by 30 April 1986 and to notify women of the procedures in this regard.  The company <Col N="1947" /> carried out an extensive public information campaign in relation to this matter in January of this year.  This campaign involved the issue of comprehensive information packs to the public media here including the national press houses.  The campaign generated an informed newspaper and broadcast coverage of this issue.  The Irish Medical Organisation and other key medical bodies were also contacted by the company.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that the publicity campaign undertaken by the company in this country provided an extensive level of coverage, It must be emphasised that this particular issue relates solely to forms of legal redress and the public notification of procedures to be adopted in initiating a claim for compensation in the US Courts.</P>

      <P>The question of what controls should be imposed in regard to the irradiation of food is currently being considered in my Department in the context of the proposed EC Directive on the matter.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Cervical smear tests are available nationally through health centres, maternity hospitals on an outpatient basis and through general practitioners.  The level of demand for this service varies significantly from area to area; in areas where demand is low the service is organised on a regular review basis while in areas where demand is high a more structured approach is taken.</P>
      <P>In the case of Dún Loaghaire the former is the case and I am assured that the director of community care is satisfied that the present arrangements are adequate to meet the existing level of demand.  This is, of course under constant check by the EHB and the Department.</P>
      <P>At present the service is delivered in Dún Laoghaire by the local general practitioners and by two voluntary women's clinics.  For those wishing to attend at a health centre an appropriate referral will be made from their local health centre to one operating regular cytology clinics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general while the methods of delivering this service may vary from area to <Col N="1953" /> area I am satisfied that a cervical smear test can be readily obtained by persons living in Dún Laoghaire.  In the case of any individual difficulty being faced by any women in the area my Department will immediately consult with the director of community care to ensure the full delivery of this service.</P>

      <P>Pay-related benefit is calculated on a person's reckonable earnings, in excess of an earnings floor, in the relevant income tax year.  According to the Department's records the earnings of the person concerned in the period 6 April 1983 to 5 April 1984, which is the relevant income tax year in respect of her claim of 4 June 1985, amounted to £1,350 only, and as this is less than the earnings floor of £2,500 applicable on her claim she is not entitled to pay-related benefit. Weekly payments of flat rate unemployment benefit at the appropriate reduced rate of £32.75, will continue to be made to her, as they become due.</P>

      <P>Following inquiries by an inspector of the Department it was established that the person concerned was last insurably employed in Great Britain.  His claim, therefore, is proper to the Department of Health and Social Security, Newcastle-upon-Tyne.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of a contributory old age pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires a person to have a yearly average of at least 20 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from his year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.</P>
      <P>The Department's records show that the person concerned has a total of 457 reckonable contributions in the relevant period, which, in his case, is from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1985.  This is equal to a yearly average of only 14 and, therefore, he does not qualify for a contributory old age pension.  Depending on his means, he may qualify for an old age noncontributory pension.  A claim form for this pension can be obtained at any post office.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to pay-related benefit with flat rate unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that the weekly sums of pay-related benefit, flat rate unemployment benefit and income tax rebate may not exceed 85 per cent of the net average weekly earnings of a claimant, since the beginning of the income tax year in which the claim is made.</P>

The 85 per cent limit applicable to the person concerned was calculated at £94.60 and as the flat rate of unemployment benefit exceeds that amount, pay-related benefit is not payable in this case.</P>

The person concerned does not satisfy the contribution conditions for <Col N="1968" /> entitlement to unemployment benefit, on the basis of her Irish contribution record. Her United Kingdom contribution record cannot be invoked for the purpose of her claim as she is not eligible for a transfer of contributions under the provisions of the EC regulations because her last insurable employment was outside this country. An inquiry to the United Kingdom authorities has confirmed that the person concerned is not entitled to a transfer of United Kingdom benefit on the grounds that she has not registered as unemployed in the United Kingdom for the required period prior to coming to Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In calculating the value of board and lodgings in respect of an applicant for unemployment assistance who resides with his parents on a farm the procedure is to estimate the yearly value of the profit from the farm and to divide the amount between all members of the household including the applicant on a weighted basis.  In general a weighting of 1.5 is attached to each parent and one to each non-earning dependant including the applicant.  For example in the case of a family consisting of parents and three non-earning children the yearly profit from farming would be divided by six.</P>
      <P>The method described above has been in operation for a long number of years. The requirement to take account of the value of board and lodgings is designed to achieve a degree of equity between applicants living in good circumstances and those in poor circumstances.</P>

      <P>One of the qualifying contribution conditions for the receipt of dental <Col N="1970" /> benefit requires persons over 23 years of age to have had not less than 156 reckonable employment contributions paid before the commencement of the treatment.  The person concerned claimed dental benefit on 14 March 1985. According to the records of the Department at that time he had a total of 79 contributions paid up to 5 April 1984.  Even taking account of further contributions from that date to 14 March 1985 he could not have reached a total of 156 contributions by the latter date.  His claim could not, therefore, be approved. Both the claimant and his dentist were notified of the position on 17 April 1985.</P>
      <P>According to the Department's records the position now is that a further 52 reckonable contributions have been recorded in respect of the 1984-85 contribution year bringing his total number of contributions to 131 at the year ended 5 April 1985.  Provided a further 25 reckonable contributions have been paid in respect of the 1985-86 contribution year, i.e. giving a total of 156 contributions paid, he will qualify for benefit in respect of any further dental treatment he may require.  If he now wishes to claim benefit in respect of further treatment he should arrange with his dentist to have the appropriate application form submitted for approval.  He is not, however, qualified for benefit in respect of his claim of 14 March 1985.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated in reply to Dáil Question No. 1 of 6 March 1986 a total sum of £1.2 million is available in 1986 under the capital grants scheme to meet existing commitments and for allocation to new projects.  The amount available for allocation to new projects cannot be determined precisely at this stage as it depends on the level of expenditure on existing commitments in the present year.  A large number of grants approved in 1985 have involved the carry-over of heavy commitments to 1986 and because of this it will be possible to assist only a small number of new projects this year.</P>
      <P>As I also indicated previously, the closing date for receipt of completed applications in respect of the 1986 allocation was 31 December 1985 and applications received after that date cannot be considered until the 1987 provision is being allocated.</P>
