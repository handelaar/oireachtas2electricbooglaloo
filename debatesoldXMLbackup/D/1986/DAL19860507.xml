    <Title>Finance Bill, 1986: Financial Resolution.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That provision be made in the Act giving effect to this Resolution so as to secure, in the manner and to the extent specified in that Act&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  that relief for management expenses by virtue of section 33 (1) of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976 (No. 7 of 1976), shall be given as if each of the following three classes of life assurance business, that is to say&mdash;</P>
      <P> (i)  pension business,</P>
      <P>(ii)  general annuity business, and</P>
      <P>(iii)  life assurance business (other than pension business and general annuity business),</P>
      <P>were a separate class of business,</P>
      <P>(b)  that relief shall not be given, by virtue of the said section 33 (1), for the stamp duty charged under section 92 (8) (c) of the Finance Act, 1982 (No. 14 of 1982),</P>
      <P>(c)  that certain annuity business shall, for corporation tax purposes, be excluded from the general annuity business of assurance companies and that annuities referable to the business so excluded shall not be treated as charges on income for the purposes of the Corporation Tax Acts, and</P>
      <P>(d)  that annuities referable to the general annuity business of an assurance company shall, for corporation tax purposes, be deductible only from the profits of that class of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="7" /> This resolution relates to amendment No. 58a circulated yesterday.  The Financial Resolution has to be moved under Standing Orders because the amendment involves changes which, by restricting the over generous relief already available, will increase the corporation tax liability of life assurance companies.  It is normal procedure to move the resolution at the start of the day's Finance Bill debate but the proper place for a detailed discussion on the changes is when the amendment itself is being discussed later today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has just indicated that the proper place for a detailed discussion is when the amendment itself is being discussed later today. The Minister must know, as every Member of this House knows, that the House will have no opportunity for discussion, much less a detailed discussion, on the amendment itself later today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>For that reason I want to ask the Minister to explain the effect of this resolution.  I want to put that in context.  Yesterday evening as we were debating other sections of the Bill the Minister, without the knowledge of any Member debating the Finance Bill in the House, circulated two very detailed amendments.  One is called euphemistically &ldquo;the second additional list&rdquo;.  The first additional list was circulated in the offices, and we were unaware of it, at approximately 4 p.m. and the second additional list was circulated some time around 5 p.m.  No Member of the Oireachtas who was addressing himself or herself to the issues of the Finance Bill yesterday had any knowledge of these <Col N="8" /> two booklets &mdash; that is what they are &mdash; until we left Dáil Éireann yesterday evening.</P>
      <P>I want to protest at the manner in which the Government and the Minister are treating the Dáil.  To call it trickery would be to understate it.  It is absolutely unacceptable that we who are charged here with representing the people's interest in scrutinising finance legislation should be treated in this manner.  Resolutions were already moved here at the beginning of the Finance Bill and, understandably, we all assumed that those resolutions were necessary to discuss the sections of the Bill or amendment published at that time.</P>
      <P>When a Minister for Finance &mdash; it is becoming a pattern for this Minister who claimed to move towards reform in the House &mdash; treats the House with such contempt as he did yesterday in introducing two booklets of amendments which we had no opportunity to read or discuss and this morning proposes to add another Financial Resolution to give effect to that contempt, we must protest in the strongest possible way.  Does it vary the agreements we have, a copy of which I have in front of me here, that this morning we deal immediately with section 27?  It ensures that there is no possibility of our having anything like a reasonably informed discussion.  For that reason I have to ask the Minister to explain precisely what is in this resolution, why the changes from his original intention, why he has introduced the change, why he has had a change of mind in the past 12 hours and why are we being asked, without any opportunity to study the implications of that change of mind, effectively just to pass it through &mdash; and not through a slot machine.  This does not even feed into the slot machine, much less come out at the other side.  It is making a mockery of the whole procedure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to address myself to this resolution because, in common with other Members of the House, I will have no opportunity to speak on the amendment on which it is based.  The amendment is to section 53 and the part <Col N="9" /> of the Finance Bill which is due to be debated today will end at section 55. There is not the remotest possibility of a section in the thirties to fifties being reached or discussed.  I wish to protest as strongly as I can at what is called the legislative process which is supposed to go on in the House as it is a farce every year as far as the Finance Bill, the most important single Bill to come before the House each year, is concerned.  It is particularly farcical this year because I was told last week that four days were being devoted to Committee Stage of the Bill, I took that at its face value as meaning four days although I expressed grave reservations as to whether four days would be adequate.  In practice, what do the days consist of?  Yesterday the debate on the Finance Bill began shortly after 4 o'clock and ended at 7 o'clock, less than three hours.  Today, the debate on the Bill began at 12.15 p.m. and will be adjourned at 1.30 p.m.  It is due to recommence at 3.45 p.m. and to finish at 6 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment and the resolution are interesting not so much for what they contain but for what they do not contain.  At the last minute yesterday the Minister for Finance very properly, and I give him credit for that, decided that he would not proceed with what it had been indicated earlier he would be proceeding with.  Long and complicated as this amendment is, and, therefore, the Financial Resolution, it does not contain the objectionable features which the Minister for Finance announced earlier, through his various officials, that it would contain.  The major part of the amendment and by far the most damaging part to people who hold life assurance policies has been dropped and for that we must be thankful.  However, that has been done not so much through the processes of the House but outside the House. Increasingly legislation is made, and unmade, outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the limited amount of advice I could get on this extremely technical matter overnight indicates I do not <Col N="15" /> see that there is anything fundamentally objectionable in the amendment because the serious matter has been entirely excluded from it.  One of the effects of it &mdash; I mention this in passing because even though it is damaging to the public at large and to people who insure their lives, it is only a pale shadow of the damage that would have been done if the Minister had gone ahead with his proposed amendment &mdash; is that the levy which is payable on life assurance policies will no longer be allowable as an expense.  Therefore, the net cost to the policy holder of the levy will be increased from 1 per cent to 2 per cent but that at least is only on new business written from now on.  At least people will go into that with their eyes open and will know in advance what the levy is going to cost them.  The fact that it is being increased by two-thirds is regrettable but at least people will know it.  It is not retrospective taxation and therefore, it is unlike some of the Minister's other proposals.  It is not objectionable in principle, whatever one might say about the merits or demerits of it otherwise.</P>
    <P>Big and long as the amendment is, the thing that distinguishes it and makes it most remarkable is what is not in it, in particular the proposal of the Minister to levy full corporation profits tax of 30 per cent of the investment income funds of a life assurance company irrespective of whether it made a profit or a loss without any allowance on that 30 per cent for expenses.  That proposal, which happily the Minister has dropped, was a new concept in corporation profits tax or in any kind of taxation here because an artificial statutory profit was being declared. Whether it was made in practice or not, a corporation tax at 35 per cent was payable on that 30 per cent.  In effect it was a levy of 10½ per cent of the entire fund and would have operated retrospectively.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated that at the very last minute he declined to go ahead with that provision.  Directly arising out of that, and out of this Financial Resolution, one must ask, what are the Minister's intentions in regard to <Col N="16" /> section 85 because that section, this amendment and the Financial Resolution, are entirely bound up together?  It just happens that the amendment was being put in the chapter of the Bill that related to corporation tax because it was a corporation tax provision.  In fact, it is entirely bound up with section 85 and what is proposed in it.  Since there are not going to be these onerous changes in the law in relation to the corporation tax, the provision in section 85, presumably, will only operate for this year.  On what basis does one justify a once-off provision of that kind other than frantic searching around by the Government for some way, no matter how hamfisted or idiotic, of raising a substantial amount of money in the short term?  Is the Minister prepared to look at the amendment to that section to enable this payment which would be made this year to be regarded as a credit for corporation tax that would be payable in future years, particularly now that the corporation tax will be increased to a fairly significant degree by the amendments to this resolution?</P>
    <P>If the Minister considers, as clearly he does, that his proposals in regard to corporation tax were improper, he cannot but consider that the proposals in regard to the stamp duty levy contained in section 85 are improper.  Indeed, he has already conceded as much by his change of the rate of stamp duty from 15 per cent down to 9 per cent.  I should like to re-emphasise, because the matter is a technical one, that the people who will have to bear the burden of this are not insurance companies in the last resort. That impression is given because it is fashionable nowadays to be seen to impose taxation of all kinds and levies of all kinds on what are called financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The people who have to bear it in the last resort are not the insurance companies or the people who invest substantial sums of money with insurance companies in the guaranteed income bonds and guaranteed growth bonds schemes which the Minister is quite properly seeking to get at.  The people who will suffer are the with-profit policy holders <Col N="17" /> of the companies concerned, the ordinary people who do not have large sums of money to invest but insure their lives for the protection of their wives and children by paying an annual, six monthly or quarterly premium.  Very often those people find it very difficult to do that but in the last resort they are the people who will have to bear the brunt of what is proposed in 1986 in section 85.  Now that the Minister has had, very happily for everyone, considerable second thoughts on the whole question of corporation tax, I would ask him to look again at section 85.  I ask him to accept the amendment down on that section which would get over this difficulty as best one could in the circumstances and, at the same time, give the Exchequer the revenue it so frantically seems to need at present.</P>
    <P>It is very unsatisfactory that the Minister should have introduced this resolution with perhaps a 20 or 30 seconds speech in which he said the details can be gone into on the amendment.  As a result those of us who speak on it are given no information by the Minister, but he has the right to reply.  At the best of times that is somewhat unacceptable.  It is particularly unacceptable when the amendment is enormously complicated.  It was circulated apparently at about 6 o'clock last evening, affording people very little opportunity to seek advice on it.  Nonetheless we are expected to conduct a debate on it.  It is just another aspect of the entirely unsatisfactory way in which the debate on this Finance Bill, and Finance Bills generally, is being conducted.</P>
    <P>The debate is really a bit of a farce. Last evening we got to section 5, when suddenly every section up to 26 was guillotined through.  I cannot see us getting beyond the first two or three sections today.  They deal with this DIRT tax and several hours at least will have to be devoted to a debate on that topic, with the result that anything from, say, section 30 onwards has virtually no hope of being debated today.</P>
    <P>I shall finish on this point, as someone who was elected to this House by some section of the people.  It is no longer acceptable that the House, which they <Col N="18" /> thought was their legislature, has no function in relation to these matters, that the financial legislation in effect is being handled by officials of the Department of Finance and of the Revenue Commissioners. The Constitution of Ireland does not contemplate that situation.  We had better rectify it because it is a very serious situation for us.  This resolution, and that amendment on which it is based, are the proof of the absolute truth of what I say. That truth is unpalatable and it simply cannot go on.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy spent his entire contribution on this resolution referring not to the contents of the resolution but to his opinion as to the timetabling for its discussion and the discussion of the section to which it relates. For that reason it is necessary for me to reply to the points made by Deputy O'Kennedy although, strictly speaking, they do not come within the terms of the resolution itself.  But, seeing that Deputy O'Kennedy spent his entire contribution talking about this and did not refer to the resolutions, it is necessary for me to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I should say it was indicated in advance that we would be introducing an amendment, or amendments, to deal with this subject.  That was indicated in the course of the debate on Second Stage when we clearly indicated the area in which we would be seeking improvement, namely, means of increasing the corporation tax yield in future years, that is, from 1987 onwards, from life assurance companies.  That having been done Deputy O'Kennedy and I agreed, and the House subsequently validated our agreement, on a timetable for taking the Finance Bill.  Clearly at the time Deputy O'Kennedy agreed to this timetable he was aware that this subject would be <Col N="21" /> likely to come up, as it had been indicated in advance that it would be on the Second Stage debate, which was before he entered into the agreement for the time-tabling of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, the first entire day of the debate on the Finance Bill was used by Deputy O'Kennedy, Deputy O'Malley and others in promoting the amendments which they knew had no prospect whatsoever of success because, in many cases, they would have had widespread effects on the Government's financial targets.  They were put forward simply to enable those Deputies to make speeches indicating that they would like to see taxation lower. Would not we all?  But there was no need to spend the entire first day of the debate in the promotion of amendments which had no particular contribution to make to the technical content of the Finance Bill.  Yet Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy O'Malley used up a very valuable first day&mdash;which could have been used for detailed discussion of sections like this&mdash;in what was simply a political exercise.</P>
      <P>It is wrong for Deputy O'Malley to use the term that these sections are being guillotined through the House.  This is not the case.  The timetable was agreed by the House without any demur from Deputy O'Malley on the occasion when it was being agreed.  If he was here at the time, on the Order of Business&mdash;which I think he should be&mdash;that was the time to raise any disagreements he had with the timetable.  He did not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not do so, no more than was he vigilant when he should have been moving an amendment he had put down himself here yesterday to the Finance Bill.  He was not in the House to move it and the amendment <Col N="22" /> had to be disposed of because Deputy O'Malley was absent.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy were vigilant, in regard both to his own amendment and to any objections of his to the timetable suggested by the main Opposition party, he could have raised any necessary points at that time rather than doing so as he has done for the last while, eating into the time necessary for the debating of the Bill itself, in order to make over-blown political points.  That is the only term that could be appropriately used to describe the first part of Deputy O'Malley's contribution. I shall pay the Deputy the compliment of saying that he at least did read the section.  He at least did address the section in part of his speech.</P>
      <P>It is in no way unusual for amendments to be submitted during the course of the debate on the Finance Bill.  This has been the case for the last ten or 15 years. Amendments have been circulated in second and third lists during the debate on the Bill.  That is no more and no less than has happened in this case.  This amendment was circulated around 5 p.m. last evening.  All the other Deputies at present in the House had the entire night to read the amendment and have discussions on it if they wished to do so.  Unfortunately, it would appear that some of these, not including Deputy O'Malley who did read the amendment, did not use the time available to them as is normal in every financial debate to discuss and examine the terms of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will wish to know why the amendment was not introduced with the first list of amendments.  Quite truthfully, the reason for this is that there have been, up to a relatively late date, ongoing discussions with the insurance companies and with the relevant experts in the Revenue Commissioners' Office and my own Department, to ensure that the twin objectives of having a tax which will yield money and will at the same time do no irreparable harm to the industry would be achieved.  Of course, it would have been possible for me to have circulated an amendment a week ago but if I had then circulated an amendment which did not reflect all the discussions which have <Col N="23" /> taken place, it might have been necessary for me to have amended the amendment. It makes much more sense for the Government to ensure that any amendment introduced has been discussed in full with those directly affected, so that their point of view, which is an expert one, can be taken into account and then the amendment circulated and the opinion of the House also taken into account. That is a prudent and normal course to adopt.</P>

      <P>The time being devoted to discussion of this year's Finance Bill in terms of the number of days being taken for Committee Stage is, to my knowledge, as long as we have ever had for the discussion of Committee Stage of a Finance Bill.  What is unfortunate is that much of the time is being used by Opposition Deputies &mdash; and I include here all three Opposition parties &mdash; to make political speeches rather than to address the particular section of the Bill to be debated.  That is regrettable.  Perhaps if we had more time, if there was not a constitutional requirement whereby the Finance Bill must be passed within a certain number of days of the budget debate taking place, it might have been possible to have a different arrangement which would allow greater time.  Unfortunately, the House sits on only three days a week unlike other Parliaments which sit for five days a week.  We have specific time limits within which these Bills must be passed and these are matters agreed by parties on all sides.  Of course, we would have more time for debating the Finance Bill if there were not laid down in the Constitution a time limit within which it must be passed, or if there were a possibility of the House sitting for five days a week rather than three.  It is not the Government alone who are responsible for this <Col N="24" /> situation.  Deputies generally have a requirement to be in their constituencies and it would appear that it is not possible for them to be here on Mondays and Fridays.  Therefore the debate is constrained both by the availability of parliamentary time and by the constitutional requirement.  This means, unfortunately, that from time to time amendments will be circulated rather later than would be desirable.  This is a case where that is so. However, it is not as late as Deputies suggest and is certainly nothing unusual by comparison with past practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall refer the House, if I may, to the main changes contained in the amendment to which this Financial Resolution refers.  First, annuities which are not related to genuine life annuity contracts will cease to be deductible as charges against the profits of the life assurance companies.  This change applies to what may be described as non-genuine life annuity contracts issued on and from yesterday.  It is specifically directed against a loophole exploited by guaranteed income and growth bands which were the major type of tax avoidance investments in the assurance area.</P>
      <P>Three main classes of life assurance business &mdash; namely pension business, general annuity business and life assurance business &mdash; will be treated separately in future, for the purpose of relief for management expenses.  Excess management expenses on one class may not be relieved or set against profits in another class.  In particular, management expenses in relation to pension business, which is exempt from tax anyway, may not and will not in future be capable of being set against or relieved against taxable profits on another class of business, which clearly was essentially a tax avoidance device in so far as life assurance was concerned in the past.  The fact that one could move expenses around, so to speak, from where they were appropriate to where they were not appropriate simply to artificially diminish tax liability is no longer possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, a deduction will no <Col N="26" /> longer be allowed against an assurance company's profits for the special levy on assurance premiums imposed by section 92 of the Finance Act, 1982.  Also, reliefs for genuine life annuities which are treated as charges against profits will be confined to the profits of the company's general annuity business and not usable elsewhere.  The profits of the business relating to what I describe as non-genuine life annuities, such as guaranteed income bonds and growth bonds, will be taxed as part of the life assurance business &mdash; in other words, other than as pension and general annuity business.  Because of the way in which the system operates, these changes are not expected to begin to have a significant impact on the yield of tax until the payment year of 1989; the accounting year of 1988 determines the payments for 1989.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the Second Stage speech on 15 April, these reforms are intended to provide a long term basis for securing a reasonable corporation tax contribution from the life assurance industry.  If extra tax yield were to be sought from companies next year other than by these amendments but by more far-reaching proposals with a more immediate effect they could seriously affect the solvency of some companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy stated on Second Stage a special levy is being imposed this year yielding £20 million. The Deputy suggested that debates in this House have no value and in particular in regard to Finance Bill matters do not yield any outcome.  The fact that this amendment has been produced reveals precisely the opposite is the case because the points the Deputy made on Second Stage were taken into account in this amendment.  Far from Deputy O'Malley's case being true that there is no opportunity for what Deputies say to be taken into account, this amendment demonstrates that it is the case that they can be and are being taken into account. <Col N="27" /> The points made by Deputy O'Malley on Second Stage, which was the appropriate time to make them, were taken into account by me in regard to this amendment.</P>
      <P>Naturally, it was also necessary for me to take into account the views of the industry and the interests of the Revenue Commissioners.  Hence the need for elaborate and lengthy discussions leading up to the introduction of this amendment. These discussions took somewhat longer than I would have liked from the point of view of the timing of the circuclation of the amendment.  This has happened in the past and it is likely to happen in the future until there are fundamental changes in the way in which the House orders its business in regard to the amount of time available each week for debate, until such time as the Opposition cease to waste that time with amendments which have no technical purpose but which are simply a vehicle for political speeches, and until such time as the time limits for the passage of the Finance Bill after the passage of the budget are relaxed.  All of these changes could be brought about, some of them by the Government, but for them to have any effect they would require the co-operation of the Opposition in the manner in which they would be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley asked about section 85 and the prospects of my accepting an amendment to that section which has been put down by Deputies Flynn and O'Kennedy.  I have to say that I regrettably will not be in a position to recommend to the House that it accepts that amendment.  The reason for this is that the effect of the amendment would be to virtually abolish the yield from corporation profits tax from life assurance companies in 1989 which is the year in which it would have full effect.  I have no wish to create a situation in which a substantial gap would be created for the Government in achieving their financial targets in 1989 as a result of measures taken in 1986.  That would not be reasonable from the point of view of the Government <Col N="28" /> responsible to this Dáil passing on financial liabilities in this way to the Government responsible to the next Dáil. Hence, I do not propose to accept the amendment advocated by Deputies Flynn and O'Kennedy.  While this is not strictly relevant it was raised by Deputy O'Malley and it is appropriate to reply at this stage.</P>
    <P>What this amendment illustrates is that, far from the Government allowing the Revenue Commissioners, to use Deputy O'Malley's colourful term, churn out law, points made by Deputies, notably Deputy O'Malley on Second Stage, can be and are listened to by the Government when they come to introduce amendments on Committee Stage.  That does the House, the Government and Deputy O'Malley some credit. Rather than he being, to use another word beginning with &ldquo;c&rdquo;, churlish about it which is not characteristic of him, he should acknowledge the fact that his own efforts have yielded some result in this amendment and he should be more pleased than displeased and somewhat less aggressive in the expression of his views in view of what has actually happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No.42 (a):</P>
      <P>In page 35, line 15, after &ldquo;money&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in excess of the rate of change in the consumer price index in the relevant year&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to make a change in the definition of interest in order to confine the charge to real interest rather <Col N="29" /> than to nominal interest.  In this respect, I am reflecting the views of the Commission on Taxation which felt that for tax purpose what should be regarded as taxable interest should be real interest rather than nominal interest.  This would have the effect of putting that into effect and confining tax to the difference between the rate of interest and the rate of inflation.  This does not make a major difference this year because the rate of inflation, happily, is low and it is estimated that for this year as a whole it will probably come out at about 3 to 3½ per cent.  Therefore, interest rates which are payable now are more significant in real terms than was the case in the past.</P>
    <P>We do not have to cast our minds back very far to remember a time when banks and other similar institutions were paying 6 per cent or 7 per cent to depositors and inflation was running at 18 per cent to 20 per cent.  Therefore, by simply having money in a bank one was actually losing out very seriously in real terms.  We could see those days again.  We may see them either because there will be a substantial and sustained reduction in interest rates, which I would dearly love to see, or because we may go back to times of higher inflation for reasons which are no more under our control than the reasons we have low inflation today are under our control.  They are the result of fortuitous external factors.  They are fortuitous at present but the same external factors were not fortuitous in the past.  We could well go back to that situation again.</P>
    <P>There is very little reality &mdash; and clearly this view is shared by the Commission on Taxation &mdash; in someone receiving 6 per cent interest on money at a time when inflation is running at 18 per cent and then being taxed on the 6 per cent as if it were an actual gain to them.  The purpose of this amendment, therefore, is to try to overcome that situation and bring a sense of reality into what the meaning of interest is.  In real terms, it is simply the excess of the amount of interest over the rate of inflation at the time at which the interest is paid.  If you are going to tax the interest, at least tax it on its real value rather than on its nominal or national value.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> I regret very much many aspects of the proposal, even with the various amendments the Minister has made to the Bill. The failure to exempt people who should be exempted is very serious inasmuch as it is an imposition of tax on a large number of people who would not be liable otherwise for it and who were not liable for it in the past.  Insult is added to injury by the failure of the Government to impose the tax on real interest rather than on nominal interest.  The injury is very considerable indeed.  It is amazing that when the Minister was giving a press conference on 4 April last on the introduction of this Bill and on its circulation he made a statement in which he gave an estimate of the likely yield from this DIRT tax.  He said that if all those who were not liable for tax were exempted 60 per cent of the prospective yield would be lost.  That is a most shattering statement because it makes it perfectly clear that only 40 per cent of the liability that is now being created is on people who are liable for income tax and that the other 60 per cent is in respect of people who are not liable.  They were not liable for tax up to now for a variety of reasons but the main one was that their incomes were so low.  These huge amounts are to be taken from them now.  The prospective yield of tax in a full year is £130 million.</P>

      <P>I am debating the rate of interest and the tax.  I am trying to point out that considerable injury will be done by this proposed tax.  Substantial insult will be added to that injury if the tax is to be charged on nominal interest rather than on real interest.  This is especially so when we have regard to what the Minister said on April 4: that 60 per cent of the yield from the tax would be lost if people who were not liable for tax were excluded from the provisions.  That is appalling.  It does not seem to have made any great impact at the time.  The tax is not just being imposed on poor people <Col N="31" /> but also on sporting organisations and community organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>These people have had no liability for tax up to now.  Suddenly it is being imposed on them at 35 per cent.</P>
      <P>To add insult to that injury &mdash; and this is the point I am trying to put across in my amendment &mdash; the tax is to be changed, not on the real interest that accrues to them, but on the nominal interest.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to contemplate the equity of the situation which existed in this country in the not too distant past of somebody being paid interest at 6 per cent when inflation was running at 18 or 20 per cent.  What real gain is there to such a person?  There is only a real loss and in serious terms.  It is quite inequitable to tax somebody on the nominal gain which in fact is a real loss.  That difficulty can be overcome.  If the House wants to accept the principle of this DIRT tax, which I am not keen on, at least they should apply it only to interest that is earned in real terms.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, for somebody who has money on deposit this year he will earn interest in real terms.  The interest rates one is likely to get on deposits will be double or more than double the likely rate of inflation.  That is good but it is very rare.  Therefore we should legislate not just for the fortuitous circumstances in which we find ourselves this year but for the circumstances which have been much more common for quite a number of years past.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley's amendment echoes the recommendation in paragraph 11.15 of the first report of the Commission on Taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That paragraph states:</P>
      <P>We recommend that the income from all interest-bearing deposits should be charged to tax to the extent only that the rate at which it accrues exceeds the rate of inflation during the period of accrual.  In so far as the interest earned is insufficient to compensate for the erosion of the capital value of the deposit, the shortfall should be allowed as a deduction against other income.</P>
      <P>The interesting part is:</P>
      <P>Interest on borrowings should only be allowed for tax purposes to the extent that the rate at which it is paid exceeds the rate of inflation.  These are essential elements in our recommendations which involve a systematic adjustment of the tax base...</P>
      <P>Note the word &ldquo;systematic&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>...to allow for the erosion of capital by inflation.  These elements include, in addition to indexation of interest, indexation for capital gains tax purposes and the adjustment of business income and they form an integrated package.</P>
      <P>Note the words &ldquo;integrated package&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the interests of equity and efficiency all three elements must be implemented.</P>
      <P>What Deputy O'Malley is doing &mdash; I am not suggesting that it is by design &mdash; is picking from the report the good bits which would reduce the level of taxation applied to interest by subtracting the rate of inflation.  He is not putting in the bad bit which would reduce the extent to which interest can be claimed.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but the Deputy did not say it in his contribution. He referred to the Report of the Commission on Income Taxation and quoted selectively from it.  The Commission recommended that deduction of interest from taxable income should be done only after the rate of inflation has been subtracted.  That would increase the burden on borrowers substantially. Clearly, to do what Deputy O'Malley has suggested would involve considerable extra expense to the Exchequer because you could not pick out the bit that would be beneficial to the taxpayers and the bit beneficial to the Revenue.</P>
      <P>The Deputy said it is not possible for him to move an amendment that would impose an extra charge on the Exchequer, but he is clearly familiar with the report he quoted and I am sure he could manage it.  My personal opinion is that there is much to be said for the recommendation of the Commissioners on Taxation on this general matter, but it will have to be looked at on an integrated basis rather than in isolation as proposed in Deputy O'Malley's amendment.  I will be looking at it during the next year, before the introduction of the next Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated, there is much merit in Deputy O'Malley's case because interest rates have the value of what they are worth only against the background of inflation.  The Deputy's proposal is not part of an integrated package and, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.  If accepted it would cost in the region of £27 million in 1986.  Unless we were to introduce reductions in the way in which interest might be calculated on mortgage relief we would be thereby reducing the value of the mortgage interest allowance. That would be a major change in the tax system.  It would be better to look at the whole thing together rather than try to do it in an isolated way.  However, it was interesting to be able to debate how interest should be calculated.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister confirming that interest rates are running at <Col N="34" /> three or four times the rate of inflation? When is it likely that this will finish, and what can we do about it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, I am very concerned about this.  I have done all I can to reduce interest rates, by every means open to me through the Department's activities with the Central Bank.  It is in our interest as a Government to bring interest rates down because the Government are large borrowers and are paying these rates like other borrowers. Since I took office, for a variety of reasons interest rates have gone down, and in the last week there has been a reduction in the short term position.  I note with satisfaction reports in today's newspapers that there will be a further reduction in the rates.  It is my intention to do everything possible within limits to reduce interest rates, but it must be appreciated that interest rates are the price of money and that they are governed ultimately by supply and demand. The Government can influence the matter somewhat but they cannot overcome the fundamental law of supply and demand.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 43:</P>
      <P>In page 35, subsection (1), lines 27 to 29, to delete paragraph (a) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) which is made by, and the interest on which is beneficially owned by&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  a relevant deposit taker,</P>
      <P>(ii) the Central Bank of Ireland,</P>
      <P>or</P>
      <P>(iii) the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, plc.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to allow deposits made by the Administrator of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland to be outside the scope of the retention tax provided for in Chapter IV of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that purpose, the amendment provides for the insertion of a new paragraph <Col N="35" /> (a)  in the definition of &ldquo;relevant deposit&rdquo; in section 27 (1) of the Bill.  The existing paragraph (a) provides that bank etc. deposits are not to be &ldquo;relevant deposits&rdquo;&mdash; so that, accordingly interest on the deposits will not be subject to deduction of tax at source &mdash; where the deposits are held by, and the interest on them is beneficially owned by, a relevant deposit taker, as defined in section 27 (1) or by the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The new paragraph (a), as provided for by this amendment, includes, in addition to the references to a relevant deposit taker and the Central Bank which were in the existing paragraph (a), a reference to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  Thus interest on deposits made by the company with a relevant deposit taker may be paid without the deduction of tax.</P>
    <P>Funds provided under the terms of the rescue scheme established for the Insurance Corporation of Ireland are currently held on deposit by the administrator.  The interest arising on these deposits is an important element of the rescue scheme. If such interest were to be subject to deduction of tax at source, the benefit of the interest to the current cash flow of the company would be significantly reduced.  It is, therefore, desirable that such interest should continue to be paid in full without deduction of tax, and the Government have decided, accordingly, that the company should be relieved from the retention tax in the same way as interbank deposits, or deposits by the Central Bank with a licensed bank, are relieved.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the administration of the ICI is being funded by long term loans of £100 million through the Central Bank, of which £70 million has been provided by Allied Irish Banks.  The money has been lent by the bank to the Minister for Finance who in turn passed it on to the ICI fund in the High Court which, in turn, makes it available to the administrator with the authority of the court.  The interest rate is a very fine one and has been subsidised by the banking <Col N="36" /> system.  There is no mark-up on the interest either for the Minister or the compensation fund.  Both the Minister and the compensation fund are simply a means of passing the money through to the ICI, in other words, conduits.  The administrator has invested the money at the precise interest obtained thereon.  It is an essential element in his cash flow calculations &mdash; without it he could not service the debts he has.  Some of the fund was placed with the Minister but a large part of it was deposited with banks, much of it in compulsory trust accounts to cover potential future liabilities. Therefore, in view of the fact that the State is precluded from giving any direct aid&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> If the Deputy allows me, I will give him the information.  Largescale household budget surveys were undertaken in respect of the years 1951-52 and 1965-66 when only urban areas were covered and in 1973 and 1980 when both urban and rural areas were surveyed.  Therefore, a seven-year cycle has been established for undertaking this survey since 1965-66 and, as the last largescale household budget survey was carried out in 1980, the next survey should be carried out in 1987.  That is in keeping with the seven-year cycle that has been established.  It is not on a five-year basis as stated by the Deputy.  While I cannot anticipate a Government decision, it is my view that the Government will approve the holding of a household budget survey in 1987.</P>
      <P>As is the normal practice, a sum of money was made available in the 1986 Estimates for preparatory work but naturally that money cannot be spent until a Government decision is taken with regard to carrying out the survey in 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If the survey takes place in 1987 &mdash; and attempts are being made at the moment to block it &mdash; the results will not be known until 1988 which will <Col N="40" /> be eight and a half years since the last survey was carried out.  My point is that the way people spent their money in 1980 when the country was doing well economically is not in line with the way they do so now when the country has been in a recession for three years.  The inflation rate of 2 or 3 per cent is not based on the way people are spending their money.  It is a flawed figure.</P>

        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> The statements made are not accurate.  The main purpose of a largescale household budget survey is to provide detailed information on current household expenditure patterns for updating the consumer price index.  As I have said, the seven-year cycle has been established since 1965-66. In view of the fact that the last survey was undertaken in 1980, it would follow the established cycle that the next survey should be undertaken in 1987.  There is also a corresponding seven-yearly updating of the CPI.  That was done in November 1968, in 1975 and in 1982.  We are not departing from what has been done in the past.  I am confident that a survey will be undertaken in 1987 but I am not in a position to anticipate a Government decision.  All I am saying to the Deputy is that we have made initial preparations for the holding of the survey in 1987 and once the Government decision is taken it will proceed.</P>

        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> That is a question of opinion.  I am not in the business of giving one's own opinion on this matter.  I have to stick to facts.  The detailed information to be collected in a household budget survey is laid out. Those details will be the same as in the past.  It is a question of opinion as to how people spend their money.  The Government have made preparations for the holding of a survey.  We are sticking to the seven-year cycle.  There were seven-yearly updatings of the CPI in 1968, 1975 and 1982.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 10 and 24 together.  Notwithstanding the very considerable cost of acquiring defensive and other equipment for the Defence Forces, expenditure in this area by my Department is subject to the financial constraints necessarily imposed on all Government spending.  There is, however, a continuous programme for the provision of modern up-to-date equipment for the Defence Forces generally, <Col N="42" /> within the financial resources available.  I mentioned recently, for example, that the replacement of some small arms weapons has been under consideration and that new helicopters are due for delivery shortly.  Improvements in particular areas will continue to be made as necessary to maintain the capability of the Defence Forces to discharge their roles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister confirm whether the testing of weapons which his Department propose to purchase has been completed?  Can he give any indication of when he proposes to purchase any consignment of weapons? Has any order been placed for the purchase of these weapons?  Can he tell us when we can expect delivery of the helicopters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the first part of the Deputy's supplementary, I had occasion to answer that question here a short time ago when I said that final assessment of small arms weapons was taking place and that when it had been completed an order would be placed.  A decision has been taken on replacement and it is a question of when the people directly involved in assessing the adequacy of these weapons will complete their task.  Then the order will be placed. Department personnel have been diligently pursuing the matter of the helicopers in recent times and I am now advised that delivery of helicopters will commence next month.  I understand that two helicopters will be delivered initially and the remaining three will be delivered at fortnightly intervals thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the information that we can expect delivery of at least two helicopters next month.  I assume that the assessment of replacement weapons has not yet terminated. Would the Minister agree that the cost to the Army and to his Department of maintaining existing weapons which are becoming obsolete is very high and that it is urgent to proceed with the replacement of as many of these weapons as financially possible in 1986?  Can he give <Col N="43" /> a commitment that at least some of these weapons will be replaced in 1986?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree that weapons which are obsolete and obsolescent should be replaced.  I fully agree that maintenance costs are very high and that is why we decided some time ago to consider replacing these weapons.  It is important to make the right decision on the kind of weapons to be purchased since they will have long term use in the Defence Forces.  I am not technically minded, nor can I pre-empt what might be decided in relation to the examination by the experts who are assessing these weapons.  I would hope the assessment would be completed as soon as possible so that we could begin purchasing.</P>

      <P>This is the Minister for Defence who has responsibility for defence matters and the fact that VAT is imposed on purchases within the Department of Defence deprives the Minister of resources and facilities that would be available if VAT was not imposed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to comment on whether we are the only <Col N="49" /> country in western Europe who apply VAT to military goods.</P>
      <P>There are two factors involved.  The first is that since the inception of the VAT system, VAT has been applied to a variety of goods including military goods and other goods and services in areas in which a case as strong as a case for military services could be made.  However, I should like to see the VAT element removed.  We have been talking to the Revenue Commissioners on this issue and the advice we have got is that because of EC restrictions we would not be allowed introduce a zero VAT rate on any particular type of commodity, including military goods.  Let me also point out that it does not necessarily follow that if there is a zero VAT rating for any purchase of goods, such as military goods, that there would be more money available to buy more goods.  One must remember that the State would have that much less in revenue.  So it is a Catch-22 situation.  I know it is a circular transfer but that is the system and it applies in other areas also.  Apart from all that there is the definitive EC restriction which prohibits the introduction of zero VAT rating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that VAT is eating into a lot of the financial resources available to his Department?  I submit that VAT on purchases within his Department is basically a transfer of resources.  Since we are a neutral country, could the Minister, through his Cabinet colleagues, make a special application for special exemption for Ireland, on the basis that we are a neutral country and not involved in any alliances, to de-rate the VAT charges on military purchases here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the heading of other interests to which the question and answer referred, does the Minister foresee a day when the Air Corps and the Naval Service will be adequately equipped to provide a comprehensive air rescue service and so avoid the humiliating situation which has so often developed here?</P>
      <P>No later than last week on one day we got a protest in this House about a British helicopter committing an incursion into Irish air space and a couple of days earlier a helicopter belonging to the same British service assisted in the attempted rescue of an unfortunate member of one of our fishing trawlers off the south coast.  I would like to see the day come when we either stop protesting about incursions or can provide adequate air/sea rescue services of our own.  The present situation is a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's statement that it is anomalous, to say the least, that we do this kind of thing.  We are about to receive five new helicopters which will have capacity way beyond what we have been accustomed to.  They are twin-engined helicopters and can operate at night.  They have the most up to date facilities in the world in that area of activity.  Together with the <i>Eithne,</i> a very well equipped ship carrying helicopters, they will hopefully give us a capacity in the area of air and sea rescue services <Col N="51" /> which we did not have before.  While we will not have a comprehensive service, it will be a great improvement on what went before.</P>

Is that not an undignified situation for this Republic to be in?</P>

In relation to the second part of his question, we have modern equipment, albeit not to the same extent as other military services or armed forces, which needs specialist servicing by specialist personnel who, in turn, need training.  In many cases the only place they can get adequate training is where the equipment is manufactured and supplied.  That is why we send our personnel abroad and I consider it worth while.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service whether he has seen a report in the media (details supplied) suggesting that his Department are unable to collect reliable statistics on the numbers employed in different departments of the public sector and that this failure may be due in part to deliberate obstruction; whether there is any substance in this suggestion; and, if so, what he proposes to do about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the media report referred to.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service is the only area for which I have direct responsibility.  I am satisfied that the statistics available in my Department in respect of the Civil Service are adequate and reliable.  They will, however, be further improved when a computerised personnel system at present being considered for the Civil Service generally is introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the wider public service I would hope that difficulties which have <Col N="53" /> been encountered there will be surmounted when the co-ordinating role envisaged for my Department in <i>Serving the Country Better</i> is given statutory effect.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the suggestion that there is deliberate obstruction in making information available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if his Department have not done more than merely look at the media report which was all that was available to me when I put my question down?  About ten days have gone by since the publication of this report.  Have the Department studied this very important report?  Does the Minister know if they have studied it?  Perhaps I should tell the Minister, because it may not be in his brief, that the author acknowledges assistance from members of that Department in compiling his report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the author's investigations related to a period a few years back and the report may not be totally up to date.  In relation to the point raised by the Deputy, obviously the views expressed by such a reputable author are considered seriously.  In the context of the question put down by the Deputy, I have gone to considerable trouble to find out the exact situation within the Civil Service and in the broader public service area.  In relation to the Civil Service, for which I have direct statutory responsibility, the system we have at the moment, with some improvements which have occurred in recent years, is reliable and adequate but I see room for further improvement.  That will happen when the computerised system is put in place.  My Department recently went to tender for such a system and, subject to the availability of a system which meets all our requirements, it is intended to have a system operating on a pilot basis in at least two sites by the end of the year and further improvements will result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the public service, at the moment I do not have statutory responsibility there but the upcoming legislation <Col N="54" /> in this area will give me the statutory base which will enable us to provide a better authority for the assembling and analysis of information across the entire public service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister like to comment on the fact that 13 years after the establishment of a special Department whose purpose was to improve the public service, it should still not be possible for that Department to know how much goes out in pay each week or month, and to how many people in each Department in the Civil Service. Does he not think it amazing that a reputable author &mdash; as he rightly said and I would like to endorse that view &mdash; publishing under the aegis of the ESRI which is funded by the State, should use words like &ldquo;ludicrous&rdquo; and &ldquo;bizarre&rdquo; to describe the defects in the recording system of the State in regard to the number and locations of its own employees and how much is being paid out to them in salaries each week?  Would he not regard it as a matter of first urgency to make sure that, at the very least, as Dr. Ross suggests, the pay computers of each Department should be linked to a central system so that week by week and month by month the Government can keep track of how well each Department are keeping within their budget, given that pay is the big end of the pot in every Department pay out?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot account for what happened in the past 13 years.  I can relate only to the situation in the past 13 weeks during which I have been in the Department.  As I have mentioned, we must be clear on the distinction between what occurs within the Civil Service for which the Department of the Public Service have direct statutory responsibility and the situation in the broader public service for which the Department do not have such direct responsibility as yet. One reason for the decision in the White Paper to provide for that co-ordinating role is the very point the Deputy raised. The upcoming legislation will give that broader co-ordinating function to the <Col N="55" /> Department.  However, I would like to make it clear, in case there is any suggestion that people may be paid who are not part of the authorised establishment of the Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I hope this year to see an improvement of the technology and an improvement of the statutory role of the Department of the Public Service.

      <P>This report is very useful in a number of ways, but the question that receives a great deal of publicity and attention is only in relation to the number of people working in the Department of the Public Service.  Does the Minister really need statutory control to find out how many teachers and doctors there are?  All of these agencies have to send in returns to the various Departments they are linked to.  They are on approved complements and are allowed to employ only on grants-in-aid or the deficit funding which they receive from Government Departments.  That practice has been in operation in most organisations since the sixties and in the health boards since 1971.  The Minister needs neither a computer nor statutory control to do a head count.  What Departments, agencies or semi-State companies is the Minister referring to when he says that he is not happy with the figures returned? I understand that his Department have all this information and that this was on a tot of the figures which came in.  Were some of these figures left out or what is the difficulty?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difficulty in relation to the Civil Service itself, although from the point of view of removing time lags and having statistics available at the press of a button and more up to date, the new technology would help.  In the broader public sector there is need for the statutory role of the Department of the Public Service.  Let me quote a few examples of the difficulties, to give the House a better appreciation of the situation.  If the Department had this statutory role, with the improvement in technology we would get much greater improvements from the point of view of the broader public sector.  Let us look at some of the difficulties.</P>

We have national, secondary, special school, comprehensive, community, vocational, university and other institutions of higher education and other school employees who are not teachers at all.  Then we go into the area of whole time incremental, whole time temporary, part time and all these aspects in relation to them.  Therefore, it is not quite as easy as it looks. But I assure the House that during this year, with the new legislation and with the new technology being put in place, I hope particularly in relation to the broader public sector to have an improved situation.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Minister's denial that there can be any question of obstruction, would he like to comment on the author saying that his experience has been that resentment or feeling of Departments over the embargo which has had the effect of reducing staff numbers has made them less willing to provide material which he regards as a mere bureaucratic irrelevancy on the part of the Department of the Public Service?

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 12 and 18 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="58" /> The Civil Service is the only area of the public service where I currently have statutory responsibility for control of numbers and grades employed.  The information sought about the representation of women at higher levels and the number and percentage of women in the higher grades of the civil service is in the form of tabular statements which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>While the tables show that women are under-represented in the higher levels of the civil service, the proportion of women serving in the higher grades has increased significantly in the past decade.  The figures show that, today, over 23 per cent of assistant principals, the main middle management grade in the Civil Service, are women.  This compares with 4 per cent in 1972.  In the grade of higher executive officer, the comparable figures are 33 per cent and 12 per cent respectively. As stated in the White Paper on the Public Service, paragraph 4.20, the Government as employer are committed to equality of opportunity and to fuller participation by women throughout the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>A number of major initiatives have been taken by my Department in the area of equal opportunity.  Since January 1984 a section in the Department have been designated with specific responsibility for women's affairs.  The section serves as a focal point for the co-ordination, development and implementation of policy in this area.  They are involved in negotiations on a wide range of claims on equality and family issues with staff side interests under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service. Another significant development has been the introduction of more flexible working arrangements which are of particular importance to staff wishing to combine a career and family responsibility. These include the schemes of career breaks, job-sharing and flexible working hours.  For women in management grades, the Civil Service Training Centre has designed and launched a new course &ldquo;The Woman Manager&rdquo; which is specifically designed to encourage <Col N="59" /> women employees to develop and enhance their management potential.</P>
    <P>Guidelines for implementing the policy of equal opportunity in the Civil Service will be issued by my Department in the near future.  These guidelines will deal <Col N="60" /> with equality in relation to recruitment, placement, training and promotion and will ensure that advances made by women in the Civil Service to date will continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree, looking at the percentage of females employed in the Civil Service, that something is drastically wrong with the Appointments Commission when, although the positions were competed for by women, only one woman could come through in that two year period?  Does the Minister accept that there seems to be an anomaly in relation to the figures given for higher executive officer and executive officer positions?  Does the Minister also accept that, compared with men, a very low percentage of women have been appointed?  I do not want to hear a long speech, like that of the Minister's predecessor, about pious aspirations in regard to the employment of women in the Civil Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say that nothing has been done about this.  In regard to higher executive officers, there are 827 men and 414 women in this grade. I mentioned the progress which has been made since 1972 and the comparable figures &mdash; 33 per cent at present as against 12 per cent then.  It is easy to pinpoint the situation at the top level but we must be realistic in regard to other grades.  The <Col N="62" /> under representation of women in the higher levels of the Civil Service is related to the general restriction on the employment of married women which existed until the Civil Service (Employment of Married Women) Act, 1973, ended the restriction.  The effects will work their way through the grading structure in time but progress has been made and the Government are committed to making further progress.  I have already outlined the initiatives which my Department are taking although we are still some way from total equality.</P>

      <P>It is not specifically related to the original question and my brief does not indicate the position in regard to the top level appointments commission.  It is necessary to reiterate that, because of the restrictions up to 1973, there was been very little progress at the top level but the commitment of the Government is clearly indicated by the very substantial progress made at middle management level.</P>

The question referred to the group which appoint people at <Col N="63" /> higher level but, unfortunately, the Minister is not briefed on that matter.

      <P>The Deputy will not be restricted.  I take it both Deputies are referring to the pay proposals which emerged in January last, details of which I set out in a reply to questions from the two Deputies on 20 March last.</P>
      <P>The package of proposals has now been offered to a wide variety of public service unions and associations and the following is a summary of the current position in the main areas.</P>
      <P>At a meeting of the General Council of the Civil Service General Staff Panel on Wednesday 20 April, the Civil Service Executive Union indicated their acceptance of the 25th round package.  The Federated Union of Government Employees have also indicated their acceptance of the package.  The package has been offered to the other unions on the staff panel and is being considered by them.  One union, the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants, have indicated that the package is not acceptable to them.</P>
      <P>Two of the unions on the Civil Service Higher Staff Panel, the Association of Higher Civil Servants and the Veterinary Officers' Association, have indicated their acceptance of the package.  I have already indicated the position of the third union &mdash; the UPTCS &mdash; on the panel.</P>
      <P>The Garda Representative Association, the Representative Body for Superintendents and the Chief Superintendents' Representative Body have all indicated their acceptance of the package. The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors have not yet responded to the proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been made clear to the teacher unions that the same package of proposals put to the other unions is also on offer to them.  Deputies will be aware of the current discussions with the teacher <Col N="65" /> unions.  While these discussions are continuing I do not propose to comment further on the teachers' position.</P>
    <P>The package of proposals was put to the staff panel under the Local Authority and Health Services C &amp; A Scheme on 17 January.  No formal response has been received to date.</P>
    <P>In regard to local authority manual grades, an offer of the public service pay package which had been endorsed in a Labour Court recommendation has been rejected by the unions representing general operatives in Dublin Corporation and further talks are taking place on the package; 25th round settlements have not yet been reached with general workers in other local authorities and health boards or with craft workers.</P>
    <P>As regards the implementation of the increases for those groups who have accepted the agreement, all relevant payments will be made as soon as the necessary formalities have been complied with.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;round&rdquo; increase of 7 per cent consists of a 3 per cent increase from 1 May 1986, 2 per cent from 1 January next and a further 2 per cent from 1 May 1987. The cost in 1986 of applying this 3 per cent increase across the public service as a whole is approximately £52 million.</P>
    <P>The proposals also involve the phasing in under clause 3.2 of special increases where the adjudication hearings had taken place prior to 1 January 1986.  Such increases will be implemented in three phases over the period from 1 December 1986 to 1 July 1988.  On the question of the costs of arbitration awards, the total annual cost of all existing arbitration awards in the Civil Service, teachers and local authority areas is approximately £70 million for those groups directly covered by the awards.  The approximate cost of implementing these awards under Clause 3.2 of the current proposals in the years 1986 to 1989 is as follows:</P>

In regard to implementation, I referred in my reply to necessary formalities to be completed and, as soon as these formalities have been completed, payment will be made.

The Government have proposed paying that award in instalments commencing next December and to be completed by 1988.  Is the Minister aware that negotiations in regard to that award began in 1981?  Will he agree it is ridiculous that an award which follows talks that have been going since 1981 should be paid in instalments up to 1989?  Will the Minister give a commitment to enter discussions with that group, represented by the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants, on the implementation of that award?

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's policy for the protection of the population from the effects of radioactive fall-out in the event of nuclear war is based on the concept of domestic refuge rooms prepared by householders themselves and on the ability of the Civil Defence organisation to predict and monitor radioactivity and to warn and advise the public in relation to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the levels of radiation which might reasonably be expected in this country, the mere fact of staying indoors, in itself, provides a significant protection and this protection factor can be very <Col N="70" /> substantially increased by carrying out simple protective measures.  Advice to the public in this regard is contained in my Department's booklet, <i>Bas/Beatha,</i> which is available free of charge.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for detecting, measuring and predicting radioactivity and advising the public in relation to this have been set up.  National, regional and county control centres provide a comprehensive infrastructure for a national warning and monitoring network and the warden service of Civil Defence is equipped with and is trained in the use of radiation dose rate meters capable of detecting levels of radiation over a range from the very high &mdash; such as might be expected to result from a nuclear war &mdash; right down to levels far below those which would merit concern.</P>
    <P>The Civil Defence organisation, in which the vast majority of personnel are volunteers, have an aggregate strength in the region of 40,000 and the active strength is about half that number.  For a fall-out situation the required national strength is 4,000 approximately and I am satisfied that requirement is met and that such personnel are adequately equipped and trained.</P>
    <P>In relation to any radioactivity-linked peacetime incident, my Department maintain liaison with the Department of Energy who have primary responsibility in this regard.</P>
    <P>I will have more to say on the matter of Civil Defence preparedness when the 1986 Estimate for Defence is presented to the Dáil for consideration in the near future.</P>

Are there annual, biannual or quarterly meetings and what is the system of communication or co-operation operated by the Minister's Department?</P>

      <P>The monitoring network consists of the Department of Defence personnel, the Army Observer Corps, which is being expanded this year, elements of the Garda Síochána, the Meteorological Service, Irish Lights, RTE, certain local authority personnel and volunteer personnel of the Civil Defence warden service, which includes radiation protection, national, regional and county control centres with communications links and a broadcasting facility under national control.  Its equipment includes radiation measurement instruments. The network is tested about once a year, through the national fall-out exercise, which has performed well in the course of these tests.  I have been on one of them.  They are very effective and operate right across the whole country in a very effective way.  In my view the overall service is well organised and very effective.</P>

Is the Minister aware that, for the forthcoming all-Ireland Civil Defence finals, there are counties in which there is one unit only of Civil Defence, that there are several counties in which there is no unit of Civil Defence and what action does he propose to take to ensure that there are adequate Civil Defence units in every part of every county?</P>

      <P>That is the intention. It is done on a regional and county basis. As the Deputy will be aware, local authorities play a major role in this.  Some local authorities are more effective at organising than others.  I want to assure the Deputy and the House that we ensure at all times that we establish a well-knit Civil Defence organisation throughout the country.  That is done through my Department, my officials, in liaison with the Department of Defence, who operate it very effectively.  I know there are some <Col N="72" /> areas in which the position is not as satisfactory as in others.  It should be remembered that this is a voluntary service and that it must be done by way of example. I am satisfied that the will and enthusiasm exist.  I should say that while there are 40,000 members in the voluntary service, 20,000 of them are active.  That is a sizeable number of people operating on the ground on a voluntary basis.  It is something of which we should be very proud, that we have such numbers of people coming forward and acting in such a very responsible manner.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been referring to the necessity for this amendment which excludes deposits belonging to the administrator of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland from application of the deposit interest retention tax.  I pointed out that already interbank deposits &mdash; that is, deposits by one <Col N="106" /> bank with another or deposits by the Central Bank with a licensed bank &mdash; are themselves also relieved from the deposit interest retention tax.  In order not to upset the finely drawn financial calculations upon which the recovery package for the Insurance Corporation of Ireland has been drawn up, we are providing that this calculation would not be in any way upset or changed by the subsequent introduction of the deposit interest retention tax.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of points that might be made in respect of this amendment it might be appropriate to point out that the recovery package for the Insurance Corporation of Ireland is not being financed by the taxpayer, as is very frequently claimed by interested parties who are looking for public money, making the spurious claim that, if it can be done for the ICI, it can be done for them or that, if one is making a financial promise &mdash; as was contended by the Opposition recently &mdash; well, it is a small amount of money only in comparison with the cost of the ICI rescue package.  This is being financed on the basis of a loan, the vast bulk of which is being given by Allied Irish Banks &mdash; £70 million &mdash; and the remainder, £30 million, by the Central Bank.  The interest on that loan to the administrator is in the region of 2 per cent per annum.  The difference is being made up by the banking system generally.</P>
      <P>The banks are contributing, essentially, in the form of interest subsidy, £7 million per annum, towards the cost of servicing this loan.  The balance is the 2 per cent that is to be paid by the administrator. Therefore, it should be obvious that it is the banking system essentially that is financing the arrangements for the recovery of the ICI, which is not unreasonable because the necessity to intervene, to provide a means of keeping the ICI in being arose from the fact that it was owned by a bank.  Therefore, it was considered necessary that the banking system should not be subject to the danger that might have arisen if the action taken by the Government had not been taken quickly, as it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the danger to the banking <Col N="107" /> system is something which would affect every household in the most adverse way, for example, people who have money on deposit.  Those who have money on loan from the bank would find suddenly that all that money was due to be repaid immediately although they might have made provision to repay it over a number of years.  In order to keep the banking system in operation on a reasonably secure basis, on which so many jobs directly rely but practically all jobs indirectly rely, the Government's action was reasonable.  It was achieved in a manner which does not involve the taxpayers in financing it, but rather the banking system itself in the way that I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I am saying this because it is necessary to put the record straight.  Even though it was put straight at the time, many people since &mdash; and I cite most particularly some of the disputants in the present argument about teachers' pay &mdash; have been making inaccurate statements about the taxpayers financing the ICI when, in fact, that is not the case, as I have illustrated.  It is only reasonable, although it has not a great deal of reference to this section but has some, to make the points I have just made.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a few references to amendments that I wish to introduce on Report Stage.  These will be circulated in time to allow Members on all sides of the House to consider them, but in order to give the House notice of the subjects to be covered, I should like to draw attention to my intentions on these matters.</P>

      <P>On Report Stage we will be debating the whole matter if I propose to change the Bill.  If I do not propose to change the Bill, we shall not be debating it, because there will be no need.</P>
      <P>Changes are also required in relation to the tax arrears situation where there is a fixed charge held on the book debts of a company.  An amendment to effect such changes will be circulated prior to Report Stage.  This amendment will provide that in certain circumstances the holder of a fixed charge on the book debts will be liable for the tax arrears of the company in question.  This change is necessary to ensure as far as reasonably possible that taxes collected by a company are paid to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Report Stage I shall also be moving an amendment to insert new sections 49 and 50 in the Finance Bill.  These new <Col N="110" /> sections will provide for amendments in sections 40 and 41 of the Finance Act 1984 to take account of objections raised by the EC Commission in their existing scope.  In the case of section 40 which imposes certain limitations on tax based leasing, the proposed amendment could enable an machinery or plant leased for use any manufacturing or exempted Shannon activities to qualify for unrestricted capital allowances.  Otherwise leased machinery or plant not grant aided will be subject to the limitations imposed by section 40.</P>
    <P>In the case of section 41, the effect of the proposed amendment will be to exclude some IA assisting services from access to section 84 finance.  In view of that being quite a complex statement, I shall have copies made and given to the four Deputies present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I inquire from the Minister in relation to this amendment why, for example, the administrator of the PMPA is not included if the administrator of the ICI is?  The ICI are at present trading.  It seems to put them at a very major advantage as against all their competitors, not just the PMPA in administration, but all the companies which were prudent enough not to get themselves into administraton, liquidation or anything else.  These companies are trying to operate in the light of severe difficulties in the market place, particularly so far as general insurance companies are concerned, of which the ICI are one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ICI got themselves into the situation they are in today due to extremely imprudent actions over a period of years. Why is their administrator given these very generous facilities that their bank deposits will be free of tax when no other company with which they have to compete is given them?  In particular, why is the administrator of PMPA not given these?  He has funds at his disposal not provided by the Central Bank or AIB but by the levy on general insurance. No doubt, he has some income from the <Col N="111" /> deposit interest that these funds accumulate from time to time before they are used up and replenished.  Surely he must be in the same situation.</P>
    <P>Ordinary insurance companies which are not in administration and are trading at present have funds at their disposal from time to time on which they seek to obtain an investment income, because most of these general companies are operating at an underwriting loss.  Is it not therefore going to affect their investment income and accordingly their overall results if their deposit funds are subjected to this retention tax but those of one of their main competitors, the ICI, are not? The ICI are given this privilege simply because they were foolish enough to put themselves in a position where they had to be bailed out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that the Minister's amendment, as he said, is put in there to remove the ICI from the tax retention.  This poses questions, not only the ones Deputy O'Malley has rightly posed about the PMPA.  There are other areas where one has to pose questions.  The Minister is exempting relevant deposit takers and they are listed in the Bill as being building societies and so on, but what about companies like Fóir Teoranta and the Electricity Supply Board, the poor liquidator of Irish Shipping, the local authorities, the Housing Finance Agency who are all handling State funds at one time or another and who are putting these funds on deposit? They are not being exempted as the ICI are being exempted.  We have to put this rather strongly today as it is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is happening in this amendment is that it is part of the rescue of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  The Minister did not put it like that, but this section of the Finance Bill is now becoming part of the rescue of ICI.  I put it to the Minister that, if there is to be a rescue <Col N="112" /> package involving all sorts of areas to assist the ICI, it should be done in a more direct way as part of a package to keep the company moving, and not slipped into the Finance Bill to give them a competitive advantage over other people in the market.  This is the wrong way to be of assistance to the ICI if that is what the Minister wants to do and clearly it is.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister is trying to steady the nerves in the market place and Ministers have to do that, but I must take issue with the Minister over his statement that the ICI do not cost the taxpayer any money and only cost the banks money. The Minister said the figures are £70 million from the AIB and £30 million from the Central Bank.  I hear the Minister saying that it has been easy for the people of Ireland and that between the AIB and the Central Bank the ICI have been sorted out.  The Minister gets angry when people say this costs the taxpayers money.  I have to say this to the Minister. At the end of the day the money provided by the Central Bank and the AIB will ultimately be taxpayers' funds because successive Ministers, long after the present Minister has gone, will come into this House and tell us that we have to keep the banking system afloat.  Therefore, they have to get this, that and the other concession.  After all, it is part of building up banking confidence.  The State must yield on this and on that, yield on this tax matter and on this confidentiality matter and all the areas which are designed to support deposits in our financial institutions.  Of course, this is what we all want to do.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should let it go out from this debate this evening that suddenly the whole ICI debacle magically is being dealt with with mirrors at no cost to the public.  That is not the situation in my view.  It may not be of direct cheque signing cost to the public this year or next year, but at the end of the day that £100 million or so will come out of the pockets of the Irish people because that is where the banks get their money.  If it is going to cost the banks today, it is going to cost the public tomorrow.  I should hammer that on the head in this debate because <Col N="113" /> it is a bit disingenuous to suggest that suddenly the ICI are sorted out and the public get off scot free.  I doubt very much that will be the situation.  Why pick out the ICI in this Bill at this time?  As Deputy O'Malley rightly said, why not the PMPA which are in a broadly similar situation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The ICI have to hold substantial moneys on deposit as part of the rescue package in order to meet their foreign liabilities.  The PMPA, to which Deputy O'Malley referred, do not have foreign liabilities.  Because of the critical position of the ICI the banks, mainly foreign ones, in respect of the foreign liabilities required the ICI to hold funds with them.  It was part of the original package that the money paid over by the AIB and the Central Bank by this very circuitous route to the administrator had to be put back in turn into the banking system.  Obviously, it was available for use by the ICI.  This is not a new concession for the ICI in the sense that all it is doing is ensuring that the introduction of the deposit interest retention tax does not change the pre-existing position as far as the ICI are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally enough, given that this was a very large rescue operation, the figures were extremely finely drawn in order to ensure that the minimum amount of money was put in to ensure that the rescue was successful.  The figures were calculated very carefully, needless to say. Anything which came in subsequently such as this tax which changed the basis of the rescue was something which had to be provided for.  It could not be provided for by bringing in new money because the banks have done what they are going to do as far as putting money in is concerned.  There is no question of the taxpayer putting in money and the Central Bank have also put in all they are going to put in.  If the situation was changed by extraneous action, such as the introduction of this tax, it had to be provided against by ensuring that that did not apply to the ICI.  Essentially, all we are doing in this amendment is maintaining the situation as it was.  There is no <Col N="114" /> new concession.  It depends on what way we look at it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a necessary measure to achieve something that truthfully everyone needs to achieve. Deputy Brennan made an interesting point when he pointed out that in essence the banking system ultimately is the same as the taxpayers of Ireland and that money taken out of the banking system ultimately affects the same people who are paying taxes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair point. It does, in a sense, put in context the simplistic ideas such as that the Government should not step in and should not have provided a mechanism whereby the banks could save themselves.  Obviously, the people who would suffer, if the Government had not taken the action they took, would have been the very taxpayers Deputy Brennan and I and everyone else in this House are concerned with.  He made the point quite well that essentially it is the same people ultimately. As I have pointed out already the taxpayers are not making a contribution. This is being done by means of the AIB which is a private bank providing the bulk of the funds, the private banking system providing the interest subsidy which comes to £7 million a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a contribution by the Central Bank.  The Central Bank is owned by the State and any contribution that it makes ultimately affects the amount of their surplus.  That, in turn, affects their ability to make a contribution from their surplus towards the Exchequer.  There is no guarantee as to whether they will have a surplus of any size, because many other factors affect the size of the surplus.  They also have a means of increasing their surplus, if they so wish, by decisions that they take, so that they could still maintain the same level of contribution to the Exchequer even though they may have <Col N="115" /> other provisions to make.  I hope that I have answered reasonably the points that have been made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not dealt with the competition from the other insurance companies, not just the PMPA.  They have money on deposit with banks and they have to bear the tax.  Why is this most improvidently run company, or the remnants of it, given this advantage?  Whether or not it was correct for the Minister to claim that the taxpayer had not made any contribution to the ICI, that it was banking money and Central Bank money, the position now is that the taxpayer is making a major contribution on this amendment. We are told by the Minister that the administrator of ICI has to hold £100 million on deposit against certain foreign liabilities.  On that sum of money he would be likely to receive an interest rate of about 13 per cent which is £13 million. The interest on that at 35 per cent amounts to almost £4.5 million.  The other taxpayers of Ireland will have to make up that £4.5 million.  It is £4.5 million less yield on this tax.  One could ask why should the administrator of the ill-fated and improvidently run ICI receive a present of £4.5 million each year from the taxpayer when other organisations such as the GAA have to pay tax on their deposits.  I do not think the GAA have done much harm to the economy or to any other aspect of Irish life over the last 100 years.  These questions deserve more precise answers.  The competitors of the ICI, in particular, deserve an answer. They do not get £100 million handed to them.  They get limited funds from their policyholders.  Some of those are short term funds which they deposit in banks from time to time.  They do not get vast amounts of interest the same as the ICI. They get smaller sums, which are vital to them.  Why should they be subject to 35 per cent interest when the ICI are not subject to it?</P>

      <P>In view of what has been said, would the Minister not accept <Col N="116" /> that amendment No. 43 is, in effect, introducing a new subsidy for the ICI in the sense that it is not being made subject to what is quite a heavy taxation being imposed on the other institutions.  As far as I am concerned, it is a straight subsidy. Let us call it that and get it out of the way.</P>

      <P>As I explained in response to Deputy O'Malley's original question, the ICI, peculiarly among insurance companies because of the nature of its foreign liabilities, is required to hold money on deposit in banks.  Other insurance companies who have similar money available to them would not keep it on deposit in banks.  It would not be sensible because of the rate of interest.  They would tend to put it in other savings instruments, one of which be gilts, which are not liable to deposit interest retention tax.  Because of the competitive position of the ICI they have to hold the money on deposit in a bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible for me to change it.  As I explained to Deputy O'Malley, that arises from the nature of their foreign liabilities.  The competitive position of other companies is not therefore affected in the way that Deputy O'Malley suspects.  The other companies would not be holding money on deposit in the banks to the same degree.  They would tend to hold their money in other forms of savings which would not be liable to the tax.  The same effect in respect of the other companies that will in any way apply is now being achieved in the case of the ICI in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ICI are really only gaining a cash <Col N="117" /> flow benefit from this change in the sense that they will not be liable for £2 million worth of deposit interest retention tax. Even if they had been liable, they would have been able to set that off against tax liabilities next year in the form of tax losses that would otherwise be claimable. In practice, the main benefit to them is in terms of cash flow or of a timing nature and is necessary because of the very fine drawn way in which the rescue package for the ICI has been constructed.  Even the timing disadvantage which would have arisen if the tax had to be paid this year, even though it could be negatived in subsequent years, was something that was inconsistent with the very finely drawn package which had been put together for the ICI.  Therefore, it was considered not to be wise from the point of view of the policyholders and of the public generally, who have an interest in the maintenance of stability both in the insurance market and in the banking system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The significant thing about the provision in relation to deposit takers identified in the section, including the ICI, is that a very specific advantage is being conferred on Government gilts. Advantage is being given to the ICI, though a similar provision was not made for the PMPA.  The Minister said this <Col N="118" /> is because of the necessity to maintain confidence in the banking system.  This tax, which we oppose totally in any event, discriminates between one and the other. On what grounds can the Minister justify excluding gilts from the application of the tax?</P>
      <P>This provision imposes a discrimination in favour of Government security as against any other deposits in any other financial institution.  Representatives of the CII have expressed a view on this and my main concern, which coincides with theirs, is that it has been evident for some time that when the equity market is so weak and when the rate of investment in equities is so poor in contrast with gilts &mdash; the Minister admittedly is moving in this Bill to try to relieve the burden on dividends &mdash; what we are likely to get as a result of this exemption is that the money which should be available for investment in the private sector through the banking system is being swallowed up more and more by public funds, in this instance by Government gilts.</P>
      <P>In the course of the past two years the main reason for the unusually high interest rates here by comparison with elsewhere is that the money available to the private sector in such scarce supply has been scarce because of the interest rates.  The high interest rates in the banking sector are affecting every sector in the economy, including farmers and most people interested in investment and, instead of providing a right balance between the banks and the other institutions, what the Government are doing is further distorting the position by excluding gilts from the application of this tax. I am not arguing for the application of this tax to gilts or to anything else, but if the Government are hell bent on implementing this inequitable and unfair tax there does not seem to be any reason why the whole range of Government gilts should be made exceptions.</P>

      <P>I want to speak on deposits.  The explanatory memorandum defines &ldquo;relevant deposit&rdquo; as the deposit accounts to which retention tax applies. Certain categories of relevant deposits <Col N="119" /> should be exempt, and the only people exempt are the permanently incapacitated and those older than 65 years.  I feel strongly that the provision regarding relevant deposit should include people who would not have tax liability in the first instance.  To tax them is therefore very unfair and unjust.  Many people would not have a tax liability but now, for administrative or financial reasons, they are being taxed under the DIRT provision though they would not be liable to income tax otherwise.</P>
      <P>The Minister rightly said that anybody who says we should not have this tax should point out where the revenue would come from otherwise.  I have had a number of parliamentary questions in the past few weeks about the agricultural sector tax and I am concerned that there is a disproportionate view in favour of agricultural interests in this House and indeed in the Cabinet.  I submit that more could be done to spread the tax burden more equitably.  For instance, in the Estimate for Agriculture, we are to spend £336 million on agriculture, and that is just the Estimate.</P>

      <P>Section 27(1)(e) refers to &ldquo;a deposit denominated in a foreign currency&rdquo;.  Why does the Minister feel he has to exempt deposits nominated in foreign currencies?  Does he think it makes sense?  Will that provision stay there?  How will the Minister monitor foreign currency nominations?  I presume sterling has been regarded by Irish banks as being a foreign currency.</P>
      <P>Section 333(b) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, states that exemption shall be granted in the case of:</P>
      <P>. . .payment forming part of the income of any body of persons or trust established for charitable purposes only, or which, according to the rules or regulations established by statute...</P>
      <P>I presume the Revenue Commissioners are operating from a list that goes somewhat beyond that definition.  It is legitimate under this section of the Bill to raise the position of, say, a parish church fund, a sports club or the various other community groups that do not strictly fall under the definition of a charity as defined in the 1967 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The import of the section is to exempt from the retention tax any income that was clearly excempt under section 333 of the 1967 Income Tax Act but in doing that it quite cleverly ignored a range of other areas that are not the subject of income tax but will now be the subject of the retention tax such as parish funds, sports clubs and voluntary organisations. It would have been better to exempt in a straightforward way any club or institution already exempt from income tax. It would make sense that they should automatically be exempt from retention tax.  It is not sensible to have a long list in the original Act exempting people from income tax and then to select only a few <Col N="121" /> from that when drafting section 27 of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in the comments of Deputy O'Kennedy regarding gilts.  I appreciate he has acknowledged that the Finance Bill is trying to move away from what has been an historical discrimination against equities in the productive sector so far as tax treatment is concerned.  In that light we are both talking the same language.</P>
      <P>As far as extending the tax to gilts is concerned, a number of points should be made.  First, issues of gilts are made under terms that cannot subsequently be varied and obviously any change would apply only to new issues.  Secondly, the change the Deputy suggests would probably have an effect on the rate at which the State would have to issue gilts.  In other words, it would have to increase the rate it would pay for the money to make up for the tax liable to be collected. Essentially, one could have a circular transfer with no net financial gain at the end of the process.  To some degree, the point the Deputy has made is merely looking superficially at the matter.  However, the net effect might be rather different for the reasons I have given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the net effect that people are encouraged to invest in gilts?  Even if one were to accept the point made by the Minister, is it not the case that people are being encouraged to invest in gilts and away from the banking system which provides funds for the private sector with the consequences I mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If what the Deputy has suggested were done it might not have the effect he thinks it would have in the sense that the State would then have to increase the rate of interest it paid on gilts.  This would counteract the effect he is seeking to achieve of making gilts less attractive and the end result would be the same as at present.  I realise that one would not be in a position of leaving oneself open to the charge the Deputy is making but that would be all one would achieve <Col N="122" /> in the sense that the financial effect might be nil.  Ultimately it is the taxpayer who pays the interest rates.  The more fundamental problem is one on which Deputy O'Kennedy and I are agreed, namely, that the volume of money being borrowed by the Government is really the problem in so far as interest rates are concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not.  I do not want to repeat myself for the third time. I do not think that will be the case for the reason I have given.  Even if we did what the Deputy is urging it would probably end up in an increase in the rate of interest to be paid by exactly the same amount as the money that came in.  We would end up with the same result, except for the fact that there would be a higher nominal interest rate on gilts.  I suppose there can be different views on that matter at any given time, depending on the elasticity of demand for funds in the market on any given day.  It is not possible to generalise.  There may be times when what the Deputy is saying is true, although I do not think it would be true in the generality of cases.  It is not a question of black and white.  The problem is the volume of borrowing overall.  That is what pushes up interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell made one point and a number of observations.  The observations do not necessarily affect the section. Farmers are liable to income tax.  Farmers have a restriction of 30 per cent on capital allowances they may claim which does not apply to other taxpayers claiming capital allowances.  As a result of the farm tax, farmers essentially will be in the same position as other commercial operators who are paying rates in the sense that they will now be paying the equivalent of rates.  It is the case that substantial interest charges are offset by many farmers against their tax liability. It seemed a wise thing to borrow in the seventies in order to reduce their tax liability but most of them now realise it was a very foolish thing to do for that <Col N="123" /> reason.  Many of them are now paying much more in interest than they would ever have paid in tax.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan raised an interesting question about the definition of relevant deposit in relation to foreign currencies. For an Irish company to hold foreign currency in the bank they need the approval of the Central Bank.  The funds would be of two kinds &mdash; funds held for trading purposes in respect of a company's foreign trade and funds held by foreign companies established in Ireland, which funds could be moved out at any time.  It would be wrong to penalise the former because in a sense it is an accident that the money is here rather than overseas.  The provision of exempting funds ensures that the money stays here.  If we did not exempt it the money could be moved out at any time.  It is not a marvellous opportunity for finding a new way round a tax by putting money into foreign curency.  It just cannot be done.  The people who can do it belong to a very limited category and have a good reason for doing so.</P>
    <P>The definition of charity being used is the one which is well established in the tax code.  There were others who could claim that their objectives or activities were benevolent in intent.  That list would be virtually limitless and obviously we have to draw a line somewhere.  We draw it at those who are charities in the strictest sense within the existing interpretation. However, it is possible for people who feel they can come within the definition of a charity and make a claim to the Revenue Commissioners for their designation as a charity.  The Revenue Commissioners will be quite happy to facilitate anybody who wishes to make such a claim and any cases made will be examined carefully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that, due to the procedure so far today, we are as yet only on the first of 37 sections which we had hoped to cover.  The Minister may say that this is a consequence of the agreement I gave.  If he suggests that we have time to get to the other sections in <Col N="124" /> the whole Bill, that is patently not the case.</P>
      <P>I should like to address myself to the principles proposed under this section and following sections and to indicate the reason we are opposing this section.  It gives effect to a tax which in principle is both unfair and inappropriate at this stage.  It is unfair because it applies income tax at the rate of 35 per cent to relevant deposits, irrespective of whether the deposit holder is liable to income tax. That is the first time this principle has been incorporated into any financial legislation.  We must not overlook the fact that this is income tax at the standard rate of 35 per cent being imposed on all deposits in institutions other than the ones the Minister has now chosen to exclude, Government gilts being among those.  It is entirely inequitable.  Many people are not earning sufficient interest from their deposits, which constitutes their sole income in some cases.  Many of them are now to be subject for the first time to income tax at 35 per cent.  It does not matter whether they are widows, young people or old people or whether they are in very needy circumstances, as many of them are.  Under the appropriately named DIRT tax the Minister is taking tax from people who are not and never would be liable for income tax. That is totally unacceptable.  I hope every Member would agree that those who are not liable for tax should not now be subject to it.  We have tabled amendments to these sections to ensure that such people would be exempt from the provisions of this section.  By exemption I mean that they would not be required to present to the Revenue Commissioners documentation to establish that they have not been earning income sufficient to bring them within the income tax net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said more than once that this provision is necessary because difficult measures like this new tax must be contemplated to achieve the overriding priority of reduced income tax.  In effect the Minister is proposing to subject people to income tax at 35 per cent who have not an income which makes them <Col N="125" /> liable to income tax in order to reduce the tax level on those who are liable to income tax.  That is a most unfair statement from any Minister.  He proposes to impose income tax on those who are not liable so that he can reduce the burden on those who are.  I would be the last person to argue that the burden of income tax is not outrageously high and has not grown hugely under this Government to the extent that it is well over twice what it was when they came into office.  I am not arguing that the burden of income tax is not too high.  I am arguing that it is a nonsense to include those who are exempt from income tax in the income tax net as the only way to reduce the burden on those who are already in that category.  The Minister has made the specious claim that this is the only way to reduce the burden on those who are liable.</P>
    <P>During his Second Stage speech the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Wherever the line is drawn, however, there is the risk of genuine cases being on the wrong side of it.</P>
    <P>Obviously, he is leaving a lot of genuine cases on the wrong side of that line.  He gives his reason as follows:</P>
    <P>Refunds for all non-liable persons cannot be considered, however, because this would be far too costly. Have we ever heard anywhere from any Minister for Finance such an outrageous statement that people who are not liable to tax have to be subjected to tax because the cost of not subjecting them would be far too high?  If this Minister and the Deputies supporting him and this Government can actually support the two principles that tax is to be imposed on those not liable because to do otherwise would be too costly and, secondly, that tax is to be imposed on those not liable to lift the burden on those who are liable, let them come into the House and let the Minister state that this is his position. The Minister stated that here twice. That is what we are being asked to accept.  The Labour Deputies are <Col N="126" /> always absent when we touch on these delicate issues, but I am sure that when we put our amendment they will come in when the bell rings and vote against it.  But, if they happen to be listening in their rooms, I want them to know that they are voting to impose income tax at 35 per cent on people that the Minister admits are not liable and could not be liable to income tax.</P>
    <P>In an afterthought the Minister has provided for exemption for old people, people aged 65, 75, 80, 85.  But he is obliging them actually to fill up forms to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners disclosing every detail of their circumstances.  These people are old, feeble and, in many cases, unable to write even their names.  What kind of society have we got when we are going to force those people, who are apprehensive about filling up applications for grants, never mind the Revenue Commissioners, to apply at the end of the year for a refund of what should not have been deducted at the beginning of the year?  The concession being granted by the Minister, if it could be called a concession, is that they can apply for a reduction, but only to the extent that their income does not bring them within the tax net.  That is ignoring the reality of our people and particularly our old people.  If the Minister is saying that he needs this money from our old people to maintain this State, then that is a sorry admission on his part.  Has the Minister any idea of how much he would have to forego if he were to exempt old people from the requirements of this nonsensical outrageous tax?  The Minister will find that many of them will have to be helped to fill up the forms to claim back from the Revenue Commissioners what belongs to them in the first instance. That is outrageous.</P>
    <P>The next group concerned is young people.  Who is to say that those young people who have money on deposit in the banks or whose parents have money for them have an income that makes them liable to income tax?  Is it not the case that in most families prudent parents put money on deposit for their children to encourage them to save and to give the <Col N="127" /> children, when they come of age, a start so that when they need money for their education, for their first bicycle, for their first car or for their first home they can go to the bank manager with a proven track record having had money on deposit for a certain number of years? That is the main reason people put money on deposit for children.  But, no matter what age they are, 13, 14, 15, they are suddenly being raised to the status of fully-grown mature citizens.  This Minister is going to impose a tax on children although under every other aspect of the law children are meant to be and are in a special position and must not be discriminated against.  This proposal is discriminating against them so that the Minister can get some extra money.  He says that to do otherwise would be too costly.  Does the Minister know how much it would cost if he exempted children and old people?  If he does not know that then he should not say it is too costly to exempt them.  That is totally and utterly reprehensible.  This tax is, for that reason, appropriately called the DIRT tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that charities are exempt.  I am relatively familiar with the definition of legal charities and trusts established for the purpose of legal charities.  We are different from other countries.  Where Britain has a register of charities, we do not.  The decisions here are taken on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, albeit guided by principles.  They must be wholly and exclusively for one of the following reasons: for the advancement of religion, for the promotion of education or for the relief of poverty.  If they happen to be engaged in other activities as well, they are not exempt.  This is where the parish funds, funds for buildings and for various other activities such as recreational functions and so on, come into it.  They, by definition, are not charities within the strict legal requirement.  It may be that a benign interpretation by the Revenue Commissioners or some inspector in the office will help them; but they are not legal charities.  It is wrong that so many organisations should be subject to this <Col N="128" /> tax.  Let me give an example of one such organisation, the Lions Clubs.  Most of the work they do would be charitable in the legal sense of the word, the relief of poverty.  But a lot of the work they do goes to funding everything from children's outings, outings for old people and providing medical facilities in hospitals, and these are not designated as charitable. Because some of the work they do &mdash; excellent, worthwhile community work &mdash; is not strictly charitable work, by virtue of doing that worthwhile community work they are included in this awful DIRT tax.  If they did not do all of those other things, providing facilities, taking children on outings, providing necessary medical equipment in hospitals and so on, they would be all right.  If they just collected money to give to the poor, they would be all right.  But, because they do more, they are not.  That is outrageous and all of this is the consequence of what is outrageous, inequitable legislation. Edmund Burke said on one occasion that any fool can dream up new taxes, but even Edmund Burke would not have thought that such fools could be found in 1986, who are not just foolish but absolutely inequitable in their attitude to the poor and the needy.</P>
    <P>Let us turn to the others who are going to be included.  We are totally opposed to this and have amendments down later. I refer to all the voluntary organisations, among them one that has been referred to already, the Gaelic Athletic Association. I want to read onto the record a telegram I got from that association:</P>
    <P>Munster Council of GAA shocked at proposal to impose DIRT on GAA. Implementation would have gravest consequences on promotion and development at club, county, provincial and national levels.  Strongly demands exemption as amateur voluntary body servicing youth and promoting the national games.  Such recognition given in legislation since foundation of State.</P>
    <P>To that we in Fianna Fáil say hear, hear. We support the principles incorporated in that telegram because that organisation and every other sporting organisation &mdash;<Col N="129" /> the Rugby Football Union, the Football Association of Ireland, the Irish Amateur Athletic Union, the boxing groups and so on &mdash; are promoting sport and other healthy activities for our young people. Yesterday the Minister made great play of introducing a new amendment to enable people to invest in Cospóir, the promotion of sport and the healthy activities associated with sporting organisations. What is he doing today?  He is levying a 35 per cent income tax on the interest income of every sporting organisation, among them those which made a major contribution to the well-being of this nation.</P>
    <P>In a measc sin tá an Cumann Lúthchleas Gael mar dar ndóigh tá a fhios ag gach éinne go bhfuil obair an-tábhachtach á dhéanamh acu i ngach baile, gach sráidbhaile agus gach contae sa tír.  Tá a fhios ag gach éinne go bhfuil obair fhónta á dhéanamh ag Cumann Lúthchleas Gael le tamaillín anois agus tá súil agam go mbeidh leis na blianta.</P>
    <P>Long after this Government and this Minister, who will not be seen as a committed supporter of that or any other sporting organisation, have gone from the scene, this DIRT tax will be biting into the funds of organisations which have done magnificant work for this country.  Why?  Because the Minister says to exclude them would be too costly. There will be no exemption for the marvellous work these organisations have done, because he is saving the country money.  But it will cost the country a lot more if we force these voluntary and community organisations into a decline. At a period when so many things are going into a decline one of the things which must reassure us is the healthy state of our games and, I say it deliberately, our national games.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil insist that Deputies on all sides should come in here and say they are in favour of taxing the poor who are not otherwise liable to pay income tax.  They should say they are in favour of making the old who cannot see or write fill out forms when they are not liable to pay tax, they are in favour of taxing every <Col N="130" /> voluntary organisation although in their constituency they go to meetings and say they are willing to help them in any way they can.  Let Deputies be clear what they are about to do.  Let them do what I am demanding on behalf of my party; let them vote to exempt these groups, citizens young and old, from this tax.  I do not know how many people would be liable for tax, but there would be a considerable number; and it is outrageous for a Minister to impose tax on individuals and organisations who hitherto were not liable to tax.</P>
    <P>We are totally opposed to this awful nonsense, this DIRT tax.  We intend to oppose it in this section and on any other occasion.  If the Minister would indicate that he is prepared to accept our amendment to section 35, we will give this part of the Bill immediate passage without further opposition, but if he is not prepared to accept the principles incorporated in that amendment, then he can face the fact that he will have to rally the forces of his own party and of the Labour Party, those who care for the poor, to impose income tax on all, irrespective of income or voluntary community contribution.</P>

      <P>On 20 February£8.7 million was outstanding from farmers in <Col N="131" /> health contributions.  It is true that farmers have not paid rates in the recent past, unlike other businessmen, and that they get favourable treatment by way of stock relief.  While I do not mind small farmers in certain circumstances being treated favourably, I do mind large farmers being treated favourably at the expense of the rest of the community, including the taxpayers.  They make a contribution to the general Exchequer and carry the can for enormous outpourings of revenue.  I am thinking particularly of large sums provided for agriculture.  Farmers are not paying even 10 per cent of that amount.  There are a number of reasons why this legislation is trying to raise funds in the inequitable way Deputy O'Kennedy referred to, and I acknowledge that it is inequitable to ask sombody to pay tax for which they would not be liable if their income had come from another source.  The first reason is that in order to release that income we have to cut Government expenditure, including the interest on the enormous borrowings which were made by people like Deputy O'Kennedy when they were in office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This tax is being imposed because there are sections of the community who are not paying their fair share and at the same time the Government have very high expenditure, including the repayment of borrowings and interest on those borrowings which were made recklessly.  Attempts have been made to bring some sort of equity.  Equity has been the main point which Deputy O'Kennedy alleged he was referring to, but any attempt to bring any sort of equity into this country has resulted in the character of the people who tried it being destroyed.  One thinks of the former Minister for Finance, Richie Ryan.</P>
      <P>It has resulted in promises being made that it is not necessary to have equity because taxes such as wealth tax can be abolished and resource tax can be refunded.  That happened when Deputy O'Kennedy was in Government.  He has some neck to come in here and talk about equity.  We would not have to impose the tax that Deputy O'Kennedy refers to on those people who are not liable if we were prepared to go along with a more equitable tax system in the areas I have mentioned.  There is no point in coming in here and pretending to whinge and cry about inequitable tax systems when we know the reasons for them.  There is no magic formula.  We know the formula. Either we cut spending or we share out taxation more equitably, and we are not doing that.  Unless we are prepared to do that and to include large farmers we will make no headway with equity in taxation.</P>
      <P>I gave figures when I stood up to speak and I will not repeat them, but this side of the House will not get away with bringing in the sort of equity the Deputy referred to because the House is too much dominated by argicultural members.</P>

      <P>Regarding the 35 per cent tax I would like to ask the Minister one question.  Let me give an example.  Two people have been in business all their lives owning, say a public house or a grocery shop, and they sell for health reasons.  They reinvest the money they get and go out of business and live on the income they get from that investment. They cannot qualify for a tax free allowance in any shape or form or for the noncontributory pension because the income on the investment disqualifies them. Every penny of that income is taxed at 35 per cent, according to this Bill.  I assume that those two people are entitled to £2,000 each tax free at least which is the normal tax free allowance.  Am I to assume that for such a couple in their old age the first £4,000 of the interest from the investment is not taxable at 35 per cent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I make no apology for giving Deputy Hilliard preferential treatment. I would like to reassure him on the points he raised.  As a result of the change in the proposal contained in the Finance Bill now &mdash; I take it that the Deputy is referring to a couple, one of whom is over 65 years of age &mdash; they will be able to make a claim for a refund of the DIRT that will be deducted at source on the money in the bank to the extent that their personal allowances, which are larger than those mentioned by the Deputy, reduce the liability and they will get the money back.  Arrangements will be made to deal with such cases of claims for refund as quickly as possible and thought will be given to providing information as to how older people &mdash; those over the age of 65 &mdash; can make the necessary claims and to ensuring that the forms concerned are as simple to fill in as possible.</P>
      <P>It is not all that unusual.  Deputy Hilliard will be aware that many PAYE taxpayers at the end of the year have to submit a claim for a tax refund because either they may not have been working for part of the year or for some other reason the amount deducted would be greater than the amount due to be collected from them.  They submit a claim later in the year giving certain information that enables a refund to be made. This is a fairly normal process.  In this case it will simply be a refund which will have to be accompanied by a certificate from the bank of the amount of interest paid and the amount of DIRT deducted. Once they are aged over 65 they will be able to get the money back.  We selected people over 65 because these people are not in a position to earn money other than their means of income because of age.  We have extended a similar concession for refund to those who are permanently incapacitated because they cannot go out to earn a living.  Therefore, those two categories will be entitled to the refund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy went further than <Col N="135" /> my colleague in suggesting that people over 65 should be exempt from tax.  To have them totally exempt would cause many problems.  People under 65 who have substantial holdings of money which they will not be required to disclose now to the Revenue Commissioners and on which they might if they disclosed them have to pay 58 per cent tax because their holding might be on top of a reasonable income, would start to put their money in the name of their aged parents into the bank where not only would the amount not have to be disclosed but no DIRT would be deducted from it.  Therefore, Deputy O'Kennedy's proposal for total exemption could be used for large scale evasion not just of DIRT but of normal income tax.  By shifting the money into that form, where it is not necessary as a result of these changes to be disclosed anyway now that non-disclosure has been introduced, people would be able to avoid normal interest on income tax quite apart from and above being at, say, 58 per cent rather than 35 per cent, the amount that would fall during the normal course.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy made a case about the GAA and other organisations and inferred that this was a new and difficult problem for these organisations.  I do not deny that the tax causes problems, but this is not entirely a new proposal.  After all, GAA clubs or any individual who had money deposited with a building society have had DIRT levelled on them for years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; which was not the subject of any scheme of refunds for those over 65 or of any exemption in the case of charities.  Now admittedly this tax is at 35 per cent and applies to a wider range of institutions, but to infer that it is totally different would not be correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy made another interesting point about parish funds which he pointed out may be used partly for promotion of religion, education and <Col N="136" /> relief of poverty but some of the other activities undertaken with parish funds, while worthy and benevolent activities, would not come within the definition of charities in the normal course of events. It is possible for organisations like that to open a separate account to deal specifically with purposes which come under the definition of charity.  Therefore, they would not be paying any tax on the money whose interest is used for charitable purposes. I strongly advise any parish fund manager who is worried about the matter to look at this possibility and I shall naturally be happy to help them in an advisory capacity to achieve that result.</P>
    <P>Sporting organisations, especially those with substantial sums of money, should look at the other saving instruments available such as savings certificates and the possibility of investing in Government gilts.  Where there is a substantial sum of money which has been accumulated gradually and is not being called upon on a weekly basis for withdrawals, the longer term financial instruments to which I referred would be quite suitable for at least some of the purposes. It would be wise for the organisations concerned to look into the possibilities in this regard.  I do not want to go into the whole matter.  Deputy O'Kennedy made a Second Stage speech and I do not wish to repeat my Second Stage reply.</P>

      <P>I support the points made by Deputy O'Kennedy which centred around four principal issues.  He mentioned the proposed tax on children's savings.  Parents and teachers always encourage children to save, and having succeeded in getting children to do so, this proposal means that children will now be taxed.  It is no wonder that many <Col N="137" /> people have no confidence in public representatives when the Government introduce this form of taxation.  It adds insult to injury when one considers that over the past two years we encouraged people who kept their money in biscuit boxes or under the mattress to put it in financial institutions to avoid the risk of attacks. Is it any wonder that there is a lack of respect for public representatives by these people having been encouraged by us to lodge their money?  The Minister said that even those who are not liable for tax will be taxed and they will have to go through the whole process of applying for a refund.  This bankrupt Government will have the benefit of money which does not belong to them.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Kennedy, has outlined eloquently and adequately the elements of the section and there is no need for me to be repetitive.  Deputy Hilliard mentioned those over 60 years of age who are liable for tax and even where one spouse is over 60 years of age, the tax will still be taken from them and they will have to apply to get it back. What about those under 60 years of age? I quoted a case on Second Stage and I will repeat it now.  The only source of income of the family to whom I referred comes from interest on a sum lodged in the bank from the sale of a business because the husband is suffering from a heart ailment.  It is amazing that he recovered from the shock of learning that 35 per cent will be deducted in tax from this income.  They do not seem to be entitled to anything although they have three children attending school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to put further emphasis on sporting organisations, in particular Cumann Lúthchleas Gael, who served this country well in their 101 years, not just in the sporting arena but in their development of a spirit of nationalism, Irishness and of people doing something for themselves, which is the hallmark of the GAA.  It took a Coalition Government to penalise them for their century of activity for the people.  That organisation struggled for many years under oppression by another <Col N="138" /> regime outside the country but they overcame it.  It takes a native Government to punish them for their efforts.</P>
    <P>The Government even acknowledged the fact that in 1927 the work of the association was the prime factor in the GAA being exempted from taxation in the Finance Act of that year.  To his credit Earnán de Blaghd recognised that and exempted the GAA from taxation.  The Finance Act, 1932, and the Income Tax Act, 1967, acknowledged and recognised the input of the GAA and also exempted them from taxation.  The Minister said that some organisations have substantial sums of money.</P>

      <P>I should like to tell the Minister, in case he and other members of the Government do not know, what the GAA means to people, the efforts they have to make to collect money and the work they do in local areas.  The Minister must be aware that all units of CLCG, at club, county, provincial and national level put surplus finances on short-term deposit to try to earn some income to meet demands throughout the year.  Clubs acquire playing pitches, build dressing rooms and erect social centres with money obtained from various fund-raising efforts and interest earned on short-term deposits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="139" /> There should not be any need to elaborate on that point.  It is well known that money collected by GAA clubs and boards is put on short-term deposit and earns a few pounds in interest.  Every junior club in the country is aware of that.  Money earned in that way helps provide facilities for our young people. Those involved in GAA clubs leave surplus funds in banks in the hope that it will earn some interest while they continue with their fund-raising efforts to buy a pitch or erect a dressing room. Would the Minister prefer if our young people had to tog out at the ditches as players had to do for many years until the association developed?  I may be sectional in the way I am making this case but the members of other organisations can make their case.  The position of the GAA was recognised in Finance Acts introduced in 1927, 1932 and 1967.  But in 1986 this penniless, pauperised Government want to put an end to the progress of Cumann Lúthchleas Gael by taxing its short term investments in financial institutions.  The GAA provide community centres and other facilities in parishes where Government agencies have failed.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to make provision for organisations like the GAA. He should recognise the work they have done, are doing and, hopefully, will be able to continue to do.  If the Minister allows the DIRT tax to remain, it will seriously damage the efforts of sporting organisations to provide facilities for their members.  There is a lot of talk these days about the extra leisure time many people have.  Some people, the unemployed, would prefer if they did not have that leisure time.  The Minister should give serious consideration to the proposal to tax sporting organisations.  We cannot have statements of concern by the Minister responsible for sport, and others, about leisure time and how it should be used while at the same time the Government introduce legislation that will be detrimental to the efforts to provide facilities for those who have leisure time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the principle of this tax, which seems to be very dubious, and to those who will have to pay it.  The figures I propose to give are not mine or those of any economist.  They are figures given by the Minister for Finance on 4 April in a press release when he circulated the Finance Bill.  In the course of that statement he said that representations had been made to him to exempt from liability for this form of income tax people who were not liable for income tax.  The Minister said he had considered those representations but he could not accede to them because, if he did, 60 per cent of the yield of the tax would be lost.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to that remark.  That is a statement by the Minister for Finance that 60 per cent of the tax that will be collected under this and the succeeding sections will be collected from people who are not liable for income tax. Therefore, that represents a major new imposition of tax.  It is not a major imposition on people who potentially might be able to bear it but a major imposition of tax on people who through their circumstances have incomes that are so low that they are not liable for income tax at the moment.  We all know that one has to have an exceptionally low income here not to be liable for income tax.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us that the yield in a full year will be between £120 million and £130 million and 60 per cent of that, according to the Minister's statement, will be paid by people whose incomes are so low that they are not liable for income tax.  I cannot conceive of anything that is not more of a vicious imposition on the very poorest sectors in our community than that.  Socially and economically it is grossly unfair and, inevitably, must cause severe hardship and difficulty for very weak and poor people.  There are some people who are able to make their case in relation to this; but the very poor, those who will be worst hit by this, are not able to do so.  Members on all sides will have to bear that in mind.  I did not dream up the figure of 60 per cent.  The figure was given by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>For example, the GAA have been exempt from tax since the foundation of the State.  They now find themselves subject to this tax.

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>To tell a small GAA club in some remote part of the country to take out of the bank the £500 or £1,000 they had accumulated over the last few months and invest it in gilts seems to me to be really a bit of a joke or, as the Minister recommended, to put it in savings certificates.  This is short term money.  Savings certificates have a life of five, seven years, or whatever and, if one does not leave the money in for the full period, one does not get the full benefit of the interest.  Savings certificates were never intended as a vehicle for short term funds of that kind.</P>
      <P>For example, if a sporting body, a community or parochial body are collecting funds to build a pavilion, church, school or whatever, wanting to accumulate funds over a period of a year, two, or whatever, until the building can begin, certainly they will not be in a position to leave the money there for five or seven years.  To give them that sort of advice flippantly in the House, saying that we recognise this is a problem but this is the way out of it, telling some club down the country with, say, £1,000 to go off and put it in gilts, is really not very useful advice.</P>
      <P>This whole thing will have to be rethought because clearly it is inappropriate and inequitable.  Above all, it is inequitable to people on very small incomes but, in the nature of things, they are the very people who are not able to complain, who can do nothing about it. If this tax is retained it should be simply on the basis that anyone who is not liable to income tax should not be liable to this form of income tax.  It is worth drawing the attention of the House to the heading of Chapter IV &mdash; Interest Payments by Certain Deposit Takers.  It was called in the budget a tax on financial institutions. Of course, it is not at all; it is simply a tax on people with very small incomes who deposit their funds in a financial institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I am sure the Minister has been reminded before now, it is not much more than a year ago that his predecessor and various other members of this Government were advising people to put their <Col N="143" /> money in banks, telling them how safe it was, that they would not be penalised for so doing, that they were not to keep money at home, not to have cash, but to put it in the banks where it would be safe. Here we have this most iniquitous form of income tax now being imposed.  Perhaps the Minister would tell me, when replying: is there any other country in Europe that imposes income tax on people whose incomes are literally negligible, perhaps a few hundred pounds a year?  Is there any country in Europe that imposes tax in those circumstances?  I believe there is not, that it is grossly unfair and simply should not be tolerated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the principle of the deposit interest retention tax because it has been very wrong that some financial institutions have been treated differently from others, leading to a basic inequity in the financial system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to some of the points the Opposition made, while there was accuracy in what they said, certainly there is not precedent involved in this tax.  If we are talking about the taxation of people's incomes we must remember that all notional taxes do not take account of people's tax-free allowances; whether someone pays value-added tax on any product or commodity does not take into account whether or not that person has a tax-free allowance.  Equally whether people pay a farm tax bill does not take into account whether or not they have a tax-free allowance.  It is the same principle with all notional taxes.  While I am not arguing that two wrongs make a right, it is not a new departure to have a notional tax because our tax system &mdash;<Col N="144" /> ranging from customs and excise duties to all indirect spending, through valued-added tax and many other notional forms of tax &mdash; take account of tax-free allowances. That point has been lost by the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to seek clarification from the Minister on some points. I was most alarmed to note that some building societies decided, when this was announced, that they would saddle its cost on mortgage account holders.  I am glad the Minister intervened in this respect. However, I should like some clarification <i>vis-à-vis</i> some building societies because there are very few regulations preventing them doing what they like in many areas.  I should like confirmation that mortgage account holders will not be hit by the provisions of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like clarification in relation to the position of credit unions.  I notice they are not specified on page 36 of the original Bill as are the Post Office Savings Bank, the Industrial Credit Corporation, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the Trustee Savings Bank and building societies.  I am very interested in the position with regard to credit unions. I think we shall see an increase in their importance, not only in the establishment of very small businesses but also as a means of keeping people away from moneylenders.  While deposits within credit unions are exempt the deposits of <Col N="145" /> credit unions in banks must be considered. In other words, apart from the 1 per cent per month they have on outstanding loans they get from their shareholders, it is well known that friendly societies and credit unions put money into banks and invest it.  This means their whole financial structure could be upset if they were liable to this tax.  I should like clarification on their position from the Minister.</P>
    <P>Indeed I would encourage the Minister to go further, through the vehicle, not of Government gilts &mdash; which as Deputy O'Malley rightly said are remote from ordinary people and which have proved to be a very lucrative haven for substantial savings at the expense of the productive sector of our economy &mdash; but through the Post Office, through the Trustee Savings Bank.  There must be a simple way of giving an annual return, as opposed to five or six year returns.  If short term savings certificates could be introduced it would be of great benefit to many people under the existing exemption.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his last intervention that non-disclosure would be applicable to everybody.  My understanding was that that would not necessarily be the case if they were liable to tax over 35 per cent.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that point also.</P>
    <P>Also in relation to incapacitated persons, many different criteria are applied within the Department of Social Welfare. Can we take it that a doctor's letter would suffice or will a particular test be applied? Does a person have to be in a wheelchair, does one have to be permanently incapacitated, or what would be the criterion applied?  Some institutions, such as the Trustee Savings Bank, have been lobbying very strongly for the introduction of the retention tax and it will bring equity within the financial system.  Leaving aside the points on which I need clarification, however, it is hard to justify.  I have no difficulty in supporting the Government in the overall context, but feel that there is inequity for some one not liable for income tax who is not incapacitated and not over 65 years of age. <Col N="146" /> As I said on Second Stage, it is unfair and I would favour some modification in that area.  At the same time, the overall retention tax with its effect on the financial services sector is positive and must be welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the total opposition of my party and the case put forward by our spokesperson for Finance, Deputy O'Kennedy, against section 27.  It is totally discriminatory and unfair and will destroy the economic and financial base of the country.  With the introduction of the direct interest tax, a massive amount of funds has moved across the Border into Northern Ireland, or out of the country into the Isle of Man, Nova Scotia and other places.  This will have serious consequences on the economic fabric of the country.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the case.  It is unfair and inequitable on old age pensioners, on young children who have savings and on many institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand a Minister for Finance who has served in Government for a long number of years saying that people can make an application for a refund of tax.  This is a cumbersome, bureaucratic, crazy system.  What will be the administrative cost for the Exchequer?  What about the local authorities who are already under financed?  The local authority services are already crumbling and the authorities are being asked to make their contribution.  What about voluntary charitable and sporting organisations?  I concur with the outstanding case made here by Deputies on behalf of voluntary and charitable organisations and particularly on behalf of Cumann Lúthchleas Gael &mdash; the Gaelic Athletic Association.  They are in a very serious financial position.  In 1986, due to the high cost of insurance cover and the high risk involved in sport, they cannot get insurance cover from any Irish company.  They are faced with having to provide a national accident scheme which they intended to fund &mdash; and have funded in the past &mdash; from contributions and levies on the various gates taken at matches throughout the country. Above all, they wanted to create a fund <Col N="147" /> of £1 million from savings and interest accruing on deposits which they have placed in various financial institutions, particularly the banks.  Most of the GAA financing is short term investment, having funds on short term deposit.  This proposal will erode that finance and deprive the players and members of the Gaelic Athletic Association, numbering one million people, of an accident scheme to protect them.  Voluntary charitable and sporting organisations are investing and creating funds to provide facilities which the State should be providing. They are doing this in a voluntary capacity and they are now to be deprived of that opportunity.</P>
    <P>What about the job losses that will result from this tax?  Moneys accruing on deposit and interest have often cushioned and safeguarded many jobs in the voluntary and social sector.  These jobs are now at risk.  There is a danger that many charitable and voluntary organisations will have to let go some of their permanent staff.  We should be giving people leadership to create savings, to be thrifty, to save and invest in order to provide their own homes.  We will now put extra pressure on the State to provide more houses and more finance for housing. There will be terrible social consequences as a result of this tax.  The Minister has talked about invasion of old age pensioners' accounts if these people are to be exempted.  Nobody will interfere with the savings of old age pensioners, relations, or otherwise.  Nobody will put money into the accounts of such people. For a Minister for Finance to talk in those terms in modern times is absolutely ludicrous.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell talked about the contribution from farmers.  He fails to recognise that farmers today owe £1,500 million to financial institutions.  He also fails to recognise that farmers are the biggest contributors in indirect taxation of any consumer group.  That has not been recognised generally.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter and completely remove this section from the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister a simple question, and I am not embarrassing him by it because he inherited this Finance Bill, which is a Cabinet Bill.  I welcome most aspects of the Bill, but I want to highlight a very serious problem particularly in this section.  I know numerous small business people who sold businesses, in one case because his child went blind.  The sale was for £45,000.  Such a person would get £5,353 a year interest from Bank of Ireland Finance because he invested the money from the sale of the property in that institution.  He would be allowed £5,000 tax free a year, which meant that he should pay income tax on only £353, leaving him to pay £127 income tax a year.  Because of this new tax, £1,874 will be stopped from him.  That is not fair. Something will have to be done to help such people.  In my personal view, groups such as the GAA in particular and voluntary organisations who are providing a good service for young people, should be exempt.  Let us take the cities of Dublin and Cork, for example.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister reconcile two different figures, to one of which Deputy O'Malley has already referred?  The first was given on 4 April 1986, when the Minister, introducing this Bill, said that to exempt all non-liable persons would probably have reduced the yield in 1987 by £60 million.  In reply to a question from me, submitted on Wednesday, 30 April, the Minister said that with regard to exempting non-liable persons some £25 million to £40 million could be in respect of these.  Would the Minister indicate which figure is correct &mdash; the £60 million or the £25 million to £40 million indicated a few weeks later? <Col N="150" /> Clearly, the Minister has no idea what this will bring in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,245,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1986, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> The role of the Comptroller and Auditor General is one that is provided for in the Constitution.  It is one of considerable importance.  It is useful that we should have an opportunity to debate this Estimate in order to focus on the valuable work carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General in presenting reports on the correctness of expenditure.  I should like to pay tribute to the work carried out by the Committee of Public Accounts under the chairmanship of Deputy Denis Foley in examining the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General and in bringing relevant matters to the attention of the public.  The committee have been particularly active in this Dáil.  As a result of the rapid succession of elections that occurred in the early part of this decade a substantial backlog of reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General were built up which had not been processed by the Committee of Public Accounts.  I am glad to say that the present committee have worked very expeditiously in clearing this backlog and have produced a number of useful reports.</P>
    <P>This Estimate provides for the salaries and allowances payable to the staff of the Comptroller and Auditor General and amounts to £1,245,000 together with associated travel and other expenses amounting to £80,000.  There are approximately 91 people working for the Comptroller and Auditor General.  However, there is an offset of these costs in that the Comptroller receives an income in the form of fees for certain audits that he carries out.  The Comptroller's own salary is borne as a charge from the Central Fund.  It does not have to be voted on by this House.  He is not, therefore, subject to having his salary reduced or interfered with by the Government of the day by means of any changes that might be made in this House.  His salary is provided for from the Central Fund in order to emphasise his independence.</P>
    <P>Public accountability which is one of the main purposes of the activities of the Comptroller and Auditor General is an accepted concept in most nations.  Ireland is no exception.  I have said that the Comptroller's activities are provided for <Col N="154" /> in the Constitution, which states that the Comptroller and Auditor General is required &ldquo;to control on behalf of the State all disbursements and to audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas&rdquo;. The basic legislation relating to the Comptroller and Auditor General and his functions is set out in the Exchequer and Audit Department Acts of 1866 and 1921 and under the Comptroller and Auditor General Act, 1923.  It is interesting that this legislation, enacted at the very foundation of the State, was so well drafted that it has stood the test of time. It is a tribute to the Dáil which enacted it and many other pieces of legislation which have equally stood the test of time in trying circumstances and at great speed, with much less staff available to the Government of the day than at present.</P>
    <P>It is under the Exchequer and Audit Department Acts, which are still extant, that the Comptroller audits the Appropriation Accounts and reports on them to the Dáil.  His reports are considered by the Committee of Public Accounts. His functions require him to satisfy himself that moneys expended by Departments have been applied for the purposes intended by the Dáil.  On his own initiative, with the support and encouragement of successive Committees of Public Accounts and the Department of Finance, the Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn up his reports to embrace matters involving loss, waste, etc. and to that extent he has gone beyond the parameters of his strict narrowly defined legal role.</P>
    <P>The House will probably recall that the Committee of Public Accounts last year made a special report to the Dáil in relation to the Comptroller and Auditor General and his functions and the resources which, in the opinion of the committee, should be allocated to him.  Modern thinking on public sector auditing is that there should be management and performance audits focusing on the effectiveness of public expenditure programmes and the economy and efficiency of the <Col N="155" /> procurement and utilisation of resources&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He was most erudite during that year.  I will not say how much of my education I owe to him.  It is a good thing that the Opposition have sought discussion on the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is obviously useful to consider whether his functions might legally be extended to include a wider area of activity than at present being covered.  The Department of Finance pay very close attention to the matters raised in reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General and of the committee. A special statement is presented <Col N="156" /> to the Committee of Public Accounts setting out the action being taken by the Government and the Departments in regard to the matters raised.  The committee play an extremely useful role in the elimination of waste and in ensuring that money is being spent properly.  I am sure it is the hope of all Members of the House that this role can be enhanced in the years ahead.  The staff of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office do great work and I am glad to have this opportunity to pay a tribute to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should bear in mind that not only has Deputy G. Mitchell offered but there are at least three Members on this side who wish to contribute.  I suggest that if I take five minutes everybody else should take five minutes.  First of all I associate myself with the Minister's remarks when he said that the work on the auditing of the accounts done under an Article of the Constitution has been extremely important and beneficial in regard to the accountability of the State.  Article 33 of the 1937 Constitution followed legislation that had been there for several years, and I agree with the Minister that like much of the legislation enacted at that time it has stood up remarkably well.  However, it could be argued that the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General should be extended.  In the recent past it would have been desirable that the Comptroller and Auditor General could have gone more deeply into certain matters of expenditure and that he could have put forward reports on matters from which he is precluded at the moment, particularly when we are using computerised <Col N="157" /> accounts systems in a number of Departments and are moving more and more in that direction.  I think the accounts system of the State will take a major shake up in the next five years because of the welcome use of modern technology.</P>
      <P>During the year there was some debate on the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There was a suggestion that he should report to the Oireachtas from time to time.  The Leader of Fianna Fáil and other Members asked about expenditure by Departments and they wanted a definition of expenditure for departmental use and expenditure for party political purposes.  We were anxious to have a debate so that the Comptroller and Auditor General could examine and report back to the House on the whole question of accountability for money spent by Governments with a distinction between departmental expenditure and expenditure for party political purposes.  It has been highlighted by Members of this House.  It came to our notice a number of times during the year that committees composed of members of the Government, of people who had nothing to do with the Government and, of civil servants, spent vast sums of money on advertising propaganda campaigns. In one sense it could be argued the advertisements were giving information to the public.  That would be acceptable if what was involved was just a list setting out the increases in the budget, but when it transpired that this was not always the case we considered what was done was not reasonable.  For example, one advertisement stated that the children's allowance book was worth more than it said, that it was worth an extra £3.  The item was presented as an advertisement for party political purposes.  The Communications Strategy Committee set up by the Government have a vast expenditure under their control.  Does it mean that all Governments in the future can adopt the course taken in this instance? The Comptroller and Auditor General should clarify the matter in his annual report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff well.  They do an <Col N="158" /> excellent job.  I should like to see an updating of legislation to deal with ever-increasing expenditure and perhaps this is something that might be considered by the various committees dealing with legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with Deputy Ahern in expressing appreciation of the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff.  I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and I know at first hand the work they do.  If the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is to have any meaning it should be a strong committee.  However, it is very difficult to have a strong committee when it has only the part time services of one clerk compared with the facilities made available to the Committee on Public Expenditure and other committees. The Committee of Public Accounts is the senior committee.  Every Parliament of this kind has such a committee, but in our case it has not been able to issue its report for a considerable time because of the lack of staff.  That situation cannot be allowed to continue if we are to achieve anything with regard to accountability.  There is an enormous backlog of material on tape that has not even been typed, let alone reported on.</P>
      <P>The powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General should be extended. About three years ago in Britain they had a National Audit Office Act which gave greater powers to their Comptroller and Auditor General and streamlined his work and that of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I said in this House about 18 months ago that we should look at the situation in Britain with a view to updating our legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General is an officer of the Constitution or of Parliament.  He is not employed by the Government.  If he works for anybody he works for this House.  It is frustrating his work and his constitutional responsibilities if we do not allow for the work he carries out to be properly reported.  He should be allowed to develop into the area of efficiency accounting and reporting. The leaders in this field, the <Col N="159" /> Canadian Auditor General and the Canadian Committee of Public Accounts have research facilities and they make regular management reports to the committee who transmit them to their Parliament. If we are to develop along the lines the Minister for Finance has been advocating for a long time, the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the committee should be extended in line with the Canadian model.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General is slightly out-of-date.  He should bring forward the report for 1985.  The latest report available in the Library deals with 1984.</P>
      <P>I wish publicly to bring to the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General something mentioned also by Deputy Ahern which I regard as an abuse of public funds by a group whom I cannot find under any heading in his report, namely, the Communications Strategy Committee.  I have in my possession a copy of minutes of a meeting on 20 March 1986 where the following persons attended: The Ministers for Labour, Social Welfare and Education; Frank Flannery who was known as one of the national handlers and a Government appointed member of the RTE Authority; Mr. Pat Heneghan, also a national handler and owner of Public Relations of Ireland, Limited, whose firm also works for the Department of Communications and who received fees of £17,712 in 1984 and £19,181 from the Department of the Public Service in 1984.  Incidentally, he is also public relations officer for British Airways.  They would have some involvement with the Department of Communications with regard to air routes and there may be a conflict of interest there; M. D'Arcy, S. Treacy, P. White, the Fine Gael Press Officer and Mr. F. Finlay, the representative of the Tánaiste in the Government Information Service.  I will quote from the minutes of the meeting. Under the heading &ldquo;Discussed&rdquo; was the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of upcoming events. <Col N="160" /> Noted that some had &ldquo;good news&rdquo; potential, others &ldquo;bad news&rdquo;.  Good news items; child benefit scheme, effect of budget on personal taxation, family income supplement.  Bad news item: Food subsidies (timing &mdash; Bank holiday, Taoiseach away); higher paid people going back on PRSI; teachers' conferences.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Agreed to recommend&rdquo; was the following:</P>
    <P>(1)  That the Taoiseach deal with food subsidies in a speech before he goes away (A separate note has been sent to the Taoiseach in this regard);</P>
    <P>(2)  Ensure that the Government decision on trade with South Africa gets maximum positive coverage on Tuesday next;</P>
    <P>(3)  Investigate possibility of price reductions in other areas (EC butter, petrol);</P>
    <P>(4)  Advertise forthcoming child benefit scheme and tax reductions &mdash; radio, TV and papers over Easter weekend;</P>
    <P>(5)  More publicity re home improvement scheme;</P>
    <P>(6)  Speeches emphasising brighter economic future.</P>
    <P>Above note to be circulated to each member of the Government requesting co-operation where appropriate with advertising proposal.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Comptroller and Auditor General, who is here this evening, if there is a heading in the Appropriation Accounts dealing with the Communications Strategy Committee?  If not, will he ensure that the people responsible, namely Fine Gael and some members of the Labour Party, are surcharged? There is a certain amount of trickery in relation to expenditure matters and this trickery is taking place on the part of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  They have misappropriated money and they are covering up expenditure.  The Comptroller and Auditor General should carry <Col N="161" /> out an immediate investigation of the trickery going on in Government agencies. The Minister for Finance cannot stand over the abuses taking place.  Palms are being greased and it is the responsibility of the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out a full investigation of the allegations that Deputy Ahern and I have made.  We want a reply to them in this House as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down a question that was answered by the Minister for Finance about four weeks ago relating to the annual reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In relation to the frequent points in his report where he indicates he is making further inquiries and where he is not satisfied with the explanation given for expenditure, I asked if the Minister might arrange for him to issue interim accounts setting out how he has got on with his further inquiries and what answer he had received.  The Minister replied quite rightly &mdash; and I must admit that my question was unhappily phrased to this extent &mdash; that it was not for him to arrange anything for the Comptroller and Auditor General to do, that he is an independent constitutional officer and that as Minister he has not control over him and could not in any way instruct him.  Of course I accept that.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless I feel that if the Minister or anybody else in a responsible or reasonable context suggests something, the Comptroller and Auditor General, a more than usually responsible official, constitutionally secure as he is, will take it to heart.  With every respect to him and his office, I would suggets that he might arrange within the ambit of his office a somewhat more adventurous system of reporting to the Dáil than the annual report.  Quite apart from being delayed in the way which has been mentioned, which I understand is due to a staff shortage in his office, the Comptroller and Auditor General might see his way to publishing more frequent reports indicating the effect or product of this correspondence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will quickly give the House a concrete example of what I mean.  In the 1983 <Col N="162" /> report under the Office of Public Works subhead F.1, page XXVII of that report, he asked to be told why it was the OPW appeared to have ordered materials for maintenance and supply totalling £675,000, surplus to requirements.  He asked to be told whether the Accounting Officer regarded it as acceptable that purchases should be kept so far above the level of current needs.  As an ordinary member of the public I should like to have easy access to the reply he received to that question.  I do not want to have to find out through the Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am not a member.  I turned to his report for 1984 and found no reference to the subhead F.1 with which he had expressed dissatisfaction the previous year.  It may be that he has since received satisfaction but it ought to be on some record, if not in an annual report, then in a quarterly report.</P>
    <P>There is a new matter mentioned in the 1984 report, namely, the amazing overrun incurred by the Department of Tourism and Transport in regard to developments at Valentia which were originally estimated and sanctioned at £80,000 but ended up costing nearly £500,000.  The Comptroller and Auditor General asked why tenders had not been invited for the additional works and he sought information regarding the nature of the improvement works and the original estimated cost.</P>

      <P>With all respect &mdash; and the Comptroller knows that is not in any sense a feigned expression of politeness &mdash; I would like to see the answer to the question he asked expressed in black and white, not just in his annual report, which is not overdue although we are already well into 1986, but quickly.  The public are entitled to it.  With the greatest respect to him, his office and the Minister who shows such diffidence and fastidiousness towards him, it is time we had a different format of report from the Comptroller and Auditor General and a different format for presenting the fruits of the <Col N="163" /> operation of his office to the public and Members of this House.</P>

      <P>As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I have a special interest in this debate.  Some time ago my committee took the unusual step of tabling a special report on the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. The report was never debated in this House.  I hope the Minister will use his good offices to improve the staffing position which was highlighted in the report. The matter has already been mentioned by another Deputy and I look forward to a response from the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General has recently been concerned that he might not be able to carry out his duties in an efficient manner.  From the evidence given before my committee we are satisfied that his concern in this matter is genuine and deeply felt and the committee formally endorse his sentiments. In any event, he is obliged under legislation governing the operation of his office to bring to notice any change in the nature and character of the examination carried out by him.  He went on to refer to various issues in his report but he was mainly concerned with the staffing situation.  I hope there will be a response to his request.  I congratulate the Comptroller and Auditor General personally because he is doing tremendous work with a very limited staff.  The staff must be included because, like him, they are dedicated officials.</P>
      <P>The Comptroller has been highlighting points in the Appropriation Accounts going back to 1979.  There is no doubt that his staff should be increased substantially. He has many options open to him.  He could simply do the work formally but in fact he peruses every issue and reports on that basis.  I am disappointed that reports have not been brought up to date due to laxity in the public accounts section where there are no full time officials, in contrast with the public expenditure committee who have full time officials.  It is a very serious situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While in the short term the question of <Col N="164" /> resources made available to the Comptroller and Auditor General has to be dealt with, there are other issues to be considered.  The function of the office itself must be highlighted.  It is covered by legislation.  I understand the Minister for the Public Service visited a number of countries during the past few years to look at certain aspects of the operation of their public services.  I am not sure what aspects he has been looking at, but I ask whether he has looked at the way their systems of public accountability operate, how their national audit offices are constituted and provided with resources and how their parliamentary committees contribute to the creation of an effective framework of public accountability. These issues must be brought out. If the Minister gained any information on these matters I hope he will report back. It is time to update the legislation dealing with the Comptroller's office and position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be associated with the complimentary remarks in regard to the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff.  I appreciate and understand the many difficulties with which they are confronted.  He is not afraid to highlight irregularities within various Departments.  The problem is that there is little or no follow-up to this information.  The information is stale by the time it arrives at the Committee of Public Accounts or the Committee on Public Expenditure and this is a major problem.  It is difficult to get committee members interested in irregularities which occurred two or three years previously and to get satisfactory solutions to them.  Some form of special committee should be set up by the Government to follow up immediately these irregularities which the Comptroller and Auditor General identifies so that we can get more positive results.  He is carrying out his duties well and doing a good job.  He is not at fault.  In the reports for 1983 and 1984 the Comptroller requested the Government to give him more staff and assistance.  There is nothing in the 1986 <Col N="165" /> Estimates to give him that extra provision.</P>
      <P>It is hypocritical of the Government to seek improvements in that area if they are not prepared to give the resources to the person who is capable and willing to investigate these things but has not the time to do it.</P>
      <P>Many of our public accounts are in arrears.  The accounts of health boards and local authorities and various other bodies which should not be are in arrears and the Comptroller and Auditor General has made that very clear in his last two reports.  I would like to see the Government tackling this by providing the Comptroller and Auditor General with the small amount of money that is needed to bring the accounts of the State up to date.  No businessman here could run his business on accounts which he gets six months after the close of the year. I appeal to the Minister on behalf of the Comptroller and Auditor General to give him extra staff immediately.</P>

      <P>I thank Members for their contributions. I was interested in the suggestions by two Deputies that the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General should be extended.  I have decided to review this legislation to see if proposals could be prepared to enhance the legal powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General. This will be the first major review of this legislation since 1923 when it was first initiated.  It would be a useful addition and I invite the Committee of Public Accounts to submit their proposals to me on how the legislation might be improved.  In the context of this legislation, it might also be useful to consider the relationship between the Committee on Public Expenditure and the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Committee on Public Expenditure might also like to make suggestions in this regard although, of course, the committee solely responsible for considering the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General are the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy John Kelly made a number of points about following up reports.  In the <Col N="166" /> first place these reports are followed up by the Minister responsible and by the Department of Finance.  It is also open to any Deputy who, on reading the committee report, has noted an irregularity reported thereon, to ask a Dáil Question of the Minister responsible as to what is being done on foot of this.  There is a very good mechanism there for both the Government and Dáil Members individually to ensure that a follow up occurs. Where the Comptroller and Auditor General himself would wish to bring out additional reports, an update on what has happened in regard to the matters raised in the previous report, that is a matter essentially for him, being an independent officer.  It is open to the Committee of Public Accounts to make suggestions and that is a matter I am sure they will consider.</P>
    <P>I now come to the points mentioned by Deputy Leyden and Deputy Ahern about advertising.  The giving of public information about what the Government are doing in a fashion that will arrest people's attention so that they will actually read it and make use of the information requires the employment of advertising skills.  Clearly the production of an advertisement containing public information which is interesting and which people will read is a more appropriate use of public money than preparing an advertisement that is presented in a boring way and which nobody will read. Clearly it is sensible for the Government to use whatever professional advice they can to ensure that any information they have to give, as part of their responsibility to give the public information, is given in a form that is actually read by people and absorbed by them.</P>

      <P>Any Deputy who is concerned about any expenditure of public money has the opportunity to object to it in the normal course of events, in the Estimates to date or by means of a parliamentary question.  But it is Ministers and Ministers alone, who are responsible for the expenditure of public money.  They may, as I am sure is the case with other administrations, bring in other people to advise people before they make a decision.  There is nothing unusual or wrong about that.  But I can assure the House that any advertisements that have been placed by this Government have always been placed with a view to imparting useful information to the public and, indeed, we have been extremely careful to avoid any content in the advertisements which would be considered to be party political in its nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not quite sure that at all times the previous administration was equally careful.  I can recollect a series of advertisements in regard to the administration of justice where Deputy Leyden's colleague, Deputy Seán Doherty, appeared personally in the advertisements, walking from the horizon towards the camera to express his interest that the public should support the Garda Síochána.  I am not quite sure what additional public information Deputy Doherty's personal appearance on that advertisement added to the store of public knowledge.  It would appear to me, if information was necessary on that matter, that information, could easily have been given without the Minister personally appearing.  That is <Col N="168" /> not something that has happened under the present Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>On 11 and 12 March 1986 we had an opportunity to discuss a Fianna Fáil motion in relation to the closure of Sellafield.  Tonight we are again dealing with Sellafield with reference to the disastrous situation which has arisen in the wake of the Chernobyl catastrophe.  The disaster at the Soviet nuclear power station has aroused serious concern around the world, especially in Ireland.  However, the Coalition Government do not seem to share this concern.  Once again they put down an amending motion refusing to recognise that the only safeguard this nation and our people have against a similar disaster is to demand the closure of Sellafield.</P>
      <P>This motion is not about Fianna Fáil or about politics; it is above politics.  It expresses the serious concern of the Irish people and the fears they have for their safety.  The people are demanding the closure of Sellafield.  Surely the safety and concern of our people are far more important than opposing for the sake of opposing?  That, in my opinion, is what is happening on the Government side tonight.  The nation's credibility is at stake and I appeal to the Government, in the interests of the people to support our motion and let us be united in our representations on behalf of the Irish people in the eyes of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious to everyone that the nations which have nuclear power plants cannot be trusted honestly to make <Col N="173" /> available information to other countries. When a major disaster occurs, unfortunately it seems to be surrounded in secrecy.  It took three full days before the Russians finally admitted they had a major disaster on their hands and only for the vigilance of Scandinavia, who knows if they would ever have come into the open and announced this disaster.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the major accident which took place at Sellafield on 8 October 1957 was also surrounded in the same type of secrecy.  It took 26 years for the full story to unfold.  Now, 29 years later, we still have the basic principle of secrecy as was evidenced with the Russians, despite the fact that the lives and the health of thousands of people throughout the world were at risk and in danger.</P>
    <P>This is a criminal act, yet the Irish Government refuse to take action.  The people of Ireland continue to live in the shadow of Sellafield, a shadow which is fraught with danger and the threat of the destruction of our people.  Despite continuous assurances by the British Government and their cohort experts that all is safe, the Chernobyl disaster revealed that even with the most vigilant supervision accidents can and do happen. Investigations recently carried out by independent consultants and by the <i>News of the World</i> special investigation team have shown that many nuclear power stations in Britain are suffering from serious defects and are as poorly protected as the Russian reactor which caused such devastation when it blew its top.  The <i>News of the World</i> goes on to say:</P>
    <P>...the biggest threats are posed by Calder Hall in the Sellafield complex, Chapel Cross in the Scottish Borders, Berkeley in the West Country and Bradwell in Essex.  All were built without surrounding reactor containment walls.  The missing safety factor which was evident at the Chernobyl plant brought worldwide criticism.</P>

    <P>Ireland has no vested interest in nuclear power stations but the Chernobyl disaster has brought home to us all that we must be concerned about our neighbouring country's activities in such an industry.  We must insist that a process at international level should make it obligatory on nations with nuclear power structures to notify the countries of the world <Col N="175" /> immediately an accident has occurred. Coming from County Wexford, I have an interest in the nuclear industry because during the seventies we had a great debate concerning the siting of a nuclear power station at Carnsore Point, County Wexford.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley, then a Minister, tried to bulldoze through a decision that would have sited an active time bomb on our doorstep, but the people of Wexford objected and, fortunately, won the day, although the site is still in the ownership of the ESB, a monument to what might have been. During that period we had massive rallies at Carnsore Point.  Thousands of people congregated there every year to voice their disapproval of the siting of such a project there.  However, this site is still in the ownership of the ESB and the people of Wexford are concerned that they continue to hold it.  I call on the ESB here tonight to get rid of that site, to sell it, and once and for all to kill the notion in Wexford and throughout the country that they still have in mind a proposal to site a nuclear station there, whether in the next decade or into the next century.</P>

      <P>The Chernobyl disaster has focused world attention on the danger inherent in nuclear industry.  It shows clearly the extent of the threats posed to life and to our environment.  The fact that these threats transcend national boundaries is cause for even greater worry.  Most of Europe is now put at risk by the difficulty in even identifying the probability of further accidents which apparently cannot be assessed accurately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lest there be any misapprehension regarding the scale of the threats or any suggestion of exaggeration, I would like to read a short quotation from page 20 of the <i>Financial Times</i> of 30 April 1986, a <Col N="176" /> newspaper which, I can assure the House, is not prone to exaggeration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or Fianna Fáil &mdash; and probably is influenced by the industrial and financial interests which are bound up with the nuclear industry.  I quote:</P>
      <P>The disaster at Chernobyl has broken new and fearsome ground. People have been killed.  An uncontrollable fire is raging at the power plant. Nuclear fuel has boiled into the atmosphere. Radioactivity has been wafted thousands of miles into neighbouring countries.  The dreaded melt-down of the fuel-core, which fail-safe systems are meant to make impossible, has apparently occurred.</P>
      <P>To contemplate those words strikes terror in all of us.  Chernobyl is the latest of a long list of nuclear accidents which have occurred both in Communist countries and in the West and have stemmed from both human factors and design faults.  There was a nuclear melt-down in Canada in 1952, one in the US in 1955 and the one in Windscale in 1957, which I will come back to.  There was one in the US in 1961 and again in 1966, in Britain in 1966, in France in 1966, in Switzerland in 1969, in the US in 1979 and in Chernobyl in 1986.  They were not minor accidents, they were melt-downs of the core of the reactor, which is the doomsday type of situation in any nuclear accident. That is the litany of disasters that have occurred, so let nobody come into this House and, as an expert or otherwise, pretend that this sort of thing happens only occasionally and that we should not worry about it.  It is clear from the list that I put before the House tonight that it is all too frequent and we have every cause to worry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even before the accident at Chernobyl, to be fair to this party, we had been calling for the closure of Sellafield for a long time.  The Chernobyl disaster reinforces our case and gives concrete expression to our worst fears.  That Sellafield <Col N="177" /> poses a threat no less serious than Chernobyl and more insidious to Ireland cannot be debated.  It is insidious because the effect of radiation may not become apparent for ten, 15 or even 20 years because it causes genetic effects spanning a number of generations and it is passed on in all kinds of ways, including in particular through food and food chains.  Evidence of radioactivity has been found in breast milk in England, at pretty low levels but nevertheless there.  Radioactive emissions from Sellafield are silent killers because they can strike, are striking and will strike over many generations. The Chernobyl accident shows that there are no safe havens from a nuclear accident in any country whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the country which opts for a nuclear power programme bears a heavy responsibility to the rest of the world and we are calling on that responsibility here tonight, all the more in the case of Sellafield, which is right up against our shores. A member of the European Community of nations, that very nation is openly and callously polluting our environment with its toxic waters.  The worst accident in the history of the nuclear industry occurred at Sellafield, then Windscale, in 1957 in a fire which destroyed the core of a plutonium producing reactor and sent radiation clouds into the atmosphere.  What happened then the authorities denied and, having denied it, went on to minimise totally the dreadful effects on their own citizens let alone the citizens of this or any other country.  Afterwards, when they were pushed, an official report linked the accident to dozens of cancer deaths and the increased incidence of leukaemia and genetic defects in children. That was after the harmful effects were totally denied.  Therefore, one wonders about denial in the nuclear industry. The more denials one hears in that industry the more one worries about what really is going on, because the history is one of denial.</P>
    <P>Not generally appreciated is that this accident introduced cancer producing ingredients into Ireland's environment and, in my view, still poses a health hazard.  Again in 1983 tons of radioactive <Col N="178" /> material were discharged into the Irish Sea from Sellafield by what they called an accident.  There has been progressive pollution of the Irish Sea to the extent that the House of Commons report described it as the most radioactive in the world.  The British Government announced recently that they were setting limits to the extent of the spillage of radioactive material into the Irish Sea.  There should be no spillage into the Irish Sea, not to talk about setting limits to the extent of that spillage.  That is and has been the position of this party for many years. There is no safe or acceptable level of radiation from Sellafield.  Like &ldquo;an acceptable level of violence&rdquo; it is complete nonsense to talk in those terms.  The only safe Sellafield is a closed Sellafield and that is what this party and this House should call for tonight and we have been calling for that.  The time for expressions of concern as in the Government amendment has long passed.  Every political, legal and moral resource at our disposal should be mobilised in seeking the closure of Sellafield.</P>

      <P>The time has passed for calling for investigations or for meetings of international communities.  I suggest to Deputies on every bench that it is nothing short of national sabotage if they do not call tonight for the closure of this station.  It is nothing short of letting down the Irish people, the Irish nation, if they do not join with us in this motion and call for the closure of this station.  How are we to look to the outside world if the House is divided on a fundamental issue such as this?  The Government are looking for international co-operation, but all other Governments will say that we could not get agreement in the national Parliament in regard to the closure of Sellafield and that other Governments should not be asked to do our work.  If we are to make any progress internationally, the buck stops in Dáil Éireann tonight.  I ask <Col N="179" /> the Deputies of every party to leave politics aside and to support the nation tonight so that the country will have one voice with one message: close down Sellafield because it is a menace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>On a previous occasion I fully supported the call for the closure of Sellafield as the only safe way of dealing with it.  That is still the position today and the reality of that need is heightened by the disaster at Chernobyl.  Arising from that disaster, apart from demanding that Sellafield should be closed, the Irish Government should take urgent initiatives in regard to international monitoring of all stations, not just those in Britain or Europe but also in the United States, the USSR and any other countries which have nuclear power stations.</P>
      <P>Recent events, including the Chernobyl disaster, a long list of incidents at Sellafield reprocessing plant and the unreported running aground of a US nuclear submarine in the Irish Sea in March emphasise how vulnerable we are to the potentially devastating effects of nuclear accidents.  As a result of the Chernobyl disaster it is clearer than ever that the absence of non-military installations in any country does not protect it from radiation, which recognises no national frontiers.  In the event of an accident, as we have seen in the last week, the health and safety of whole populations can be at the mercy of the direction of the wind.</P>
      <P>None of the nuclear powers has a good record in recognising the rights and interests of non-nuclear nations.  The failure of the Soviet Union to promptly release full information about the Chernobyl accident has caused unnecessary anxiety and worry to many people in countries throughout Europe, including Ireland.  If the information which they have since made available had been released to neighbouring countries in the early stages of the accident, much of the risks and distress could have been avoided as Governments would have been in a better position to advise on the precautions which needed to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" /> While the Soviet Union has correctly been criticised for its tardiness in the matter, the West have cynically tried to exploit that accident, for economic benefit in some cases.  For instance, the commodity markets in the United States literally went through the roof as a result of speculation regarding wheat, a basic food item.  That kind of speculation indicates that some people are prepared to use any accident or opportunity to make hugh profits, even at the cost of heightening the distress and fears of ordinary citizens. It is important, therefore, to balance the record and to make the point, while the Soviet Union was wrong not to announce details of the accident and have been rightly criticised, we have had first hand experience ourselves of the fraud and deceit practised by British Nuclear Fuels in their operation of the Sellafield plant.  Our Government should demand to know why we were not informed of the potentially disastrous running aground of the US nuclear submarine in the Irish Sea in March.  It is time that Ireland and other non-aligned nuclear countries asserted their rights.  We should take the initiative and convene a meeting of other interested countries, especially non-nuclear states, to actively campaign for a UNbacked treaty which would provide effective monitoring procedures for nuclear power stations all over the world.  Their aim would be to ensure that every possible safety procedure is in place and observed.  It would also provide for an effective early warning system to ensure that all states with nuclear installations are obliged to report to the United Nations without delay.</P>
    <P>While campaigning for such procedures to eliminate the possibility of accidents in nuclear power stations, we should not lose sight of the fact that the greatest threat to the future of the globe is the existence of nuclear weapons by the superpowers and the elimination of such weapons would bring about a total reassessment of nuclear power stations which are used to supply fuel and nuclear rods for nuclear weapons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the <Col N="181" /> opportunity to participate in this debate. It give me a chance to clarify a number of issues and to make it clear to the House that the Government are acting in a determined and sensible manner on the issues we are discussing.</P>
      <P>On the question of the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant, the Government have again and again stated their policies and the reasons for them.  On 12 March last this House approved a motion of confidence in the Government's policies on the issue, but it is worth while to repeat those policies and to put them in their proper context.  The Government's position is that radioactive discharges from Sellafield should be minimised and eliminated as soon as possible through the use of the best available technology. This position has been stated at every opportunity in contact with the British authorities and at all appropriate international fora.</P>
      <P>The Government recognise that the spate of incidents at Sellafield are, in themselves, of little radiological significance to Ireland.  Clearly, a balanced view of the situation must be maintained. However, the frequency of these incidents has caused the Government and the Irish people to lose confidence in the safety of the plant.  The safety record at Sellafield has been less than satisfactory and the frequency of incidents poses the possibility of the occurrence of an accident in the future which could have serious consequences for this country. The Government are not blind to this possibility and are well aware of the widespread public concern that exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in recognition of these concerns that the Government have pursued a series of actions at international level. The Taoiseach met the British Prime Minister on 19 February 1986 and urged that there be a review of safety procedures at the plant.  The further incidents at Sellafield which followed that meeting underlined the necessity, as we see it, for such a review.  But, as I said on many occasions, we are exposed to a potential hazard from an operation outside our jurisdiction.  This makes the problem an <Col N="182" /> international one.  The view of the Irish Government is that this issue must be resolved by the European Commission under the provisions of the Euratom Treaty.  The Government consider that a European inspection force is necessary to determine independently whether Sellafield can operate safely or whether operations should be suspended or cease until it is rendered safe.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy, the Minister for the Environment and I have had separate formal discussions with Commissioner Clinton-Davis about this matter. In various discussions we have had with the Commissioner it was stated that we were satisfied that the Commission has a central and vital role to play in the implementation of the Community's basic radiation safety standards under the Euratom Treaty.  The Irish Government's call for a European inspection force was stressed.  The Commissioner confirmed that the question of a Community inspection force is one which is being examined under the terms of the Euratom Treaty.  I was glad to note his comment on television on RTE news on Tuesday, 29 April, that the Chernobyl accident has strengthened our case for an independent inspection force.</P>
    <P>On 11 April 1986 our ambassador in Brussels, on behalf of the Government, formally requested the Commissioner to establish a Community Health and Safety (Nuclear Installation) Inspection Force to report to the Commission, and in turn to the member states, on existing or potential health or safety problems at individual nuclear installations in the Community.  We are awaiting a response from the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Government have been called upon from time to time to demand the closure of the Sellafield plant, but that question of closure is not as simple as it seems.  There is already a large quantity of spent fuel for reprocessing stored at Sellafield.  This would continue to require attention and management even if further reprocessing is not carried out.  The Government must be assured beyond doubt that the plant can and will be operated safely without danger to the <Col N="183" /> Irish public and in conformity with the principles laid down by the Euratom Treaty.</P>
    <P>Let me assure the House that I will continue to give this matter my fullest attention and I will decide on what further steps are appropriate in the light of the response from the European Commission.</P>
    <P>We need this assurance that the plant is being safely operated, and we consider that the basis for any such assurance must be an investigation by a European inspection force such as we are proposing.  The Irish Government are of the firm opinion that it is in the interest of all concerned to support this inspection force at European level and to support any measure that might be adjudged necessary by an inspection force to improve the safety at Sellafield, even if this transpires to mean suspension of operations or the closure of the plant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey has asked why we do not press for closure.  The answer is that we are trying to achieve the possible and not pursue in vain the impossible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows well, and I have said this before, that the UK Government are not prepared to close Sellafield.  The plant is within the jurisdiction of another sovereign state and we cannot force that state to close it down. But because of the international implications, to which I have already referred, we feel, and the Government have been so advised by the Attorney General, that the Commission under the Euratom Treaty have powers to inspect the safety of nuclear installations.  As I have said, we have formally asked the Commission to exercise those powers.  The Government are of the firm opinion that this is the correct and proper way to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But Chernobyl has taught us another valuable lesson.  There can be appalling and long term consequences from an accident at any nuclear power station.  Such accidents recognise no boundaries, as was <Col N="184" /> so dramatically demonstrated by Chernobyl. The reality we are faced with is that there are many nuclear installations at our doorstep and we would be taking a very shortsighted view by looking at Sellafield to the exclusion of other nuclear installations throughout Europe. Those installations contribute significantly to the economies of the countries where they are situated.  We must recognise that there is little likelihood of these being closed even in the present circumstances. That may not be to our liking but these are the facts of life.  The nuclear industry is there and will not go away.  For this reason we must devote our efforts to ensuring that the industry is safe beyond doubt.  The only way this can be tackled in a proper and objective way is through the establishment of an independent inspection force.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey has frequently said in the House, and elsewhere, that the Nuclear Energy Board is redundant and should be scrapped.  That is a rather peculiar statement coming from a Fianna Fáil Deputy, because it was Fianna Fáil in Government who initiated the establishment of the Nuclear Energy Board.  I suggest to the Deputy that he seriously misunderstands the crucial role the board has and the valuable service it is providing and will provide for this country.  I must refute quite emphatically any suggestion that the board no longer fulfils any useful function.  It is true to say that the board was initially set up at a time when the building of a nuclear power station in this country was under consideration, and under consideration by a Fianna Fáil administration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  To ensure that safety codes and regulations on the use, etc., of radioactive material and equipment are <Col N="186" /> complied with in industry, medicine and research.  The board operates a licensing system for this purpose under the Nuclear Energy Order, 1977 and</P>
    <P>(c)  To provide a radiation measurements service, including a programme of environmental monitoring of radioactivity with reference in particular to the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>There is no nuclear power station in this country, thank God, but the board's functions are sufficiently wide to enable it to act as a radiological protection board. Because of the shift in circumstances this, in fact, is what it has been doing from its inception and will continue to do under the Government.</P>
    <P>This House is, of course, fully aware of the monitoring programme being carried out by the Nuclear Energy Board and by the universities.  The ongoing programme includes monitoring of radioactivity levels in fish, seawater, seaweed and sediment taken from the Irish Sea.  Independent research programmes are also undertaken by the environmental radioactivity laboratories of University College, Dublin, and Trinity College, Dublin.  The results of these monitoring programmes have clearly shown that contamination has occurred in the Irish Sea as a result of the discharges from Sellafield.</P>
    <P>A report published recently by the Nuclear Energy Board on their monitoring of radioactivity levels in the Irish Sea between 1982 and 1984 confirms that the radioactive contamination of the Irish Sea decreases rapidly with increasing distance from Sellafield.  It also shows that the fish is safe to eat.  Fianna Fáil did a lot of damage to the fishing industry on the east coast by their irresponsible comments on this matter.  In particular, Deputy Burke has been most unhelpful in this regard.</P>

      <P>In the course of an Adjournment debate on 1 May 1986 the Minister for Energy outlined the arrangements which would come into play to identify if we were affected by fall-out from any nuclear incident.  Contamination would be detected in the first instance by the continous monitoring of the atmosphere which is routinely carried out by the Nuclear Energy Board.  If significant levels of contamination were detected in the air from fall-out, the foods which are most at risk would be monitored to determine levels of contamination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Chernobyl disaster, I must say that the Russian Government were quite irresponsible in not informing their neighbours of the disaster.  We took action as soon as we heard of it and foresaw the possibility of radioactive damage to our environment.  On Thursday, 1 May the inter-departmental committee, in conjunction with the Nuclear Energy Board, was established.  On Sunday, 4 May, at about 6 p.m., the Minister for Energy was informed that <Col N="188" /> air monitoring samples from the Dublin area showed indications for the first time of radioactivity from the Chernobyl plant and, of course, samples of milk were taken in the Leinster area immediately</P>
    <P>On Monday, 5 May the inter-departmental committee met and, with the cooperation of the Civil Defence Force, immediately arranged for the collection of milk samples on a countrywide basis.</P>
    <P>Members will be aware from what the Minister said last night of the major steps taken by this Government to ensure that everything possible is done to monitor the situation, indeed that the public would be told of the situation.  This we have done at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am in a position to inform the House that various samples of milk tested today show that the level of iodine 131 has shown a consistent decline in all samples.  The most recent results from the Leinster area have shown an iodine 131 concentration in milk to be at 30 becquerels per litre, considerably lower than the peak value found early in the week, at about 440 becquerels per litre.  Therefore, we have seen a rapid and welcome decline.  These levels are well below the international Atomic Energy Agency action level of 1,000 becquerels per litre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies on the other side of the House who said there are no boundaries to this debate are quite right. What is an even more harsh reality is that the boundaries of the impending disaster we all face&mdash;that some countries experienced last week&mdash;have no limits.  That is why it must be tackled in the most constructive, positive way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure other Members of the House share my consternation at how helpless and powerless one small nation can be with regard to the proliferation of nuclear energy, both by way of power stations <Col N="192" /> and weaponry.  I am glad this subject has been brought up again and again.  I want all sides of the House to fight this matter to the bitter end, to use the terrible experience of the past couple of weeks to consolidate what many of us feared and what, unfortunately, too few people have taken seriously to date.  I deplore the fact that always there has to be a crisis or an accident of huge, human proportions before we take the right emergency measures.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the Minister has spelled out the reality that, even if we pass this motion in the House this evening, the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant will not be closed down.  It should be remembered that huge, powerful interests are involved not just at the economic and industrial level but also at the military level and, dear God, we all know just how powerful they are.  I want this debate to continue in the most positive and constructive way.  Out of the disaster we have witnessed must come sanity, solid lobbying and working to get the people with us.</P>
    <P>Members on the other side of the House will agree with me that one of the most inspiring things with regard to public opinion in the recent past in our attempts at the establishment of a nuclear plant has been the across-the-board awareness, concern and action on the part of the people generally.  I did not mean it as a cheap political jibe when I said it was the people who stopped it.  All of us tonight, from whatever side of the House, should be appealing to the people of Ireland and Britain &mdash; because, remember they also have an investment and their Government do not seem to be listening to them &mdash; encouraging a worldwide movement, all of us standing up using every means available to us to ensure that this insanity does not continue.</P>
    <P>I am sure all of my colleagues share my concern and terrible sadness that a country like Sweden&mdash;a country that has had a great sense of social and security planning, even of neutrality &mdash; could find itself not being informed of a disaster that could affect them.  It was only when <Col N="193" /> Sweden, with all its attempts at security, neutrality and good statemanship, found its people invaded internally &mdash; perhaps to a degree as they have said themselves, causing disease and death &mdash; did any information with regard to what had happened at Chernobyl emerge.</P>
    <P>It is no longer a safe world.  I absolutely agree with every Deputy who has said that we must use the international committee which must be set up and that that committee be urgent in their tasks.  The first area to which they should look is Sellafield.  I am tried of people telling me that there is a natural background of radiation, that because we are living on a planet which has natural radiation somehow we will develop a continuous resistance to it.  That is balderdash.  That is like saying that because there is natural electricity in the atmosphere we can take high doses of electricity and will build up a resistance to it.  It is as stupid and as short term as that.</P>

Already, pregnant women are the people who are most fearful, and rightly so.  The least we can promise to pregnant women is that they should have some security, that not alone will their babies be born safely without genetic mutation, but that they will be born in some kind of a safe world.</P>

      <P>It is a pity that the Minister has left the House.  I have spoken on this issue on four or five separate occasions and it is disappointing to have it made a political issue.  This is a non-political issue.  Pollution of this kind knows no boundaries.  The singular issue facing this House tonight is to show with a united voice that we can stand up to Britain on this matter.  Why should we defend the stand which Britain is taking?  From this country's point of view, we have no vested interest whatsoever in a nuclear industry or in the activities that are taking place in Britain.  That is the kernel issue. That is what the Government should face up to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much debate has taken place, and rightly so, around Sellafield.  Not much reference, however, has been made to the perhaps most important fact that Sellafield is being expanded.  I am sure that Deputy Barnes will be interested to hear that a £3 billion expansion is taking place there, through the Thorpe expansion <Col N="195" /> programme.  Surely it stands to reason that if one expands that plant and that industry to the pitch to which they are being allowed to expand, the risk of serious accident becomes far greater. Many have asked what stand can Ireland take.  Ireland can take the stand that united, this Parliament is calling for the closure of Sellafield.  Let nobody ask what we can do.  We can do an enormous amount as a small nation.  Our voice is strong in Europe; it is not muted.  We do have a point of view.  Rather than reading in British newspapers tomorrow morning &ldquo;Irish Government Vote down Bid to close Sellafield&rdquo;&mdash; that is the type of headline which appeared in those newspapers after this issue was debated in the Dáil &mdash; we should stand united on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

      <P>We should call for the closure of all nuclear plants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to introduce any political rancour into this debate.  It is a very serious subject in which I have had an interest over the last four years.  Whether we like it or not, the Government are a party to a huge potential risk to this nation.  Contamination has come from 1,500 miles away.  I would go so far as to say in this House tonight that it is not beyond the bounds of possibility, given the long term effect of low dosages of radiation, that people might die as a result of that accident so far away.  I could be accused of being alarmist in saying that, but it is a fact of life.  Information has come from England today that perhaps ten people will die there as a result of what happened 1,500 miles away from them.  Why should we defend that appalling situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were insulted quite recently when a Minister in Britain referred to the fears expressed by people about Sellafield as being akin to a mediaeval witchhunt. Imagine a man saying that.  It is an insult to the intelligence.  They will eat their words now that a serious accident has taken place.  It is right and proper that this <Col N="196" /> Parliament sound a warning to protect its nation.</P>
    <P>The chairman of our Nuclear Energy Board, Dr. George Duffy, only recently stated that he was more worried about the safety of the 30 year old reactors at Sellafield than he was about the pollution caused by radioactive discharge into the Irish Sea.  How can we defend that system?  We just cannot.  It is criminally negligent to the nation to engage in divisive side-tracking amendments such as the motion put down by the Government. The kernel of the issue is that Britain could be taken to the European Court for being in breach of EC regulations causing a threat to a sovereign state bordering it.  There are very serious grounds for believing that that could be done because of the risk which it is putting before this nation.  The expansion of Sellafield is a horrendous proposition for this country.  There is activity in the Irish Sea, bringing nuclear waste from far off countries such as Japan who will not get rid of their own waste, and dumping such waste into our sea.  Then they talk about cutting back radiation to acceptable dosages. The fact that it is present is most regrettable.  The reality is that there is no acceptable level.</P>
    <P>The point has been made: what can we do about Sellafield?  Much of the material cannot be disposed of.  I have read reports on the research which has been carried out on dry land storage at the plant.  Much of the storage could take place there in a safer manner.  I seem to be repeating this <i>ad nauseam</i> but until there is a unified commitment &mdash; from Ireland even which stands to lose so much &mdash; from this House we will have lost our opportunity and we will let England away with this and their proposition to develop a nuclear industry.  That is the proposition. They are going to expand and develop.  It is not just one particular plant within 70 or 80 miles from where we are debating tonight, let alone 1,500 miles away in southern Russia, the fact of the matter is that there are dozens of nuclear plants in England.  We are making a singular protest here tonight which should <Col N="197" /> be backed unanimously by every Member of this House.</P>
    <P>We have had a report contradicting the statement made by the Tánaiste about twice the level of radioactivity.  Nobody really knows about this and what damage is being caused by radiation of this kind. I appeal strongly to the Government on this.  There would be no face lost.  It is not even being looked at from that point of view and it angers me to hear people say it is not sensible to call for the closure of Sellafield.  Of course, it is sensible.  We all know it, which is worse.  We all realise that it is the sensible course to take.  So do the public.  They know it is the way to go.  A gesture now by the Government to make this a united call from this House tonight would be the answer and give us a pointer so that we could refer the matter to the European Court.  If we are arguing amongst ourselves and have not got a united voice on the issue, then the Government are negligent in the absolute extreme on this matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the second part of our motion.  Not enough attention has been given to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very timely motion following the Chernobyl incident. We have had massively increased levels of radioactivity from an incident which occurred 1,500 miles away.  It is an indication of the seriousness with which we view the Sellafield plant that we have had <Col N="198" /> a second motion in the space of about six to eight weeks.</P>
      <P>Sellafield is almost 40 years old.  There have been numerous serious errors, in particular the fire in 1957 and the serious discharge into the Irish sea in 1983.  They have been fined £10,000 for failure to obey the regulations.  The total lack of information coming from Sellafield is very serious.  Management and workers are bound by the Official Secrets Act not to give information.  The military control 15 per cent of the plant.  Are the military obliged to adhere to the same stringent regulations that the normal public company are obliged to obey?</P>
      <P>Wrong information has been given. Indeed a committee set up under Sir Donald Black was given wrong information. Later, one of the officials who left Sellafield was able to disclose that Sir Donald Black was given a figure which was one fortieth of the real figure of uranium discharged.  He was given a figure of 40 grammes when it should have been 20 kilogrammes.  I listened to the Environment Secretary on the BBC radio programme last Friday night &ldquo;Any Questions&rdquo; on which he stated that he was very proud to live in a society where there was openness and frankness and condemned the Russians for the fact that they did not disclose information.</P>
      <P>Of serious concern to us are the lack of information and the failure to disclose important information.  The 1983 discharge into the Irish Sea was not disclosed until a Greenpeace boat happened to be in the vicinity.  Following on their finding of this discharge it was admitted that such a discharge did occur.  Having listened to the Minister last night and the Minister of State tonight I would like to know when the Department were informed of the incident in Kent three or four days ago.  That was not disclosed until questioning by a reporter from <i>The Observer</i> elicited this information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Professor Hillery and Dr. Sheehan did an intensive study in the Dundalk area and linked a number of cases of Down's Syndrome to the 1957 incident at Sellafield. It was suggested that they were being alarmist and that that could not <Col N="199" /> have happened in view of statements at the time that the wind was blowing in the opposite direction.  In the last few days Paddy Ashdown, a Liberal MP, stated in <i>The Guardian</i> that there was a large amount of radioactivity at that time but it was blown out to sea, presumably the Irish Sea.  Naturally this came towards the east coast.</P>
    <P>There has been an increased incidence of disease in the area around Sellafield. There has been an increased incidence of leukaemia.  In fact, the third highest level of leukaemia in children in the UK is in Seascale.  Doctors right along the east coast, North and South, are very concerned about the increased incidence of leukaemia.  It is inexplicable.  Many of them link it to Sellafield and consider it worthy of further study.  The Department of Health set up a committee in 1984 to look at the problems of Down's Syndrome and leukaemia.  They promised to report in April of this year but there is no sign of the report to date which is an indication of the casual approach of the Government.</P>
    <P>There has been absolutely no preparation by the Government even though they must be aware that these incidents would happen at some stage.  We heard the Minister last night and the Minister of State tonight saying they would continue to monitor the situation.  I would have liked to have heard from either of them what plans they have and what plans Civil Defence have in the event of a major incident?  What plans have the Department of Health?  Are there any iodine tablets available if a major radioactive iodine fallout reaches this country? While we on this side of the House believe that prevention is the answer, the least we would have expected from the Minister was some indication of what plans he has made in the event of a serious incident.</P>
    <P>I am seriously concerned about the recent incidents at Sellafield and their frequency.  My main concern about Sellafield is that it has potential for destruction. We are not facing up to that.  If there was a serious disaster or fire at <Col N="200" /> Sellafield, the radioactive particles would be carried up into the atmosphere.  The main problem would be created 60 miles away, which would involve our east coast.  We are talking about radioactive elements which are very serious and hazardous to man in large quantities.  It will cause cancers, leukaemia, genetic defects and any amount of serious illnesses.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State tonight stated there was little likelihood of closure of Sellafield and that we should ensure safety.  In my view there is no such thing as safety.  People depend upon measuring instruments.  As they have become more sophisticated the safety measures have been reduced.  The people do not want measuring instruments or monitoring of what is happening.  They want a safe environment in which to live.  Health care and the promotion of a healthy lifestyle will be emphasised more in the future.  It is essential that we should have a healthy atmosphere.  People do not want to turn on their radios at 8 o'clock in the morning to find out whether or not it is safe to put milk in their tea.  All parties to this country, North and South, except the Coalition parties, want Sellafield closed. I appeal to the Government and to the Deputies opposite to support our motion. We are regularly calling on nations around the world to reduce the number of nuclear armaments that are available. It would not be wrong for the Government and their backbenchers to support our motion and to show that, as a nation which does not have a vested interest in nuclear power, we are standing up in defence of the rights of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In this motion Fianna Fáil are proposing that this Government engage in a specific course of action to protect the health and the interests of the Irish people.  Specifically we are proposing that the Government, in a united way with the backing of all Irish people, immediately confront the British Government and demand the closure of Sellafield because of its deplorable safety record. Secondly, we are urging the Government to abolish the Nuclear Energy Board and to replace it with a radiological protection <Col N="201" /> institute.  Thirdly, we are recommending and urging them to put in place a comprehensive system involving all the appropriate agencies and Departments designed to protect our population to the greatest possible extent from the effects of nuclear fallout.  Fourthly, at an international level we are urging that they take a series of initiatives directed at dealing with the growing menace of nuclear power and opposing any further expansion and imposition of international safety controls and inspections.</P>
      <P>This debate, like the debate in March and on other occasions, has been marked with ill-tempered outbursts by Government Ministers and accusations of irresponsibility by the Fianna Fáil Party. As we have said before, and as our record has proven, we are acting as a responsible Opposition reflecting the fears and genuine worries of the Irish people in regard to this menace on our doorsteps, the nuclear power stations in Britain but particularly Sellafield.  We had another example of an ill-tempered outburst here tonight by Minister Collins.  He accused us of being irresponsible.  The same Minister on 22 January 1985 in this House accused the leader of our party of indulging in alarmist questioning.  He said &ldquo;There is no danger of people living in Ireland from discharges at Sellafield.  Since then a British House of Commons report proved that the Irish Sea is the most nuclear radioactive in the world.  We have had the tragedy at Chernobyl, which is 1,500 miles away but which has had radioactive effects in this country.  The same Minister of State told us in this House in December 1985 that on the question of discharges into the sea from the Sellafield plant he had no reason to believe that the United Kingdom were not carrying out their obligation under the relevant international agreement, the paris Convention of 1974 on the prevention of pollution from land-based sources.  Time and time again this Government and their Ministers have been totally misled by the British Government.  They continue to accept the word of the British Government and British Nuclear Fuels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today in Switzerland, Mr. Norman <Col N="202" /> Fowler, Minister for Social Security in the UK, told the Irish people, lectured us, that we are foolish we might be, but we are as a nation united in concern about Sellafield. If he has any doubts about it let him ask any man or woman in the streets of Ireland how they feel about Sellafield. They want it closed now.  This Government will not ask for its closure.  Their only argument for not pursuing it was that it would be impossible for the British Government, that we cannot force the British Government to close it because it is on their territory and, therefore, we have no power over it.  I say to you, do not underestimate the united voice of the Irish people, which would be reflected in a vote in this House tonight.  If there was a unanimous decision made by the Irish Parliament on behalf of the Irish people calling for the closure of Sellafield it would have great moral sway on the British Government and it would hold them out before the eyes of the world on this issue.  Our Government are afraid to get off their knees in case they offend the British Government.  I say to them: Your responsibility is to the Irish people.  You are the Government of the Irish people, and it is your responsibility to act in the best interests of the Irish people.  I implore those Deputies who have spoken on the opposite side, Deputy Barnes and others who genuinely share our concern, to join with us in asking for the closure of Sellafield.  It might be a long road, but the first step on any long road can be taken.  Think of the headlines in British newspapers tomorrow &mdash; that the Irish Parliament as a united Parliament calls for the closure of Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant.  The effect that that would have on British public opinion and on world opinion is incalculable.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about making the nuclear industry safe.  The nuclear industry cannot be made safe.  If anybody has any doubt about that let them look at Chernobyl and the explosion that took place there.  Let us look at the track record and the accident record of Sellafield. In 1986 alone there were three major incidents at Sellafield which were <Col N="203" /> reported to the Nuclear Energy Board and to the Government.  They are the incidents that we know about.  What about all the other ones that we do not know about?  It is fair to say that, because they have so often hidden incidents in the past until the truth was dragged out of them.  Close Sellafield.  The Irish people feel very strongly about this.  Our views are not being properly reflected when the chief executive of our Nuclear Energy Board is reported in last Thursday's paper as saying that Ireland's east coast was at least 60 miles from the nearest British nuclear power station and that, consequently, we would not expect severly damaging radioactive fall-out to affect us here in the event of a major accident.  There was a major accident in Chernobyl, which is 1,500 miles away. According to Dr. Peter Mitchell of University College, Dublin, radioactivity found in one milk sample yesterday could give cause for concern if repeated.  Yet our Nuclear Energy Board tell us that we have nothing to fear because we are 60 miles away.  We already have reason to fear from 1,500 miles away.</P>
    <P>On the far side of the House they speak regularly about free votes on issues of this kind.  I ask the Taoiseach to release his backbenchers from the moral pressure he has put them under.  I have no doubt that many of them would join in calling for the closure of Sellafield.  I ask them to join us tonight on this non-political issue to put moral pressure on the British Government on behalf of the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make three brief points on this issue.  It should not be a source of party division because it is a matter of human safety.  Never before in the history of the House has public safety been a party issue.  The end result, the safety and well-being of people not only here but in Europe and the world, is our prime concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are very lucky that we do not have a nuclear power station in Carnsore.  That is not because of the wisdom of Government but because the oil crisis of the late <Col N="204" /> seventies forced a change of mind.  It is only eight years ago since the then Government, based on a decision of the previous Government, agreed that we should go ahead with the building of a nuclear power station at Carnsore.  The then Minister for Energy, Deputy O'Malley, was very clear and explicit when he told us that was the future, the way in which we should look after our energy sources from then on.  When Deputies Barry Desmond and Kelly then raised the points being made here tonight, questions about safety and the discharge of waste, they were dismissed in a very abrupt way by the then Minister for Energy, without demur from his colleagues.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford to feel smug.  We are lucky because the oil crisis of the late seventies allowed for a drop in demand and as a consequence the need for the nuclear power station did not arise.  We should keep that in mind and neither side should claim exclusivity of concern on this issue.</P>
    <P>There are two ways to approach this problem, both reflecting great concern about Sellafield.  British Nuclear Fuels have lied through their teeth consistently over a long period about the real position in Sellafield.  Like us, the British public have cause to be concerned about this and the British Government must have great difficulty in standing over the credibility of stories coming to them from Sellafield.  We accept all that, but how do we bring about a change?  We can shout or even roar and call for the closure of Sellafield.  We can do it night after night in this House, but we will be told it is not our business, that the safeguards are there, that the British are satisfied about their safety standards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be the most effective way.  The other way to go about it is through methods that exist already.  We can work through the EC.  There we can lobby and bring pressure on Britain to allow access to the best independent monitoring experts so that <Col N="205" /> we can get a full picture of what the situation is.</P>

      <P>We can shout and roar to bring pressure on Britain but it will not be effective.  A more effective way would be to work through processes that exist at present.  We can win the support of our colleagues in the EC.  We can put diplomatic pressure on.  But, if we persist in calling for the closure of Sellafield, the natural reaction of a combative and perhaps arrogant British Prime Minister is to dig her heels in even more, to give us even more cause for concern.  If we want to be effective so that we can bring about a change of mind, the way open to us is to go along the lines suggested by the Minister for Energy last night.  It may not be the most popular way.  It might be easier and more popular to shout and call continuously for the closure of Sellafield. Perhaps that, too, would change public opinion, but it would be fatal for us to divide on this issue this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It is our job to help them to mobilise opinion.  Politically, though, if we want to be effective rather than scoring points, rather than whipping up alarm and fears which might not otherwise exist, if we work through the way outlined by the Minister for Energy, through the proper diplomatic channels, through the European Atomic Commission, putting every diplomatic pressure on the British, we are more likely to be effective in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy O'Hanlon said, the debate here is particularly timely, because never before has there been such concern about the dangers from nuclear fuels.  This has been caused by the disaster at Chernobyl. It would be wrong if the concern of the <Col N="206" /> House was not expressed to the Soviets. We should first express our sympathy to those who have suffered and for the devastation caused, but we should let the Soviets know that their irresponsible behaviour in the wake of Chernobyl is simply not acceptable to the other countries of Europe.  There was no access until very recently for independent experts.  If we talk about matters of which we are ignorant in regard to Sellafield, how much greater is our ignorance about what happened at Chernobyl, about the irresponsibility of the Soviets in their pressure to develop nuclear fuels at an alarming rate, to build in the interests of their economy without any regard for safety?</P>
    <P>This evening, while expressing the great concern of everybody in the House about the situation in Sellafield and in pursuing the proper diplomatic political means of bringing about the sort of changes we want in Sellafield, let us express to the Soviets our concern at their unneighbourly behaviour in waiting for a day or two after the event before making it public, in refusing to allow access or to give verification of the true circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in Deputy Manning's contribution.  There are some matters I do not understand. He said this should not be a political issue, that we should not divide on it. That is precisely the point we are trying to make.  The House should not divide on this national issue, affecting the health of our people, affecting our environment. It affects North and South, all Irish people.  All Irish people are agreed on this.  The only forum in Ireland today in which you will find disagreement and division is this House.  For the life of me I cannot understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand the suggestion that we should allow the European Parliament to deal with this.  That Parliament have decided, have voted for the closure of Sellafield.  Surely that represents a much wider range of opinion.  Why can we not come together here tonight and send out a united voice to the British <Col N="207" /> Government?  We should say that enough is enough.  As far as Ireland is concerned, let the British close Sellafield now, once and for all.  That is not making hysterical political speeches.  That is not alarmist, as Deputy Haughey was labelled by the Minister of State, Deputy E. Collins, who thankfully has left the debate in the despicable and deplorable manner in which he walked out the door.</P>
    <P>This party, under the present Leader, for some years have been pointing out time after time &mdash; I was called hysterical and he was called alarmist and Deputy G. Brady was probably called by every word in the English dictionary from time to time for annoying the Government of the day by bringing in a motion which was not reasonable.  They told us time after time that there was no risk, no danger to health.</P>
    <P>If they have had doubts on the other side &mdash; perhaps they thought they could overcome the problems arising from Sellafield &mdash; they should put them aside now.  It is foolish to tell us, as Government Deputies have been doing, that the British Government will not close Sellafield. This has been the kind of defeatist attitude adopted here tonight by the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, and by Deputy Barnes, who nearly shed crocodile tears in relation to what might happen to the people.  It is no argument to say the British Government will not close Sellafield or that they will not listen to the British people.  What is happening here is that our Government are refusing to listen to the voices from every part of the country to get behind the call for the closure of Sellafield.  How can our Government credibly say the British Government will not listen when they themselves are not prepared to listen to the Irish people?  This matter is non-political and it should not be a cause of division among us.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the cosy and apparently comfortable attitude of the Government in relation to this matter.  In his speech this evening the Minister of State did not tell us anything we had not known already.  In fact, that speech could easily have been made in the House of <Col N="208" /> Commons.  In essence it was in line with what two Ministers in the British Government said this afternoon in an effort to assuage the fears of the British people.  I refer to Minister Peter Walker and Minister Norman Fowler.  We heard the same expressions from them when they tried to persuade the British people that there were no risks.</P>
    <P>On British television last night, in a late news bulletin, figures confirmed that there would be a minimum of 8,000 deaths caused by cancer as a result of the unfortunate accident that took place 1,500 miles away.  Yet, here we are in the Irish Parliament prepared to divide on an issue like this when we know &mdash; it has been shown quite clearly by the experts &mdash; that many thousands of people will die from cancer.  We must ask how many Irish people will die from cancer as a result of that accident.</P>
    <P>I ask every Member on the opposite side to think again before they vote. Many of them will have attended the funerals of friends and relations who died of cancer and related diseases.  How many Members opposite have asked the question: why so many young people are dying because of cancer?  There was a serious accident in 1957.  There is no doubt that accidents were covered up and that lies were told about them time and again.  There is no doubt that the Irish Government were not informed about the true facts.  The nuclear industry worldwide pours hundreds of millions of pounds into protecting that industry. They have created the most effective propaganda and public relations exercise in an effort to maintain that industry for themselves.</P>
    <P>From what we see in our own country we know there has been a serious increase in the incidence of cancer, leukaemia and related diseases.  Despite all the differing statements in the past few days since this unfortunate accident, we know there will be more cancer deaths, both North and South.  Perhaps we may be lucky enough and not suffer from those horrible diseases, but certainly young people and pregnant mothers may be affected.  Is it <Col N="209" /> any wonder that the women in the country are phoning various offices throughout the day in an effort to get up-to-date information.  They do not believe, and cannot be expected to believe, the information emanating from various Government sources.</P>
    <P>Last night in this House the Minister for Energy said that the radioactivity increase during the weekend was only twice as much as normal, but today we find out from an eminent scientist in UCD that it was 23 times more than normal.  I will not waste my time quoting the various statements that have been made.  The statement from the Nuclear Energy Board was different from that of the Minister for Energy.  We had a definitive statement from medical authorities here saying the NEB do not have the medical expertise that would entitle them to tell the people of the country that there is no health hazard.</P>
    <P>Phrases such as &ldquo;the normal risk&rdquo; have been used and we have been told that the radiation level is &ldquo;a bit above the normal risk&rdquo;.  What is the normal risk?  Who created it?  Why should there be any normal risk?  Are we talking about protecting the health of our people and our environment?  We are not.  All the Government have mentioned, in the speech tonight and last night, was monitoring &mdash; the usual response from this Government.  What will they monitor? They may monitor the levels of radiation but will that do anything to remove the risks.  Up to now have they carried out any monitoring or inspection of fresh vegetables? Tonight in Dublin Bay there is a ship from Poland.  Are the Government even aware of that fact?  Are they doing anything about it?  It is not today or yesterday that the <i>ad hoc</i> interdepartmental committee should have been established and brought together.  The Government got plenty of notice.  They were told on many occasions of the accidents that happened in Sellafield and of the build-up of radioactivity.  Yet, it took this major disaster to get them to set up the interdepartmental committee.  We must ask the question: to do what?  The answer we have been given is to monitor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> We are quite clear in what we call for tonight.  The Government cannot be happy with their amendment to our motion.  I shall quote from it.  It speaks of:</P>
    <P>conveying to the UK Government the Irish public's concern that the number of accidents at Sellafield has caused a loss of confidence in the safety of the operation of the plant.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with an Irish Government that they will not stand up for the rights of our people and honour their responsibilities to those who elected them?  They should demand the closure of Sellafield. Do they expect to get anything if they do not ask for it?  If they sit at home during a general election campaign, do they expect people to come out and vote for them without even asking?  They will not even honour their responsibilities to the Irish people by making the demand.  Let it be refused, but at least they should carry out their responsibilities and respond to the wishes of our people.</P>
    <P>We must ask the question why they are not making that demand.  Why have they continued for so long to pour out speeches that have more in common with speeches delivered in the House of Commons in their attempts to tell us we are not at risk?  Is it any wonder our people are asking why are our Government so reluctant to make that demand?  They wonder why the Government are so afraid and subservient.  Is there a strategic and defence reason?  We know that Sellafield is there for strategic and military reasons.  Is that why the Irish Government are not prepared to demand its closure?  Are they afraid they might dislodge the excellent relationship we are told exists between the two Governments, although one must wonder how deep that runs?  Is that the price they are expecting the Irish people to pay?  If so, I believe they are making a serious misjudgment and miscalculation. There is no price our people are not prepared to pay to assuage the grave concern that exists throughout our island.  They will stand behind an Irish Government who make that demand.  It may ruffle <Col N="211" /> feathers along the way, but when have an Irish Government so thrown away their independence and spirit of nationalism that they are not prepared to do what our people wish?  Has it gone so far that once again they are prepared to bend the knee and to endanger the health of our people and the environment?  That is not a price we are prepared to pay.  We believe that every Irish person would be prepared to stand fully behind the Government on this matter.  Indeed it might lift some of the air of despair and disillusionment that exists today if we saw a spark of leadership from this Government in relation to this issue.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is silent on this issue but if he were in Opposition he would be running around the world trying to organise international public opinion behind his call on behalf of the Irish people.  He is so silent it is incredible; he has gone to ground.  Three weeks ago I heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs say on radio that the British Government will not close Sellafield.  He is not prepared even to ask &mdash; what is not worth asking for is not worth receiving. There has been silence from the benches opposite but there are people there who have at heart a genuine concern for the people and we will wait to see whether they go right or left through the division lobby tonight.</P>
      <P>It is not a political issue or an issue which should divide this House.  This will be the only House in the 32 counties where there will be a division of opinion in relation to making a demand once and for all for the closure of Sellafield.  We should be proud to be an Irish Parliament and put it up to the House of Commons from the 32 counties of Ireland.  If we cannot agree on anything else, we can agree on that alone.  Let us demand that Sellafield be closed and get back to the business of running this country, representing its people and making it a better place, if not for us to live in, then for our children to inhabit in the future.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 1 in the name of Deputy Lenihan and Deputy D. Andrews. Amendment No. 2 is related to it.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 may be debated together by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1) (d), lines 47 to 49, to delete &ldquo;with the consent of or at the request of the appropriate member of the Government,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> The whole spirit behind this Bill as adumbrated by the Taoiseach and by other speakers is to ensure that we have an archives system that is independent of Government, can garner the necessary information, do the necessary research and carry out examination apart from any political control or influence and that that be seen to be done.  This is important if we are to have any credibility attaching to the archives system.  The whole thrust of the Bill, which was welcomed by us, could be defeated and frustrated if it appeared at any stage that a member of the Government, or an appropriate member of the Government as is suggested in section 4, should be in any way involved in the work of the proposed director of the National Archives Advisory Council.  I ask the Taoiseach to give serious consideration to the amendment standing in my name and that of Deputy <Col N="219" /> D. Andrews which is designed to achieve what I have just said.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 seeks to delete the words &ldquo;with the consent of or at the request of the appropriate member of the Government&rdquo; and leave it to the good sense of the organisation that is being established here, established, we hope, with full expertise and capacity for research.  The director in charge of the National Archives should be placed in an independent position to do the sort of historical research which is so essential and, above all else, to give credibility to whatever historical research is done and provide an academic basis in the form of information available to historians of the present and the future so as to give a balanced account of how matters have progressed under various Departments of State and by reason of the examination of various public documents.</P>
    <P>Similarily, that is the thrust of amendment No. 2 which proposes:</P>
    <P>In page 5, subsection (1) (d), line 49, after &ldquo;records&rdquo; to add &ldquo;Provided that the Taoiseach may, where the security of the State or the public interest warrants it, by order declare that certain categories of records shall not be subject to inspection by the Director except with the consent of the Department concerned&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Again to protect the integrity of the system of research established here and to protect the integrity of the director of the National Archives Advisory Council, except where a question of the security of the State is involved, we want to ensure that neither an appropriate member of the Government nor the Taoiseach should in any way interfere with the working of the National Archives Advisory Council or the director of the council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed similar amendments in the Seanad at length on Committee and Report Stages.  The basic problem is that there is confusion here between different elements of the process. First, there is the question of the retention of records dealt with in section <Col N="220" /> 7, the transfer of records after 30 years in section 8 and the release of records to the public in section 10.  We are talking here about the powers and functions of the director and the issue at stake relates to his function to ensure that the retention of records is carried out properly, that they are being retained in a manner which will ensure that they are properly looked after and preserved.  For that purpose it seemed desirable, and after consideration we decided, to give the power to him to inspect and examine the arrangments for the preservation of records in Departments prior to their transfer to him after 30 years.  It is not part of his function, and was never envisaged to be part of it, nor could it properly be, to inspect the records themselves in order to examine their contents for any purpose within the 30 years.  His function, prior to the 30 years, relates to satisfying himself that they are properly preserved.</P>
      <P>In the ordinary way that function will be fulfilled by his having the power to examine the arrangements for their retention for preservation and to inspect them on the spot to see in what condition they are kept.  He is to inspect the premises to see that there is no danger from damp, that they are properly kept and not allowed to become dog-eared and that they are not kept in the wrong kind of containers and so on.  It is important that he should have that function because we are all aware that old records can be carelessly looked after by people whose primary concern is with getting on with the job rather than the preservation of old documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a recognition of the fact that there are circumstances in which the mere external inspection might not give him sufficient information to enable him to satisfy himself of this and, therefore, if he is unhappy about anything, if there are boxes of records which externally may seem reasonably satisfactory but perhaps are showing indications that they may not be containing the records satisfactorily &mdash; they might be badly preserved within the box &mdash; he can request the right to inspect for the purpose of establishing that they are properly maintained <Col N="221" /> as distinct from inspecting the records, which is not his function and which would be quite inappropriate to give him as a function because these records contain current information, not merely about Government policy, but in relation to individuals.  There would be records from the Revenue Commissioners, security records and so on in respect of which it would be quite inappropriate for anybody to have the power to inspect them within the 30 years.  For that reason we have made the provision in this form that he would have as part of his functions the inspection and examination of arrangements for the preservation of vital records and, with the consent or at the request of the Government, the examination of governmental records.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan pointed to the undesirability of any undue political involvement in archival functions.  I agree, but his own amendments simply reverse the process and provide that he would be entitled to see all records except such as the Taoiseach might determine in the public interest as not being appropriate for inspection by him.  Apparently it is quite inconceivable that any Taoiseach, even if he spent his time doing nothing else for five years, could inspect all the records and decide which should be looked at or examined&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would trust the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might trust the Taoiseach&mdash;and it is good that the Taoiseach should be trusted&mdash;but Taoisigh could not be entrusted with such a wide ranging function because it would be required, in order to ensure that he did not inspect any records which it was undesirable to inspect, that the Taoiseach should inspect all records in order to make the exceptions.  Obviously, that is totally impracticable.  Apart from involving a political element in the function, it is simply an impractical way of managing it.  It is only in very exceptional cases that the director may feel that the inspection of the arrangements may not be sufficient and, in those circumstances, he can ask <Col N="222" /> to look at the records, not to examine their contents, but to make sure that they are properly maintained and preserved.</P>
      <P>That is why we have come to this conclusion and to accept the amendment would place him in a position which would be unnecessary, undesirable and, in terms of the functions conferred on the Taoiseach, totally impracticable in that it would impose a burden on him of having to inspect all records to determine which should not be released for this purpose. Basically, the problem comes back to the confusion between the different roles. The director's role is fundamental.  He takes charge of records after 30 years, puts them into order and makes sure that they are available to the public.  This is an additional function to ensure that, when that point is reached, the records will have been properly preserved and he can satisfy himself in that regard.  For that purpose, we have made this provision which is appropriate and, with respect, the Deputy's amendment would be inappropriate to the purpose to which it is directed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Taoiseach's thinking on this.  I have studied in some detail the Seanad debates and the Taoiseach's contribution&mdash;or rather the contribution of his stand-in&mdash;as reported in the Seanad Official Report, volumes 107, 108 and 109 of 13 March 1985, on 9, 14 and 29 May 1985 and on 25 September 1985.  We are proposing to give the director who is charged with the operation of this Bill unrestricted powers, no more and no less.  The Taoiseach suggested that he as Taoiseach or following Taoisigh would have too wide ranging powers and he does not want such powers to be given to them.  However, he is meant to be running the country and, in those circumstances, his powers are wide ranging.  I do not know why he cannot encapsulate our amendment which is tidy, neat and leaves the question of decision making in that context at the door of only one person, namely, the Taoiseach of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) (d) is intended to give powers to various Government Ministers <Col N="223" /> to make whatever decisions are to be made in the context of the subsection.  I find that unattractive because it is too disparate and too spread out in its functions.  We suggest that our amendment is the proper one.  The arguments put forward in the Seanad went to the heart of the Bill and section 4 is the heart and spirit of the Bill because, if you erode or diminish the role of the director, as intended in the section as it now stands without the amendment proposed by us, it affects the Bill in its totality.</P>
    <P>The functions of the director are restricted by being made contingent on a request from the appropriate members of the Government.  We believe that the director should have less restricted powers of access and this is the most disturbing deficiency in and feature of the Bill.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could consider the amendment on Report Stage because it is fundamental to the tenor, spirit and responsibility of the Bill.  We strongly urge the Taoiseach to reconsider his rejection of the amendment which, as he properly pointed out, was proposed in the Seanad by Senator Ross and Senator Brendan Ryan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If I heard the Deputy aright, he seems to be misconstruing subsection (1) (d) in suggesting that it was only at the request of a member of the Government that the director could examine departmental records.  That, of course, would be quite inappropriate and unsatisfactory.  It is with the consent of or at the request of a member of the Government.  In other words, it would be possible for a member of the Government to ask to look at certain records to see that they were properly preserved and to look at those records.  The director, in examining the arrangements for the preservation of records, might find in some instances that he could not, from the inspection of the arrangements, satisfy himself that the records were adequately preserved and would seek the consent of the Minister to look at them more closely.  With a responsible director, and a responsible Minister, if such a <Col N="224" /> request came forward it would be looked at reasonably.</P>
      <P>In the ordinary way the initiative will lie with the director and not with the Minister which would be quite inadequate and inappropriate.  It may be appropriate in rare cases but it would be the exception rather than the rule.  The point the Deputy is not adverting to is that amendment No. 2 would require that the Taoiseach should, before the implementation of the legislation and the appointment of a director have examined under his responsibility and satisfied himself in relation to them all records from all Departments in order to identify what records the director should not be allowed to see.  Even if a Taoiseach spent five years at a job and doing nothing else, he could not examine all the records and satisfy himself as to which ones should not be open to inspection by the director during this 30-year period.  Obviously, that is totally impracticable.  In so far as the Taoiseach did not do that, in so far as he failed to go through the records, it would mean that the whole process envisaged by the Bill of the release of records to the Director of the National Archives after 30 years would be vitiated. The Taoiseach could not personally examine, within the period all the records and identify all the ones which are of such a character in terms of the personal information they contain, the security aspects, questions of good faith in regard to individuals, or for whatever reason, that should not be shown to anybody, even the Director of the National Archives.  A director's function is only in relation to handling of records after 30 years.  It is only in relation to them that he is given access and has the job of making them accessible to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies opposite must see that a Taoiseach could not carry out the function it is proposed to impose upon him of satisfying himself in respect of these records.  The effect of the two amendments in practice would be that the director would have the power of inspection of all records the moment they come into existence.  He could be coming in and looking in at the minutes of Government <Col N="225" /> meetings the day after they are made or the correspondence the day after it is written unless the Taoiseach managed to identify all those different areas and closed them off and all of that for what purpose?  It is for a purpose which does not have anything to do with the purpose of the section which is concerned only with the director's legitimate concern that records during the 30 years are maintained in such a condition that at the end of the 30 years they will be legible and will not have deteriorated to the point of not being accessible to the public at that time.  That is the only purpose of this and the director is given the necessary power to examine the arrangements.  If he is unhappy with that he can ask the relevant Minister if he can look at them more closely for the purpose and any such reasonable request put forward on the grounds that the external inspection does not enable him to satisfy himself would, I am sure, be granted on the basis that the director would look inside the box and see that all was well.  He would not start reading through the papers himself. That is the only practicable way to do it and the alternative suggestion is clearly totally impracticable in that it would impose upon the Taoiseach a burden which he could not carry out and would vitiate the whole purpose of retaining records for 30 years before they become accessible to, usable by, visible to and the contents known to the director.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach cannot have it both ways.  I am willing to yield on the second amendment because of the point he has made, that it might be impracticable to ask a Taoiseach to investigate each record or have an apparatus seeking out the security issues involved as proposed in that amendment.  I regard that amendment as an attempt by us to help the Government, and the Taoiseach, but if the Taoiseach is willing to yield the necessity for any security investigation by him so be it.  However, the first amendment is far more fundamental. It is quite noticable that the Taoiseach devoted very little time to replying to that amendment.  I will give him a present of <Col N="226" /> the second amendment but I want to discuss the first amendment which is germane to the essential nature of the Bill, the appointment of a Director of National Archives.  The sections are concerned with the establishment of a council and the appointment of a director.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) (d) states:</P>
      <P>(d) the inspection and examination of arrangements for the preservation of Departmental records and, with the consent or at the request of the appropriate member of the Government, the examination of Departmental records,</P>
      <P>The functions of the director in regard to inspection and examination of arrangements for the preservation of departmental records is tied in with the consent of the relevant Minister or, if not with his consent, at the request of the appropriate member of the Government.  Therefore, the function of the director according to this section is tied in in a politicised way. He can only function in two ways.</P>

      <P>According to the subsection the functions of the director in regard to the inspection and examination of arrangements for the preservation of departmental records will be with the consent or at the request of the appropriate member of the Government or the appropriate Minister.  They are the only ways records can be examined by the director.  That is the essence of our criticism. The Taoiseach spent a lot of time talking about the second amendment but we are yielding the point involved in that and we are concentrating on the point in the first amendment which is basic to the system the Taoiseach is seeking to establish.  If we are to have a system of preservation, examination and research in regard to national archives, if we are to appoint a proper director, a proper council and staff they must not be circumscribed in the way the Taoiseach is proposing.</P>

      <P>I am totally bemused at the Deputy's attitude.  If we pass the first amendment all we can do is inspect the arrangements.  If the director is dissatisfied with the arrangements and wants to look more closely we will have removed the possibility of his doing so.  If we accept the first amendment and delete &ldquo;with the consent or at the request of the appropiate member of the Government,&rdquo; the director is left with the power of inspecting the arrangements only.  We are anxious to ensure that if he is not satisfied with the arrangements there should be some method by which he can look more deeply into the matter.  I cannot accept the Deputy's proposal because it would so limit the powers of the director or his functions.  There appears to be some misunderstanding between us as to what the Deputy wants us to do.</P>

But, for the delectation of the Taoiseach and perhaps his bureaucrats, he might reflect on the British Act of 1958, which did not define the functions of the director in detail.  In the process that Act left the director more unfettered than will be his Irish counterpart under the provisions of this Bill.  I am not a great man for comparing Irish with British Acts or suggesting that we are comparing like with like.  But the British have been notorious, in the best sense of that world, for taking care of their heritage, this type of heritage in particular.  That is what we are talking about.  We are talking about the role and functions of the director of a part of our heritage, namely, the Director of the National Archives.  In Britain they take the view that he should not be fettered whereas in Ireland the view taken is that he should be fettered.  If I may use the expression, the Taoiseach <Col N="228" /> effectively is emasculating the Bill by virtue of his unpreparedness to accept a very reasonable first amendment.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Lenihan, that certainly we can concede the second amendment on the basis that it was in aid of the first.  Whether we can concede the first amendment, which is so fundamental, is another day's work altogether.  I really would ask the Taoiseach to convince us that what he is saying is correct, that he believes what he is saying to be the correct thrust of his thinking on the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has suggested that the British Act provides a power which we are closing off here.  As I understand it, under the British Act there is no power to inspect the arrangments by the director.  This is an additional power we are giving which, as I understand it, the equivalent director in Britain does not have.  I repeat.  The power here is one which enables him to inspect the arrangements but does not give him power to inspect individual records, which is not permitted, as far as I know under any archival system, where a rule like the 30-year rule applies and where the director's functions are normally confined to the period after 30 years.  We are, perhaps somewhat exceptionally, giving him a function to ensure that the records are preserved.  In giving him that function we are being more liberal than elsewhere rather than less liberal.  I think the Deputy has got that wrong.</P>

Then we have the important section we are now discussing, the appointment of a Director of National Archives and his functions, which functions are set out in section 4, subsection (1)(a) right through to (m).  No amount of semantics by the Taoiseach can persuade me or this House, on a reading of paragraph (d), which we are seeking to amend, that these functions of the Director of National Archives are being circumscribed by the inclusion of the words we are seeking to delete.  The words we are seeking to delete are &ldquo;with the consent of or at the request of the appropriate member of the Government,&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £3,716,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1986, for the salaries and expenses of the office of the Attorney General including a grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>If I may, I will introduce both Votes.  This is probably one of the few occasions on which these two Votes have been discussed separately from the Finance group of Votes.  I suppose there is no harm in that. It affords us an opportunity of looking at the overall role and function of the Offices concerned.  It has been decided in the past &mdash; and I can quote a precedent on this, at volumes 56 and 60 of the Official Report &mdash; that the Attorney General's administration of his office may not be discussed in the course of the debate on the Estimates.  The Minister for Finance is merely responsible for the expenditure concerned and the carrying of that through the House.  The activities of the Attorney General &mdash; and, by extension of that precedent, the duties of the Director of Public Prosecutions &mdash; do not come within the purview of the Minister for Finance, nor do they therefore come within the purview of a debate of this kind.  Obviously, that confines one essentially to a basic description of the expenditure involved and the functions of the two office-holders, but beyond that the debate cannot go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary function of the Attorney General is that of legal adviser to the Government and, indeed, to all Government Ministers and Departments.  He is, therefore, provider of the legal service of the State.  His main functions may be summarised as follows: First, legal adviser to the Government and all Ministers; secondly, administration of public services, both within and without the State, relating to the legal representation of the <Col N="233" /> Government and of the public in all legal proceedings; administration and control of the functions of the Chief State Solicitor's Office, the Parliamentary Draftsman's office and the local State solicitor; the prosecution of offences in which the Minister is the prosecutor and finally&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I raised that point today. I know that genuinely, the Minister wants the proceedings of this House to be efficient and effective.  A Member of this House, if he gets a script from the Minister and has some other work to do or has to meet somebody else, can take away the script, read it and perhaps come back later and contribute to the debate.  Otherwise, he will have to wait until the Official Report is available and he cannot take part in the discussion.  I am not saying that my remarks relate particularly to what is going on now.  I am making this as a general statement with regard to the efficiency of debate in this House.  I just had to get that off my chest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know how seriously to take the Deputy's interventions in future. The office of the Director of Public Prosecutions was established by the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974.  The aim of that Act is to take prosecutions out of the political arena, to hive off criminal matters from the Attorney General, whose office had become overloaded with <Col N="234" /> advisory work after the accession of Ireland to the European Economic Community, and to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of prosecution briefs.  The Act provided that the director would take over the functions formerly exercised by the Attorney General in criminal matters and that he would be independent in the performance of those functions.  Just as I have given the functions of the Attorney General under five headings, I shall give the functions of the Director of Public Prosecutions under five headings.  I trust Deputy Woods will be able to retain this information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no chance of that, but let the Minister continue, anyway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Woods knows it all already, being as well informed as he is.  The functions of the Director of Public Prosecutions are as follows: First, the prosecution of all offences on indictment before a jury or in the special Criminal Court; secondly, the granting or withholding of consent to summary trial for certain offences; thirdly, the prosecution and defence of State side applications; fourthly, the nomination and payment of barristers to appear for the Director; fifthly the dispensing of general legal advice to the Garda and State solicitors on criminal matters.</P>
      <P>Now let me come to the financial side, having described the functions of the two office-holders.  The allocation for 1986 for the Attorney General's Office is £3,716,000.  This represents a reduction of 8 per cent on the outturn for 1985, due primarily to reductions in the provisions for fees to counsel retained by the Attorney General and for general law expenses, expenditure on both of which was exceptionally high in 1985.  It is therefore capable of being reduced in 1986. While, given the nature of the expenditure on these items, accurate forecasting is extremely difficult, it is hoped that expenditure patterns will return to a more normal pattern in 1986.  Thus the allocations made in this case are adequate and will not be exceeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the financial allocation <Col N="235" /> for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, provision here is for £1,255,000, which is an increase of 13 per cent, or £144,000 over the 1985 outturn. The main components in the increased allocation are the provision for salaries due, <i>inter alia,</i> to some strengthening of the staff of the office, and for payments and fees to counsel representing the Director in the Central Criminal, Special Criminal, and Circuit Criminal Courts.  It is impossible in any one year to forecast with any accuracy the number and seriousness of crimes that will be prosecuted and, in consequence, the forecasting of expenditure is very difficult.  The provision for 1986 under this heading is £834,000, representing an increase of 11 per cent on 1985.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the matters which may be discussed on this Estimate are rather limited.  As the House will be aware, the Minister for Finance, although responsible for the Vote, has no statutory responsibility for the exercise of his functions by either the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions. Therefore, the Minister for Finance can only answer in this Estimate debate and Members only discuss in this Estimate debate matters which come within the responsibility of the Minister.  There are many precedents for this position.  However, within those constraints I shall, of course, be happy to answer any queries or deal with any points raised from the other side of the House or from my own, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>There are a few points I might mention which could be of interest to some Members, although it is hard to anticipate what Members are going to want to know in a debate of this kind.  One is the position of the Law Reform Commission. At the moment the position is that the Government have directed the Attorney General to establish an <i>ad hoc</i> committee representative of a number of Departments as well as his own, to identify those areas of law reform requiring the attention of the Law Reform Commission.  It is the view of the Attorney General and of the Government that the final selection <Col N="236" /> of the new law reform commissioners should not take place until this review has been completed.  This would enable members to be chosen and the mandate to be given to them on the basis of the actual needs for law reform at the point in time.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the outgoing Law Reform Commission set a programme of work for themselves soon after their foundation, I think around 1976.  That programme of work has been almost entirely completed at this point. There is, therefore, a need for a new programme of work of which the agenda, so to speak, initially is appropriate to be decided by the Government.  The Law Reform Commission are then established and once established, the commissioners will have entire freedom as to the conclusions they come to on the agenda set for them.</P>
    <P>The Government are fortunate in the services they can call on from both the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions. Both of these individuals are distinguished people who make a very useful, if different, contribution to the affairs of this country.  I would like also to avail of this opportunity to pay a special tribute to the two offices concerned and in particular from my own direct knowledge to pay tribute to the work of the Attorney General's Office. During the three Ministries I have held at different times since the beginning of this decade, I found that when the Government had occasion to look for advice from the Attorney General's office at short notice and very often after hours when most people, if they were not already in their beds would certainly be at home with their families, the Attorney General's Office were prepared to provide advice of a very high quality under pressure.  This advice has turned out to be, in almost every case, extremely good and well founded.  I am sure that has been the experience of all Ministers in the various Administrations.</P>
    <P>I would like to say also, that the Government of the day, and in particular this Government, have had occasion to <Col N="237" /> make great calls on the dedication of the parliamentary draftsman's office in that we have been producing very large volumes of legislation.  Often this legislation has been extremely complex against deadlines agreed in this House, very often under pressure from the Opposition who were demanding that legislation be produced by a particular date, not unreasonably from their point of view.  I am very glad to say again that despite the fact that their staffing resources are quite limited the parliamentary draftsman's office have provided the Government with an extremely good service.  I am quite sure that that will also have been the experience of Deputy Woods during his period as a Minister.  Certainly, it has been mine.  It is no harm that we have had this opportunity in the House, which is unusual because these Estimates are not usually discussed separately, to pay tribute and express our thanks to the offices concerned for the contributions they make to the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make some comments of a very general nature in relation to these two offices. They are two very important offices of the State and they are particularly important in relation to the prosecution of offences.  I should like to join with the Minister in congratulating the office-holders for the services they give and their attention to detail under the pressures they have to work under, in recent times particularly.  These offices are having to handle a tremendously increased volume of work, particularly in relation to the prosecution of criminal offences which as we know have grown very largely in number in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Governments in recent times have put a lot of pressure on the office of the Attorney General because of the demands for legislation.  If we look at the allocations, we find that this is reflected in the figures.  In 1981, the Director of Public Prosecutions was allocated £603,000.  This has doubled by 1986 to £1.255 million.  This figure increased consistently each year in between, reaching a peak in 1985.  The 1986 figure is slightly <Col N="238" /> down from that.  That of course reflects the tremendous increase in the rate of crime and the number of cases coming before the courts and consequently being prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions on behalf of the State.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General's office have likewise been burdened with an increased volume of business.  The figure allocated to them has increased from £2.3 million in 1981 to £3.716 million in 1986.  Therefore, we see that the figures bear out by the case we can recognise fairly readily that these offices have been forced to deal with a greatly increased volume of business.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in the Minister's reference to the Law Reform Commission.  That commission have been in somewhat of a limbo in recent times.  They have done a tremendous amount of basic work on which much of the legislation coming before this House, particularly in relation to family law, owes its origin.  It is particularly sad that they are faced with this situation.  The Minister was quick to come in tonight to say that the Government have appoined an <i>ad hoc</i> committee to identify the areas of law reform which might be pursued in future.</P>
    <P>The people want to know what is happening with the Law Reform Commission.  They want to know why the appointments are not being made, when they will be made and when the position of the Law Reform Commission will be regularised and set out clearly.</P>
    <P>During the past year there has been growing public concern about the workings of Ireland's criminal justice system. Taking the system as a whole, there have been delays in presenting books of evidence with the result that cases were struck out.  The prosecution of the offences involved were halted and suspects were released.  For example, there was the case of the robbery of goods valued at £19,000.  The case was struck out at Rathfarnham District Court because the book of evidence was not available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> Members of the Judiciary have repeatedly complained about delays in presenting books of evidence and warned that they would have no option but to strike out cases if books of evidence were not prepared in time.  Other examples of cases being struck out because of delays were published in the media.  So there have been problems in the general administration of this area.  There was a very good article in <i>The Irish Press</i> of Monday, 23 September 1985 when the kind of problem which was developing was highlighted.  The justices concerned were saying that the system was not working for them, that in general, the money was not being provided, that the system was not working and that they were fed up with repeated remands because of delays in the production of books of evidence. Mr. Justice Herbert Wine, District Justice Gillian Hussey and Mr. Justice Delap have all highlighted the problem.  All this relates back to the efficiency of the operation of this system.</P>
    <P>While we cannot go into any individual case we must be concerned with the overall system as it performs and with its needs.  We have a duty in this House to provide the means necessary to carry out the legal system as we know it and as we operate it.  Ultimately, the whole question came to a head with the Owens case in August last.  In this case a man was charged with murder and brought before the courts.  He was remanded in custody pending the presentation of the book of evidence and the prosecution of the case. After repeated warnings by the district justice a final week's warning was giving and when the book of evidence was still not ready the case was struck out and the accused was freed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the Minister that I am talking only in very general terms.  It is necessary to refer to specific cases.  There is no point in allocating money and saying that everybody is happy.  The worry was that enough money was not being allocated. Perhaps we were not doing our job in providing the staff.  I mention these cases in passing.  A murder case is a very important case.  The man involved could have evaded justice completely and was later apprehended and found guilty of manslaughter.  The case finally highlighted the fact that the system of prosecution had broken down.  The administration that we are talking about was clearly at fault whether through negligence, lack of supervision or possibly the absence of a cohesive and effective system.  The due process of the law was brought into disrepute and public confidence was undermined.</P>
      <P>The prosecution of the offences was seen to be the weak link in the entire criminal system.  That is why I must refer to this.  The Garda are being repeatedly accused of not succeeding in prosecuting cases.  This is something which we must address in general terms.  No system can work with inherent weaknesses.  The justice system in particular relies on coordinating the activities of the Garda, the community, the public prosecutors, the courts and the prison service.  At present over 11,000 gardaí are involved in some 98,000 indictable crimes annually, many of these involving violence.  Given that the detection rate for all crimes is only one in three, we must at least ensure that these detected cases are fully and properly prosecuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public outcry was directed at the office of the DPP.  On examination we discovered that the delay was apparently due to the barrister who was nominated by the DPP.  The Minister for Justice promised an investigation into this matter but so far we have not been informed of the outcome.  Given the public concern <Col N="241" /> in this case and the need to preserve the integrity of the whole criminal justice system.  It is not acceptable to sweep this matter under the carpet.  We are told that as a result of this case changes have been made in the prosecution of murder cases and that additional staff have been allocated to the Chief State Solicitor's office. I had hoped that the Minister in his reply would be able to give the House the outcome of the investigation which was carried out in this case and say what changes were made in staffing and in the prosecution of offences.</P>
    <P>As we have seen from various statements it was decided that certain murder cases would be dealt with directly by the staff of the DPP and not by the barristers operating in a semi-independent way. This was part of the change which was brought about.  It is also suggested that, because of the embargo, a number of staff were not appointed and that following these events extra staff members were made available.  The Department's management services unit examined the request for additional staff which came from the Chief State Solicitor.  Permission was given to appoint 15 additional staff, some legal and some technical.  The allocations we are talking about are very relevant to the general operation of the justice system.  While we are not permitted to go into any of the individual cases, public concern about these matters is reflected in the House.  The House is expected to provide the resources to ensure that the prosecution of offences can go ahead in a normal way without the Judiciary having to be critical in public, which they are very reluctant to do, and without the DPP and the Chief State Solicitor having to make public statements or to have the Attorney General make them on behalf of the DPP as happened in this case.</P>
    <P>In another case which came to public attention the wrong charge was made in the Circuit Court.  Once again the people charged walked free.  This was the Ballinspittle case.  The Garda had proffered the correct charge in the District Court but this was changed by the barrister engaged on behalf of the DPP when the case came <Col N="242" /> to the Circuit Court.  It was subsequently struck out on the grounds that the charge was wrong.  The public were outraged and offended at this outcome especially when those involved admitted vandalising the Ballinspittle statue.  The law was brought into disrepute.  It later emerged that no supervision is exercised on barristers prosecuting cases on behalf of the DPP.</P>
    <P>There is a general problem in relation to the management and organisation of spending within this Vote.  We can keep our distance from the details.  The Prosecution of Offences Act is there to ensure that the details in relation to decisions on the prosecution of an offence are matters which are not interfered with.  Ultimately it is a matter for the DPP in that case.  At the same time, the question of how the whole system operates or should operate in the future is one about which we must be concerned.</P>
    <P>In two recent celebrated cases, the Owens case and the McArthur case, the families involved were very upset at elements in the handling of these cases.  In the Owens case no charges were proffered against a person who was allegedly involved.  In the McArthur case there was no prosecution for the second murder which was allegedly involved.  In both cases explanations were demanded by the public from the DPP.  There was considerable public agitation and concern. Under the existing legislation, to all intents and purposes, the DPP is gagged even in cases of vital public concern and even where we may know or assume that he has good reasons for the kind of decisions which he has to make.</P>
    <P>The public perception of what is going on is a problem.  It has led to very virulent demonstration and protest.  When this happens within the system, it is time to have a look at the system and at how it operates.  This is unacceptable and it does not encourage public confidence. Although it is open to the Attorney General to consult with the DPP and presumably get the necessary explanations, this does not appear to have been done in these cases.  This is regrettable in that the Attorney General could have reassured <Col N="243" /> the families and the public that the due process had been observed.</P>
    <P>Experiences, particularly during the past year, highlight the need for a reappraisal if not a radical overhaul of the whole system of prosecution including the accountability of the prosecutors and public officials involved.  Some of these examples, and I have only referred to them in passing, have indicated very clearly that there are problems which have to be addressed.  If we are serious about beating the criminal we must not allow our criminal justice system to be undermined by staff embargoes, by the lack of organisation and finance or by the mismanagement of the present resources of the prosecution system.  The system must not only be effective but must also be seen to be effective and accountable to the public.</P>
    <P>In some of these cases the Garda are blamed.  In the Ballinspittle case people were offended and upset because those who admitted doing this act of public vandalism got away scot free and the Garda were blamed in the public eye. The Oireachtas established the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism and when they inquired into the case they were told the Garda were completely blameless.</P>
    <P>The fault lies with the system, which was not capable of responding in the normal way.  The correct charge was put when the case was brought to court in the first instance, but when it was referred to the Circuit Court a barrister was brought in and he put a different charge.  The court had to strike out the case as a result. What kind of supervision was there which resulted in that?  The book of evidence was not in by a week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This is regrettable, all the more so because the Attorney General could have reassured the families and the public that the due process had been observed.</P>
      <P>The committee got a reply from the Office of the DPP in regard to the working of the system.  This is on record in the report of the committee.  The reply stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Director would not wish to be in any way unhelpful to the Committee. However he considers that it would be entirely inappropriate for him having regard to the general framework of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, and <Col N="245" /> of Section 2(5) thereof in particular, to enter into correspondence or explanation regarding the processing or conduct of a particular case.  When any governmental or legislative agency wishes to make enquiry regarding any such matter, the Director considers that such enquiry should be addressed to the Attorney General, with whom the Director has a statutory obligation to consult on matters pertaining to his functions (See Section 2(6) of the 1974 Act).  Should the Attorney General ever so request, the Director will be more than happy to place the full facts of any case at his disposal for such use by him as may seem appropriate to him.</P>
    <P>The DPP made it quite clear how the system works.  I am talking about supervision in the case that was struck out when a wrong charge was entered.  We wanted to know how this could happen. The Garda were blameless.  As I have said, it was in the Circuit Court that the wrong charge was entered.  The committee wanted to understand the system and to find out if a system of supervision was in existence, if there was somebody watching and supervising the preparation of these cases.  The letter from the DPP continued:</P>
    <P>That said, the Director feels that he should, in fairness to the hardworking and dedicated staff of his Office, state that the reports in the national newspapers of the 10th instant relating to the meeting of your Committee on the previous day, were wholly unjustified in so far as they related to this Office. Furthermore, the Chairman of the Committee is quoted as suggesting that there was &ldquo;need for more supervision of counsel for the DPP&rdquo;.  The Director wishes to make two comments on that suggestion.  First, this Office has four legal assistants, who handle approximately 5,000 files per annum, many of them very complex and difficult.  It would be ludicrous to suggest that in addition they could undertake the task of supervising the work of prosecuting lawyers in all the courts around the <Col N="246" /> country.  Secondly, the Director takes this opportunity of stating, unequivocally, that barristers retained by his Office are selected exclusively on the basis of the most expert advice available as to their professional competence and commitment, and that they perform and have over the years performed their duties in a thorough and highly professional manner which does not admit of supervision any more than would the professional services of a surgeon or an architect.  He considers that once a function is delegated to a barrister, it is virtually a contradiction in terms, and a defeasance of the purpose of the delegation, to seek to supervise the detail of the professional performance of that function.</P>
    <P>The problem is that there were instances when the system broke down, and this brought the process of law into disrepute. The committee suggested that there should be a system whereby the barrister would be given cases and would figure out how he would present them.  Surely somebody in the prosecution must oversee, check and make sure that this is done by a certain time.  The Minister should arrange for management studies so that a unit would go and have a look at prosecution cases.</P>
    <P>We had another such case in regard to an escape from Portlaoise Prison.  Charges were being prepared and, in the process, security information on prison officers was included in the book of evidence which was given out to people, including the defendant who had attempted to escape?  How can that happen?  I do not know how a management system can allow such things to happen.  Security information given by prison officers about themselves was included in the book of evidence and, of course, this was dangerous to the prison officers &mdash; it may have got into the book of evidence inadvertently.  There is a lack of checking and control within the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What point is the Deputy making about prison officers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="247" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of supervision within the system.  There was a breakout from Portlaoise Prison and charges were prepared against the people involved.  In preparing the charges, apparently a security check was done on the prison officers at the time and details of that check ended up in the book of evidence that was presented to the people on the other side.  That kind of thing should not happen.  Parliamentary questions were asked about it at the time.  I am saying we should have a system that would ensure nothing like that would happen again.</P>
      <P>There was also the case that arose in Malahide, County Dublin where there was a charge against a member of the Garda Síochána for allegedly assaulting a person in the station.  The case came forward and the barristers working on behalf of the State came to what they regard as an agreed price.  The agreed figure of £16,000 was given in the informations and was published in the media. Apparently, the Attorney General was proceeding on that basis but he had to get approval from the Department of Finance. In the event, they did not approve the agreement and, as a result, the case went to a jury who made an award of £85,000.  I should have thought that the judgment of the Attorney General and the barristers and the staff in that Department &mdash; the Minister complimented them earlier on the difficult and onerous work they carry out &mdash; should have been relied upon.  It turned out to be a very expensive business.  Probably it will be settled eventually for some figure between the two amounts.  I will not go into details&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The case was reported in <i>The Sunday Press</i>, dated 26 January 1986, and was also reported elsewhere.  I will advise the barrister in question to pass on the comment to the Minister and not to the civil servants involved.  In recent times the Attorney General has not apparently been given the same freedom to exercise his functions in that direction that he had previously.  I ask the Minister to look at the matter.  The case I mentioned brought the matter to public attention and it indicated that the Department of Finance had a direct function in the matter.  The financial purse strings are controlled by the Department. The Minister also operates within the system in that he arranges for management studies and operates embargoes in relation to staff.  All of that is relevant to this Estimate.</P>
      <P>In Scotland they have a system of independent prosecuters who do all the State prosecutions.  The office is known by the title of Procurator-Fiscal.  In their case the police do not prosecute and they are moving towards that system in England. The Crown prosecution system will be under one office and, again, in that system the police will not prosecute.</P>

      <P>No, I am not.  I was trying to outline how the different parts function. The Minister has people to carry out management studies and I am suggesting that he might look at the system.  From the point of view of the Garda Síochána, there is the benefit that gardaí would have <Col N="250" /> more time on the beat and more time to deal directly with crime.  Obviously that is why the British are going in that direction now.  They will have to make adjustments also.  If the Minister undertook a study of the system, he might provide the basis on which future decisions could be made. That is as far as I would go in that regard. In Britain they are tending to use full time staff to prosecute cases.  We have reached the stage where we need to take another look at our system and consider the best use of the time of the gardaí. This is a very interesting area and I am glad the matter can be discussed here in general terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point.  I want to reiterate what I said at the outset. I appreciate the volume of work that has fallen on the Office of the DPP in recent times.  I outlined this increased work and the increased cost.  I appreciate that the office and the system have been put under great strain, but that gives us an opportunity to look again at the way we do our work in this area.  We are quite happy to support the Minister on these two Estimates and we give our full support to both the Office of the DPP and the Office of the Attorney General in the very <Col N="251" /> onerous functions which they have.  We assure them of our full support.</P>
      <P>Having said that, there are situations which arise and it is important that they be faced up to and dealt with.  The Minister for Finance is in an especially good position to look at this matter in conjunction with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, and perhaps at the end of the day they will bring about systems to prevent the kind of public concern which has been expressed over the past year in relation to a number of these areas.  There are many examples of this kind of thing and I suggest it is time to have a look at the functioning and effectiveness of the system in the face of a new situation and in relation to the general question of accountability.  We must consider some means of giving reassurance to the public or the House in particular cases where people are aggrieved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is one example. Another example would be the case I mentioned where a murder case was not pursued.  There is very great public concern and we need some mechanism which does not involve the DPP.  It may be that a statement from the Office of the Attorney General could allay public fears in relation to a particular case.  There might be a mechanism for doing that, thereby preventing feelings of public unease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal first with the last point made by Deputy Woods, although it ran right through his contribution. I refer to the question of the wisdom of the DPP or someone on his behalf giving an explanation as to why a particular case on which a file had been prepared had not been prosecuted.  There would be serious dangers involved in any procedure of this kind, even if applied only in exceptional circumstances.  Of course, prosecution does not in any sense prejudge the result of the court case, but in very many cases failure to prosecute <Col N="252" /> might be due simply to a technical matter such as the non-availability of a particular proof or the death or unavailability of a particular witness.</P>
      <P>If the DPP gave an explanation in that type of case he would have to draw attention to the fact that this was the only factor preventing him from prosecuting. In another case where there was no evidence, good, bad or indifferent, if he gave an explanation it would have to be a much more full explanation indicating that there was no evidence whatever.  The contrast would then be drawn between the two explanations.  In the first case the DPP would be admitting that but for the non-existence of a particular witness he would have proceeded, whereas in the other case he would be giving almost <i>carte blanche</i> to the prospective defendant. The public would immediately&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If any statement at all is made it is likely that more and more elaboration of that statement will be called for and the reputation of the prospective defendant might be taken in a non-judicial way by public statement by the director and the comment that might emerge, either in public or in private conversation, on what the statement contained or, more often, what it did not contain.  In essence the result of the director's making any statement could be trial by public opinion rather than trial by jury or trial by the court.  That would be clearly contrary to the whole principle upon which our criminal justice system in this country and in many similar countries is based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the reasons of good sense and fellow feeling which might lie behind the suggestions made by Deputy Woods in this matter, it would be most unwise if they were pursued by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I do not accept <Col N="253" /> that the bland type of statement which he would like to allow the DPP to make would be sufficient.  He would be put under more and more pressure to make statements, if he made any at all.  In my opinion the Deputy's suggestion is not a good one.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods made a number of other points about the position in regard to cases where it could be argued that counsel employed either by the DPP or the Attorney General had not acted in a manner that would be considered up to scratch and where the results suggested in some sense or other that there had been a failure on the part of the person acting.  Deputy Woods asked whether there should not be a system of supervision whereby the barrister would be acting but the DPP would be looking over his shoulder on a daily basis to ensure that he was doing all he should.  That would be a little like having a dog and barking yourself, as far as the DPP is concerned.  Under our system he pays the barrister to do the job and there would not be much point in that if the DPP were trying to do the job too by second guessing the individual decisions the barrister took in a particular case.</P>
    <P>There is general supervision in the sense that, if a particular barrister fails to conduct the case to the satisfaction of the director, the director will of course be inclined to review whether or not that barrister would be retained again in a case of that seriousness.  That process is designed to ensure that the barrister always will have the incentive to conduct his business up to the highest possible standard because he knows that in practice it will affect the likelihood of his being given further business by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  That is probably a sufficient incentive.  The system we have at present is such that in individual cases the director and the barrister are acting at arm's length.  The system suggested by Deputy Woods would consist of a public prosecutor's office conducting the case with direct responsibility on a day to day basis on the part of the counsel employed by the director to the director, cross-checking <Col N="254" /> individual decisions as they are taken. But in either of these two systems, as the House is well aware, there are likely to be mistakes made.  Obviously, those errors tend to get disproportionate publicity relative to the overwhelming majority of cases where the prosecutions go through normally without any difficulty and the court is able to make its decision on the basis of the evidence presented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Who is accountable for the errors in that system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, there are likely to be difficulties in either system. But changing the present system simply because there are difficulties is not the answer.  Of course, the Director of Public Prosecutions is ultimately accountable for failures of this kind; but the purpose of accountability is not so much to go back over past errors as to ensure that one learns from these errors.  That purpose of accountability is entirely fulfilled by present practice in that if a particular barrister fails to perform adequately the director does not have any requirement to retain that barrister again.  That would not be the case if we had a system whereby the barristers were full time civil servants employed by the director.  In such cases if a particular person was not performing well he would still have a contract of service and would have to be retained in the service of the director until he reached the age of 65.  So there would be far less effective accountability in a system of a public prosecutor's office where all of the counsel were employed, because they could not be disemployed so easily as is the case in the present system, which provides a far better and more positive form of accountability, in a really meaningful sense that yields results than any system of supervision of the kind that Deputy Woods is advocating could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods drew some inferences from the fact that seven extra solicitors were recruited by the Chief State Solicitor's Office in June 1985 and he seemed to suggest that this was in some sense an indication of understaffing in the past. That was not the case at all.  The reason <Col N="255" /> for these additional solicitors being recruited was that, up to that, work which was more appropriate to the solicitors' branch of the legal profession was being conducted, in the absence of in-house solicitors, by barristers.  As the House will be aware, that is a very expensive way of getting work done that might be more appropriately conducted by solicitors. As a result of the decision to take on these additional staff, considerable savings have been made.  That is evidence of the prudent conduct of his office by the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor and is in no sense an indication that there had been inadequate provision in the past, but rather that prudent action was taken to reduce costs in the fashion I have just described.</P>
    <P>The Deputy made great play of the fact that in regard to his functions it is possible for the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General to consult together from time to time in matters pertaining to the director's functions and that the Attorney General is the director's channel of communication to the Government.  However, I think that it would be highly unwise, in cases of public controversy, if it were to be publicly advertised that the Attorney General was exercising his rights to consult with the director in a particular case.  If it came to public knowledge that this was being done, as seemed to be the inference in Deputy Woods' suggestion, there could be incessant demands from the Press to know exactly what had occurred at this consultation.  That would defeat the whole purpose of the consultation.  This type of discussion in public would not be conducive to the best conduct of justice and would probably worsen it considerably. It is better that the Attorney General should continue with the practice that he has already well established of, where he does consult from time to time with the Director of Public Prosecutions, doing so in a manner which is not advertised publicly and the results of which are not advertised publicly, because to do so would simply raise expectations as to the <Col N="256" /> availability of information, which availability would not serve the interests of justice at all, for reasons that I have already elaborated quite fully.

      <P>Deputy Frank <Col N="257" /> Fahey was given permission to raise on the Adjournment of the House the serious position of agricultural business in Connemara.  He has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to express my appreciation to you, Sir, for your permission to raise the question of the present state of agriculture and the position the farmers find themselves in in Connemara.  I consider this to be a most urgent problem.  I have to be strong in my criticism of Government inaction towards agriculture particularly in Connemara. The position has become serious.  In fact, it has become an emergency in recent weeks because of the very high level of fatalities particularly among hill sheep and cattle.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note that the Army will be taking fodder to Connemara in the coming days.  That is a welcome development. However, that is only a first step which the Minister now must take in order to alleviate the difficulties for farmers and indeed in order to save many farmers in Connemara from total destruction.  In addition to immediate measures, which I will outline in a moment, I feel that the Minister must now take this opportunity to address himself to the problems that are now facing Connemara farmers because the various schemes over the years have not been successful in tacking the difficulties in that area.</P>
      <P>In addition to immediate measures which I will outline in a moment, the Minister must take this opportunity to address himself to the problems facing Connemara farmers because over the years various schemes have not been successful. Because Connemara is unique, the farm modernisation scheme, the western drainage scheme, the fodder scheme and so on have not been successful in that area, and I want to tell the Minister why.  I ask him tonight to tell the House what proposals he has to change those schemes and to address the unique situation in Connemara.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> In ten years about 15 farmers in Connemara benefited from the farm modernisation scheme.  That is proof that this scheme was a useless exercise.  This scheme has been a total failure in this area because the income targets set are too high, the capital base of farmers in the Connemara area is extremely weak and their borrowing capacity is nil.  The present farm modernisation scheme should be amended to take account of those factors and so benefit those farmers.</P>
    <P>The most important change should be to ensure that part time farmers are included in the scheme since the vast majority of farmers in that area are part time farmers.  Many of them must have other types of employment to add to their income from the farm.  My first request is that the farm modernisation scheme be tailored to meet the needs of the farmers in Connemara, because the area is unique.  The amount of the grant should be increased significantly in peripheral regions.  The costs in Connemara are much higher than in any other area.  If a farmer wants to build a sheep shed or a cattle shed, his construction costs are higher because he has to bring concrete blocks from Galway which is 60 or 70 miles away.  He has to pay higher rates for all work done.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the western drainage scheme.  This too has been a failure in the region.  In order to benefit from this scheme farmers had to increase their livestock units by 20 per cent by the end of the planned period.  How can any farmer in Connemara be expected to increase his hill sheep numbers by 20 per cent?  That is beyond me.  This scheme does not and cannot work in Connemara, and I am sure the Minister accepts that. I ask him to accept that this scheme has been a total failure.</P>
    <P>For many years farmers in Connemara have been persistently trying to get grant aid for perimeter fencing.  Until such time as such a scheme is introduced, the saving of the agricultural industry in Connemara will be very much in doubt.  I want you to spell out clearly why you have not been prepared to give perimeter fencing grants to farmers without any conditions. <Col N="259" />&ldquo;Without any conditions&rdquo; is very important because people on the hills cannot be expected to farm properly without such fencing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to tell me why he will not provide assistance to this area.</P>
      <P>I want to deal now with the reclassification of Connemara as a mountainous area.  Over the past 12 months efforts have been made to get the Department to enter into discussions at EC level on the reclassification of Connemara as a mountainous region.  I put down a question to the Minister some weeks ago about this and was informed it could not be done because it was to benefit dairy farmers only.  There are only 13 dairy farmers in Connemara, but there is no doubt that many other benefits would flow from the reclassification of Connemara if the Department were seriously interested in entering into negotiations. I want the Minister to tell us why the Department are not interested in entering into negotiations on this matter, or is it that the reclassification of Connemara would involve higher grants being paid by this Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to the most serious problem which has brought all these issues to the fore, that is, food shortages and animal mortality in the region.  I am shocked to find that there is a 30 per cent mortality rate among ewes on the mountainside and up to 50 per cent mortality rate among lambs.  I spoke to some farmers in Connemara over the weekend and was shocked to hear of the unbelievably small number of sheep which will yield a lamb, stand up and walk away, because the sheep are so weak.  That is a terrible state of affairs.  What the farmers and the public find very annoying is that this problem was forecast in September 1985 when it was brought to the attention of the Department.  A headline in the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> of September 1985 read &ldquo;Lambs to Starve, Warning from <Col N="260" /> Hill Farmers in Connemara&rdquo;.  Several articles were written by Michael Dillon in <i>The Irish Times</i> in which he spelled out that the difficulties which were apparent in 1985 would become very serious in March 1986.</P>
    <P>Why has no remedial action been taken in the seven months since last September when it was very evident to all the experts that there would be a serious problem of the number of store lambs being returned to the hills at that time?  It is nothing short of scandalous that no action has been taken to alleviate the position which results in a 50 per cent mortality rate in lambs and a 30 per cent mortality rate in ewes.</P>
    <P>The one remedial action which was taken by the Department was the introduction of the feed voucher scheme.  That scheme has been a help in Connemara, but it has also caused a very serious shortage mainly because the Department, for their own good reasons, did not choose to operate it in the same way as similar schemes.  Five ewes to one livestock unit was the criterion for deciding who was eligible for fodder vouchers instead of seven ewes to each livestock unit as in all previous schemes.  Why did the Department change the rules on this occasion?</P>
    <P>I heard of a case in Connemara last week where a farmer had three dead cows and 25 dead ewes after spending £5,000 on winter feed last winter.  He is not a big farmer.  He has 65 livestock units.  If the original number of seven ewes to the livestock unit was employed he would come under the free fodder scheme but he was left outside it because of this change.  Why did this change occur?  Will the Minister consider making free fodder available to all farmers in Connemara because of the present difficulties?  As far as I am aware, not too many farmers have been left outside the free fodder scheme, but one could not equate five mountain ewes with, say, 60 of a dairy herd in west or east Galway or the midlands.  The earning capacity of 60 dairy cows would be ten times greater than the earning capacity of 300 mountain ewes and I think the Minister will agree with me in that.  To <Col N="261" /> compare the owners of those mountain ewes with the owners of dairy herds who could have 60 dairy cattle and still qualify for food vouchers is not fair play.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to make fodder available to all farmers in the Connemara region because of the very high levels of animal mortality which some farmers have experienced.  The number of such farmers is not so very great and a compensation fund should be available to them to get them out of their difficulties which, the Minister will agree, are very serious.  The knock-on effect of the mortality rate will be very significant next year as a result of reduced grants due to reduced numbers and inability to replace sufficiently because of those reduced numbers and not having money to buy replacements.</P>
    <P>I heard during the week about a man in Connemara who was buying a bale of hay a day because he could not afford to buy hay at £3 a bale in any quantity.  In the longer term the fodder crisis shows up the need for a higher level of grant assistance in regard to the farm modernisation scheme.  I call on the Minister to provide a decent level of grant for housing sheep, for instance a 75 per cent grant, so that farmers in the Connemara area can provide some form of sheep housing which they cannot provide at present.  Only a small number of farmers in Connemara have land capable of producing silage but even those farmers should get once off grants to enable them to commence silage making.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and the Minister of State have made many promises with regard to the introduction of new legislation for commonage division. The Minister of State is aware that 80 per cent of the land of Connemara is in commonage.  It is almost impossible for farmers involved in this commonage to develop their lands properly and until such legislation is introduced and the problem of commonage is tackled, I cannot see farmers who at present are doing their best making any significant headway.  I ask the Minister of State to indicate tonight why this legislation has not been introduced and why no evident <Col N="262" /> progress has been made on commonage division, and to spell out exactly his proposals for development in this area.</P>
    <P>Because of the peripheral nature of the area, the Connemara farmers cannot get any kind of break on matters such as the lime subsidy, the AI subsidy and so on. I appreciate the difficulty about the reintroduction of the lime subsidy but I ask the Minister of State to consider the introduction of a transport subsidy for lime for farmers who live, say, more than 50 miles away from the lime quarries.  In Connemara many farmers live more than 50 miles away and with the desperately bad roads the lime distributors are not interested in delivering lime to them except at exorbitant prices for delivery. The situation could be improved with the introduction of a transport subsidy to apply outside a certain distance.  This would not cost a great amount of money because very few farmers are in that situation but they are hit hardest at the moment.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister of State a few questions about areas where promises have been made and to date no action has taken place in regard to them. Does he envisage that the assessment by An Foras Talúntais of the pilot scheme for aerial spreading of fertiliser under the hill land improvement scheme will be completed in time for the scheme to proceed this year?  Will he indicate if his intention is to grant assist the spreading of fertiliser by helicopter in the current year?  Because of the large scale demand among farmers for aerial spraying of bracken fern by helicopter, will the Minister of State consider grant aiding such a project as part of the hill land improvement scheme?</P>
    <P>I cannot emphasise strongly enough how urgent it is that the Minister should take action in the areas I have talked about.  Farmers in Connemara are considerably disappointed that over the past three years, while the Minister has shown a great deal of personal concern and has taken an interest in their plight &mdash; and for that they are most grateful &mdash; he has not succeeded in making any significant change in the schemes which could assist <Col N="263" /> farmers in Connemara.  He has not heeded the warnings last September and the result has been very significant losses to those farmers.  He has not made any progress in other areas, such as the reclassification of Connemara as a mountainous area or in the division of commonages in that area.  I welcome this opportunity of hearing the Minister's proposals for action in these areas.  I should also like to know if the Minister intends to make some form of compensation available to farmers who have been literally wiped out over the last few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were to respond to all Deputy Fahey's questions it would take much longer than the ten minutes available to me.  I am delighted that Deputy Fahey is interested in Connemara farmers, as I have been interested in them for a very long long time.  Many of the schemes to which he referred were initiated by me over the last three years and I sincerely hope they will lay the foundation for reasonable progress in future.</P>
      <P>The effects of the prolonged bad weather last summer and autumn, and particularly the non-existent growth of grass, means that we are about six weeks behind from the point of view of growth.  The exceptional combination of factors means that many farmers have run out of fodder and the remaining fodder is of very poor quality.  There are always a fair number of casualties in early spring in relation to sheep and cows, not just in Connemara, and they have to put up with that loss.  It is certainly worse this year and livestock losses are higher than they would normally be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is aware of the various measures adopted by the Government last autumn to relieve the situation caused by the bad summer of 1985 which seriously affected the making of hay and silage.  These measures&mdash;the winter fodder scheme, the Shannon valley flood scheme, the feed voucher scheme and the working capital scheme for tillage farmers&mdash;cost the Exchequer about £23 <Col N="264" /> million.  In the very near future hay will be transported from the south to Connemara by the Army.  I also arranged last week, at very short notice, to make an advance payment in the suckler cow scheme and the reaction has been very good.  People who needed it most got hard cash into their hands.  I am also currently reviewing the ewe premium, which obviously is the most important one to hill farmers, especially in Connemara. This payment is almost £17 this year, the highest ever, and it applies across the board without any reference to income limits or off farm income.  Last Christmas I organised a payment of £4.90 without an inspection because I fully understand the plight of sheep farmers. This was extremely well received because it allowed farmers to buy badly needed feedstuffs for their sheep.  The total amount paid out from my Department last week for the cow suckler scheme amounted to £4.5 million and a great deal of that went to County Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that information because there are about 9,000 herds in County Galway, probably many of them in Connemara.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I took over this office there was a problem with the timing of inspections for headage payments.  Many farmers had to hold on to their stock during October, November and December before they were inspected for these payments.  That created a glut on the market at the end of the year.  However, I am delighted to say that over the last three years the headage inspection has been brought forward, we were able to carry out most of them last August and we will be in a position to do the same this year.  Last August we allowed mart and factory receipts to be taken even before the inspection, which was of great help to farmers because they did not have to hold their cattle.  This was greatly appreciated in many areas.  To prove that I have a very deep concern for the people of Connemara, we included Connemara ponies <Col N="265" /> under the headage scheme for the first time.  I hope also that sheep inspections for the ewe premiums will be ahead of schedule, as they are being carried out at a very brisk pace.  We hope to bring the premium payments forward by at least four to six weeks.  If we can do that, it will mean that many farmers will get this payment at the end of next month, which will be of considerable help to those who are in a bad way at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fahey inquired about commonages. A total of 112 have been divided in the last two years, principally those that could not be divided until I invoked dormant legislation which allowed us to divide them.  I admit that there are certain commonages in Connemara which would be exceedingly difficult to divide, no matter what legislation is in force, because of problems which have cropped up over the years.  However, I am satisfied that we are on the right track in that regard as well as in the area of fertilisation.  I introduced a fertilisation scheme in Connemara a few years ago on a pilot basis and I hope it will help sheep farmers everywhere as they will have better herbage during late and early spring.  Because of the accessibility of helicopters to areas where a man could hardly walk, I am heartened by the herbage growing in many of the hills which were fertilised over the last two years.  As Deputy Fahey mentioned, an in-depth study is taking place at present and will soon be ready.  I sincerely hope we will be able to improve the fertilisation programme in future.</P>

      <P>Fencing grants, which were introduced recently, will be very beneficial to farmers in Connemara, much more so than the farm modernisation scheme.  I have been closely involved in these grants and I have allowed different types of fences which heretofore were not allowed for grant purposes.  This is greatly appreciated by farmers in that area.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fahey questioned the livestock unit in so far as the calculation of sheep is concerned.  It has always been acknowledged that four or five ewes are equal to one cow unit.  It is in accordance with normal policy in so far as livestock units are concerned.  I hope I have shown that we have reacted favourably to the situation. I also sincerely hope that the sun will shine in Connemara tomorrow as it is worth millions of pounds to everybody. If we had nine or ten days of good strong sunshine it would do a lot for a very depressed area.</P>

      <P>A breakdown of this information by grade is not readily available and would require a disproportionate amount of time to assemble for each of the relevant grades in all departments.</P>
      <P>It is Government policy to contain and reduce the level of expenditure on overtime in the civil service.  There has been an appreciable drop in real terms in recent years.</P>
      <P>Following is the schedule:</P>

      <P>A claim, sponsored by the Civil and Public Services Staff Union, seeking payment of a cost of living increase from 1 January 1986 on behalf of members for whom the union holds recognition, was presented at the general council under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Civil Service at its meeting on 26 March 1986.  The claim sought a &ldquo;floor&rdquo; payment of a set amount plus a percentage payment.</P>
      <P>In response to the claim the official side of the council, at the same meeting, offered the package of proposals dealing with the 25th round and related matters, which emerged from discussions between my predecessor and certain public service unions in January last.  The 25th round provides for an agreement of 18 months duration overall with a pay pause of four months from 1 January 1986 and increases of 3 per cent on 1 May 1986, 2 per cent on 1 January 1987 and a further 2 per cent on 1 May 1987, giving a cumulative increase of 7.16 per cent.  It does not include any provision for a &ldquo;floor&rdquo; payment.</P>
      <P>The union has not yet formally responded to the offer.</P>

      <P>A scheme for the implementation of merit pay in the Civil Service, on the basis set out in paragraph 4.5 of the White Paper on the Public Service, is being prepared by my Department in consultation with the other Departments. As indicated in the White Paper, awards will be made to not more than 10 per cent of the staff in any grade or Department and then only in accordance with rigorous standards.  Awards will be within a range of 5 to 10 per cent of annual salary.  Merit pay is one of the items in the White Paper which will require consultation with the unions.  Because of this it would not be appropriate for me to give further details at present.</P>

      <P>Six separate competitions for appointments as electrician, carpenter, plumber, fitter-welder, bricklayer-mason and plasterer (official title trades officer) in the Prison Service were advertised by the Civil Service Commissioners in January 1986.</P>
      <P>There were 1,139 applications for the competitions.  A total of 204 applicants are being called for interview.  It was necessary to shortlist candidates for interview because of the large number of applications.</P>
      <P>Shortlisting was undertaken in accordance with the following provision of the statutory regulations:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioners, at their discretion, may request the interview Board to examine the applications of all the candidates in the context of the duties <Col N="78" /> of the position to be filled and of the prescribed qualifications and, having considered the report of the Board, may decide that a number only of the candidates shall be invited to attend before the Board for interview&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The embargo has been an important part of the Government's overall strategy to contain public expenditure. The Government has looked to improved management and the more flexible and economic use of available resources to ensure that the resulting reduction in numbers should not lead to any significant fall-off in the level of service provided to the public.  Various measures of redeployment of staff from areas of lesser to areas of greater need have been an intrinsic part of the embargo policy.  In general I am satisfied with the results achieved although the need for a less rigid system has been acknowledged in the White Paper and is at present being introduced.</P>
      <P>The end-year staffing targets for individual Departments have not yet been finalised but I would expect that they will be fixed very soon.</P>
      <P>As indicated in reply to a question on 13 February, it is expected that some 1,000 persons will be recruited to the Civil Service during 1986.</P>

      <P>The function of the Employer-Labour Conference is to provide a forum for discussion and review of developments and problems in money incomes, prices and industrial relations.</P>
      <P>The conference is a bi-partite body with an independent chairman agreed on by both sides.  The employer side is composed of 26 employer members of whom five are nominated by the State in its capacity as employer and 21 are nominated by the Irish Employer Confederation and State-sponsored bodies.  The labour side is composed of 26 labour members nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  In recent years industrial relations issues referred to the conference are considered by a steering committee comprising six labour side representatives, five employer side representatives and an independent chairman.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer and her husband are assessed to income tax on their combined incomes under section 194 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  The taxpayer's husband is in receipt of a social welfare old age pension, which is chargeable to income tax.  This pension is paid gross and it is standard practice in such cases to collect the tax attributable to it by restricting the aggregate tax free allowances under PAYE.</P>
      <P>Due to an oversight in the tax office the couple's aggregate tax free allowances for 1985-86 were not restricted in respect of the husband's old age pension and consequently the allowances granted for that year were excessive.  The necessary restriction of the tax free allowances was effected for the current year, 1986-87.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment benefit up to 29 October 1985, when he had drawn his maximum entitlement to 390 days benefit.  To requalify for unemployment benefit he requires at least a further 13 weeks contributions paid at the appropriate class providing cover against unemployment. Weeks of employment since the date on which he received 156 days of unemployment benefit may count for this purpose.</P>
      <P>He then applied for unemployment assistance and was paid initially on the basis of a qualification certificate issued in connection with a previous claim showing weekly means of £1.  He was, accordingly, in receipt of unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £75.95, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £76.95 less means of £1.</P>
      <P>Following a review of his claim he was disallowed from 12 March 1986 on the grounds that his means derived from benefit from his wife's earnings exceeded the statutory limit.  He recently appealed against the disallowance and his case is being referred to an appeals officer for determination of his means.  His entitlement to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of the outcome of the appeal.  All arrears due on his claim will be paid to him this week and further weekly payments will continue to be made as they become due.  When the social welfare officer completes his investigations the means of the person concerned will be reassessed and the weekly rate of unemployment assistance payable will be determined accordingly.</P>

      <P>Following reinvestigation of his unemployment assistance claim in March 1985, the means of the person concerned were assessed at £27.65 weekly derived from profit from his holding.  He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £39.40 being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £67.05 less means of £27.65.</P>
      <P>If he considers that his means have changed since the last investigation, it is open to him to apply for a review of his case.  A form for this purpose may be obtained at his local employment office. In the meantime, weekly payments of £39.40 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a person must have at least 26 contributions which provide cover against unemployment, paid or credited in the contribution year governing the claim.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 3 February 1986. According to the records of the Department he had only 23 contributions in the contribution year 6 April 1984 to 5 April 1985, which governed his claim. Therefore, he was not entitled to payment of benefit.  However, further inquiries are being made both to establish the number of weeks of insurable employment in the relevant contribution year and also, in view of the part-time nature of the employment, to establish if the employment should be insured at a contribution class which provides cover against unemployment.  When the inquiries are completed his entitlement to unemployment benefit will be determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending a decision on his unemployment benefit claim the person concerned claimed unemployment assistance and following investigation of his means by the social welfare officer his entitlement was determined at £31.75 weekly, that is the maximum appropriate rate payable in his case.  All arrears due on the claim less a refund of supplementary welfare allowance paid to him while awaiting a decision on his claim, will be paid this <Col N="92" /> week.  Further weekly payments at £31.75 will be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit to 28 January 1986 when payment was disallowed following an examination by a medical referee who considered him to be capable of work.  He appealed the decision to disallow benefit and was examined by a different medical referee on 2 April 1986 who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.</P>
      <P>His appeal was referred to an appeals officer for determination.  The appeals officer, after holding an oral hearing at which the claimant was present, decided that he was not incapable of work within the meaning of the Social Welfare Acts during the period from 29 January 1986 to 8 March 1986 (after which date he was certified fit to resume work by his own doctor) and is not entitled to be paid disability benefit in respect of that period. He was informed of the appeals officer's decision on 2 May 1986.</P>

    <P>All figures given are estimates rounded to the nearest £ million.</P>
    <P>*A small amount of Health contribution income and income from the Youth Employment Levy and Income Levy is contributed by employers (where the employee has a medical card) but this factor is not signigicant.  The figures given do not include health contribution and levy moneys collected outside of the PRSI system from the self-employed including farmers.</P>
    <P>+The figure given takes into account the abolition of the Income Levy with effect from 6 April 1986.</P>
    <P>The above table shows how contributions received through the PRSI system from employers and employees are allocated. In the case of the Social Insurance Fund the income from such contributions is supplemented by a grant from the Exchequer.  The estimated amount of this grant in 1986 is £398 million.  Contribution income to the Social Insurance Fund and the Occupational Injuries Fund is also supplemented by income from the investments of both funds.  For 1986 the estimated investment income of the Social Insurance Fund is £2 million and the figure for the Occupational Injuries Fund is £0.5 million.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 29 January 1986 but his claim was disallowed on the grounds that he had insufficient contributions paid or credited during the contribution year 6 April 1984 to 5 April 1985, which governed his claim.

      <P>Following a reinvestigation of his unemployment assistance claim the weekly means assessment of the person concerned were increased from £31.85 to £56.25.  The means are derived from profit from his holding and from capital.</P>
      <P>In calculating his means the deciding officer took into consideration the gross yearly income of the farm at £6,061 less expenses of £3,154.84 incurred in earning that income leaving a net annual profit of £2,906.16, taken as £2,900.  The person concerned was also deemed to have capital amounting to £446.35.  The yearly value of this capital calculated in the prescribed manner for unemployment assistance purposes is £24.63.  The applicant's means were, accordingly, assessed at £2,924.63 or £56.25 weekly.</P>

      <P>The unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that his means derived from self-employment exceeded the maximum rate of unemployment assistance payable in his case.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the disallowance on 3 March 1986 and arising from contentions made in support of his appeal the papers were returned to the social welfare officer for further inquiries.  On completion of the inquiries the case was submitted to an appeals officer for determination of his means.  The appeals officer, however, requested further information before giving his decision and it became necessary to return the papers again to the social welfare officer.</P>
      <P>When the inquiries are completed the papers will be re-submitted to an appeals officer for determination of means as soon as possible.  The entitlement of the person concerned to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of the outcome.  He is at present in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance.</P>

      <P>The adverse weather conditions last summer and autumn caused severe farming difficulties all over the country.  In order to alleviate the problems, I introduced a number of measures, including the nitrogen and silage subsidy schemes, the feed voucher scheme and the working capital scheme for tillage farmers, at a total cost of approximately £23 million. Farmers in north County Dublin have, of course, been eligible to participate in these schemes and it should also be noted that in the case of the working capital scheme for tillage farmers special provision was made for producers of horticultural products.</P>

      <P>In so far as I have responsibility under the Betting Act, 1931, the position is as follows: I am not aware that the four main British bookmakers are involved in the activities claimed in the question.  I am aware of newspaper reports concerning an alleged interest by British bookmakers in becoming involved in the bookmaking business in Ireland.  One such firm has recently informed me that they are currently preparing an application for a certificate of fitness to the Garda under section 4 of the Betting Act, 1931.  I have no role in relation to such applications. My role is confined to applications under section 5, and no application has been made to me under that section.</P>
      <P>I cannot foretell what the outcome of the above mentioned application under section 4 &mdash; should it proceed &mdash; or of any other application, may be.  Moreover, it would not fall to me to conclude in the light of that outcome whether the provisions of the Act generally, or those relating in particular to section 4 applications, are defective in any way.  As far as applications to me under section 5 are concerned, I am satisfied that the law as it stands is adequate.</P>

      <P>The precise arrangements made for the policing of particular areas is a matter for the Garda authorities having regard to local circumstances, available resources and demands on Garda services.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that parking on footpaths is an offence to which the gardaí pay particular attention, as it is considered to be a danger to pedestrians in general and to persons with prams and those who are elderly or unsighted in particular.  I am informed that where offences come to notice, appropriate action is taken by way of fine-on-the-spot or summons.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities say that on the occasion of matches in Croke Park, every effort is made to police all nearby roads as effectively as possible, and that Clonliffe Road, which is open only to restricted traffic on big match days, is one of those that has been, and will continue to be, given particular attention so far as available resources permit.</P>
