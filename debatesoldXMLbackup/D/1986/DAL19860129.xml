    <Title>Slaughtered and Detained Animals (Compensation) Bill, 1985: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Slaughtered and Detained Animals (Compensation) Acts, 1928 to 1938, a special fund was established for use in compensating livestock exporters who might suffer financial loss if, as a result of an outbreak or a suspected outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Britain, their animals were slaughtered, died or were unduly detained at a British landing port.  The fund is administered by trustees appointed by the national executive of the Irish Livestock trade and is <Col N="818" /> financed entirely by charges levied on livestock exported to Britain.  The Bill now before the House arises from a request by the trustees for amendments to the basic legislation to enable them to purchase offices and to provide greater flexibility in the fixing of the export charges payable under the Acts and of the amount of remuneration payable to their secretary.  The Bill also includes provisions whereby the trustees might be wound up if, at some further date, such winding-up is considered necessary or appropriate.</P>
    <P>The trustees have traditionally occupied offices in premises owned by the Exported Live Stock Insurance Board. That board is in the course of being wound up on foot of an enactment which was passed by the House in 1984.  The board's premises must be sold and the trustees wish to purchase it to provide their accommodation.  As the trustees have no legal power under the Acts to purchase or rent offices, an appropriate enabling provision is included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Acts provide that the collection of export charges may be suspended whenever the fund amounts to £40,000.  The levies have been accordingly suspended since 1973.  Indeed, the amount in the fund has been increasing each year since as a result of income received from investments.  However, in the event that it might be necessary at some time in the future to re-introduce collection, the Bill provides a flexible mechanism for the fixing of these charges by regulations in place of the fixed and now uneconomic charges stipulated in the 1928 Act.</P>
    <P>Under the Acts the maximum amount of remuneration payable to the secretary to the trustees was fixed at £300 per annum.  This ceiling was fixed in 1938 and is clearly unrealistic in present day terms. The Bill proposes that the trustees themselves, with my consent and the concurrence of the Minister for the Public Service, may determine the amount of their secretary's salary.</P>
    <P>The Acts under which the compensation scheme was set up contain no provisions for winding up the trustees.  While <Col N="819" /> there is no intention at present to terminate the scheme, the Bill provides enabling powers so that winding up, if considered necessary or appropriate at some future date, can be effected without the need for further amendments to the basic legislation.</P>
    <P>As I indicated at the outset, the Bill is designed to afford a greater measure of flexibility to the trustees in their operations, to remove some unnecessary rigidities in the existing set-up and to provide a mechanism for wind-up should the need arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Bill before the House cannot be taken in isolation. It must be viewed in the context of the beef industry as a whole.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, especially since its introduction has been at the behest of the livestock trade, as the Minister of State correctly pointed out.  Its provisions constitute a tidying up operation updating pre-war legislation.  The provisions of the Acts of 1928 to 1938 established a special fund, financed through charges on livestock exports, to compensate exporters for losses resulting from an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Britain.  At that time those Acts dealt specifically with exports of cattle to the United Kingdom. The provisions of this Bill update standards bringing them into line with trends prevailing.</P>
      <P>The introduction of this Bill may afford the Minister an opportunity to have a meeting of minds with those directly involved in the cattle trade.  There is urgent need to have the views of producers, the Department of Agriculture and the livestock trade generally taken into account.  The provisions of this Bill will enable the livestock trade, to a certain extent, to have control over their destiny. Its introduction may afford an opportunity for a coherent approach to the future of the whole livestock industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one examines the Acts of 1928 to 1938 one sees that we have made much progress since those days when most of our exports were to the United Kingdom. The approach now is to get all interested <Col N="820" /> parties together in view of the obvious problems facing the industry such as the threat of the EC quotas and the levy system and, more so, imported beef and livestock flooding the EC markets from outside.</P>
    <P>I assure the Minister from this side of the House that he will have my full support in resisting the GATT agreement on importing beef and livestock into the Community.  I need hardly remind the House at this time that there is already an over-production of beef in Europe and any additional imports can come about only at the expense of countries like ours which are so dependent on the beef industry.  It is no exaggeration to say that the livestock industry, already representing 36 per cent of total agricultural production, could become the greatest single contributor to the national economy from the agricultural sector, but it will not develop under existing policies.  It might be boring to repeat, but it is worth repeating, that it is in the national interest that the cattle breeding herd be increased. The herd is currently at its lowest level for many years and unless Government incentives are introduced it will soon reach the stage where it cannot be revived to its full potential.  While the dwindling national breeding herd remains a threat to the industry, it is in our own hands to overcome that.  However, I fear that proposals at EC level to tamper with or abolish the intervention system might be put through over our heads.  I appeal to the Minister at this stage to be extra vigilant on this matter which involves a vital national interest.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us today is in its concept very narrow and does not allow us to discuss to any great extent the whole aspect of the livestock trade and the beef industry generally.  In earlier years most of our exports were to the UK only.  The Bill before us today originated in the early years of the existence of the State to insure exporters against losses in the event of foot and mouth disease.  At the time and right up to the sixties when live exports peaked at 650,000 head of cattle our main destination was the UK.  Now, <Col N="821" /> thanks to, among other factors, the restrictive veterinary regulations involved in importing cattle to Britain, that section of the trade unfortunately has dwindled to a mere 16,000 or so.  I am afraid that the effects of this drop have been felt most strongly among the west of Ireland farmers who specialsied in producing store and breeding cattle.  I ask the Minister to look into the possibility of initiating talks with the British authorities that perhaps would lead to the streamlining of the veterinary regulations and eventually to an increase in the export of cattle in this section of the industry.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's good faith in presenting this Bill as an improvement in the service to the beef and livestock industry.  I welcome the Bill and my party will be giving it full support.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his speech:</P>
    <P>The trustees have traditionally occupied offices in premises owned by the Exported Live Stock Insurance Board. That board is in the course of being wound up on foot of an enactment which was passed by the House in 1984.</P>
    <P>The Minister might outline what is involved when he stated:</P>
    <P>The board's premises must be sold and the trustees wish to purchase it to provide their own accommodation.  As the trustees have no legal power under the Acts to purchase or rent offices an appropriate enabling provision is included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister in his reply will be more specific about any plans that his Department may have for the trustees who are appointed and who will continue in operation under this Bill.  Have the Department any plans to give him extra powers or does he envisage the trustees continuing or is it totally at the behest of the livestock trade?  It is important that the House be aware of what the trustees have in mind, if anything, in the furthering of their interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also tell us if it is the intention of the trustees under this Act to reintroduce a levy at a more realistic rate.  I know that the levy under the <Col N="822" /> older Acts is now totally unrealistic.  The Minister might outline to the House if the trustees have anything in mind, whether there will be a risk and whether it will be necessary to insure and compensate the livestock exporters against anything that may happen.  They have the power under this legislation.</P>
    <P>I understand that the old legislation provides for a ceiling and that the amount collected in levies cannot exceed £40,000. Of course, it exceeded that many years ago.  I ask the Minister if a ceiling will be provided as it was in the past, if the trustees in future can change that ceiling with the consent of the Minister for Agriculture, if they can impose a levy and if they can alter the amount of that levy either upwards or downwards as occasion may arise.  I ask the Minister to explain in detail the extra powers that will accrue to the trustees as a result of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives power to the trustees to wind up the whole operation of this scheme.  Does the Minister see this arising in the foreseeable future; is it necessary that it will arise or will it be to the benefit of the trade generally that the trustees remain just in case something may happen in the future?  Those are a few questions that I want to pose to the Minister.  The Bill is narrow and brief and does not give an opportunity to discuss the whole aspect of the lifestock trade, but I want to welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill. As the Minister pointed out, all sections of the trade are quite happy with it.  It is before us today as a result of the recent winding-up of the Export Livestock Insurance Board by the Minister.  There was also the necessity for the premises of that board to be purchased by the trustees of the Slaughtered and Detained Animals Compensation Board.  At the moment the latter board are using the premises of the board which has been wound up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few other matters also being attended to in the Bill, apart from the acquisition of the premises.  It is ironic that in this day and age any public servant <Col N="823" />&mdash; albeit only in a part time job &mdash; finds himself, as the secretary to the Slaughtered Animals (Compensation) Trustees does, working for £300 a year since 1938. Previous to that, the figure laid down by statute was only £200 a year.  The present incumbent of that job is Mr. Paddy O'Donoghue of the Irish Livestock Export Traders.  It is considered at the moment by the national executive of the livestock world that we must continue with this cover <i>pro tem</i>.  All of us who can recall the last foot and mouth outbreak in Britain in 1968 can remember the ripples and fears that went through the trade here at the time.  It is easy to become casual about it when there has not been an outbreak of this horrific disease in our neighbouring country for some time.  We have only to remind ourselves of the value of our livestock exports and how important they are, not just to the agricultural community but to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>We are a net exporting country and agriculture in round figures and agricultural output amount to about 25 per cent of our exports.  Of that figure, cattle exports alone take up 19 per cent.  The value that can be put on that cannot be over-estimated to the community at large.  We have had from time to time, and increasingly in recent years, a conflict between urban and rural communities and a lack of understanding of how interdependent both communities are on each other.  It is easy to forget, particularly in urban Ireland, that we are an agriculturally based country and that the future, particularly in the job line, will depend to a great extent on the agriculturally based industries, particularly in the food processing and value added sector.  High in the list of importance in this area are our beef herds, cattle exports and, it is hoped, an increasing trade in value-added products from beef.  With the advent of the super-levy again, we must increasingly turn our attentions to the importance of livestock exports, both on the hoof and in dead meat.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals specifically with an insurance fund to compensate against <Col N="824" /> losses due to foot and mouth outbreak in Britain.  At the time of the last outbreak in Britain there was no need to draw on the fund.  None of our exporters got caught up in the problem there.  The last time that this fund had to pay out was in 1963.  As the Minister has pointed out, in 1973 it ceased levying exporters of livestock to Britain because the fund had reached an acceptable level: £40,000 is deemed acceptable.  Since then, even though no levies have been imposed on exporters, the amount in the insurance fund has gone to well over £100,000.  It is deemed prudent, and rightly so, that this fund now be invested in the building owned by the company that the Minister has just wound up, the Exported Live Stock Insurance Board.  The Minister is also providing that export charges payable under the Acts may be fixed by him by regulation from time to time, as is deemed necessary.  The final inclusion in the Bill allows him the power of dissolution and of winding up the trustees board concerned, even though it is stated &mdash; and I would like to underline this &mdash; that there is no intention of doing so at the moment.</P>
    <P>The live trade to Britain has taken a back seat to Third World exports in recent years.  Traditionally, going back over the decades, Britain has been one of our main markets for our cattle, both store and beef.  Indeed, in 1985 there was a reversal of the decline in the trend of exports to Britain for the first time in several years.  The figures were up, particularly in June, July and August. Frankly, they are dictated by prices and with a very buoyant Third World market the exporters and producers had their eyes on that part of the world and not so much on Britain.  For different reasons, such as the slackening of Third World trade in the middle part of 1985 and with the exchange rates and MCAs coming in their favour, there was an overnight pickup in exports to Britain.  At the moment there is only one boat per fortnight going out of Greenore to Britain.  There are ro-ro facilities in Dublin and Rosslare but for some time since the autumn these have not been overstretched, to put it <Col N="825" /> mildly.  Greenore is the only port at the moment which is engaged in active livestock export to Britain.</P>
    <P>In June, July and August my local co-operative, County Wexford Marts, were involved in a tremendous increase in activity in livestock exports though Rosslare using the excellent ro-ro facilities that we have down there.  The mart in Wexford provided the lairage facilities necessary for the exporters and this has proved a tremendous asset to farmers and exporters from the south east and southern parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Rosslare traditionally was a very important export port to the southern part of England where they had a tradition of taking our store and beef cattle over the years.  It is hoped that this trade will pick up again.  The scene in the Middle East and the Third World is very volatile from month to month, let alone from year to year.  It is very hard to know the position.  Apart from the political climate in the countries out there, the trade depends to a large extent on the subvention from Europe as to whether it will continue to be viable.  With the CAP and the difficulties that we all know about in that connection, the future could be uncertain, even though it is a very valuable market to us.  If there should be any difficulties in the Third World, there would be an immediate increase in the activity of live cattle exports to Britain and it would be very necessary that this would happen, to have an outlet for what is generally an increasingly important beef herd in this country.</P>
    <P>The super levy and all that has imposed on us concentrated our attentions on beef, even, may I say, beef specialisation in which traditionally this country has not taken a No. 1 role.  We have produced beef cattle from our dairy herd with no specialisation at all, unlike many of our European partners.  The general pattern of putting a continental bull on our dairy cow has continued and has served us very well, in latter years particularly.</P>
    <P>The suckler premium, particularly the increase in the premium given to those in the disadvantaged areas, will encourage those who perhaps are not in dairying in <Col N="826" /> a viable way to consider switching to a beef herd.  It is hoped that Europe will increase incentives to make our beef herd viable.  Single suckling and suckler herds generally have not proved economic over the years, but there has to be a future in this.  This country, with our insular position which should make us relatively disease free, with our temperate climate and limestone grasslands, is an ideal part of Europe in which to produce these herds.  I have repeated often and do so again that one of the premises for the setting up of the EC was that production would be concentrated in areas of greatest natural advantage.  Where in Europe is there an area of greater advantage for beef production than in our country?</P>
    <P>The importance of this Bill will be appreciated when we remember our insular position in regard to meat exports.  We have had an excellent record in regard to foot-and-mouth disease and because of that our farmers, particularly younger farmers, are in the luxurious position that they give little thought to the problem of this disease &mdash; they never experienced it or felt the economic pinch caused by an outbreak.</P>
    <P>However, EC regulations generally have been relaxed, our borders are becoming more open in regard to imports of dead and live meat and this means we will have to be increasingly vigilant.  Even though only one boat a fortnight goes from Greenore, there is always the possibility that there will be an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Britain or elsewhere which would seal borders.  The fund we are discussing this morning compensates exporters for any loss through slaughtering or detention at British ports preventing livestock from reaching their destination.  Exporters will be fully compensated for that.</P>
    <P>Such a fund proved to be an excellent servant to those involved in the sixties and back to the time when it was set up. I am delighted it has been decided to continue it lest it should ever be called into action.  The likelihood of this is not great but one outbreak is sufficient to bring to our minds the dangers of foot-and-mouth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> Before 1940, all livestock exported to Britain were insured by British insurers and the late Paddy Hogan decided that Irish companies should have the benefit of any levies for insurance rather than have all the money go across the water. He initiated the Exported Livestock Insurance Board which was wound up a few months ago.  They fulfilled a useful role and, with the Slaughtered Animals (Compensation) Act and the Detained Animals Act between 1928 and 1938, took care of all the insurance problems and other difficulties experienced at the time.</P>
    <P>Recently we were issued with the CBF annual review for 1985 which gave us very succinctly the position in relation to live cattle exports, particularly to Britain, and it is very pertinent to this Bill.  It would appear from the review that there has been an increase in exports to Britain, particularly in 1985, of live cattle.  This is a reversal of the trend we have been experiencing for many years.  We exported 16,000 head to Britain in 1985, a 68 per cent increase in the numbers exported in 1984.  We hope that trend will continue.  The fund before us and the insurance provided thereby could become all the more important.  There is increasing attention in the EC to greater herd numbers.  Here our beef cow numbers are rising slowly for the first time since the seventies, and even though growth is slow it will continue with the decline in the dairy herd, to be expected because of the super-levy.</P>
    <P>All of us will be happy about the provisions of the Bill.  I am delighted that we are to continue with the cover provided in the Slaughtered Animals Acts, <i>pro tem,</i> but I would urge the Minister, even though he has made provision for winding up this fund if it should become necessary, not to consider doing so because future exports to Britain will increase if we follow the pattern we have seen recently and particularly considering the volatility of the Third World market We have some excellent men operating as trustees on the compensation board, <Col N="828" /> people such as Hugh Walsh, Dan Richardson, Con Horgan, John Cullen, Brendan Dukes and Patrick Lalor.  They have done excellent work, and with the importance of the British market to Irish livestock exporters and the ever present threat of foot-and-mouth outbreaks and the damage that would do to us as an insular agricultural nation, the provisions being made this morning are very wise. All the trade will support the Minister in what he is doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this necessary legislation but I am worried about section 5 which seems to indicate that the existing provisions will be terminated. Why is it necessary to have this section included?  Would a simple order not be possible in the years ahead if the Government wished to terminate the compensation provisions?  The livestock trade is in a serious position.  This is a transition period.  We still have the super-levy and we do not know where we will go from here.</P>
      <P>We have been an EC member for 12 years.  At the beginning we were talking in terms of a cattle herd of seven million and we expressed hopes that we would reach a figure of nine million or ten million by the early nineties.  Now we are fighting desperately to reach the seven million mark.</P>
      <P>When we look back at our history in this regard we have improved our carcases and so on but we must now seriously consider profitability.  Those in the trade have stated in reports on beef production that people involved in it have been making only slender profits in recent years.  As recently as last January beef prices were as high as £1.18 per pound. At present producers have to fight hard to get as much as £1.  That is not satisfactory for producers.  There is increased sheep production and more poultry are being produced.  There has been a reduction in calf and veal production.  Continental animal carcases are now being brought to a higher weight than before and it might make up a little for the fact that we cannot increase cattle numbers as we had anticipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> In relation to cattle exports, there is little joy for us in the accession of Spain and Portugal to the EC.  While a fairly substantial amount of meat will be imported into Spain, most of it will be consumed in the Canary Islands, which is not in the EC, so benefit there will not be great.</P>
    <P>This Bill was necessary certainly in so far as premises were concerned.  It is interesting to note the amount of money provided in previous Acts for compensation for losses incurred as a result of foot and mouth disease in Britain.  Although we are scourged with disease problems, particularly TB and brucellosis, we must be thankful that foot and mouth disease has never come in here.  TB and brucellosis are giving rise for serious concern especially now that there is a reduction in herd testing.  We cannot object to this Bill when we depend on the livestock industry to charter a course for the future of meat production and for farming generally.  We will continue to depend on this industry in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>I would draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that, whereas there has been a vast improvement in recent years in eliminating unlicensed slaughtering of animals and much higher standards of hygiene now prevail in municipal abbatoirs, there is a degree of unlicensed slaughtering of animals in County Limerick.  There is a double danger there.  There is a threat to public safety and health because the slaughterings are not controlled or monitored by medical authorities.  It is also an area developing in the black economy and such activities are not subject to the proper scrutiny and control of the Revenue or tax authorities.  In the context of this Bill, will legislation be introduced to ensure that unlicensed slaughterings of animals is brought quickly under public control for the benefit of the public health and public finances?</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I was impressed by Deputy Doyle's speech.  She reminded me of an old style cattle exporter in the way she reviewed the history of the cattle export trade.  I have great memories of walking to the fairs outside of Mitchelstown and Fermoy, but that was in buoyant times when we had a strong outlet in the UK. We lost that market because of price structures changing, probably for the better.  If that market is opening up again it looks as if something is happening to our livestock industry and pricing is not as attractive in Europe.</P>
      <P>This Bill gives me an opportunity to refer to a serious problem in west Cork where we had a very modern meat plant with a capacity to kill 2,000 cattle per week.  This was one of the finest meat plants in the country but it has now got into difficulties and may have to be sold and a large number of people will be put on the dole queue.  I would have thought we would have had considerable development in that area.  This was a co-operative venture which was very welcome.  A lot of expertise went into the building up of this industry and vast numbers of farmers invested their money in it.  I am disappointed that a substantial amount of the investment put in by the farming community will be lost.  The highest bidder should be allowed purchase that plant.</P>

It is disappointing that we will have politicians meddling in the affairs of the organisation.</P>

      <P>We have an animal disease problem and this Bill enables us to regularise things for exporting and so on.  The Bill introduced many years ago served the country well, but achieving disease free status is now one of our major problems.  We have many new diseases introduced here because of the importation of foreign breeds of cattle. We will further compound the problem if we import calves and small cattle, as was suggested recently.  This would be a retrograde step and we cannot allow it to happen.  It is a pity that we did not renegotiate our derogation with the EC to protect our valuable livestock industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another problem is caused by the cutbacks in the TB eradication scheme.  At the moment we have 6,900 herds locked up and we have identified about 5,000 reactor herds.  This is very serious.  We will have to have a more definite approach to it.  The farming and livestock people have always been co-operative in disease eradication, which has cost millions of pounds.  A lot of blame has been attached to the farming and livestock community.  This is unfair as they have always been co-operative.  However, if we do not have a Government commitment to disease eradication it is unreal to expect the farming community to assist. It is of benefit to the nation to have a disease eradication programme.  A strong Government commitment is needed in this area.  It is a matter of providing the necessary finance for the job.  I appeal to the Minister of State, who is very knowledgeable in the livestock industry, to ensure that the Government have a rethink and will co-operate with the farming organisations and will adhere to the programme of disease eradication that was jointly agreed to eliminate the terrible disease which we have been trying to eradicate since 1950 and which is now <Col N="832" /> more serious than it was ten years ago. I expect that we will get the necessary funding to solve that problem.</P>
    <P>I am greatly concerned that our intervention system is under threat.  We were given a concession in that regard by the EC.  We are the largest exporters of beef in the Community, exporting 50 per cent or more of our beef to third countries with 10 per cent going into intervention. Any tampering with that system will further erode the growth of our livestock industry.  There should be more growth in our suckler herds.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputies who contributed to the debate and tell the House that there is no question of any winding up of the trustees board.  The Bill seeks to bring certain matters up to date.  The trustees who are using the building in the North Circular Road have money to expend and they propose to purchase the premises which will be a source of revenue.  It is agreed that the amount that was paid to the secretary was not realistic.  At this stage there is no question of reintroducing levies.  If we were to wind up the board it would have to be done by way of new legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to tell Deputy Noonan who referred to the GATT that we are as concerned as he is about imports.  We <Col N="833" /> voted against them in Brussels and we will continue to oppose them.  There has been a reduction in imports in recent times and many of the imports into the Community involve calves being shipped to Italy.  It was suggested that the veterinary regulations should be streamlined and I should like to point out that much of that has to do with the declaration of brucelosis free status, with the blue-greys from the west and so on.  However, as Deputy O'Keeffe pointed out, getting our hygiene regulations into line will also cause us further problems.  We have to protect ourselves from the widespread import of calves.  While there has not been a demand for such imports I can see it posing a problem in the future because of the high price of calves here and the comparatively low price in the UK.  Huge numbers of high quality calves are on offer in the UK while few calves are on offer for the many customers here.  As Deputy Leonard pointed out when we are talking about cattle at £1 per lb we are talking about the top of the market. Some of the top people in the market are saying that this is the limit to which they can afford to go.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure the House that we will defend intervention in the strongest possible way because we believe it is the keystone of CAP.  We are in favour of the development of export refunds which have helped to promote our exports.  Deputy Prendergast mentioned the slaughtering of animals in unlicensed slaughtering premises and I should like to tell him that legislation to deal with that will be before the House shortly.</P>
    <P>I will not apologise to anybody for being involved in the livestock industry locally.  I live in the area, I am a shareholder in the industry and I canvassed for shares for it.  I am part of that scene.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is an attempt to end the five year debate which commenced with the preparation of the Telesis report and the NESC report which indicated the direction our industrial policy would take in the coming decade. I wish to comment on the performance of the Industrial Development Authority since its inception in 1952.  At that time the formation of the Authority was opposed by the Opposition.  However, its formation was a very important step forward in the history of industrial development.</P>
      <P>Some of the proposals, targets and objectives set out then are still relevant and important today.  It is interesting to read what the then Minister, Deputy Morrissey, said on Second Stage, that the Government were certain that in the national interest the development of industry should not be left to follow a course set by the unco-ordinated activities of individuals, companies and groups working to cater for market requirements as termed by themselves.  That was the most important aspect of the Bill.  The Government saw the need for specialised autonomous organisation and they set up the IDA to advise and assist the Government in the intensification of industrial development on the best possible lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary function of the Authority, therefore, was in planning new industries, bringing forward proposals and schemes for the creation and development of industry and the expansion and modernisation of existing industries.  In 1952 we also saw the enactment of the Undeveloped Areas Act which gave an advantage to certain parts of the country. In the context of the wider European development since the early seventies one could justifiably make a case for the extension of disadvantaged areas to all parts of this country when one compares it with Europe.  Nonetheless, the idea was that industrial firms should undertake the establishment of factories in undeveloped areas and this was of particular advantage to the less well off parts of the country. <Col N="838" /> Of course the eastern part of the country is still the best place for industrial development in its proximity to the European market but all parts of the country have benefited.</P>
    <P>The 1952 Act established An Foras Tionscail and their special powers included the ability to acquire land either by agreement or compulsion.  They were also empowered to set up advance factories, grant aid people to acquire land, and to give 50 per cent of the cost of plant and machinery, training and so on.  This was all extremely important in the development of industries.  There were a series of amendments to the legislation in 1959 when a new industrial development Bill was introduced which provided for an expanded and more sophisticated structure for industrial promotion.  The expertise and functions of An Foras Tionscail were merged with the Industrial Development Authority which would be outside the Civil Service for staffing purposes only.  Incentives were included in the Bill to equalise the advantages which industry might have in any one part of the country over another.  Industry has developed in a series of stages, very quickly in the fifties and sixties.  The Authority now have to compete with much more sophisticated similar-type job creating organisations in more developed countries than us and, consequently, policy had to be reviewed for the eighties and nineties.</P>
    <P>In July 1984 the Government published their response to the Telesis report, an investigative study into industry, which has and will have very serious implications for the development and growth of industry and investment in it in the future.  The other submissions included the comments of NESC on Telesis and the IDA's strategic plan for 1983 to 1993. The Government recognised the need to give a new impetus to industrial development and faced the daunting task of job creation in the turbulent economic environment of the eighties.  They also had to take account of the nineties and well into the next century.  The White Paper set out what it perceived as the main industrial challenges facing us in the eighties and nineties.  There is slow <Col N="839" /> growth internationally relevant to that of the sixties and seventies.  Competition in the marketplace is far more intense.  We have to be far more cost effective and competitive to ensure our survival.</P>
    <P>The mobile investment market on which Ireland has traditionally been heavily dependent will not be growing as fast as it did some years ago.  The cost therefore of attracting a greater level of mobile investment will be higher and will need a greater degree of sophistication and investigation on the much wider market scene.</P>
    <P>The Minister set out the main objectives for industrial policy as specified in the White Paper.  The White Paper suggests three key direction changes.  This has arisen because there are strong compelling arguments for the development of industry along the lines set out by the experts in this field.  The first suggestion is the selectivity in granting State aid to industry with particular support for linkage development and import substitution. We have heard a great deal about import substitution and the products which are on sale in our markets but which could be produced at home.  This demands very careful consideration and should attract investment to change that trend.  If that cannot be achieved the possibility of our being able to provide key indigenous projects will be under attack. A new policy direction would be the movement away from investment in fixed assets and instead towards market research and development and so on.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the orientation of overseas investment projects which are capable of self sustainment in both business activities and manufacturing projects.  A wide range of policy measures designed to achieve the desired objective was specified as follows &mdash; closer monitoring, closer control, new industrial relations guidelines and action on absenteeism.  This is a very important area.  Recently I was in contact with an industrialist who has returned from Europe.  To a large extent he has been able to control the level of absenteeism by vigilance on the part of management. <Col N="840" /> It was a pleasure to see the way that industry functioned, providing 100 permanent and 50 additional jobs.  That type of control and approach should be encouraged. Many jobs are lost because there appears to be some type of barrier between employers and management on the one hand and workers and trade unions on the other.  It is only now, when we have such a high level of unemployment, that people are beginning to realise that they must change their attitude towards work practices.</P>
    <P>Companies must be updated technologically and there must be a much greater investment in marketing.  Financial aids to assist companies in these areas are essential.  This is particularly true in the meat processing area.  Earlier this morning we were dealing with a Bill relating to compensation for slaughtered animals and related problems.  We have relied far too heavily on intervention in the meat processing business without taking into account how to present products in a more acceptable way to the consumer. We are learning from experience when we see how imported goods are presented by producers who do not have the same advantages as our producers; yet, these foreign producers are able to take a share of our market.</P>
    <P>The IDA small industries programme has been fully regionalised and great credit is due to the Minister, the Minister of State and the Department who ensured that this development took place.  I would like to comment on this programme because therein lies the greatest possibility for future job creation. Recently I had a communication from the Minister in connection with the establishment of additional small industries throughout the country creating a small number of jobs, about 128 or 130 jobs, real sustainable jobs.  From the Minister's speech it was obvious that all those companies exceeded the target set. If the target set was 15, they employed up to 25, while others with targets of ten employed 12 or 13, with the possibility of additional growth.  That is encouraging and demands additional investment by <Col N="841" /> the State particularly to ensure that these small companies will be assisted in carrying out the necessary market research. This Bill provides for that and for that reason alone is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The national linkage is particularly focused on the electronics sector which has been launched under the auspices of the IDA.  It is designed to maximise the level of raw materials and services, linking overseas and indigenous industries by bringing together potential purchasers and suppliers.  The recently enacted National Development Corporation will act as a State vehicle for investment in productive enterprises.  That is one of the reasons why I was pleased to see the evolution of the National Development Corporation within the lifetime of this Government.  People may have the doubts about the ability of the corporation to come up with the level of jobs which one feels is possible, but nevertheless it will provide equity capital rather than than having firms pay high interest rates. Hopefully that money will be used effectively, will be properly monitored and will be successful in meeting the challenge of job creation which we have to face in the eighties and nineties.  There is no easy formula for success.</P>
    <P>The Department's role as the primary policy making body is reaffirmed in this legislation, and that is to be welcomed.  I realise that the Government of themselves cannot create jobs.  They can creat the climate for job creation but the ultimate responsibility if there is an abuse of taxpayer's money must lie with the Minister.  Therefore it is important that he holds on to that function.  A linkage team consisting of representatives of Government Departments and chief executives of semi-State bodies has been established to ensure speedy and co-ordinated implementation of policy.  That too is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Bill will provide an opportunity for reviewing the jobs created and maintained, the cost of these jobs in relation to their output, the productivity and growth of these jobs, the rate of industrial investment, the share of the domestic market on the one hand and the overseas market on the other, and the value being <Col N="842" /> added to the product.  That is vital.  We hear much about value added; therein lies the key to industrial promotion and growth.  Even now we export a considerable number of cattle on the hoof.  Sides of beef are being exported but they are not boned or properly marketed to cater for markets that are crying out for good quality products.  In the Bill there is a provision with regard to monitoring weaknesses in industry and endeavouring to provide remedies.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Industrial Policy promoted by the Minister has been an effective instrument in determining our development and the manner in which we will grow from the industrial point of view.  Of course is has not been without criticism.  It has been suggested there is a specific lack of policy instruments to achieve the stated objectives, particularly in relation to developing indigenous industries in the agricultural sector and finding added value for these products.  Recently I read in a document from the NIHE, Limerick, of somebody who was given a major award for producing a quality cheese.  Production of such a commodity could eliminate some of our cheese imports.  That is the kind of value added that is required.</P>
    <P>For a long time we have done little to develop our forestries.  I hope the National Development Corporation will invest in private and State forests so that we can develop in this area.  Up to 10,000 jobs could be created within a short period if we developed this important national resources.  If we have to sell off State forests let us do so provided we get a good return so that we may reinvest to ensure further growth.  There is nothing wrong with that.  We should not be put off by comments that the State is selling off this valuable resource to private individuals who will make a profit while the taxpayer will lose.  We should not put this idea in the minds of taxpayers because nothing could be further from the truth. I am certain the Government would not subscribe to that type of policy.</P>
    <P>The White Paper has been criticised because it has not set out specifically how <Col N="843" /> it will attract overseas industries that have key business functions.  If an industry comes here and offers 1,000 jobs there should be an equivalent number of jobs in the service area.  The White Paper has been faulted by the trade union movement because of its lack of emphasis on job creation and the high Exchequer cost of our industrial policy.  It has not tackled that point.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper a series of major schemes have been suggested including marketing and a national linkage programme.  The latter is very important. If an industry setting up here has to import raw materials that is a big loss to the State.  Linking up will be to the advantage of companies.  Arising from the linkage programme there will be a company development approach.  There is also the matter of technology acquisition grants and the regionalisation of the small industries programme which is well in train.</P>
    <P>The NDC have the specific remit of investing in and developing indigenous industries and that is to be welcomed. With regard to the alleged lack of emphasis on job creation, we realise that any major increase in net manufacturing employment is going against the international trend which has seen a continuous erosion in industrial employment in recent years.  In all the European democracies, in America, Canada and even in Japan, they are experiencing the greatest difficulty in maintaining growth and employment.  By comparison we are a poor country and we do not have their resources and consequently it will be more difficult for us.  There is no easy solution with regard to the unemployment problem, irrespective of what the so-called experts may think.</P>
    <P>The Opposition Party may claim they have a formula for job creation about which the Government know nothing. The man in the street may think that formula is viable but he is misled if he thinks it is possible in the short term.  I regret to say I do not believe it is possible, even though I should like to think otherwise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="844" /> Inflation has been reduced considerably in the period this Government have been in office and this has been an important contribution so far as industry is concerned in that undertakings are now much more competitive.  I say to industrialists that this has been of great advantage to them.</P>
    <P>The concessions given with regard to PRSI in the last budget should attract people back to work.  I agree there is a disincentive to work because of the high levels of taxation, whether industrial taxation, PRSI or the levies.  These have had the effect of creating a disincentive for people to obtain jobs.  In addition, there is the point that once a person is in a job it is exceedingly difficult to get rid of him. That matter has to be looked at if we are serious about creating sustainable jobs.</P>
    <P>I was heartened to read this week in a national newspaper a call for an economic forum in connection with the economy. Trade unions, business people, the Government and other groups all have a formula but in many cases they do not appear to be sustainable.  Let them together formulate a policy with which the Government would be obliged to stay even though it may be politically suicidal to continue along certain lines.  If the people are convinced that a Government would act sensibly, positively and effectively on their behalf, the rating of politicians would rise.</P>
    <P>Investment in industry is of the order of £720 million.  I do not think it can go much further with regard to tax incentives and so on to stimulate industrial growth.  We have legislation on the stocks in relation to strikes which I shall be watching carefully.  If it makes it easier for people to go on strike and to disrupt industry we will be on the slippery slope. I would support the protection of workers where there was unjust treatment but where there is an attempt on behalf of workers or management to destroy, that must be totally resisted by the Government.</P>
    <P>Linkage appears to be the key to new manufacturing employment.  The IDA have been given a specific responsibility <Col N="845" /> here.  I am pleased to note that Dr. William Chambers has been appointed to spearhead the programme in the electronics sector.</P>
    <P>Another area of great potential is the health care sector.  At present we have a most unsatisfactory position in which only 33 per cent of industry inputs are manufactured locally.  If that could be changed the spin-off effects from the purchasers of the important firms attracted to Ireland would be attained within Ireland. This is an area in which we can make a strong contribution.</P>
    <P>Recently the OECD suggested that a strong growth occasioned by export orientated foreign firms was not creating significant linkages to indigenous industry in this country.  If we are to create sustainable jobs that situation must change.  Therefore, the new selective approach to State aid which is incorporated in this Bill is the most important change in industrial policy arising from the White Paper.  In other words, we will not continue putting good money after bad money.  There will be a much closer examination of how industries are developing. The Government have introduced a whole range of services and incentives geared largely towards the encouragement and development of the indigenous industrial sector but has that been matched by an equivalent growth in employment? I do not think so.  It is a matter of concern that we should be putting taxpayers' money into industry and not getting a return.</P>
    <P>In a book by Owen O'Malley on the performance of Irish indigenous industry in the eighties, the analysis for industrial growth is very pessimistic.  Mr. O'Malley is not a politician.  He is merely viewing matters as he sees them developing.  He criticises indigenous industry on the basis that it has failed to take account of the changes necessary for the inevitable competition of the late eighties and the nineties. This is true particularly of the agricultural sector though the dairying sector at least is endeavouring by way of investment to come to grips with that competition.  Mr. O'Malley suggests that Irish indigenous industry has remained <Col N="846" /> dormant while foreign industry has expanded and thrived.</P>
    <P>In another book by Kennedy and Healy the question of small industry in Ireland is dealt with.  The authors are clearly of the view that our real future lies in investment in and development of small industry.  They make some very important comments.  They point out that small firms have represented good value for State money and have had an impressive record in the generation of employment in recent years.  As the Minister said recently in some instances there have been growth rates of 50 per cent and sometimes up to 100 per cent above the projected target in the small industry sector.  Kennedy and Healy say that small industry is the only sector of industry in which employment has increased within existing firms between 1973 and 1980. That increase was 22 per cent.  Another important statistic is that the cost per job in small industry is 40 per cent lower than the amounts being given to some of the multinationals.  The small industry programme has been successful by comparison with other programmes and has a less capital intensive way of providing jobs.  Kennedy and Healy indicate the importance of joint marketing and the need for a greater co-ordinated regional support effort to encourage the development of small industries.  That is being done and I congratulate the Government on embarking on that programme.  I trust it will have the success it deserves.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the number of small firm creations will be fewer if the selectivity grants criteria are introduced. In a book dealing with the import dependence of the Irish economy in terms of implications for industrial policy, statistics produced by Grey and Kelly suggest that import penetration in the manufacturing sector increased by 6 per cent between 1977 and 1980.  There are people who suggest that we return to the pre-1972 position and embark on a degree of protectionism but Grey and Kelly oppose that view totally.  They say that protectionism is not the answer and suggest that a move to industries is less vulnerable to competition from low cost countries. <Col N="847" /> They say that a much greater level of investment should be made available for research, development, marketing and for the gathering of information regarding the level of imports and on how these imports might be substituted locally. Basically, that is the thrust of the Bill we are discussing.</P>
    <P>The IDA in their industrial plan for 1978 to 1982 set a target of 68,000 new jobs in firms backed by the authority. During the period of the plan that target was achieved to the extent of 87 per cent. However, the 1980-81 performance was below expectations.  In the 1978-79 period the great majority of the new jobs were in the services area, in the public service particularly.  The cost of paying for these jobs has been much too high. In the past three and a half years the Government have been endeavouring to reduce that level while trying to maintain the same quality of service though with a reduction of 8,000 people.  We should all like the State to be able to employ the maximum number of people possible but when employment is not planned, as was the case in those earlier years of the 1978 to 1982 programme, the effects are disastrous. Any attempt, therefore, to embark on a job creation programme of that kind in the future should be resisted strongly.  In 1983-84 the downward trend continued despite ever-increasing output growth.  Total employment in Irish manufacturing has declined since December 1977.  The growth of 16,000 between December 1977 and December 1979 has been off-set by a net decline in the subsequent years as the international recession took its toll of weaker industries.</P>
    <P>On 26 November 1985 in reply to Deputy MacSharry, the Minister pointed out that the overall target set for job creation in the White Paper on Industrial Policy is in the growth of manufacturing employment of between 3,000 and 6,000 jobs per year.  That would seem to be a very ambitious target in the light of past trends both here and in other countries. The Minister added that all Government agencies concerned with manufacturing, whether in the investment export or technical <Col N="848" /> export areas were being required to use their resources in such a way as to ensure the achievement of these targets in the ten year period of application of the White Paper.  One gathers from that reply that there will not be any significant increase in manufacturing employment in Ireland during the next decade.  There are about 240,000 people unemployed and having regard to the sort of target to which I have just referred, there is no point in trying to convince these people that we will be able to create the necessary jobs.  There is a new found socialist theory that it is preferable to have people working as opposed to their being on the dole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is preferable that people would be at work but jobs cannot be sustained in the absence of a level of profitability.  No one can continue to survive on an overdraft.  The day of reckoning is reached eventually.  The taxpayer is crying out for reductions in taxation levels because a small select number of people appear to be carrying the burden throughout the economy and Governments have lacked the stomach to tackle that problem.  That type of projection must be regretted.  There are a number of problems that apply.  Based on the analysis in the Telesis report the average cost per job between 1978-1984 was £15,790.  It costs £19,860 per new job in major industry and £8,000 for each new job in small industry.  Obviously the cost of producing jobs in smaller industry is far lower.  A sectoral breakdown of these costs is also interesting.  The cost per job in the chemical engineering international services is £16,000; in the food, drink and tobacco industry, £18,000 in the traditional sectors of clothing, timber and footwear &mdash; the intensive areas &mdash; about £14,500.  These figures do not make very good reading for the taxpayer.  If we were to give these people the money we might be better off but of course there is a service involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures are not just picked out <Col N="849" /> of the hat.  They are based on a survey of 6,500 firms in the period 1978 to 1984. They are reasonably accurate.  The cost of providing one job lies somewhere between £20,000 in the bigger units to less than £10,000 in the smaller units. This is why the new policy is directed towards the latter.</P>
    <P>The IDA have achieved much since their establishment in 1952.  They have also been criticised &mdash; and perhaps rightly so &mdash; especially when the Telesis report was published.  However, the recent White Paper has vindicated the IDA's efforts in trying to achieve additional jobs.  Their 1984 annual reports states that a turning point has been reached in the fortunes of industry in Ireland.  I am not yet clear as to what exactly is meant by that conclusion and how fortunes have changed in regard to unemployment.</P>
    <P>The managing director of the IDA, Mr. White, has welcomed the new White Paper on Industrial Policy.  He knows exactly what is involved in job creation. In a recent interview in the August-September issue of <i>Industry &amp; Commerce</i> he states that the main impact of the industry of the future will be spending more on what it buys into the company in terms of goods and services than the company will actually spend on a direct wage bill. He further suggests that the concept of value-added to the Irish economy is uppermost in the strategy to meet the demands of the White Paper and the national plan.  He goes on to state that the essence of industrial policy is that it recognises that the direct manufacturing workforce will increase only marginally in the coming years as a result of automation, technology, competition and sub-contracting.  That is the view of the &ldquo;prince&rdquo; of job creation through the IDA.</P>
    <P>If we are saying that the majority of jobs and the greatest economic impact will lie outside the factory through the extra wealth which the manufacturing company can generate and spend within the economy, then the key question is: what economic value added is left within the country?  The public, however, will continue to judge the effectiveness of the <Col N="850" /> IDA by their ability to create more jobs each year than the number of jobs lost and their ability to reduce the numbers on the live register.  Even though 9,870 first-time jobs were created in 1984, nonetheless when job losses were taken into account we arrived at a net loss of 7,900 jobs.  The IDA justifiably talked about a turning point in fortunes, given these figures.  The national economic plan suggests that under the new industrial policy manufacturing employment will rise by 2,227 by 1987.  Can that target be realistically achieved now?  I do not believe it can.  From projections, it seems that the IDA can inject about 10,000 firsttime jobs per annum into the economy, at the most optimistic.  Any recession will reduce that figure.  If they succeeded in generating 10,000 per annum that would generate a further 10,000 jobs in the service sector, giving an overall increase of 20,000.</P>
    <P>This Bill is important in that it consolidates all existing industrial development legislation into one comprehensive code. The Minister might elaborate on how he intends to implement section 4.  A detailed and objective analysis of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the designated and non-designated areas is essential if designation is to be used as a more flexible policy instrument for the future.  The Minister has commissioned the NESC to prepare a report on the whole question of designation and I hope this will have the effect of not allowing people to concentrate in certain areas, thereby causing many problems.  That has happened in the major cities, particularly in Dublin, where there is a far greater level of poverty than there would be in many of the other urban areas.  People living in rural communities want to see industry brought back and this can be done through the small industries programme.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for periodic reviews of national industrial performance.  The Dáil should be made aware of what is happening in that area.  Section 11 deals with the future role of the IDA, which will be to act under the direction of the Minister.  That is a change, but it is only <Col N="851" /> right that a Minister should retain a certain level of discretion and authority to direct the IDA in a certain way.  The Department are re-establishing their primary role in regard to the formulation, evaluation and monitoring of industrial policy, including sectoral policy as set out in the White Paper.  Furthermore it confirms that the IDA, together with other agencies, such as the IIRS, Córas Trachtála have executive responsibility for the implementation of industrial policy devised at Government level.  That constitutes a new power being given to the IDA.  The functions of the IDA should also reflect national concern about the gravity of the present unemployment situation.  The ultimate focus of industrial development must be on net job creation in the manufacturing and service areas. In this regard the IDA have a vital role to play.  As politicians, as Government backbenchers, we are answerable to the electorate, just as the IDA will be answerable to the Government and the Government to backbenchers in that regard.  We want to see proper return from the high level of investment in this area.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the triennial review of national industrial performance. There is provision for selective criteria under which the authority would provide grant assistance to industry in respect of fixed assets, leasing grants, rent subsidy grants.</P>
    <P>I have here a recent newsletter of the Confederation of Irish Industry, dated 12 November 1985.  It is interesting to note what they have to say under the heading: &ldquo;Lower industrial electricity prices necessary to protect employment&rdquo;.  I might draw the Minister's attention to some of the remarks contained in that article, and here I quote:</P>
    <P>The Government recognised the concern of industry as far back as 1983 regarding high electricity prices and consequently established a major Government inquiry into the situation in that year.  However, over twelve months have elapsed since the report was completed and only one minor <Col N="852" /> adjustment &mdash; a reduction of 2-6 per cent has been made.  The report contained a very detailed analysis of the reasons for high electricity tariffs for industry in Ireland.  The Confederation would strongly urge that the Government take immediate steps to reduce cost impositions on the ESB within its own control in order to ensure that the serious competitive weakness of high industrial electricity prices is eliminated. International competition is ferocious.</P>
    <P>One would have to agree with that comment because there is such sophistication in competition for the same markets.  This article continued on to say:</P>
    <P>As one major Irish exporter stated recently, &ldquo;it's dog eat dog and survival of the fittest in a way that Darwin never imagined&rdquo;.  It is for this reason that every firm needs to minimise its costs in order to remain in a competitive position, retain market share and arrive at decent profit margins.  Firms can negotiate better raw material contracts, they can modernise their equipment, they can produce more with less man hours but, unfortunately, Irish firms are finding that they are up against an uncontrollable obstacle, one which they cannot overcome, one which only Government action can alleviate: the large differential in energy costs in Ireland when compared to those prevailing in other EEC countries and indeed the world at large. Production costs for Irish firms suffer most markedly under the heading &ldquo;Energy&rdquo;, particularly where most Irish exporters find themselves paying from 20 to 40 per cent more than their European counterparts.</P>
    <P>It is clear that Irish industry is getting a raw deal on electricity prices and this was confirmed by the Committee of Inquiry into Electricity Prices.</P>
    <P>Surely that constitutes a level of unfair competition?  The fact that other countries can subsidise energy costs means that we operate at a distinct disadvantage in that regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" /> In the context of investment, in terms of expertise and taxpayers' money, in an endeavour to render industry competitive, the Minister should carry out a critical analysis of the report of the Confederation of Irish Industry.  It would be of considerable importance to do so.</P>
    <P>I hope the provisions of the Bill will far exceed expectations.  There is a particularly difficult period ahead in terms of employment.  We do not appear to have been able to make any real, positive effort in controlling or reducing the level of unemployment.  I thought we were perhaps near the point of holding its present level so that in better times we could hope for the creation of additional jobs.  But because of the automated, technological advances made in industry we must now live with a much higher level of unemployment than would have been entertained, say, 20 years ago.  In the course of the 1977 general election campaign the present Opposition added somewhat to the general confusion in that they were advocating a large scale industrial promotion and job creation programme that many people thought was achievable.  It was not.  There was heavy borrowing for that purpose.  We are now paying the price in terms of £2,500 million of taxpayers' money to service the debt, not necessarily created by that programme but which was created over a period. That is the dilemma in which the present Minister for Finance finds himself.  I hope he will have some good news for us this afternoon, I am anticipating good news. We must face the electorate, if not in the short term&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and his Minister of State on the manner in which they and their officials have committed <Col N="854" /> themselves to arrive at what I regard as a very useful Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I must say I was disappointed when the Government White Paper on Industrial Policy was published in July 1984.  The provisions of this Bill give effect to the proposals of that White Paper.  Hence, I am disappointed with the Bill itself.</P>
      <P>Deputies on this side of the House &mdash; and, I am sure, others too &mdash; were hopeful that with unemployment now standing at almost 250,000 the introduction of this Bill would have an impact on the present level of unemployment.  The provisions of this Bill talk about the creation of between 3,000 and 6,000 net manufacturing jobs per annum as being totally inadequate. This demonstrates the failure of the Government to attract investment in manufacturing industry.  The relevant figure for 1983 represented a drop of 13,000 jobs in that sector, clearly demonstrating the failure of the Government to date to attract investment.</P>
      <P>One objective voiced in conjunction with the publication of this Bill was that the National Development Corporation would play a role in the co-ordination of the commercial semi-State bodies and become involved in job creation.  I do not foresee that the provisions of the Bill will lead to the National Development Corporation having any real involvement in job creation, or that it constitutes a task that could not have been undertaken by the National Enterprise Agency which had formerly undertaken that task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the White Paper, I am concerned that some of the industries that previously would have been supported by the IDA will no longer be eligible for grant aid.  I notice a bias against the west in that the Bill and the White Paper lay great emphasis on high technology, export based products and import substitution.  It is unseemly, when we are losing a great number of manufacturing jobs in the western region in what we call the designated areas, that such a high emphasis should be placed on the technological area.  By all means I would like to see small business becoming involved <Col N="855" /> in technology and in export markets, but the first concern is that there should be help for small, local entrepreneurs who would eventually become strong enough to become involved in the export market and in high technology.  At least while innovation and development are occurring in any of the designated areas they should be supported fully by the IDA and by the county development teams, who up to now have been doing an admirable job in supporting them.</P>
    <P>One welcome feature in the Bill as regards national and domestic policy is the aspiration to contain our domestically generated inflation.  The Government are doing a good job on that, we all agree; but I am vague about some of the other recommendations, particularly where the Government state in the Bill and in the White Paper that conditions must exist to reward risk, investment and innovation.  I agree totally with that aspiration but I find in the Bill a great deal of contradiction to it, especially with regard to the IDA's involvement in the west.  We all want incentives to encourage a faster rate of growth than would otherwise occur, according to the White Paper, but the emphasis is the worrying thing.</P>
    <P>The breakown of targets between native industry and foreign industry is not spelled out in the Bill.  The White Paper has none of the detailed targets that had been set previously by Governments and Ministers of the day, so there is very little by which to measure performance.  The White Paper proposes to terminate the re-equipment grants.  I feel that they should be given on a selective basis possibly restricted to certain areas, but I cannot understand why a decision would be made to abolish them completely.</P>
    <P>Another cause for concern is the section that deals with the need for competitiveness. The whole area of how reduced electricity prices for industry would be dealt with is not spelled out here.  That issue is fudged in the Bill and we do not know the Government's intentions in this area.  Perhaps the Government have not agreed completely on policy as regards electricity prices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> Another area of the Bill that is disappointing is the section that should be dealing with natural resources.  There is very little mention of marine resources. The paragraph on forestry is very ambivalent. We can only take it that the Department of Fisheries and Forestry will continue to retain the management of our forestry resources as there is no mention in the Bill of any possibility of a semi-State body dealing with their development. The very important question of bog development in the western area has not been dealt with.  In my constituency the Government and Bord na Móna have spent much money on developing the Derryfadda bogs.  Now Bord na Móna are paying £4.5 million each year on loan charges and the only thing that has been done there is a road made into the bog to be developed.  Really we are talking about dead money being paid back with no employment or development there.</P>
    <P>The same is true for the sugar industry. The Government have not given the resources to the Sugar Company &mdash; they have admitted this &mdash; to provide capital for our four sugar factories.  One reason why at this time of the year two more sugar factories are laying off workers, in the case of Thurles for a month and in the case of Tuam for two months, is that that type of capital investment has not been made into those factories.  That should be dealt with in this Bill and the White Paper should deal with the development of our natural resources.  I ask the Minister to look particularly at those two areas: the development of our bogs and of our sugar industry, which is basically the development of our food industry.  We had a discussion in the House yesterday on the need for strong emphasis on our food industry.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the designated areas. We have an imbalance between the various areas of this country.  We have an EC concern about regional disparities, yet this Bill indicates no intent in regard to what the Government would do about that.  Regional policy is important.  The type of help given by the IDA and the county development teams in the past should be continued.  If the selectivity <Col N="857" /> for grants which was mentioned here is implemented, the situation of the counties in the designated areas will be bleak. For example, if grant assistance is to be confined now to firms who satisfy certain criteria, how will the designated areas be affected?  We are told that firms now will get assistance if they produce products for sale primarily on the overseas markets. Again we are back to emphasis on exports.  I should like the Minister to consider small firms being helped on to their feet with the hope that they would export when strong enough and I would see an important role in this for CTT.  At present small industries are fighting a case with the IDA and the Department of Finance. CTT are brought in at a very late stage and they should be brought in right from the start.  Firms may be able to get advanced technology if given a chance and the Minister should consider this.</P>
    <P>One section of the Bill dealing with import substitution gives the impression that the onus of proof will be on the firms seeking grant assistance.  They are being put in a very difficult, almost impossible situation if they have to prove that the product is based on import substitution. I should like greater assistance to be given by the various agencies in making that kind of information available to small industries.</P>
    <P>Obviously this Bill will pass because the Government have a majority, but what would have been the situation if it had come in ten years ago?  Would projects that have been grant-aided in the past ten years have obtained any assistance at all?  We have new criteria now on the selectivity of grants.  As other Deputies have mentioned, we should look at the actual cost to the Exchequer rather than the job losses that would have resulted if projects had not been eligible.</P>
    <P>The areas to be helped by these new proposals in the White Paper and the Bill will include Dublin where there is very high unemployment and areas where there are serious job losses, such as Cork, Waterford and Limerick.  Naturally, we would welcome the creation of jobs where they are needed.  We had in the <Col N="858" /> past a towns grouping system within every county, with a jobs target.  This was very successful and measured how areas could be helped.  For example, there could be the provision of IDA land and advance factories, which would help an area or a group of towns to provide the necessary employment.</P>
    <P>Regarding the designated areas, in eight of those 13 counties there are no third level colleges.  This is important in the context of the use of technology.  We might consider also the infrastructural problems of those designated counties. Will there by any incentive to offset the extra transport costs arising in the western counties because of their distance from our markets and from ports?  Any attempt made in the west of Ireland to improve the infrastructure &mdash; and transport in particular &mdash; appears to be looked at very cynically.  One has only to consider the Connacht Regional Airport to illustrate my point.  That development in County Mayo for the Connacht region will be of immense benefit, especially if we can get the type of development which has happened at Shannon and in other industrial estates.  All credit is due to those who have been involved for a long time in trying to provide that type of infrastructure and that transport access which is needed.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset that unemployment is a very serious problem with us, the figure reaching nearly 250,000. It is particularly acute in the west and the figures give great cause for concern.  I am sure that the Minister saw an article in a newspaper last Sunday which reported on a football team from Lettermore, Connemara, which had won a junior championship title some years ago.  Half of that team have emigrated and it has been estimated that 200 people have left the parish of Lettermore.  That is a new phenomenon in that area, on top of the serious unemployment experience there. There is need for a special approach to the development of the designated areas and we could look at what has been done in other EC countries.  In the UK I understand that three categories were named for assistance under the original policy <Col N="859" /> there.  There are special development grants, development grants and intermediate grants.  We might consider some system like that, rather than selectivity grants, as mentioned in this Bill, for certain areas.</P>
    <P>In the North of Ireland, there is a local enterprise development unit with a staff of 72 people.  In 1984 they were able to commit a total of £18 million to help small business people.  That is a most welcome development.  I appeal to the Minister to have the same type of approach to our county development teams, to give them more discretionary powers rather than less.  They are being undermined with the publication of this Bill.  I welcome the fact that recently the level of grants through those teams has been increased.  When I compare the situation here with that in the North of Ireland and the UK, I notice that in those countries half the grant is paid to a small company when they are approved and the other half is paid at a later stage, perhaps six months or a year later.  Here one has to spend the money and come back with one's receipts to the county development team and try to get the 60 per cent paid as quickly as possible. There could be a better way of doing that if we look at what is done in other countries.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;track record&rdquo; is always used by the IDA and by the county development teams when people come to them for assistance.  I do not believe that the track record is as important as it is madeout to be.  It is probably more important that the business is not involved in over-production of an item or product.  It is also important that the commitment of the people gets through to the IDA personnel or the county development team involved.  If we spent all our time looking up records we would never start any business.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will tell the House what has been happening since the regionalisation of the IDA. We were hoping for more prompt decisions from them in regard to regional projects, but that has not been happening: small industrialists <Col N="860" /> are still being referred to head office for final decisions.  As well, although they have got their IDA grants they are unable to get loan assistance.  We do not have an ICC office in the west and small industrialists there must go either to Limerick or Dublin to get loans at favourable interest rates after receiving IDA grants.  This problem is caused by lack of co-operation between the two bodies.  If such co-operation existed we could have earlier decisions.</P>
    <P>There has been publicity about the way the associated banks should be helping small business people and about involving them in the provision of risk capital for small industry.  During the Christmas holidays I was amazed to hear that banks are now imposing what they call money transition charges.  The matter was referred to particularly on the Gay Byrne Hour on RTE radio.  Apparently they charge 12p on each cheque they receive for cashing.  That may not seem to be much, but when it is added up it comes to a sizeable sum, which the banks can invest.  That 12p can also be aggregated with charges on bank drafts, cheque cards, travellers' cheques, copies of statements, credit transfers standing orders and the Government duty of 7p per cheque.  All these charges militate particularly against small industries.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the Minister for Finance introduces the budget this afternoon he will take into consideration many of the problems being faced by industrialists in the designated areas.  There is great concern about the provision of new jobs and manufacturing employment.  Many of our traditional industries like textiles, clothing, footwear, furniture, printing and motor assembly have declined.  Food processing is growing, showing some growth, but that level of growth is disappointing in an agricultural country.  I should have liked to have seen in this Bill more commitment to the food industry and more investment incentive in that industry so that there could be greater development of our natural resources, and more employment.  I had hoped that the Bill would help employment generally. On the contrary, it can be summed <Col N="861" /> up in the final section which states that the Bill will not involve any increased costs to the Exchequer or the recruitment of additional staff.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take into consideration the very good work being done by the county development teams and the good framework being laid down by the IDA at local level.  I hope he will try to have more co-ordination between the ICC and the IDA, particularly in regard to loan facilities, in the interest of job creation.  The Minister must give a particular commitment to small industries in their early years before they can graduate to more advanced technology and marketing. It would be very difficult to expect small industrialists to aspire to these in their early years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as an attempt to introduce an effective policy on new industrial employment. The editor of one of the great English newspapers, J. L. Garvin, said that opinions are free but facts are sacred. One of the things that has saddened me since I became a TD is that I have listened to Deputies here talking on subjects on which obviously they have not done any proper research.  There is an obligation on every Deputy contributing to a debate to study the facts before starting to pontificate on every subject from theology to toothache.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Deputy Dowling earlier admonishing the trade union movement on the need for unions to adopt a more up-to-date attitude to industrial policy.  I have the greatest and warmest personal affection for him but I suggest he should have done more research into the relationship between the trade union movement and industry.  I worked in an industry in Limerick for 30 years.  You could be sacked there at a minute's notice: you did not even get your second week's holidays.  All one got was a Mass card and a bed rest in Barrington's Hospital from one's employer.  In the fifties the owner of Shaws factory in Limerick stood outside the gate at 8.5 a.m., when times were bad and counted the men who were late and told them to go home.  That was <Col N="862" /> the policy of employers here.  This is very important in this Bill.  Due to the action of the trade union movement today we have protection from unfair dismissal, a measure brought in by a Coalition Government, a five day, 40 hour week, proper holidays and entitlement to representation in grievance procedures.  Up to the time when that industrial policy was introduced as a result of Deputy Sweetman's outlook, the policies here were barbarian and primitive on both sides of the social divide.  No more than other human institutions the trade union movement have not a monopoly on morality. They have to fight their own corner. Some people will dishonour the noble objectives of the trade union movement but by and large the trade union movement has made a magnificent and worthwhile contribution to the development of civilised attitudes.</P>
    <P>When I hear people talking about strikes and what causes them, I would point out that the most up-to-date figures indicate that for every day lost through strikes 30 days are lost through absenteeism. I spoke to one of the top sociologists last Monday morning about the need to have a survey on the causes of absenteeism and said that there is a grave national need for such a survey to define absenteeism on four counts, as between male and female, rural and urban, white collar and blue collar and management and general employees.  The policies of the Government have a direct and indirect impact on this.  I know what I am talking about as I have worked among people in industry all my life.  I invite any sociologist or economist to look at the pattern of absenteeism.  The times of the highest peak for absenteeism are generally between October and February.  There is not much absenteeism at the start of the tax year.  People realise that they are paying too much taxation and they try to redress that imbalance.  It is very important for the Government to realise that taxation policy has a direct bearing on industrial policy because of the subsidisation involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dick Dowling remarked that there are some socialist Deputies who <Col N="863" /> would see employment as being more important than being on the dole.  I certainly do and the party which I represent do.  I heard my colleague, Deputy John Kelly, expressing views which I hope will be printed by the Labour Party and circulated to every section of workers for impact.  John Kelly's viewpoint I would place somewhere in the political spectrum to the right of Ghenghis Khan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is to give statutory expression to the policies outlined in the Government <Col N="864" /> White Paper on Industrial Policy published in July 1984 at page 108, chapter 1, section 1.2, which says that the primary objectives of industrial policy are to create and maintain the maximum number of sustainable jobs in manufacturing and international services, to maximise value added in industry and to retain the wealth created for further employment creating investment, to develop a strong internationally competitive industrial sector made up of both Irish and foreign industry, to promote the rapid development of our natural resource based industries, to integrate foreign industry into our economy through greater linkage with Irish industry and the educational institutions and to improve the rate of return to the commercial State companies.  They are highly commendable objectives.</P>
    <P>It is high time this Parliament got their act together and started doing something as a parliament rather than on a partisan basis.  We live in a democracy and oppositions must oppose but we should not play games with employment and taxation which constitute two major economic and social problems which we have.  Pressure groups are playing the Opposition off against the Government.  We should lift ourselves above that.  An all-party committee should be set up to deal with taxation and industrial policy.  Employment and taxation are too important to be the subject of partisan politics and policies. We can decide on our approach when we get that scene corrected.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the comments of Deputy Dick Dowling, I have already talked about the attitudes of old Irish employers and I will refer to the attitude of some of the multinationals.  Clearly, some of the best companies operating here are multinational companies.  We have many of them in the mid-west region who have an enlightened policy on industrial relations.  We welcome that, but there are others.  I have heard Members rebuke workers and trade unions in the House.  I should like to recall for them the attitude of one company &mdash; I will not name it in the House &mdash; that was heavily subsidised by the taxes of workers.  The <Col N="865" /> turnover of that multinational company internationally in 1979 was greater than the gross national product of this country However, the company refused to give lockers to the staff who were working in a very heated steam treatment area.  I attended a meeting where the employer said &ldquo;Let them put their clothes on the floor&rdquo;.  That night the workers, who were saturated with their perspiration, walked out and said &ldquo;To hell with this.  We are not putting up with this any more&rdquo;.  A work stoppage resulted and the workers were branded for having stopped work, but nobody highlighted the cause of the dispute.</P>
    <P>I do not like to hear Members perpetuating the myth about industrial relations here.  That is damaging.  Jack Lynch, before he was pushed sideways by his own party, when interviewed at Shannon on his return from an industrial promotion tour in the US was asked about industrial relations here.  He said it was not put to him that industrial relations here were bad.  In the course of the construction of Alcan, before they closed down in May 1985, the media ran a scare that there were 16 stoppages.  That figure was quoted in a morning newspaper but in the evening newspaper it was reduced to 12.  The following morning a newspaper said the figure was eight but within two or three days the truth emerged &mdash; that there were two stoppages and not 16 as had been bandied about by the media. Such reporting helps to drive off foreign industries.  We should be careful about how we tend and help to perpetuate damaging myths in regard to industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The NESC report, No. 82 of December 1985 on Manpower Policy in Ireland states:</P>
    <P>However, the unemployment problem has deteriorated further and while a cyclical upturn may now be occurring in a general economic sense, the prospects of anything even approaching full employment in the medium term have now faded.  Manpower policy has, therefore, to operate <Col N="866" /> in the context of significant unemployment for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>That is a dreadful admission for a responsible body to have to make.  It is a very frightening statement.</P>
    <P>Certainly, it is very distressing, not just for the many thousands of young people coming on to the labour market whose families in many cases have made real sacrifices to enable them pursue their education but also for the breadwinners of many a home where that person is unemployed.  Unfortunately, I am only too well aware through my extensive constituency work and as a trade union official of the feeling of dejection and rejection in many a home where previously dignity and pride were a reality through employment.  It is easy to discuss in a macro-economic sense the adverse effects of unemployment but at an individual level, be it in an urban or rural home, its real impact is difficult to comprehend by those who are fortunate to be at work.  In this regard I genuinely commend what I describe as the discipline of the deprived, deprived not only in relation to employment but also in relation to the dignity of being a self-provider. That is the real cost of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I do not like to hear Members pontificating here who have not known what it is like to have water squelching in their broken shoes &mdash; I am not being dramatic &mdash; or the humiliation of signing on at a labour exchange, as I had, anxious and mad for work and feeling ashamed. Many Members do not know what it is like to be down at that level of society. Like standing for a church gate collection for a political party, it is very good for one's ego to have to go through that. People might be much nearer the bone if they experienced that before they start lecturing people at that level.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling referred to the cost of unemployment.  All sociologists &mdash; I will not refer to economists because I have long dismissed them as any kind of credible group; they cannot agree among themselves &mdash; are now identifying the <Col N="867" /> real cost of unemployment, the psychological damage, the increasing level of suicides, alienation and the return to vandalism. While unemployment may not be contributing directly to those problems there is no doubt that it is a big factor. It is important that we devise a proper industrial policy, irrespective of the party or parties in power.  It is crucifying to sit here listening to speeches to the effect that we have to live with a high level of unemployment.  I accept that there is no easy answer to the problem.  For 15 months prior to the European elections I worked on a committee with the Socialist group in Europe preparing a policy on employment and I can accept that there is no easy answer from trade unions, Governments or anybody else.  But some small countries have succeeded in tackling the problem.  Countries such as Austria, Norway, Finland and Switzerland, who are like us in macro-economic, in output terms, are managing nicely without a great dependency on anybody else.  It is important that we get together on this.  I agree with the suggestion from the other side of the House that somebody should convene a meeting to discuss the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>We must remember that two things create employment: the provision of services and the production of goods.  That brings us back to another problem which the Government are faced with at present &mdash; public sector pay.  People in the public sector such as teachers, nurses and gardaí do a fantastic job.  They are all productive in the sense that they fulfil important needs; but, by and large, the public sector does not generate extra disposable income.  It is extra disposable income that pays for jobs when the money circulates. Therefore, we must look to the production of goods to generate the money that helps us buy these services.</P>
    <P>I should like to give a minuscule example of what I am talking about.  It was interesting to read the comments of a number of people who visited the Blasket Islands.  A beautiful film on the islands, &ldquo;An tOileánach&rdquo;, was shown on television <Col N="868" /> recently with a great translation by Liam Ó Murchú.  A lecturer from University College, Galway, an Englishman, who visited the Blasket Islands, said in the course of an interview in Irish that the islands in the thirties were a supreme example of what a pre-capitalist economy was.  Goods were not being produced and the level of services was very low.  Raised to national level it is an indication that we must produce goods to survive.  We cannot pay for the services unless we get money for goods.  That is where our industrial policy comes in.  In this regard I should like to commend the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Bruton.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There is no limitation on costs.  It is a matter for the courts to decide whether to impose a prison sentence or a community service order and they have to get a report from the community and welfare service. Obviously if there is a very large increase in 1986 in the number of orders imposed by the courts, costs will arise in two areas. First, I will have to examine whether it will be necessary to appoint extra probation and welfare officers and I will also have to examine whether it will be necessary to appoint extra part time supervisors on the sites where the work is being carried out.  At present there is no financial barrier but if the need arises I will have to go through the normal procedures of consulting the Department of the Public Service for sanction for new staff.

Medical officers are, of course, free to refer prisoners for specialist advice in any case considered necessary. A dentist attends regularly at the prison to attend to prisoners' dental needs.</P>

There had been an argument in that regard but the Minister clarified the position and said that medication had been administered. Yet it appears that Paul Kenna had not been seen by a doctor at that time.  In a case like that, who prescribes the medicine? When a prisoner is admitted late in the evening and no doctor is available &mdash; perhaps the prisoner is a drug addict and needs treatment &mdash; who sees that prisoner first and who decides on the treatment? From what the Minister said last week, treatment seems to have been administered without a doctor being present.</P>

For <Col N="874" /> example, after questions last week referring to the young man who so tragically died in Mountjoy, I received a letter from the District Justice who held that court. She informed me categorically that there was no question of the court asking the prison to provide any medical treatment. What was at issue was that the solicitor asked if the court would remand the prisoner to allow the defence time to get a private medical examination.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 12, 13, 16, 59, 60, 61, 62 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda pursue actively all alleged breaches of the law in relation to moneylenders. In keeping with this policy all divisional officers had investigations carried out following the allegations of irregularities by moneylenders which were made in the media in November and December last year.  All of the matters concerned are still under investigation but, so far, in the majority of cases these investigations have not uncovered evidence to substantiate the allegations made.  Some evidence of irregularities was found to exist in the areas of Cork, Galway, Waterford and Wexford.</P>
      <P>This, however, must be assessed in the following context.  First, a difficulty nearly always encountered by the Garda in investigating the recent allegations against moneylenders, and indeed on previous occasions, is that in many cases the persons making the allegations or the borrowers in question are either unable or unwilling to give information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly &mdash; and this is of central importance &mdash; most of what may be described as irregularities in the matter of moneylending are not criminal offences.  In many important instances the Acts do not create offences at all and, therefore, do not provide for a criminal sanction but only for a restriction on the civil right of the moneylender to recover a debt in the courts.  Accordingly, the remedy provided by law does not rest with the Garda &mdash; even when they get full co-operation from the borrower &mdash; but with the borrower himself if the <Col N="878" /> moneylenders seeks to bring civil proceedings against him.</P>
    <P>A case in point is the matter of interest and related charges.  There is no power vested in the Garda to prosecute for excessive charges.  Charging more than 39 per cent is not a criminal offence.  The figure is mentioned in the 1933 Act in the context of a provision which allows a court, in proceedings brought by a moneylender for the recovery of money lent, to re-open the transaction and give equitable relief if the transaction is harsh and unconscionable.  The court must conclusively assume that it is such a transaction if the interest exceeds 39 per cent simple interest but can give relief even where the interest is less.  Charging more than that rate of interest could also be significant in the context of applications for renewal of certificates of fitness.</P>
    <P>The scope for Garda procedures, even where the facts alleged are provable, is therefore very limited and the Garda statistics which follow should be read against that background.  They show that there were no prosecutions for offences in the moneylending area in the years 1980 to 1983, inclusive.  In 1984 one person was convicted of unlicensed moneylending and assault.  In 1985 one licensed moneylender was convicted of opening for business on Good Friday and another person was prosecuted for 11 offences related to moneylending, that is, four counts of unlicensed moneylending and seven counts of assault.  He was convicted for eight of these offences and the other three still have to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I have been asked if I would be willing to discuss and consult with interested groups in relation to the problems.  I would welcome the views of these groups but I believe that those who have considered the matter in some detail are alive to the fact that it is part of a complex problem that is not necessarily eased but that could, on the contrary, be worsened by legal provisions that might superficially sound right.  In those circumstances, I do not consider that the matter would best be approached by my meeting some interested group but, rather, by their setting out their own considered views in <Col N="879" /> writing and I suggest that they submit their views to me in writing.</P>
    <P>Some of the questions refer to amending the law.  I will, of course, consider introducing any amending legislation that may be necessary.  I wish to assure Deputies that I will keep the subject of moneylending under review.  Decisions on any further action, either by way of enforcement or by amending legislation, will be taken in the light of developments in the present Garda investigations and points made in any submissions by interested groups.  However, in saying this, I am not to be taken as saying that this area is necessarily one that I should continue to deal with.  It may appear, as consideration of the matter develops, that it would be regarded as something to be dealt with in the wider context of social legislation, credit control and/or consumer protection.</P>
    <P>When I answered questions on various aspects of moneylending in 1984 and 1985 I suggested that Deputies should bring any particular cases they have in mind to the notice of local gardaí.  I would like now to reiterate that suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the Minister and I am very disappointed because he appears to be giving the impression that this matter is not nearly as serious as it is.  I should like to point out to him that in Wexford town, which has a population of 13,000 people, there are 5,000 accounts.  Is he aware that since the RTE programme &mdash; I should like to compliment them on that programme &mdash; the problem has got worse.  Is he aware that moneylenders are blantantly breaking the law by charging an interest rate as high as 285 per cent?  He has told the House that the total permitted rate is 39 per cent.  How can unlicensed people operate with such obvious and complete freedom?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am not aware that the situation has become worse in recent weeks or months. Secondly, charging an interest rate in excess of 39 per cent is not a criminal offence &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Even if it is over 39 per cent it is not a criminal offence and the Garda cannot arrest and prosecute somebody under the criminal law because there is no criminal law that is applicable.  However, there is a provision in civil law which enables the person who owes the money to go to court.  Where the interest rate is in excess of 39 per cent and when proceedings are brought by a moneylender for recovery of the money lent the court can find in favour of the person who has borrowed the money.  The recourse is in civil law, not criminal law.  I have no idea if what the Deputy has said about the level of interest rate is true, but if it is in excess of 39 per cent the recourse in law is in the civil code and not in the criminal code.  With regard to the final point made by the Deputy, if he is aware of unlicensed moneylenders operating he should give their names and addresses to the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>The Minister's answer was important and revealing in relation to action which the Garda Síochána can take.  Many of us were under the impression that they could deal with these matters as criminal offences but the Minister has now told us that is not so. He stated that the Garda can refuse a certificate of fitness to somebody who has been charging an excessive rate of interest.  Can he give us any idea to what extent the Garda are using this power to refuse certificates of fitness?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is not a matter for the Garda Síochána.  Every moneylender is required to take out an annual licence from the Revenue Commissioners in respect of which a duty of £100 is payable.  A licence may not be granted to a person unless he obtains a certificate of fitness from the District Court.  The procedure is that the certificate of fitness has to be got in court and obviously anybody can object to that, including the local Garda through the <Col N="881" /> superintendent or inspector, and the Deputy could also object.  If the certificate of fitness is not given by the District Court the Revenue Commissioners cannot give a licence and if a person operated without a licence he is in breach of the law and can be prosecuted.</P>

Is he aware of the fear on the part of those to whom money has been lent? Is he aware of the tension in such families and the fear caused as a result of tactics used by these people?  What does he intend to do to protect them from such tactics?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The trouble about every dog in the street knowing that something is happening is that dogs in the street are notoriously reticent about giving information to the Garda Síochána.  If Deputies, including Deputy Byrne, have information to give to the Garda Síochána about the abuse of the Act they should give that information and allow the Garda to proceed against a person if he is in breach of the criminal law.  I know fear can be created by moneylenders and it is one of the problems of the Garda Síochána when they come to get information about the activities of moneylenders.  I do not think we should highlight over-much strong arm tactics if and when they take place, and I have no specific information that they do.  Something far more simple operates, namely, that people who borrow are afraid to complain lest the next time they are in need they will be unable to get a loan.  Thus, they are reticent about giving any information to the Garda Síochána. If the Deputy wishes he may come to my office and I can go over the recent set of complaints for his own constituency and his county.  I can show him of instances where the Garda approached people and information was not forthcoming.  It is not because of strong arm tactics but <Col N="882" /> because they are afraid they may be in need again.  They may need money for a suit for a child for first communion or for a death in the family and they will have nobody to go to.  Therefore they will not give information.</P>

      <P>The Minister has touched on an important point.  Will he not agree that what is at fault is our social welfare system which does not adequately protect people in such a situation? People in need would not get into the hands of moneylenders if the social welfare system were adequate.  It is falling down in not protecting them from these unscrupulous moneylenders.  Will the Minister indicate what evidence is required by the Garda Síochána in order to have the matter listed as a valid complaint? Is it evidence that must stand up in court or is it simply valid information that a person must supply in order for a complaint to be registered?  Will the Minister confirm that the operation of unlicensed moneylenders is a criminal offence and that the Garda are obliged to prosecute if evidence is brought to them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The answer to the last part of the Deputy's question is yes.  With regard to evidence, the Garda would require evidence to stand up in court before they could take a criminal prosecution.  That is self-evident. In the case of objecting to somebody on the grounds of fitness to hold a licence, I think hard information provided by reasonable people in the community would mean it could be presented in the court.  However, it would not necessarily be conclusive because it would be a matter for the District Justice to provide the certificate of fitness in any event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept Deputy's criticism of the social welfare code.  In many cases people with large incomes from social welfare can become the prey of moneylenders while people with small social welfare payments are never in the hands of moneylenders.  The point is there are many people who will not be given unsecured loans by the banks or the financial <Col N="883" /> agencies and if they want a loan they have to go to the moneylenders.  My best advice to people is to work through credit unions who have been very effective in providing loans for short periods.  All Deputies should tell their constituents not to go to moneylenders.  They should be advised to become customers of their local credit unions and work through them.</P>

One way or the other, is the Minister prepared to give an undertaking to have the matter reviewed with the Garda following the discussion here today in an attempt to reach a decision as to what can be done about what is a very serious social problem, as people on both sides of the House will admit?</P>

I do not accept that the Garda have not been diligent in investigating complaints made to them.  I repeat that many of the areas of complaint do not constitute criminal offences and that consequently there cannot be prosecutions.

      <Col N="885" /> I have now found that section of my brief which deals with the numbers of licences granted in the various years.  To the end of October 1985, the number was 109.  The number of licensed granted in recent years, with the exception of 1984, when the figure was 128, has declined.  In 1983, the number was 114, in 1982, 116, in 1981, 116, in 1980, 116, in 1975, 123, in 1972-73, 121 and in 1968-69, 128.  As the legislation was enacted in 1933.

Regarding Garda investigations arising from the <i>Sunday Press</i> report and the RTE programme, the areas mentioned were Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Wexford.  I understand that investigations are being carried out in these areas.  In Cork east, for example, the Garda have discovered one case. That is still under investigation and will probably be brought before the courts. In Cork west the Garda are investigating the possibility that loans were being solicited by a Cork based firm of moneylenders. In Galway the Garda are investigating the legality of certain moneylenders.  In Waterford an investigation is under way into a Cork based company who have clients in Waterford. The Deputies will appreciate that I cannot give precise information about investigations that are continuing but I assure them that any charge that was made either in the <i>Sunday Press</i> of 1 December or on the RTE programme is being followed up diligently by the Garda.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Senior personnel of Telecom Éireann together with representatives of the Garda met earlier this month with a view to ascertaining whether the handling of the 999 calls could be improved.  Since then certain measures have been introduced which should be of benefit.  The Telecom Éireann operators will continue to take responsibility for each call until it has been accepted by the Garda.  Previously the practice was that once a telephone operator transferred a call to the Garda, the operator took no further responsibility for it even though, because of equipment difficulties, such call might not be received by the Garda.  There is to be continuing liaison between a senior management member of Telecom Éireann and a superintendent of the Garda in the Dublin Metropolitan Area.  This will meet the point the Deputy has raised. In addition, the Garda and the Telecom <Col N="888" /> Eireann supervisors will exchange names when passing on complaints.

There were two reports of deer being injured in the Phoenix Park.  There were three incidents of bolts from crossbows being fired through windows and two detections of crossbows being carried for protection. A mare died following injury by an arrow.  A dog was shot in a dispute between neighbours.  Itinerants were using crossbows to shoot pheasants.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The purpose of the Act is to provide an alternative to imprisonment where offenders can work in the community in a manner which is of benefit to themselves and to the community.  The benefit to the community is ancillary to the primary purpose of the Act.  There is provision in the regulations for the State to carry the insurance cost if an individual is in poor circumstances. Frequently communities are involved in organising schemes for such things as the decoration of houses for old people or looking after gardens, hedges, fences and painting work.  The State will carry the cost in those circumstances.  If there is a wider area of concern I am prepared to listen to the representations of the Deputy and see what can be done.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that in certain circumstances the State carries responsibility for insurance.  Is it not also true that for public exhibitions and art treasures the Government carry their own insurance?  If, for example, the State carries the insurance for third century Chinese horses in Dublin, when they do not move even when struck, is it not strange that the State will not carry insurance for lively hobby horses in community centres throughout the country?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy's question is about one aspect of the Land Registry office work, that is the section which deals with the purchase of ground rents under the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978.  If the Deputy wants information about other aspects of the work of the Land Registry office I will be very pleased to give it to him but I will have to get notice of such questions so that I will have a proper brief on them.  On the question of the ground rents, there was a decrease of 71.6 per cent in the intake of applications in 1985 compared with 1984.  Probably the House will remember that we introduced a Bill extending the scope of the original Bill which resulted in an enormous influx of applications. For example, in 1982 there were 6,708 applications.  Then, when we extended the provisions of the original Bill in 1983, there were 19,378 applications.  Last year those applications were down to 1,703. The backlog is being gone through very quickly.  Probably the Deputy is also aware that under the Act priority is given to any people who are selling their houses.  They can establish their freehold interest in a couple of weeks.  There is no imposition on anybody normally buying out a round rent and remaining in a house.  It is just a matter of waiting for the thing to be processed.  It presents such people with no difficulty whatsoever.</P>

      <P>I am very disappointed that the Minister has not answered my question in relation to the number of vacancies.  I am more than surprised he does not have that information.  I understand that the reason for the huge backlog of outstanding applications is insufficient staff to deal with them.  The fact that during 1985 the number of applications received was 1,703 and that there are <Col N="895" /> 12,000 outstanding speaks for itself.  Will the Minister give an undertaking, that some action will be taken as far as staffing is concerned because the Land Registry office is self-financing?  Will the Minister examine the situation and indicate whether he is prepared to authorise the deployment of additional staff to deal with outstanding applications?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> If he is asking about the situation in the ground rents section, the situation is that the authorised staffing in the ground rents section, when the scheme came into operation in 1978, was 12.  There are two examiners of title, two executive officers, two staff officers, two clerical officers and four clerical assistants.  In spite of the embargo, staffing has been maintained consistently at 12 and has been augmented temporarily from time to time, particularly in times of increased pressure such as in 1983, and is continuing.  We had 12 in 1978 and that has been maintained. At present there are 14 working in the office, so the embargo is not affecting the work there at all.

That will be reduced enormously because the office staff are working their way through the enormous number of applications that were submitted in 1983 and that caused the problem.

A person may be committed to prison for failure to comply with a court order to make certain payments in discharge of a debt, an order which may be made only after examination of means designed to establish that the person can pay.</P>

Courts can make orders to commit persons to prison for failure to pay the money involved without any examination of means and that happened quite recently.  Let me ask the Minister again if he considers it appropriate that our prisons should be used to hold people basically because they owe money to private finance companies.  While the technical reason may be breach of a court order, fundamentally it is because they owe money to a private company.

Having regard to these considerations it has been decided that the appropriate provision for awards under the scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted for 1986 is £2,667,000.</P>
      <P>As was stated in the national plan, <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i>, the scheme is proving very costly for the Exchequer.  Following a review of the scheme, the Government have sanctioned changes in the conditions of the scheme, which I will announce shortly.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not consider it quite extraordinary that he should be proposing at present in the Estimates the provision of £10,000 extra for the year <Col N="902" /> for a voluntary victim support scheme to aid the victims of this kind of personal injury but that at the same time, he is taking £1.3 million away from the people who will be injured?  They are going to be disadvantaged in this year, given the fact that the only outcome of this scheme which he is proposing must be to reduce the total amount of money available and the money paid to each individual.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The two schemes are not comparable.  The scheme to which the Estimate figure refers is in the nature of civil damages being awarded by the State for injury to people who have been the victims of crime.  The other figure of £10,000 is the commencement of a new scheme where psychological and emotional support can be given by members of the community acting voluntarily to support victims of crime.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I assume that the statement the Deputy is asking <Col N="903" /> me to make concerns the allegation that there was a lack of co-ordination between the security company and the Garda Síochána.  I am informed by the Garda Síochána that the general level of co-operation and co-ordination as between the company concerned and their staff on the one hand and the Garda Síochána on the other is high.  I do not consider that any useful purpose would be served by my making a statement about what did or did not occur in this particular case. Such a statement could not but appear as an attempt to suggest how any blame in the case should be apportioned.  What matters is that there has been contact at management level between the Garda and the company as to what lessons are to be learned from what happened and as to how procedures should be maintained at a high level.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the measures he has taken to deal <Col N="904" /> with the problem of young offenders aged 12 to 17; and the arrangements he has made to provide for their rehabilitation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Children and young people in the community who are at risk of coming into conflict with the law or who have been convicted for offences are, in so far as my Department are concerned, dealt with as follows: 1.  Juvenile Liaison Officer Scheme; 2. Probation Orders; 3.  Community Service Order Scheme; 4. Committal to Institutions.</P>
      <P>The juvenile liaison officer scheme essentially provides for the cautioning of certain juveniles up to the age of 17 years, as an alternative to prosecution.  The function of the juvenile liaison officer is to maintain contact with any juvenile assigned to him.  The juvenile may be one who has committed an offence and, having been warned, has been informally committed to the care of the officer.  The juvenile liaison officer may also be given the care and guidance of a young person who, though not known to have committed an offence, may be regarded as a potential delinquent by reason of unsatisfactory behaviour, such as persistent truancy, running away from home, staying out late at night, unruly at school or at home, behaving in a disorderly manner, or frequenting undesirable places.  Such cases would come to notice through teachers, parents, school attendance officers, or other gardaí.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a total of 79 members are at present assigned full time to juvenile liaison officer duties.  Since 1 January 1983 the number of officers assigned full time to juvenile liaison duties has increased by nine.</P>
      <P>The number of young persons dealt with under the scheme in each of the last three years is as follows: 1982, 4,743; 1983, 5,404 and 1984, 6,278 &mdash; the last year for which figures are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Probation and Welfare Service of my Department provides supervision and control in respect of probation orders made by the courts.  The number of such orders made in respect of young <Col N="905" /> offenders under 17 years was 730 in 1984 &mdash; the last year for which statistics are available.</P>
    <P>A number of community based hostels and workshops and resource centres have been established throughout the country by my Department in association with local voluntary committees.  These centres provide appropriate assistance for offenders on supervision and are mainly used for those in the 15 to 17 years age group to enable them to become stable members of the community.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The hostels in Dublin, Cork and Waterford provide up to 50 places, the workshops in Dublin, Dún Laoghaire and Galway provide 80 places and the resource centres in Dublin and Cork are catering for a further 40 offenders at present.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983 which came into effect in December 1984 is a further non-custodial sanction available to the courts in dealing with offenders aged 16 years and over. Up to 31 December 1985 a total of 36 community service orders were made in respect of offenders in the 16 to 17 years age group.</P>
      <P>In addition, St. Patrick's Institution &mdash; provided under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960 &mdash; can receive from the courts offenders of 16 years.  It is possible for these young offenders to be transferred to places provided under the Prisons Act, 1970 &mdash; Shanganagh Castle, the Training Unit or Fort Mitchel &mdash; where such a transfer is deemed appropriate to further the rehabilitation of the offender by, for example, maintaining family contacts.</P>
      <P>At present there are 26 offenders of 16 years in the places I have mentioned, 16 in St. Patrick's, six in Shanganagh Castle, four in the Training Unit and none in Fort Mitchel.</P>

In so far as places are required for custodial sentences, there are sufficient places within the prison system for young people between the ages of 16 and 17.  However, the Minister for Education, under section 58 (1) of the Children's Act, 1908, as amended in the Children's Act of 1941, has responsibility for providing special residential schools for young offenders under the age of 16 years.  I do not have that responsibility.  At present there are three such special schools, St. Laurence's in Finglas, Trinity House in Lusk, County Dublin, and St. Joseph's, Clonmel, County Tipperary.  I understand that these provide sufficient places for the cohort of young people, in trouble with the law, requiring custodial sentences, being under 16 years of age.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>In preparing this budget, I had to consider and to reconcile three different requirements. The first is: what kind of budget would be most appropriate to the present state of our economy?  The second is: the public finances constraint within which the achievement of the budgetary objectives has to be approached.  The third is: what shifts in the balance of taxation are required by considerations of equity, efficiency and the need to tackle the black economy?</P>
      <P>As far as the first requirement is concerned, the slower than expected growth in the economy and in employment during 1985 points towards a budget that will not depress the economy in 1986.</P>
      <P>In relation to the second requirement, it is clearly necessary to reduce the current deficit from the opening figure by holding public spending down to the national plan level and, at the same time, by bridging some two-thirds of the gap between the level of revenue implicit in the national plan and the level of revenue likely to emerge at current tax rates.</P>
      <P>In relation to the third requirement, a comparison of our tax structure with those of most other developed countries suggests, in our case, a marked disincentive effect in the structure of our personal taxation system.  The combination of these considerations has led me to the conclusion that the broad approach to be followed in this budget should be:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, to cut back the Exchequer borrowing requirement and the current <Col N="933" /> budget deficit, not fully to the extent implicit in the national plan, because this would sharply deflate the economy, but nevertheless by a significant amount.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement will be reduced from 12.9 per cent of GNP in 1985 11.8 per cent, and the current budget deficit from 8.2 per cent of GNP to a level of 7.4 per cent.  In addition, total public sector borrowing, already reduced from 20 per cent of GNP in 1982 to 15¾ per cent in 1985, will be further cut to 14¼ per cent of GNP;</P>
    <P>Second, as a contribution to the attainment of the objective of reducing the current budget deficit, and in order to contain the need for tax revenue, current spending will be held as close as possible to the implicit national plan level of about £8,030 million, by making such cuts in current spending as may be necessary to accommodate the additional costs of social welfare and public service pay within this broad total;</P>
    <P>Third, on the revenue side, a sufficient amount of net additional revenue must be obtained in order to achieve the necessary reduction in the current deficit.  This entails increases in excise duties and VAT.  In making these increases, however, I will take full account of the needs of some particularly sensitive sectors, such as tourism and services, which are being adversely affected by current tax rates;</P>
    <P>Finally, there will be a significant rationalisation of the taxation of financial institutions and a readjustment of the balance between the taxation of investment income from financial assets and that of wages and salaries, in order to improve the incentive to effort and the reward for work.</P>
    <P>The following, therefore, are the main components of this budget:</P>
    <P>(a)  It will make provision for the recent public service pay offer, which, if applied to all relevant groups, will add 2 per cent to the 1986 Exchequer <Col N="934" /> pay and pensions bill, as well as for certain special pay increases previously committed, which fall due for payment in 1986.</P>
    <P>(b)  It will make provision for increases in social welfare payments from July next, which will maintain the real value of these payments for a further year thereafter.</P>
    <P>(c)  It will provide for a child benefit payment of £15.05 per month for each of the first five children, an increase of one quarter on the present children's allowance &mdash; and the payment of £21.75 for each further child.</P>
    <P>(d)  It will effect spending cuts of £55 million from the sums set out in the published current Estimates in order to reduce current spending to £8,042 million and will reduce capital spending by a net £25 million.</P>
    <P>(e)  It will reduce VAT on meals and on a range of labour-intensive services, currently liable at 23 per cent, to 10 per cent from 1 July next.  The services which will benefit from this relief include hairdressing, laundry and dry cleaning, electrical and most other repairs, cleaning services, cinema admissions and travelling fun-fairs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Collins is tempting me sorely to answer that.</P>
      <P>(f)  It will restructure the taxation of financial institutions and income from financial assets in order to remove major anomalies and inequities within the system, while raising sufficient additional revenue to reduce personal income taxes by a total of £121 million, or over twice the amount which would be required for indexation.</P>
      <P>The income tax changes will be:</P>
      <P>abolition of the 1 per cent income levy</P>
      <P>increase of £100 in the PAYE allowance</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> increases in personal allowances in the 35 per cent tax band and the age exemption limits sufficient to keep pace with inflation</P>
    <P>reduction of the top rate of income tax from 60 per cent to 58 per cent</P>
    <P>doubling of the age allowance.</P>
    <P>(g)  Finally, the budget will, as a preliminary to much tougher anti-evasion action &mdash; including prison sentences of up to five years &mdash; offer to defaulting taxpayers a six-month amnesty from prosecution if they report their evasions, pay their back-taxes and re-enter the legitimate economy. There will also be an amnesty from prosecutions for those who come forward during the same six-month period admitting to earlier or existing irregularities in relation to the social welfare system.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REVIEW OF 1985 BUDGET OUTTURN</P>
    <P>The budget outturn was again close to target in 1985, following the pattern established in 1983 and 1984.  There was a small overrun on the current budget deficit, caused partly by the fact that the level of unemployment during the year was higher than had been expected, and partly by revenue shortfalls.  The higher than expected level of unemployment was due in part to the fact that export growth, including that in certain high technology sectors, suffered a temporary setback.  The revenue shortfalls resulted in part from the employment situation, and partly from the fact that last year's tax changes were more concessionary than had been thought at the time.  While the current budget deficit at 8¼ per cent of GNP was marginally higher than the previous peak deficit recorded in 1982, the overall level of the Exchequer borrowing requirement has fallen since then from about 15¾ per cent of GNP to less than 13 per cent of GNP last year.  Over the same period the public sector borrowing requirement has fallen as a proportion <Col N="936" /> of GNP from 20 per cent to 15¾ per cent. This process of reducing annual net borrowing must be continued in this year's budget as an essential step on the road towards stabilising the ratio of debt to GNP.</P>
    <P>Last year we continued with our policy of prepaying some of our earlier foreign loans and replacing them with less expensive loans carrying longer maturities.  A total of £1.1 billion was repaid and refinanced in this way in 1985.  The prepayment programme has been made possible by the favourable borrowing opportunities in the markets as well as by the high credit standing which Ireland enjoys internationally.</P>
    <P Just="Center">THE ECONOMIC SITUATION</P>
    <P>During 1985 we experienced a slowdown in the rate of growth of industrial exports.  This was due partly to a lower than expected rate of growth in world trade and partly to a sharp check to the growth of exports in certain high technology sectors.  The adverse agricultural situation was a contributory factor also. Nevertheless, gross domestic product rose by over 2 per cent last year.  For the first time in several years the volume of both personal consumption and fixed investment increased.  There was another substantial reduction in the rate of inflation from over 8½ per cent in 1984 to less than 5½ per cent last year.  By end-year, inflation was running at under 5 per cent, a rate well in line with that in our main competitor countries.</P>
    <P>There was also a further improvement in both the external trade account and the overall balance of payments.  The trade account moved into surplus in 1985 for the first time since the forties.  With tourism having an extremely good year also, the overall balance of payments deficit fell to around 3 per cent of GDP, the best outturn for ten years.  Although the level of unemployment rose again last year, notified redundancies showed a marked decline on the 1984 level, following five years of a rising trend.  In addition, the increase in unemployment moderated <Col N="937" /> again in 1985; this was the best outturn since 1979.  The indications are that nonagricultural employment had stabilised by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The outlook for 1986 on the international front is broadly favourable.  The depreciation of the dollar exchange rate and the decline in the level of interest rates internationally in the past year will contribute to easing our debt interest burden in 1986, while the marked decline in oil prices in recent months should, if sustained, have beneficial effects on economic activity in Ireland and in the industrialised world as a whole.</P>
    <P>The commitment among EC member countries to pursue co-ordinated policies to achieve more growth and employment is encouraging.  Given this external environment, we should continue to reduce our balance of payments deficit. Personal consumption, which rose in 1985 in real terms for the first time in four years, should continue this trend in 1986. The rate of increase in consumer prices, taking account of the effect of this budget and the latest falls in oil prices, is expected to be of the order of 4½ per cent. Investment in expected to maintain the upward momentum experienced last year.  Prospects for employment, the one area where economic performance has been disappointing, will also improve.</P>
    <P>EMPLOYMENT</P>
    <P>The creation of jobs both to cater for the continuing expansion in the labour force and to reduce the existing level of unemployment remains the central economic and social priority of the Government.</P>
    <P>Since taking office, we have pursued a twin-pronged strategy in seeking a resolution of the problem.  First, we have sought, through taxation and incentive policies, to create a better climate for employment.  The imaginative measures taken by the Government last October to stimulate building activity are an emphatic illustration of the Government's commitment to providing increased opportunities for employment.</P>
    <P>Second, recognising the urgency of the <Col N="938" /> situation and taking account of the fact that tax and incentive approaches must be viewed in a longer-term perspective, we have instituted a wide series of measures which would have an immediate impact on the numbers out of work.  Two of the most successful schemes have been the enterprise allowance scheme, which has enabled roughly 10,000 unemployed persons to start their own businesses in its first two years of operation, and the social employment scheme, targeted at the long-term unemployed, which had almost 5,500 participants at the end of 1985.</P>
    <P Just="Center">GENERAL BUDGET STRATEGY 1986</P>
    <P>OPENING POSITION</P>
    <P>The published opening current budget deficit is £1,350 million.  Deducting an estimated £35 million which Departments have in balances from 1985, the actual opening deficit is £1,315 million, compared with the 1985 outturn of £1,284 million.  The overall opening Exchequer borrowing requirement, taking account of Departmental balances, is £2,093 million. This is one-half of a percentage point of GNP lower than the 1985 outturn of £2,015 million.</P>
    <P>BUDGET TARGETS</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that today's budget changes must achieve a further reduction in borrowing as a proportion of GNP.  This course is essential for our future economic well-being and for the creation of employment.  Therefore, while I am providing for social welfare improvements, income tax concessions and some expenditure concessions, there is no alternative but to provide also for both expenditure reductions and some tax increases.  The tax increases, however, will be on a scale which will keep taxation within the ceiling set in <i>Building on Reality.</i></P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="939" /> CURRENT EXPENDITURE</P>
    <P Just="Center">PUBLIC SERVICE PAY AND INCOMES POLICY</P>
    <P>PUBLIC SERVICE PAY</P>
    <P>The published estimate of £2,600 million for public service pay and pensions in 1986 made no allowance for a general pay increase under the current pay round or for meeting the cost of outstanding special pay increases.  In considering the scope for new increases, the Government obviously have had to have regard to the Exchequer's capacity to fund such increases, given that expenditure on pay represents nearly half of expenditure on net current supply services.</P>
    <P>Against this background, the Minister for the Public Service has recently concluded a series of negotiations with certain public service groups which have resulted in an offer of a package of pay proposals.  This package includes an offer on a 25th round involving a 3 per cent increase on 1 May 1986, 2 per cent on 1 January 1987 and a further 2 per cent on 1 May 1987.  As regards special pay increases, the Government were faced with adjudication findings which, in the case of the groups directly concerned, would cost in excess of £70 million per annum to implement.  In current circumstances such a figure is simply beyond the financial capacity of the Exchequer.  The Government's package therefore provides for these special adjudication findings to be paid on a phased basis, commencing on 1 December next.  However, the package allows for superannuation lump sums to be paid as if the special adjudication findings had been implemented on the dates recommended.  Finally, the package involves a commitment by both sides to engage in meaningful discussions over the coming months on the machinery for pay determination.</P>
    <P>The 1986 cost of the package on offer, assuming its eventual application to all groups in the Exchequer pay bill, plus the cost of special pay increases previously committed, is estimated at £68 million.  I <Col N="940" /> must stress that, in the light of all the constraints on the Exchequer, particularly in 1986, this offer represents the absolute limit to which the Government are able to go this year.</P>
    <P>PUBLIC SERVICE PENSIONS</P>
    <P>The Government also considered certain superannuation matters which arose during the recent pay negotiations with public service groups.  One such matter was the issue of full parity on grade or special pay increases.  The Government have now decided that, in the context of the phasing arrangements set out in the package, full pension parity in relation to special increases would be introduced with effect from 1 July 1986.</P>
    <P>PUBLIC SERVICE WIDOWS' AND CHILDREN'S EX-GRATIA PENSIONS</P>
    <P>
      <i>Ex-gratia</i> pensions are payable to the widows and children of pensionable public servants who retired or died prior to the introduction of the contributory widows' and children's pension scheme. Since 1979 the rate of ex-gratia pensions has stood at 5/6ths of the rate payable under the contributory scheme.  Having further considered the position of these widows, and notwithstanding the significant cost involved, the Government have decided to introduce full parity for such widows in two steps, half the difference between the rates being eliminated on 1, January 1986 followed by full parity on 1, January 1987.  The cost in 1986 of these two pension concessions is estimated at £2 million.</P>
    <P>I shall be referring later to adjustments to the published expenditure allocations. These adjustments include savings of some £18 million to be realised in the pay area.  Allowing for these savings and for the additional allocations for pay and pensions which I have announced, the pay and pensions bill in 1986 amounts to £2,652 million.</P>
    <P>GENERAL INCOMES POLICY</P>
    <P>The Government's pay policy is that pay increases in Ireland should not <Col N="941" /> exceed the rate of pay increase in competitor countries and that, within this framework, the free collective bargaining system should continue to have regard to the ability of individual employers to pay and to the likely impact of pay settlements on employment.</P>
    <P>There was a welcome moderation in the level of new pay settlements in Ireland in 1985.  This progress must be maintained, especially since the rate of increase in our competitor countries generally is continuing to decline.  Given that there is already a sizeable carryover in wage costs into 1986 from previous pay settlements, the scope for new pay increases in Ireland is extremely limited if the capacity of Irish firms to compete at home and abroad is not to be undermined. The achievement of the required moderation in pay settlements should be facilitated by the prospective continuing decline in the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P Just="Center">OTHER CURRENT EXPENDITURE</P>
    <P>SOCIAL WELFARE</P>
    <P>Expenditure on Social Welfare has reached nearly £2½ billion.  While we continue to have an underlying dependency ratio greater than most countries with broadly comparable levels of development, the economic difficulties of recent years have exacerbated this problem. Despite the heavy and growing demands on the Exchequer and the difficult economic background, it remains a primary aim of the Government that transfers to the less well-off keep pace with the cost of living.</P>
    <P>We have achieved that aim.  Each of the welfare increases given in the first three budgets of this Government has exceeded the following year's increase in the cost of living.  Last year's budget increases already ensure that payment rates over the first half of 1986 will be 6 per cent or more above those prevailing in the corresponding period of 1985, at a time when prices will have risen by less than 5 per cent.  With inflation continuing to fall, the rate of welfare increase which <Col N="942" /> is necessary to protect the real value of social welfare transfers is correspondingly contained.  Accordingly, a general increase of 4 per cent in personal and adult dependant rates of welfare payments and health allowances from mid-July will assure the living standards of those on welfare for a further year.  The Government recognise the special position of the long-term unemployed; the long-duration rate of unemployment assistance will be increased by 5 per cent from mid-July.  These increases are not being applied to the weekly child dependant payments but the resources thereby saved are being channelled directly into the new Child Benefit scheme which I will outline later.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Weekly Welfare Payments</i></P>
    <P>The 5 per cent increase for the long-duration unemployed will give the following improvements:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a single person on long-duration unemployment assistance living in an urban area will get an extra £1.75 a week, giving a total of £36.70, while a married couple will benefit by £3.00 to bring them up to £63.15 a week;</P>
    <P>&mdash;single persons in rural areas who are long-term unemployed will receive an extra £1.70, bringing their weekly payment to £35.50, and a married couple will get an extra £2.95, thus providing them with £61.30 a week.</P>
    <P>The 4 per cent increase for other welfare recipients will bring about the following results:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a contributory old-age pensioner who is under 80 will get an extra £2.05 a week, bringing the pension to £53.45 a week;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a non-contributory old-age pensioner who is under 80 will get an increase of £1.75 a week, bringing his or her maximum pension to £45.75 a week;</P>
    <P>&mdash;where a married couple are both of pension age and under 80, the new <Col N="943" /> rates of contributory pension will mean an increase of £3.60 a week, so that their total pension will be £93.35;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the contributory pension of a widow under 66 will be £48.10 a week, an increase of £1.85;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a widow under 66 with a non-contributory pension will benefit by £1.75, giving her a maximum of £44.90 a week;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the flat-rate unemployment or disability benefit rate payable to a single person will rise by £1.60 to £41.10 a week, while a married couple will get an extra £2.60, giving them a new total of £67.70 a week; these payments may, of course, be topped-up with pay-related benefits.</P>
    <P>All the above increases will take effect from mid-July and will cost the Exchequer an additional £36.5 million this year and £79 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Pay-Related Social Insurance</i></P>
    <P>Despite considerably higher social insurance expenditure, it has been the Government's policy not to increase the rates of contribution to the Social Insurance Fund.  The current rates will continue to apply in 1986-87, subject only to an increase in the earnings ceiling from £13,800 to £14,700 as provided for in the published Estimates.  Deputies will already be aware of the new scheme under which employers creating additional employment between 23 October 1985 and 31 March 1986 will not be required to pay PRSI in 1986-87 for any additional new jobs created, provided the new employees had been unemployed for the previous six months or more.</P>
    <P>Employers alone are responsible for the funding of the benefits payable out of the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund and the Occupational Injuries Fund.  Minor increases in the contribution rates to each of these funds are necessary to ensure their continuing solvency.  The redundancy contribution will be increased by 0.1 of a percentage <Col N="944" /> point from 0.5 per cent to 0.6 per cent from April next.  The occupational injuries contribution will be increased by .03 of a percentage point from 0.4 per cent to 0.43 per cent.  As usual, the ceiling for these two contributions will be the same as that for the social insurance contribution which, as I mentioned earlier, will be £14,700 from next April.</P>
    <P>The ceiling for the 1 per cent health contribution will also be increased in April from £13,000 to £14,000.  The eligibility limit for free consultant services will be increased from 1 June.  The Minister for Health will announce the revised limit in due course.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Health Services</i></P>
    <P>I should remark at this point that the Estimates allow for almost £1,200 million in 1986 for health services.  That is a significant sum in the overall budget context. In line with <i>Building on Reality,</i> the Government's expressed intention is to concentrate resources on the prevention of illness, on community services, on services for the handicapped and on essential improvements.  Achievement of these aims will require some rationalisation of services by removing unnecessary and obsolete facilities and institutions which, having regard to recent and projected developments, are no longer necessary in a modern health service.</P>
    <P>Allocations to health agencies supplemented by these savings will allow extra expenditure of £250,000 to extend the measles vaccination scheme and funding to open an adult mentally-handicapped 70-place day facility at Belcamp in Dublin, a major new complex at Swinford in County Mayo, a geriatric assessment unit at Ardkeen, County Waterford, and the commissioning of the CAT scanner at the Regional Hospital in Galway.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Equal Treatment</i></P>
    <P>The legislation to provide equal treatment as between men and women in matters of social security was enacted by the Oireachtas last year.  For a number of mainly practical reasons reflecting the <Col N="945" /> complexity of the provisions, the legislation has not yet taken effect.  Implementation will start, however, during the first half of this year and has been provided for in this year's Estimates.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Child Benefit Scheme</i></P>
    <P>The introduction of a full child benefit scheme along the lines envisaged in the national plan will not be possible this year for administrative and technical reasons. In these circumstances the Government have decided to introduce, with effect from April 1986, a new monthly child benefit payment of £15.05 for each of the first five children, as compared with the existing children's allowance rate of £12.05.  The present differential of £6.70 in respect of the sixth and subsequent children will be maintained, giving a new rate of £21.75 a month.</P>
    <P>This payment will replace most of the existing child support schemes and will involve expenditure of £33.3 million more than would have been incurred on the existing scheme of children's allowances.</P>
    <P>The resources for this payment will be provided by adding together</P>
    <P>&mdash;the funds that would otherwise be used for the children's allowance scheme</P>
    <P>&mdash;the funds that would have been used for the budgetary increase which would otherwise have been made in the rates of social welfare weekly child dependant allowance</P>
    <P>&mdash;the extra revenue which will accrue from the abolition, from next April, of the present £100 child tax allowance</P>
    <P>&mdash;a further allocation of £11.1 million from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The combination of measures involved in the new payment will ensure that, as intended in the national plan, the effect will be to achieve a more selective distribution of resources.  Lower-income families on social welfare or below the tax threshold will benefit while the position <Col N="946" /> of standard rate taxpayers will be protected. It is important, of course, that the new scheme be seen in terms of its combined effect for the family on the taxation and social welfare sides.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Family Income Supplement</i></P>
    <P>The weekly income criteria which determine entitlements to the family income supplement scheme will be increased in line with today's budget increases in short-term social welfare benefits and changes in personal income taxation.  As the child benefit scheme to be introduced in April is somewhat more limited in scope than was envisaged in the national plan, the Government have decided to increase from 25 per cent to 33½ per cent the rate of payment under the family income supplement scheme. These changes will increase the cost of the scheme by about £1 million this year and will enhance the position of low-income employees with dependants.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Other Social Welfare Adjustments</i></P>
    <P>When the abridged Estimates volume was published last December, certain projections were made regarding the level of unemployment and of PRSI receipts. In the light of the preliminary 1985 outturn figures and other data now available, some adjustments to the 1986 Estimates would be prudent.  First, due mainly to a revised assesment of the likely level of participation in special employment and training schemes, I am providing an extra £9.2 million for unemployment payments.  Second, PRSI receipts are likely to be about £9 million lower than previously projected.  However, end-year savings on other welfare subheads indicate that similar savings will be possible this year, and these, together with certain other adjustments, give a net increased requirement of over £6 million as set out in the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>SPECIAL EXPENDITURE PROVISIONS</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>National Youth Policy</i></P>
    <P>As indicated in their National Youth <Col N="947" /> Policy published at the end of December, the Government are providing an additional £2 million in 1986 for the implementation of the provisions of the policy. The additional funds will be directed mainly towards continued development and promotion of services for young people, both in urban and rural areas of special need.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Additional Allocations for Sport:</i></P>
    <P>
      <i>Olympic Council of Ireland</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am providing a grant of £250,000 to the Olympic Council of Ireland in 1986 towards the preparation of our athletes for the 1988 Olympic Games.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Racing Board</i>
    </P>
    <P>In order to improve the general standard of racing here and to encourage owners and breeders to keep more horses in training and thereby maximise employmenmt in the industry, I have decided to make £250,000 available to the Racing Board towards increasing the prize money for national hunt racing.  I am hopeful that this gesture will in turn lead to increased sponsorship from the private sector for this side of racing.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Bord na gCon</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am providing £50,000 to increase the prize money available to Bord na gCon for greyhound racing.  I expect the increased prize fund will enable the bord to mount a better racing programme so as to attract greater attendances and in turn to undertake the upgrading of those tracks that need improvement.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Sports Scholarships</i>
      </P>
      <P>I am allocating a further £100,000 to enable scholarships to be awarded to outstanding athletes to enable them to undertake training and competition at the highest level.</P>
      <P>&mdash;<i>&ldquo;Women in Business Enterprise&rdquo;</i></P>
      <P>The Government have decided to maker a special allocation of £150,000 to develop and extend the &ldquo;Women in Business Enterprise&rdquo; programme of activities to be pursued by the Minister of State for Women's Affairs.</P>
      <P>&mdash;<i>Voluntary Organisations Involved in Cross-Border Co-operation</i></P>
      <P>The Government have decided to provide a further £100,000 assistance to voluntary organisations involved in cross-Border co-operation in addition to the £150,000 already in the Estimates.  This substantial increase indicates the Government's commitment to encouraging their work, which plays a unique role in promoting dialogue between the divided people of the North and between North and South.</P>
      <P>&mdash;<i>Limerick Civic Trust</i></P>
      <P>The Limerick Civic Trust is a charitable trust engaged in the restoration and rehabilitation of derelict sites and buildings. It is funded by covenants from local industry.  In recognition of their work the Government have decided to make a special contribution of £100,000 to the trust.</P>
      <P>&mdash;<i>Voluntary Organisations</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year we increased the allocation for once-off grants to voluntary organisations undertaking projects in the social services area to £650,000.  This is a scheme which has had an impact far beyond the resources devoted to it.  The Government feel that it would be very much worthwhile to give an additional <Col N="949" /> £100,000 to such projects this year, bringing the total amount available to these organisations from the Exchequer to £750,000.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Arts Council</i></P>
    <P>I am making a special grant of £100,000 to the Arts Council to enable them to match the very generous assistance of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation to the Arts Community Education Project.  This project is designed to develop and support projects in community arts and arts education in Ireland.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Cork Opera House</i></P>
    <P>A sum of £50,000 is being provided to the Cork Opera House to enable it to overcome its financial difficulties and to assist its continuing operation in 1986.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Cork (800) Enterprise Board</i></P>
    <P>Last year the &ldquo;Cork 800&rdquo; proved to be very successful in restoring a sense of confidence to the people of Cork and provided substantial economic benefits for the city.  A permanent committee of the Cork Enterprise Board has now been formed with the intention of continuing the work done last year for the &ldquo;Cork 800&rdquo;.  A once-off grant of £50,000 is being provided to this committee to help them get established.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Irish Labour History Society</i></P>
    <P>The Government have decided to make a grant of £100,000 to the Irish Labour History Society to help towards the establishment of a labour history museum in Dublin.  This grant coincides with the celebration of the centenary of the Dublin Council of Trade Unions which is also to be marked this year by the issue of a commemorative stamp.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>National Parents' Council</i></P>
    <P>A sum of £50,000 is being provided for the National Parents' Council which was set up last year on the initiative of the Minister for Education.  It is recognised <Col N="950" /> that this council requires some further finance to set up its structures and to be in a position to generate its own funds. This grant is a once-off payment to be made in 1986.</P>

    <P>&mdash;<i>Welfare of Emigrants Abroad</i></P>
    <P>It has been decided that the grant for the welfare and advisory services for Irish emigrants abroad is to be increased by £50,000 over and above the £150,000 already provided in the 1986 Estimates.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals</i></P>
    <P>The Government have decided to make a special payment of £25,000 to the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to animals in recognition of their valuable work.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Irish Youth Orchestra</i></P>
    <P>A sum of £15,000 is being provided to the Irish Youth Orchestra to assist it in its activities this year.</P>
    <P>NATIONAL LOTTERY</P>
    <P>The National Lottery is to be operated by An Post for an initial period subject to settlement of satisfactory terms.  The funds generated will be used for the funding of sports and recreation facilities, national culture including the Irish language, the arts and health services.  I will shortly introduce a Bill in this House which will provide for the establishment and operation of the National Lottery.  It is not possible at this stage to predict the State's income from the lottery in 1986 <Col N="951" /> and so the budget takes no account of this.  The Government are of course concerned to ensure that the good work funded by existing charitable and other voluntary lotteries which operate nationally does not suffer as a result of the operation of the National Lottery and appropriate arrangements are in train to ensure this.</P>
    <P>CENTRAL FUND SERVICES</P>
    <P>The estimate for expenditure on Central Fund Services this year at £2,290 million, is £76 million or 3 per cent greater than the 1985 outturn.  The debt service component, which is up by £53 million on the 1985 figure, accounts for the bulk of this increase.  The increase in the estimate is the smallest for many years and reflects in a very tangible way the benefits of the fall in interest rates since this time last year, as well as the weakening of the US dollar.  It is still imperative, however, to contain the level of Government borrowing and so reduce the pressure on the public finances and the balance of payments.  Interest payments this year will absorb 30 per cent of our tax revenue, as compared with 19 per cent in 1977.  Foreign interest payments in 1985, at £780 million, were considerably in excess of the balance of payments deficit on current account.</P>
    <P Just="Center">OVERALL CURRENT EXPENDITURE</P>
    <P>These provisions would leave overall current expenditure at £8,097 million, which would be in excess of the 1986 national plan figures.</P>
    <P>Work on identifying scope for achieving further reductions in current expenditure has continued in the period since the Estimates were published.  This work, and the availability of actual expenditure returns for 1985, have enabled the Government to make net additional reductions totalling £55.2 million on the published figures, inclusive of the net additional requirement of over £6 million for the Social Welfare Vote which I <Col N="952" /> referred to earlier.  Details of the changes are set out in the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These reductions, together with the other expenditure matters to which I have already referred, bring the figure for overall current expenditure down to £8,042 million, almost exactly the 1986 national plan figure.  Expenditure on the non-capital supply services will amount to £5,752 million.  This is equivalent to some 34 per cent of GNP compared with 34½ per cent in 1985.  We intend to continue our efforts to reduce the burdern of day-to-day expenditure in the years ahead.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TAXATION</P>
    <P>TAXATION POLICY</P>
    <P>Last year I introduced radical changes in the structures of income tax and VAT. My purpose was to simplify these taxes, to make them fairer and to remodel the tax system in a manner that would have substantial economic benefits.  These changes were generally welcomed.  What I propose to do this year is to build on these improvements and sustain the momentum for progress.</P>
    <P>In the 1985 budget I also fulfilled the general commitment on taxation in the national plan that there would be no increase in the overall level of taxation over the period of the plan.  While there must be some increases in taxation on this occasion, the burden of tax this year will be within the ceiling set by the plan. It remains the view of the Government that the overall level of taxation is as high as it can reasonably go.  The emphasis in the period ahead must be on sharing the burden of taxation on a wider basis, simplifying the tax code, improving collection procedures and reducing tax levels as far as reasonably possible.</P>
    <P>INDIRECT TAXATION</P>
    <P>The achievement of this year's budgetary objectives requires increases in indirect taxes.  The ratio of the main indirect taxes to GNP fell from 17.7 per <Col N="953" /> cent in 1984 to 17.4 per cent last year or by the equivalent of about £60 million. While this fall resulted in part from the selective reductions which were made in certain areas last year, a more important factor was that the major VAT restructuring undertaken in 1985 turned out to be more liberal that originally intended. In tailoring today's measures I have been particularly conscious of the needs of the tourist industry and other labour-intensive services as well as the needs of the motor trade.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Value-Added Tax</i></P>
    <P>Today's VAT changes involve an increase of 2 per cent in the standard rate combined with substantial reductions in tax on key services.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Standard Rate</i>
    </P>
    <P>I consider that the change in the stand-are rate is more justified at this time than an increase in either the zero rate or the 10 per cent rate.  The benefit of last year's substantial reduction in the standard VAT rate from 35 per cent to 23 per cent for the many categories of expenditure concerned will still be largely maintained. The yield from this increase will be £76.7 million in 1986 before allowing for the costs of the reductions in respect of meals and certain services.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Meals</i>
    </P>
    <P>At present, meals in canteens, restaurants and hotels and catering establishments generally are liable to VAT at 23 per cent.  A very strong case has been made to me concerning the beneficial effects which a reduction in this rate would have for tourism, employment and consumers generally.  Expenditure on meals constitutes a significant proportion of tourist spending and I am confident that a VAT reduction can give a significant boost to tourism, both foreign and domestic.</P>
    <P>Domestic consumers will also benefit through lower prices in staff canteens and other catering establishments.  Furthermore, this sector is a significant source <Col N="954" /> of employment and its potential for job creation will be stimulated by lower indirect tax rates.  I propose, therefore, to reduce the rate on meals generally to 10 per cent with effect from 1 July next. This will allow price reductions from existing levels of the order of 10½ per cent.  While the 25 per cent rate must, because of budgetary constraints, apply in the March to June period, I am confident that the announced reduction to 10 per cent will enable this sector to respond in a positive way in advance of the 1 July reduction.  As a rationalisation measure, hot take-away food which is currently zero-rated will also be liable at 10 per cent from 1 July.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of these changes will be £11.3 million this year and £37.8 million in a full year.  As I have said, I expect that this measure will be of considerable assistance to tourism.  Almost one-fifth of expenditure on meals in restaurants and hotels is incurred by foreign tourists, while almost one-seventh is incurred by domestic tourists.  Two-thirds of the expenditure is incurred by domestic non-tourists.  The VAT reduction will enhance the ability of our hotels and restaurants to attract business in these market segments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not overlook the fact that almost 40 per cent of non-tourist expenditure on meals out of the home is accounted for by staff canteens in factories and offices, and that by far the greater part of the remaining expenditure is on everyday lunches, meals and snacks in ordinary restaurants and cafes.  The proposed VAT reduction will therefore bring a direct benefit to a great many <Col N="955" /> people during the course of their normal daily activities.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Touring Coaches</i>
    </P>
    <P>As an additional stimulus to tourism, I propose to introduce, with effect from 1 March, a special VAT refund system which will effectively reduce VAT to 10 per cent on the purchase of certain high-cost touring coaches used in the tourist industry.  The cost this year is estimated at £250,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Selected Services</i>
    </P>
    <P>As a further measure to give a boost to employment, the rate of VAT on selected services will be reduced to 10 per cent which should, as in the case of meals, allow for price reductions from existing levels of the order of 10½ per cent.  The main areas affected will be hairdressing and similar personal services, laundry and dry-cleaning, repairs to electrical and most other goods, cleaning services, and cinema admissions and certain travelling funfairs.</P>

      <P>I detect a certain slowing down on the other side of the House.  As a rationalisation measure, the reduction to 10 per cent will also be extended to certain entertainment associated with the supply of meals and drink.  These changes will take effect on 1 July.  The cost this year will be £6 million and £20 million in a full year.  The combined impact of this change and the reduction to 10 per cent in VAT on meals will reduce by over two-thirds the services component of the VAT base covered by the present standard rate.</P>
      <P>I propose to exempt from VAT from 1 July 1986 the services supplied by dental technicians which are at present taxable. A provision to this effect will be included in the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of the increase in the standard rate to 25 per cent, the flat-rate VAT rebate for unregistered farmers and the associated VAT charge on livestock will be increased to 2.4 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="956" /> The net yield from VAT changes I have announced today will be £59.2 million in the current year and £53 million in a full year.  The impact on consumer prices of today's proposed VAT changes will be less than 0.2p in the pound.  The long-term benefits for tourism and employment generally should be very favourable.</P>
    <P>I am proposing increases in excise duties on a number of commodities.  The increase in the standard rate of VAT will, of course, affect these commodities from 1 March next.  The following excise duty increases, including consequential VAT at the present 23 per cent rate, will apply with immediate effect:</P>

      <P>
        <i>Yield from Excise Increases</i>
      </P>
      <P>The yield from the excise increases, including the cost of some restructuring of wine duties which I will mention later, is estimated at £38.4 million in 1986 and £44.3 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>The excise duty increases will take effect from midnight tonight.  There should be no increase in the price of goods already in the shops, as the higher duty will apply only to goods imported or removed from bond from midnight tonight.</P>
      <P>There are some other changes I propose to make in the excise area.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Reduction in Duty on Cars</i>
      </P>
      <P>As a concession to the motor trade at a time of difficult trading conditions, I propose, in order to offset the VAT rate increase on cars, to reduce with effect from 1 March next the excise duty on category A motor vehicles.  The duty will be reduced by 1.3 percentage points.  The cost of this reduction in 1986 is estimated at £6 million.  The combined effect on car prices of this excise reduction and the VAT increase will therefore be neutral.</P>
      <P>I propose to make a number of other changes designed also to benefit the motor trade.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Reductions in Duties on Motor Vehicle Spare Parts and Tyres</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I announced in last year's budget a reduction from 25 per cent to 10 per cent in the duty on motor vehicle parts.  Under the arrangements already agreed with the trade, the 10 per cent duty rate is to apply <Col N="958" /> from February 1986.  I now propose to phase out the remaining 10 per cent duty and discussions on timing will be held with the trade.  I am allowing £500,000 to cover the cost which is expected to arise in 1986.  The full year cost of this concession is estimated at about £3 million.</P>
    <P>I propose also to abolish the duty on tyres and tubes.  The timing of the abolition of this duty, which amounts to about 4 per cent of the retail price, will be discussed with the trade.  I am providing £1 million to cover the cost in 1986.  The full-year cost of abolition is estimated at about £3 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Duty on Made Wine and Fortified Wines</i>
    </P>
    <P>The duty on made wine will be brought into line with that on wine in order to meet EC requirements.  I propose also to restructure the duty bands on fortified wines so that a single rate of £2.90 per litre will apply to all such products in the 15 per cent to 22 per cent alcohol by volume category.  While the price of some products will increase as a result, there will be significant price reductions for port and similar products.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Duty Rebate Scheme for Table Water Manufacturers</i>
    </P>
    <P>The duty rebate scheme for Irish-based table waters manufacturers is to be phased out to comply with EC requirements. The excise duty on table waters will, however, be reduced by 1.2p per gallon from October next so that there will be no gain to the Exchequer.  Full details are set out in the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Betting Duties</i>
    </P>
    <P>I announced last year a reduction in the excise duty on off-course betting from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.  I stated that this reduction was intended to be an experiment to test whether the cost would be relatively small.  While there has been a significant increase in betting turnover, there has nevertheless been a considerable loss in revenue.  As it is too early yet <Col N="959" /> to reach a final conclusion on the success, or otherwise, of the experiment, I propose to keep the duty at its present level.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Road Tax</i></P>
    <P>I propose to simplify the rates of road tax applying to private motor cars.  There will also be increases, broadly in line with inflation, in the road tax on these vehicles designed to yield an extra £4.7 million in 1986 and £5.5 million in a full year.  The new table of rates, which will apply from 1 March next, is set out in the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>NEED FOR FURTHER MEASURES</P>
    <P>As I stated at the outset, the Government have decided that the current deficit must be set this year at a level that will reduce it from 8.2 per cent of GNP to 7.4 per cent but that, nevertheless, there should be substantial relief for personal taxpayers from April next.</P>
    <P>To achieve both aims the Government have decided on new tax measures which will substantially alter the overall structure of taxation.  Before I come to these, however, I want to turn to the matter of due compliance by taxpayers, so that all will make their fair contribution.</P>
    <P>TAX COLLECTION AND ENFORCEMENT</P>
    <P>The problems of tax collection and enforcement have been accentuated in recent years by the recession and the resultant trading difficulties for many firms and companies.  Nevertheless, this administration have, more than any previous one, recognised the importance from a tax equity viewpoint of a better tax collection and enforcement system. We have, accordingly, introduced a number of important legislative and other measures to improve compliance and penalise default.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that in October last the Taoiseach announced in this House a number of wide-ranging measures to improve tax collection and enforcement. These included a number of measures <Col N="960" /> directed towards a new organisational emphasis on collection.  In particular, the transfer of tax enforcement work from county registrars to sheriffs was decided on.  The Revenue Commissioners are now in the process of preparing for the issue of cases for enforcement to the sheriffs as soon as they are appointed, to ensure the effective launching of the new scheme of enforcement which will be introduced on a phased basis in the coming months.</P>
    <P>TAX AND SOCIAL WELFARE AMNESTY</P>
    <P>The Government are determined that the fight against tax evasion will be intensified. They are also, however, willing to give an opportunity to those who have defaulted in the past to rectify their situation. I wish to announce therefore that an amnesty from prosecution and the application of the penalties provided for tax evasion will be available to those who comply fully with its conditions within a strictly limited period of six months.  The conditions of the amnesty are as follows:</P>
    <P>Defaulters must within six months from today's date&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  disclose to the Revenue Commissioners the fact that they had engaged in tax evasion;</P>
    <P>(b)  detail the manner and extent of all their evasions;</P>
    <P>(c)  produce details of their assets, deposits and other holdings; and</P>
    <P>(d)  make a substantial payment on account of the tax evaded and agree a schedule of payments over a limited period to clear the full amount due to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Full information about the arrangements for the amnesty will be published by the Revenue Commissioners. I must stress that evaders and defaulters who fail to avail of the amnesty will be subject to the full rigour of the additional anti-evasion measures <Col N="961" /> announced last October and when detected will face a tough enforcement regime including terms of imprisonment of up to five years for serious offences. The amnesty will not apply to cases already under investigation.</P>
      <P>The Government have also decided on a social welfare amnesty which will take the form of an amnesty from prosecution for those who come forward within the six months period from 29 January 1986 admitting to existing or earlier irregularities in relation to the social welfare system.  This amnesty will not apply to cases already under investigation nor will it extend to a waiver of a requirement to repay any moneys obtained over and above legitimate entitlements.</P>
      <P>A number of specific additional measures to help prevent tax evasion will be introduced.  As Deputies will be aware, it is now a condition of the house improvements grants scheme that contractors employed on grant-aided work must furnish their tax number.  A corresponding condition is to be introduced in relation to the new house grant and mortgage subsidy and suitable arrangements for this purpose are being drawn up in consultation with the Minister for the Environment.  The detailed measures for the implementation of this requirement will be announced shortly.</P>
      <P>Legislation which is to be introduced shortly by the Minister for Health to amend the provisions of the Act under which the VHI Board operate will provide that the board will be required to disclose information to the Revenue Commissioners as to payments made to or in respect of subscribers on foot of treatment expenses incurred by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I announced on 22 May last year, in the course of the discussion in Seanad Éireann on the Finance Bill, that I proposed to introduce legislation to counter abuse of partnership arrangements for tax avoidance purposes.  Such arrangements had been used to create losses artificially which were then set off against the general incomes of the limited partners. I served notice at the time that this legislation would have retrospective <Col N="962" /> effect from the date of my announcement. The legislation required will be incorporated in the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The tax collection and enforcement package announced last October in conjunction with the measures announced today will have a beneficial effect on yield, particularly in the longer term.  I have allowed for an additional £15 million in 1986.</P>
    <P>TAXATION OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS</P>
    <P>Existing arrangements for taxation of deposit interest are unsatisfactory.  They give undue advantage to some financial institutions and there have been repeated demands for harmonisation.  I propose to make a significant change in the direction of equal treatment of the main deposit-taking institutions.  This will also ensure more orderly tax procedures, more effective countering of tax evasion and increased revenue.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, with effect from 6 April 1986, a retention tax, at a rate of 35 per cent, will be deducted at source out of interest paid or credited on bank and building society deposits in the beneficial ownership of residents.  Companies may offset the tax retained against liability to corporation tax and individuals liable at the higher rates will be taxed on their gross interest at the difference between the standard rate and the appropriate higher rate.  The present composite rate tax arrangement with the building societies will not apply for 1986-87 and subsequent years and the interest reliefs available on deposits with certain banks and other institutions will be terminated as from 6 April 1986.  Returns to the Revenue Commissioners by the financial institutions of interest paid on deposits subject to the retention tax will not be required.  To obtain exclusion from the retention tax a new form of declaration, which must be held available for inspection by the Revenue Commissioners, will be required in respect of non-resident accounts with building societies and banks.  However, in the case of banks, <Col N="963" /> notices of non-residence exempting interest on existing accounts from inclusion in returns by the banks for tax purposes will, for a period of one year, satisfy the requirement for a new declaration.  To deal with bogus non-resident accounts.  I propose to introduce legislation in the Finance Bill to empower the Revenue Commissioners to require details of existing non-resident deposits in certain cases. The requirements will operate only in respect of deposit accounts, the balances on which at 29 January 1986 are reduced by more thanm 25 per cent at any time between that date and 5 April 1987.  Further details are given in the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;.  The net additional yield from these measures in 1986 is estimated at £75 million.</P>
    <P>Life assurance companies and their investors benefit from exceptionally generous tax reliefs which are difficult to justify in today's conditions.  In particular, much of the investment in these companies is of a short-term nature.  The changes in this area were already foreshadowed in my 1983 budget statement.  It has now been decided to impose a charge of 15 per cent on the gross investment income and the surplus on the realisation of investments of life assurance companies, with the exception of their pension business and foreign business.  The charge will be collected from the assurance companies on an annual basis.  The first payment of this charge will be in October 1986 and will be based on the companies' investment income and surplus in 1985.  The estimated yield this year is of the order of £38 million.</P>
    <P>The bank levy will again apply in 1986 at a level of £25 million.</P>
    <P>CAPITAL ALLOWANCES</P>
    <P>Capital allowances on plant and machinery are given at present without regard to IDA or other grants paid from State sources.  This means that the Exchequer is extending a full measure of relief from taxation on expenditure on <Col N="964" /> plant and machinery which, effectively, the Exchequer itself has incurred.  I propose to abolish this anomaly in the Finance Bill with effect from today.  This change will yield some £18 million in a full year of operation and will have the desirable effect of correcting to some extent the perceived bias in the tax system, for which capital allowances are largely responsible, in favour of capital and against labour.</P>
    <P>The existing arrangements, however, will be continued for capital allowances on plant and machinery in respect of which State grants have already been approved but not paid or which are currently the subject of negotiation with the industrial development agencies, subject to the grants now under negotiation being approved for payment at the latest before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>TAX-BASED FINANCING</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the system of tax-based financing as it operates at present. It now costs the State over £170 million annually despite the restrictions I imposed in 1984.  The exclusion of any State grant in determining capital allowances on plant and machinery will have an inhibiting effect on tax-based leasing and I do not propose at this stage to introduce any further restriction on that form of tax-based financing.  As regards the other form of such financing, known generally as &ldquo;section 84&rdquo; lending, under which interest received by the lender is not liable to corporation tax, I am imposing a special duty at a flat rate of 12 per cent on all such interest received after today under section 84 loan agreements.  The duty will come into effect under a Government order made today.  It will be payable on a half-yearly basis and the first payment will be due in August 1986. The estimated yield in 1986 is £6 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Stock relief was introduced in the Finance Act, 1975 as a measure of relief against inflation.  Now that the rate of inflation has been reduced to a low level, there is no justification for the continuation of this relief and so it will not be renewed this year for companies and traders.  The present stock relief arrangements for farmers will be continued in view of recent adverse trends in agriculture and the forthcoming change-over to the farm tax system.  This will cost £0.5 million in 1986.</P>
      <P>TAX INCENTIVES FOR BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION</P>
      <P>Preparations are going ahead for the implementation of the tax incentives for development of the Custom House dock site and other inner-city areas in Dublin, Cork and Limerick announced by the Taoiseach in this House on 23 October last.  The details of these incentives will be incorporated in the Finance Bill.  The initial response to this policy announcement has been most encouraging and it is confidently expected that it will lead quickly to a substantial increase in building activity in depressed inner-city areas. In the longer term, it will bring a new vitality to these areas as they are redeveloped.</P>

      <P>IMPROVING THE INVESTMENT CLIMATE FOR IRISH INDUSTRY</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will introduce in the Finance Bill an incentive to increase the share of private investment in research and new product development.  Personal investors in partnerships set up specially for research and development will be allowed to write off relevant expenses against general income for tax purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="966" /> The 10 per cent rate of corporation tax on profits of manufacturing industry and certain services has proved to be very effective as an incentive to attract foreign investment projects to Ireland.  Unlike export sales relief, however, the incentive has limited value to the Irish investor relative to investments in other, nonindustrial areas.  I believe that this has been an important factor in the weakness of Irish-owned industry, which has been manifested in a lack of equity investment and a low number of new entrepreneurs and projects coming forward.</P>
    <P>I propose to introduce a scheme to increase the attractiveness to private investors of taking shares in companies qualifying for the 10 per cent rate, by reducing the tax take on income from dividends paid by these companies. There will be specified limitations on the application of this relief and the details will be incorporated in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>CAPITAL GAINS TAX</P>
    <P>The rate of tax on longer-term capital gains is being reduced from 40 per cent to 35 per cent in respect of gains arising on or after 6 April next.  Gains on assets held for three years or more are not speculative in nature and, consequently, it is reasonable that the rate of tax on them should be lowered to encourage longer-term investment.</P>
    <P>DISCRETIONARY TRUSTS</P>
    <P>There will be a 1 per cent annual charge on property held in those discretionary trusts which were made subject to the 3 per cent once-off charge introduced in 1984, that is, trusts where the settlor is deceased and no one of the principal beneficiaries of the trust is under 25 years of age.</P>
    <P>INCOME TAX</P>
    <P>The commitment in the national plan in respect of personal taxation is to adjust bands and allowances so that the overall income tax burden will not be increased. The income tax changes in this budget go <Col N="967" /> far beyond this commitment.  Despite the difficult financial situation and the pressures for higher tax revenue, the Government recognise the pressing necessity to reduce the burden of income tax significantly for all taxpayers.  To give effect to this reduction I propose a range of changes which I will now outline to the House:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the income levy of 1 per cent, which I introduced as a temporary measure in 1983 and which I moderated in both 1984 and 1985, is being discontinued;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the personal allowance is being increased from £3,800 to £4,000 for a married couple and from £1,900 to £2,000 for a single person; the widowed allowance, the single parent allowance and the widowed parent allowance are also being increased by £100 to £2,500, £2,000 and £1,500 respectively;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the PAYE allowance is being increased from £600 to £700;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the standard rate tax band of 35 per cent is being widened from £9,000 to £9,400 for married persons and from £4,500 to £4,700 for single persons; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the top rate of tax is being reduced from 60 per cent to 58 per cent.</P>
    <P>As an additional benefit for older taxpayers, the age exemption limit is being increased from £3,000 to £3,150 for persons aged 65 years or over and from £3,500 to £3,675 for persons aged 75 years or over.  These limits will be doubled for married couples.  I am also doubling the age allowance from £100 to £200 for single persons and from £200 to £400 for married couples.</P>
    <P>The cost of these large-scale adjustments will be £121 million in 1986 and £205 million in a full year.  This scale of improvement goes well beyond any tax concessions made in recent years.  It more than doubles the commitment given in the national plan to adjust income tax bands and allowances.  Taking the child <Col N="968" /> benefit scheme into account, there are substantial improvements for all taxpayers. Approximately 12,000 persons will be removed from the tax net entirely and 191,000 persons will have lower marginal rates of tax.</P>

I have consistently acknowledged that personal tax levels are high and that this situation must be rectified by widening the tax base.  As well as being a burden on individuals and families, high tax rates act as a disincentive to employment, discourage initiative and ultimately slow down economic activity.  It is imperative, therefore, that every reasonable effort be made, taking account of the financial constraints, to secure an improvement.  This is being achieved today by shifting some of the burden to areas which enjoy relatively favourable tax conditions.</P>
      <P>Today's changes are designed to distribute the benefits as equitably as possible among those subject to our highly-progressive system of income taxation.</P>
      <P>The removal of the income levy will be particularly welcomed.  In devising a package of adjustments I considered this to be a priority as the levy is imposed on gross income, without the benefit of reliefs and allowances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The personal allowances are being increased so that those at the lower end of the tax net will benefit. The increase here, combined with the increase in the PAYE allowance and the 35 per cent band, postpone the entry into the higher tax bands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the PAYE taxpayer is so immediately <Col N="969" /> taxed, it is appropriate that there should be some increase in the PAYE allowance.</P>
    <P>The overall objectives of these income tax changes is to improve incentive at all levels in the system, while concentrating the greatest possible proportion of the overall relief in the lower and middle income groups.</P>
    <P>The standard 35 per cent rate band is being widened so as to improve further the position of taxpayers in the middle income group.  Our long term objective must be to bring a far greater proportion of taxpayers into this band.</P>
    <P>The reduction of the top rate of income tax from 60 per cent to 58 per cent is a recognition of the fact that high marginal tax rates tend to have a disincentive effect particularly when, as for single people, they begin to apply at income levels which are not uncommon among those who have particular skills which we need to develop and deploy effectively in both the private and public sectors.</P>
    <P>Special attention is also given to the older taxpayer by the increase in the age exemption limits and the doubling of the age allowance.</P>
    <P>As part of the new child benefit scheme, the income tax child allowance of £100 is being withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This will provide additional revenue of £18 million in 1986.  This will, however, be more than offset by the improvements in direct payments for children which I have outlined earlier.</P>
      <P>The PRSI tax allowance is being renewed at an estimated cost of £49.6 million in 1986.</P>
      <P>&mdash;<i>Farmer Taxation</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements are going ahead for the introduction of the farm tax.  An announcement will be made later as to the level of adjusted acreage above which the tax will apply in 1986.  Since this level will not be lower than 80 adjusted acres, the income tax system will continue to apply <Col N="970" /> to all farmers for the income tax year 1986-87.  The Finance Bill will provide that farm tax paid will be allowed as an income tax credit, as provided for in the national plan.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Taxation of the Self-Employed</i></P>
    <P>It has not been possible to introduce a current year basis of assessment for the self-employed.  Some of the reasons for this are administrative, and some are inherent in the very concept itself.  Self-employed persons will continue, therefore, to be taxed on a previous year basis. This carries advantages for them.  In exercising their right to appeal, self-employed taxpayers are required to pay an amount equivalent to 85 per cent of the final amount due in order to avoid an interest charge.  For companies, the specified amount is 80 per cent.  I am proposing that this specified amount be increased to 90 per cent both for individuals and companies.  The new figure will apply for income tax for 1986-87 and subsequent years and for corporation tax for accounting periods ending in 1986-87 and subsequent accounting periods.  The change will produce additional revenue of £8.4 million in 1986.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Age of Majority</i></P>
    <P>The age of Majority Act, 1985, reduced the age of majority from 21 to 18.  Provisions will be incorporated in the Finance Bill to bring the appropriate provisions of tax legislation into line with the provisions of the Act.  One effect of this change will be that a parent will be in a position to covenant part of his or her income in favour of a child aged 18 years of over, subject to a limit of 5 per cent of income and for a period of six years.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PUBLIC CAPITAL PROGRAMME</P>
    <P>The published Public Capital Programme for 1986 at £1,706 million is consistent with the medium term framework for capital investment set out in <i>Building on Reality</i>.  The Government are committed to a strategy of balanced national investment to stimulate growth <Col N="971" /> and employment in the economy and are determined to keep the focus of Departmental capital spending on the achievement of plan targets.  Within these parameters, end-1985 expenditure returns from Departments, together with lower inflation indicate that there is scope for reducing published cash allocations while maintaining the impetus of the programme.  The Government have, accordingly, made net reductions totalling £25 million in these figures, and details of these changes are listed in the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;. There is one special extra provision incorporated in this figure which I wish to mention.</P>
    <P>SPECIAL AID PACKAGE FOR BANTRY REGION</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste announced last December details of the arrangements under which Chevron Ltd. transferred ownership of the oil terminal at Whiddy to the State.  The Tánaiste said then that the Government were examining the prospects of promoting additional investment in the Bantry area.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Jim O'Keeffe TD, is conducting this examination on behalf of the Government.  Details of the precise projects to be undertaken are now being finalised.  The Government have decided to allocate £15 million over a four-year period for development in the west Cork area with particular emphasis on Bantry as its development centre.  I am making provision for £3 million of capital expenditure in 1986.  Details of the projects in this provision and in the total development will be announced in the very near future.</P>
    <P>EXCHEQUER BORROWING REQUIREMENT FOR CAPITAL PURPOSES</P>
    <P>These revisions, coupled with the latest estimates of Exchequer capital resources, reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirement for capital purposes to £751 million.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="972" /> POST-BUDGET CURRENT REVENUE</P>
    <P>The net effect of the tax proposals which I have outlined will be to raise £154 million this year.  This includes a net loss of £25 million from renewal of temporary tax measures and takes account of the abolition of the temporary income levy at a loss to the Exchequer of £45 million this year.  The budget as a whole will have a neutral impact on total revenue buoyancy but the composition of buoyancy as between direct and indirect tax revenue will be altered as compared with the pre-budget forecast.  Total tax revenue in 1986 is now estimated at £6,117 million, some 36.2 per cent of GNP, and thus remains within the ceiling set in <i>Building on Reality</i>.  Today's tax proposals involve a significant shift in the distribution of the tax burden away from direct taxation of wages and salaries.  They mean higher net take-home pay for workers. While the proposals will raise the consumer price index by about one-half of a percentage point this still leaves the projected inflation rate for 1986 at about 4½ per cent.  The Government firmly believe that it is beneficial to alter the balance of the tax burden in this manner. Total current revenue is estimated at £6,792 million.</P>
    <P Just="Center">DEFICIT AND BORROWING REQUIREMENT</P>
    <P>The estimated current deficit for 1986 is £1,250 million or 7.4 per cent of GNP and the overall Exchequer borrowing requirement is £2,001 million, which is 11.8 per cent of GNP.  The outturn for 1985 on the deficit was £1,284 million, 8.2 per cent of GNP and for overall Exchequer borrowing £2,015 million, 12.9 per cent of GNP.  The total public sector borrowing requirement for 1986 will be £2,394 million, 14.2 per cent of GNP compared with a figure of 15.7 per cent in 1985.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CONCLUSION</P>
    <P>Today's Budget is designed to make <Col N="973" /> further progress in dealing with the imbalance in our public finances while avoiding any overall deflationary impact on the economy.  The post-Budget figures for expenditure, revenue, the current budget deficit and the Exchequer borrowing requirement have all been drawn up on that basis.</P>
    <P>I believe, however, that there are grounds for taking a more sanguine view than that conveyed by the budget figures. The shift in the balance of income taxation brought about by today's changes in personal taxation and in the taxation of financial institutions and financial assets will, in my view, tend to shift the pattern of expenditure in a way which will be favourable to the expansion of economic activity.  I believe that today's Budget will have a positive effect on economic behaviour which is not immediately measurable but which will add substantially to the growth potential of the economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="974" /> There is a general expectation that there will be a continuing decline in the dollar exchange rate and in international interest rates.  Since the national plan was published, changes in these two key variables have exceeded our expectations. We cannot rule out the possibility that that will continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>There is an even stronger expectation that oil prices will continue to decline, perhaps even more rapidly than had been expected up to recent weeks.  The combination of these factors through the year could release expenditure into activity-generating areas, with consequent benefits in terms of employment and overall economic activity.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to quantify any of these effects, and the budget arithmetic makes no allowance for them.  Nevertheless, they could add up to a useful further impetus for expansion.  This year's budget will allow us to capitalise on them to the maximum possible extent.</P>

    <P>(1) Prior to 1983, debt service costs paid from the supply services were included under this heading.  As part of the revised functional classification of expenditure, these costs (e.g. Exchequer subsidy on service costs of loans for local authority housing) are now included under the appropriate functional categories.  The total debt service cost in the Central Fund and Supply Services in 1985 was £2,197 million of which £2,043 million related to interest and £154 million to sinking funds, etc.</P>

      <P>The greeting to the Minister from the assembled benches behind him reminds me of the greeting given by the gladiators to the Roman Emperor before they perished.  It is a final salutation to the Minister from those whom he is causing to perish.  It is not just those behind the Minister who will pay the consequences of the latest in this series of cold, miserable analyses by way of budget but, much more important, those who are listening and waiting for some hope, encouragement or incentive. They have waited yet again but all they have found is a cold, detached, uninspiring analysis for the fourth year in succession.</P>
      <P>Some years ago a message of confidence and optimism was addressed to the people from this House.  This message said:</P>
      <P>Today is not a time for despair or for hopelessness in the face of the magnitude and complexity of our problems. I have faith in the Irish people's ability to set themselves with courage and determination to the task in hand and I have no doubt that we can succeed.</P>
      <P>This quotation is from the Official Report of 9 February 1983 and the speaker who gave that message of hope is none other than the speaker who, for the fourth time, delivered the same helpless, hopeless message, the current Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told that February 1983 was not a time for despair and hopelessness. If it was not, then what is the position on 29 January 1986?  Those who were facing misery three years ago are now facing chronic despair and their only consolation &mdash; if consolation it is &mdash; is that there are many more sharing their misery and despair today.  The main reason for this is the uninspiring attempt by this Minister and Government to give any direction for renewal or development based on the real rich resources of this nation &mdash; our people, our land, fisheries, forestry, tourism and so on.  By investing in the right priorities, we could create a base for activity and regeneration which would <Col N="1000" /> ensure that budget day is not just another in a series of what one might call annual crucifixions.</P>
    <P>Not even the Minister's colleagues could whip up enthusiasm to show anything like the response which is ritually given to a Minister for Finance by his own backbenchers.  This year, above all years, they would like to have had some chance to lift their spirits and to convey the message to those listening that they are of good heart, but we all know that the Government backbenchers have lost confidence in this Minister and are broadcasting it in every corner and parish in the country.</P>

      <P>If that description applied to taxation before today, the description which will be applied to it by members of the Coalition parties after today will warrant instant execution, not just trial for institutionalised robbery.  In April 1983 the Minister said he had no doubt that the Government would succeed, but his only success to date has been to spread dispair and hopelessness like a plague into every home in the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech today he mentioned the priorities he set himself.  None of the three priorities he mentioned has any relevance to the fact that it is the people who will change the face of this nation. His first priority is: what kind of budget would be most appropriate to the present state of our economy.  The people must ensure that they will have a better future <Col N="1001" /> for themselves and their families, not just fiscal aggregates and figures.  The second priority is: the public finance constraint within which the achievement of the budgetary objectives has to be approached.  His third priority is: what shifts in the balance of taxation are required by considerations of equity, efficiency and the need to tackle the black economy?  There is no reference to the real priority, that is, to end this misery, to give new hope and to demonstrate a sense of purpose and direction by investing in the real wealth of the nation.</P>
    <P>The tax allowances he should have introduced would have inspired that response but instead we are still blocking holes, sealing gaps and wondering why the nation is in such a state of depression and low morale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Three years ago the Minister said he would succeed in his aims.  Let us look at his success in terms of reality.  His first priority was to reduce the level of unemployment.  When he first addressed this House he was speaking to 170,000 people who had no work.  Now, instead of 170,000 people without work, dignity and opportunity, there are 240,000 without work, dignity and opportunity, who have to suffer the agony, indignity and frustration of unemployment every day behind closed doors.  Is that a measure of the success this Government can boast of?  Is it a success that in the last three years at least 50,000 young people have emigrated because they felt a sense of disillusionment, had no hope of a future in this country but had a sense of confidence in themselves, knowing that if they did not get a chance here, they would get on elsewhere.  What has the Minister to say to those young people today?  What have we provided for the 50,000 young people who have left us in the past three years?  According to the Minister we are providing an extra <Col N="1002" /> £50,000 for them.  It works out at about £1 per emigrant whether they be in Camden, New York, San Francisco or elsewhere and this amount is somehow to compensate them for this Government's failure to provide a place and an opportunity for them in their own home and land.  This is what the Minister boasts about after three years in office.</P>
      <P>For those of us who have remained, today's budget is the fourth annual instalment in a litany of misery and hopelessness. The Minister continues to do his budgetary sums on the proven basis of his own failure.  It is so obvious it is sad. Relentlessly, he adds to our oppression and deepends our depression.</P>
      <P>I concede one point to the Minister and the Government.  They started out with one intention &mdash; perhaps it was a good intention &mdash; of reducing the current budget deficit.  To that end they decided deliberately three years ago to increase our level of taxation to the highest level in the democratic world.  As a consequence of that mistaken decision, not only have they not reduced the deficit but they have aggravated the level of taxation to the point where we are well in excess of any other nation in the democratic world in respect of direct and indirect taxes.  Then we wonder why there is no change in the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 1983 budget the Minister promised those in employment that he would ease the burden of taxation and spread it more evenly.  That was his target and commitment in 1983. <Col N="1003" /> Even before today his success in easing the burden of taxation was to add an extra £767 million &mdash; the figures are his, not mine &mdash; to our total income tax and levies.  That is what is called reducing the burden of taxation.  Today he increased that figure by a total of £561 million and now total tax is of the order of £6.2 billion. Apparently this is the Minister's way of reducing the level of taxation.  When he came to office the figure was less than £4 billion: there has been an increase of two-thirds in total taxation in that time.</P>
      <P>His success in spreading the burden more evenly can be seen from his own admission to me in a written reply yesterday when he said that now there are 17,000 fewer PAYE taxpayers than there were in 1982-83 but the remaining taxpayers have to pay at least £1.2 billion more than was the case in 1982-83.  That is the Minister's notion of reducing the burden of taxation and spreading it more evenly.</P>
      <P>This Minister and this Government did not concern themselves with the PAYE sector when framing this budget.  The reality is that after today the increase in taxation will be of the order of £250 million, representing an increase of 9 per cent in total terms in the income tax take from last year.  If the Government's hopes are realised in respect of inflation it is evident that there will be an extra 4 per cent increase to be paid by PAYE taxpayers in addition to what they contributed last year.  Yet, we are told this Minister is concerned with spreading the burden of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case the media are tempted to respond today in the same way as they did last year to the Minister's tax reform as it was called and as they responded to the impressions he conveyed then, may I remind them of how they were taken in last year?  I wish to refer in particular to the front page of the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 31 January 1985 which had the heading, &ldquo;The taxpayers get relief&rdquo;.  This article was by the Political Correspondent, Mr. Chris Glennon.  I will quote this as a caution to those who may be tempted to respond in the same fashion to the same <Col N="1004" /> sleight-of-hand today.  Last year, after what we know now was an extra major burden on income tax payers, the <i>Irish Independent</i> made the following comment:</P>
    <P>Finance Minister, Alan Dukes, was the toast of the country last night after giving taxpayers what they have been demanding for years, a cut in income tax.</P>
    <P>This year it will be a different kind of toast that that suggested in the <i>Irish Independent</i> last year.</P>

      <P>The article made the following statement which I consider a gem.  It stated:</P>
      <P>In the most popular budget in recent times Mr. Dukes also cut VAT rates on many goods and services without seriously hitting the State's earnings and he increased social welfare benefits by between 6 and 7 per cent.  He forecast that his radical changes in the income tax code will save taxpayers £58 million this year and £97 million in a full year.</P>

I say to any newspaper reporter who is listening today not to be tempted by the Minister's presentation today into thinking he is showing great concern and that once again he will reduce the level of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated, &ldquo;It remains the view of the Government that the overall level of taxation is as high as we can reasonably go&rdquo;.  That cannot be reconciled with his statement one paragraph later when he indicated he was taking more tax out of the economy and that the overall tax revenue relative to 1985 would <Col N="1005" /> increase by 9 to 10 per cent.  Those two statements cannot be reconciled.  The Tánaiste who represents the Labour Party &mdash; I see two or three Labour Deputies present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>First, I shall refer to the targets in relation to the current budget deficit and which the Government set for themselves as being a main priority.  In 1983 the current budget deficit was £897 million or 6¾ per cent of GNP.  A Government who were determined to eliminate the budget deficit in four years have allowed the figure to increase in annual increments with the result that after today the opening target of the Government will be £1,250 million or 11.8 per cent of GNP, an increase of almost £400 million on the figure the <Col N="1006" /> Minister inherited on coming into Office and of almost 5 per cent in terms of GNP. The commitment of the Government on that occasion was the commitment outlined in the Joint Programme for Government.</P>

      <P>There was a proposal in the Joint Programme for Government to eliminate the budget deficit in four years but when it became clear that instead of the deficit, which this Government always insisted was the main problem, being eliminated, it was being increased.  The next stage was an adjustment in the <i>Building on Reality</i> targets. The programme was then thrown out the window and the plan was introduced, the purpose of which was to reduce the budget deficit to 11 per cent, 10½ per cent and finally in 1986 to 5 per cent of GNP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The arithmetic of this Government is based on the nonsense that when increasing a deficit from £600 million to £1,234 million, it is being decreased as was promised when the Government come into Office.  We cannot expect a Government who have changed their <Col N="1007" /> commitments, their targets and their direction to say anything today that will have any effect on the projections and policies necessary to deal with the priorities of the nation.</P>
      <P>In terms of borrowing requirements we were told that the figure would be reduced from £5.1 billion which was the figure when the Government came to Office to a figure that would enable us to expand our economic development but the reduction has resulted in an increase of £2.5 billion.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This brings the figure to £7.5 billion or a 50 per cent increase since the Government came to Office. They may have begun with the right words in terms of reducing the borrowing requirement but they have hit the jackpot because they have increased our foreign borrowing in that period by more than 50 per cent.  Our total national debt has increased from £12.7 billion to £20.5 billion, an increase of 60 per cent in three years.  So much for a Government who promised to reduce the borrowing requirement and to tackle what they refer to as the major economic imbalances.  Is it any wonder, then, that there is an added burden of £22,000 in respect of every worker so as to service the increased borrowing of the Government, borrowing which the Governor of the Central Bank referred to rightly as a banquet of borrowing? The biggest problem, even with the borrowing programme as is clear from the reduction in the borrowing for capital purposes, is that of the money being borrowed by the Government more than 70 per cent is being used to finance the day-to-day expenditure of the Government while only 30 per cent or less is available to fund the development programmes that are so essential to lift the economy and allow us realise our nation's potential resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told that the plan which formed an essential part of the Government's proposals would be based <Col N="1008" /> on stable interest and exchange rates but there was a bonus for the Government because while interest rates internationally have fallen the exchange rates, too, are working more favourably.  Instead of adhering to the plan, in terms of taxation, of the budget deficit or of borrowing, a plan that we were told 12 months ago was the only way forward, we find that the plan has been jettisoned.  This has happened despite the external conditions being more favourable than the Government or anyone else could have expected 12 months ago.  The reality is that this budget, like all its predecessors, is doomed to failure for the simple reason that the Government have approached the nation's problems in a shortsighted manner and are increasing tax levels to the point that as taxpayers we will now be paying more than £6.2 billion.</P>
    <P>This budget is doomed to failure also because the Minister fails to recognise that tax increases cannot be imposed in any area without consequent immediate and direct effects, not only for the Revenue but for employment, for morale in business and industry and more than anything for the renewal of business activity and consumer capacity in the economy.</P>
    <P>Before today 60 per cent of the total price of the gallon of petrol at the pumps was going to the Exchequer.  That was the highest take in any of the EC countries. By adding an extra 10.8p per gallon today the proportion going to the Exchequer is being increased to 64 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That figure is wrong, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>For that reason it is not surprising that with each increase in VAT and excise duty imposed by the Government on petrol, consumption has fallen from 46.25 million hectolitres in 1982 to 37 million hectolitres in 1985, a drop of 20 per cent.  Lest the Taoiseach should challenge that figure I would refer him to the Minister for Finance who supplied me with those figures by way of written reply here on Wednesday last. There has been a reduction of 25 per cent <Col N="1009" /> in the actual consumption of petrol and petrol products because of the level of excise duties imposed by this Minister.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of today's impositions we will find that not only will we have a reducing tax yeild but that the total level of economic activity in the motor industry will fall drastically. Employment has been particularly badly hit and has dropped from 24,000 to 14,500 during the past five years.  With total taxation of that industry close to £1,000 million, the prospects of any regeneration of activity are totally and utterly destroyed. The Minister will succeed again in bringing the economic border close to the city of Dublin.  People who live within 25 or 30 miles of the Border do not know the price of petrol in this jurisdiction because they get their petrol from the tanks in the North of Ireland.  As a consequence of this, together with the increases in excise duties on spirits, beer and other goods, we will find once again the outflow across the Border which was a major feature of the drain on our economy up to last year when, on our advice, the Minister belatedly responded and introduced selective reductions on certain products, namely spirits, electrical goods, television and video equipment.</P>
      <P>If the Minister was concerned only with extra revenue from these sources he should have looked at the trend last year. He would have discovered that the tax cut on spirits of 16 per cent in October brought about an increase in the tax yield at the end of last year of 17.5 per cent, an increase of £11.2 million.  I want to demonstrate that because of the reduction in the level of duty on spirits, which we had appealed to him to introduce to offset the impact of cross-Border trading and the damage it was doing to the drinks industry, he actually got an increase in revenue of £11.2 million or 17.5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to contrast that with the position in relation to excise duty on petrol. Instead of an increase in the consumption of petrol as a consequence of the measures the Minister introduced during the past few years, petrol consumption dropped in this jurisdiction by 20 per cent in the past three years from 46.23 million <Col N="1010" /> hectolitres to 37 million hectolitres in 1985.  Surely those two facts demonstrate better than anything else that the Minister's direction in heaping huge increases on petrol, beer, cigarettes, spirits and the whole range of other items covered in this latest onslaught through excise duties and VAT, will once again result in a lower yeild and much more depressed activity in those sectors of the economy which are affected.</P>
    <P>When the Minister introduces tax proposals he should bear in mind not just the immediate effect on the Revenue but the capacity of those sectors to employ our people, sectors such as the motor trade and the drinks industry which have actually lost up to 30,000 employees in the past three years since he came into Government.  These are sectors which could be contributing to the pool of PAYE to which fewer and fewer people are now making an input.  Is it not a tragedy that 18,000 fewer of the people listening to us today, if they are lucky enough to be in employment, are paying approximately £2 billion more than was paid by 18,000 more in 1983?  Is that not the beginning and the end of the problem of this nation? The burden of taxation, direct or indirect, which this Government have introduced has ensured that the reward for effort is no longer there.  The incentive for work is already well dead.  Those who would seek to promote activity in industry cannot even get men to take advantage of overtime because the overtime payments would move them into top tax bands, where at least 40 per cent of our people are now paying intolerable, penal rates. I do not think the Minister has ever attempted to measure the effect of each action which he introduces here on employment and living standards, or on the social and economic condition of this nation.</P>
    <P>The impact on very important sectors such as the building industry is a matter of very considerable concern.  No one can imagine how the Minister imposed such a huge burden and penalty on the construction industry last year.  This industry is engaged totally in domestic employment and has made a major contribution <Col N="1011" /> to our economy at every stage of development. In the light of that, the Minister has not one word of hope or encouragement for that industry or the thousands who have been left unemployed as a consequence of his 5 per cent increase in VAT last year.  Instead of offering help, the Minister adds insult to injury by suggesting that the actions of last year were a major support and incentive to the building industry.  He stated that imaginative measures taken by the Government last October to stimulate building activity are an emphatic illustration of the Government's commitment to proving increased opportunities for employment in the building industry.</P>

Any Minister who is capable of presenting that statement to the House is capable not only of juggling figures but of misrepresenting words and statements to suit his own ends, without any regard for the effect it has on the people who are waiting in vain for any hope or any new direction from this budget.</P>
      <P>While we welcome to some extent what appears on the face of it to be a relief for the tourism industry and the hotels and restaurants in particular &mdash; I see the Taoiseach smiles at my response &mdash; when we take into account the increase in the levels of VAT and excise duties imposed in the areas with which I have been dealing, as well as the impact of taxation on the employees in these industries and the consequent pressure for increased wage levels&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I acknowledge it to be a step in the right direction and it would be were the Government sensible and prudent enough not to proceed with these foolish, short-sighted, unjustifiable increases in excise duties announced today.</P>
      <P>I want now to turn to the Government's social conscience since we can see no trace of economic purpose in what they do.  Unfortunately four out of every ten of our people &mdash; and probably a higher percentage of those listening to us today &mdash; are dependants on our economy. Four out of every ten have no means of providing for themselves whether that be occasioned by age, illness or unemployment. That is the sad reality of the Ireland the Minister for Finance addressed again today.  What have we done for those in that category?  As of today we have provided them with an extra 4 per cent, to take effect in July, on their miserably low levels of social welfare payments, benefits and assistance whether by way of old age, unemployment, disability or maintenance allowances, right across the range, unfortunately all too common in the homes of our people these days.  The best the Minister can offer a nation and people suffering the agony and frustration of unemployment is a 4 per cent increase and he would suggest to us that that is in line with inflation.  I would suggest to the Minister that if account is taken of the fact that food subsidies are being reduced, there is no provision for child benefit allowances in the 4 per cent increases, if account is taken of the fact that the normal child benefit allowances, of which the Taoiseach does not even seem to be aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The sad fact is that there are 50,000 more people in this nation unemployed at present that there are engaged in total manufacturing industry.  What have we to say to those people?  Instead of giving a boost to manufacturing industry, to programmes of marketing, research and development, investment &mdash; by way of signals of new hope and direction &mdash; what we have to say to them is that they will have a 4 per cent increase in unemployment benefit <Col N="1014" /> or assistance as a consequence of the generosity of this Government and of their concern for them and their families. That is one of the stigmas attaching to this Government.</P>
      <P>If we want to achieve a sense of national purpose then I suggest to the Taoiseach that we can do so only by way of well established principles of social concern and justice.  Any Government that ignore the plight of the growing numbers of unemployed, sick and dependent on our economy, in the way this Government have done, can expect an angry response not merely from those social welfare dependants but from all of society.  While I am at it, I might say that, even in terms of the old, the Government have not provided in full for those who will become eligible for old age pension next year, bearing in mind the Government's assumption that there will be 4,000 less people eligible for old age pension next year than there were this year.  Surely that is being suggested only as a means of reducing the Government's commitment to the old and needy in our economy?  Similarly with regard to the unemployed, the Government in their figures have provided for unemployment benefit and assistance for 236,000, whereas unfortunately as of now that figure is increasing and it is probable that the number with which we shall have to cope will be of the order of 240,000.</P>
      <P>When what we needed today from the Minister was actions across the range of taxation, of incentive measures, social action, imaginative proposals, all we got was more of the same dreary catalogue of additional impositions on the old reliables, juggling with the income tax bands, in consequence of which taxpayers will pay at least 9 per cent more next year.  The problem that has bedevilled this nation for the last three years will remain.  The hope we had awaited is again postponed.</P>

    <P>When we need investment we frighten it away.  Even taking into account the budgetary proposals relating to the financial institutions and insurance companies, including the levies of approximately £113 million this year, it will be seen that <Col N="1015" /> those proposals ignored two fundamental things.  First, they ignored the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation, whose proposals go in the opposite direction. These budgetary proposals ensure that the Report of the Commission on Taxation, as far as this Government are concerned, was a mere academic exercise of no concern whatsoever to the Government and particularly the Minister for Finance.  Rather than moving in the direction advocated by the reports of the Commission on Taxation the Government have moved in the opposite direction. The Government have also ignored the fact that the financial services sector constitutes one of the growth areas for employment in every advanced economy in the world.  Instead of encouraging employment in those sectors the Government have added another £113 million to the levy or tax imposition on the banks and insurance companies as a consequence of today's budget.  This Government's mounting appetite for increasing taxation is consuming more and more of the available resources and wealth of this nation.  They are now managing over 60 per cent of the total wealth of the country.  When one takes that amount of wealth from people it is not good enough to tinker at the edges of the economy and adjust a little here and there.  What is required is to base one's tax proposals on the immense potential of our resources, for example, in agriculture which has been ignored totally in this budget &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in fisheries, which has been totally ignored in this budget, in forestry and its development, totally ignored in this budget, in our education programmes, particularly in research, development and marketing essential to any future priority development of this nation, all totally ignored in this budget.  All of the areas of wealth, potential and real growth have been ignored by this Government.  They have ignored all of the areas that might yield an <Col N="1016" /> extra £1 million without any concern for the effect that extra £1 million would have on the level of activity and economic endeavour.  Is there any hope for an agrifood industry in this country?  If so, where is there to be seen today the incentive for the development of a marketing strategy for that industry?</P>
      <P>Our real resources, particularly those that we in Fianna Fáil focused on for so long, and the development of the added value through the knowledge based industries are ignored by this Government as if they were of as little consequence in 1986 as they were in 1386.  We are dealing in an era of technology.  We have a new challenge for our young people and we have young people well equipped to face that challenge, but the Government turned their back on them as they have done so often in the past.</P>
      <P>A budget does not always have to be an instrument of oppression, a dreary catalogue of new tax measures imposed with each passing year.  It can and should be an element of economic policy, an element that would point directions in terms of the priorities we would put in our tax adjustment policies.  When are we going to encourage real investment in industry through effective equity participation without the limitations and qualifications that the Minister proposes to introduce again today?  When are we going to start to encourage the development of our services sector in tourism by encouraging investment in that sector? When are we going to start to encourage those who are investing their money abroad, be they builders, industrialists or even those who are leaving us to invest their skills abroad, and to signal to them that it is no longer a shame to succeed in this nation?  It may be perceived up to the moment that the only credit we are prepared to give is a credit for success abroad.  For the countless thousands of our people who are leaving us to achieve success abroad today's budget has no other message but that success at home is still a matter of shame and indignity as far as this Government are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; by way of the capital programme.  When we find a Government who can borrow on a ratio of 70 per cent for the current programme as against the capital programme, who reduce investment in the road programme by £10 million from that announced in the <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> illusion &mdash; as it is now &mdash; coming into the House today and reducing further the public capital programme by £25 million while increasing current budget expenditure by over £200 million, then we realise why under this Government there will be no development, no direct and effective Government action for infrastructural development, for a new dynamism and a new opportunity in the economy.  After today the position facing those who would invest in the country is even more depressing than it was before we trooped into the House to hear the Minister's message.  When we could save so much from EC allocations through the Regional Fund for our road programme, for building programmes, 50 per cent direct contributions plus depreciation over a period of five to 20 years, instead of investing in putting our people to work we prefer to invest in keeping our people idle and we drop the investment programmes even for the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fairly clear that after today's budget, with the increases of 10 per cent on income tax, the increases in over £500 million in total taxation, the miserable addition of 4 per cent to those who are unfortunately dependent on social welfare payments, looking at those in the round we must say that this Government have no sense of concern for the poor and no sense of hope or purpose for the young and able.  Until such time as this Government take the only course open to them to make a really effective contribution to this nation, namely face the people who are waiting to judge them, we will continue to wallow in the misery <Col N="1018" /> that has been a consequence and characteristic of their actions over the last three years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Again let me ask for clarification. How many Deputies are <Col N="1019" /> required to be regarded as a party for the purpose of being allowed to speak here? Secondly, let me ask how is it that one Member may not be allowed to put a point of view of a party who are not registered but could and may be if it was so required?  How come that the Chair has now called on Deputy O'Malley, who I agree fully is entitled to have a say which I presume does not represent that of the party whom he was elected to represent at the last election, whereas I have been elected many times representing a party who are in existence and who qualify but have not sought registration in this House?  If you can clarify that it might help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy started by asking what the required number of Deputies to constitute a party was.  There is no fixed number.  The one thing that has always been abundantly clear is that one does not.  This has arisen out of my calling on Deputy O'Malley.  I propose to give very briefly the reasons for my decision, and that will conclude the discussion on this matter.</P>
      <P>I considered whether four Deputies led by Deputy O'Malley and known as the Progressive Democrats are a party for the purposes of Standing Order No. 38. There is no definition in Standing Orders for a party.  It is not defined any place in Standing Orders.  I then had a look at Standing Order No. 85 which deals with priorities in moving private Members' motions and Bills and starts off by saying:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For the purpose of this Standing Order ...&rdquo; therefore that is not relevant to what we are considering now.  I then went to Standing Order No. 38 which is the relevant Standing Order here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>You had a bit of a journey, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave great thought and consideration to this.  Standing Order No. 38 reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A member of the Government who has given prior notice to the Ceann Comhairle may make a statement in <Col N="1020" /> the House on any matter.  No debate shall be permitted on any such statement but further statements may be allowed at the discretion of the Ceann Comhairle from a spokesman nominated by a Party in Opposition.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, I cannot get a definition anywhere in Standing Orders for a party.  I therefore came to the conclusion that each case must stand on its own set of facts.  I looked at the four members led by Deputy O'Malley and from what is widely known about them I clearly came to the conclusion that they are, first, a party and, secondly, in opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for calling me to speak on this occasion particularly as it is clear that there is some fairly vehement opposition to my making a speech at all.  Remarks were made in the course of the last half hour one or two of which I would like to comment on.  I would make it perfectly clear that when I and my three colleagues were elected to this House, we were elected by the only people who can elect somebody, the Irish people.  That applies to every Member of this House and will continue to apply to every Member of this House. I am glad that we have been able to clarify our position in regard to speaking and so on, a month after the formation of the Progressive Democrat Party, because Deputy Blaney has been here as an Independent for about 15 years and appears to have failed to make his position clear as yet.  I am in the unusual position in these benches that the two Deputies who would have been our neighbours here are not here as one is in jail and one has been suspended from the service of the House. I hope that the havoc that has been wreaked on those who occupy these benches has now come to an end.  After <Col N="1029" /> that half hour or so of diversion on irrelevancies, which is such a feature, unfortunately, of the procedure of this House, I will get down to talking about the matters which we are here to discuss today, namely the budget.</P>
      <P>The first thing about the budget is how very little is in it, how unimportant are the long lists of provisions and how totally they fail to come to grips with the real problems paralysing us.  We had in this budget most unusual lists of small provisions of small amounts of money for some of the most obscure objectives of which I have heard in a long time.  The Budget Statement has been reduced to an unusual level when we see sums of money set aside for expenditure in a particular constituency on the advice of a named Deputy on the Government side.  Is the Budget Statement not the principal annual statement of the fiscal and economic strategy of the Government for the year?  Is that not what it should be? What do we find?  We see it used, among other things, for the Fine Gael Party to express preference for one of their Deputies in a particular constituency, as against another.  That is trivialising the situation in a way that is scarcely good enough today.  It is rather unhappy for us all that at a time when we are literally crucified and paralysed into inaction these matters come up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to spend a lot of time on the detail of the budget because very little of it is of any significance, in my view.  On the income tax side the only thing that has any significance is the fortunate abolition of the 1 per cent gross income levy.  Everything else is really a repetition of the sort of things that were done last year, where all kinds of figures were changed but where the reality on the following 6 April was that most people paid more tax.  The situation is summed up if one looks at the yields that are proposed.  For example in income tax for next year the yield will be 6 per cent higher than it is this year.  There will be a 6 per cent higher yield in income tax with a smaller working population, fewer taxpayers and at a time when the forecast <Col N="1030" /> rate of inflation is 4½ per cent.  I am afraid that even with the welcome abolition of the 1 per cent levy unhappily income tax payers at all levels will find themselves in the same unfortunate position that they found themselves in for quite a number of years, paying more tax each year.  It should be remembered that there are fewer of them now to pay more and their incomes are under more and more constraint in that regard.</P>
    <P>At a time when we have more than 75,000 fewer cars on the road than we had four years ago we find ourselves in the position that motor vehicle duties and so on are up again.  We are the only country in Europe unable to avail of the bonanza that has hit everybody else of decreased oil prices.  In those circumstances I wonder how that industry can survive at all.  The index of our tax on beer within the EC is 335 while the EC average is 100, and we have had further increases although we are being advised by the Commission in Brussels that we have to harmonise with the general level of EC taxes in respect of alcoholic beverages.</P>
    <P>To address the budget for this year in terms of the Government's initial policies of 1982, or even of the drastic revision of 1984, is not merely to make a somewhat hackneyed political point.  It is also to emphasise what is in some ways more alarming than any single statistical index of economic decline; that the apparent ability of the Government to set and achieve even modest economic targets for the management of the nation's affairs is non-existent.</P>
    <P>It is less than four years since it was solemnly declared by those who have introduced this budget that the abolition of the current budget deficit within four years was both a vital necessity and an attainable target.  Subsequently, in a document whose title <i>Building on Reality</i> seems itself a criticism of the previous programme, this target was altered to the reduction of the deficit to 5 per cent of GNP by next year.  It has, in fact, risen last year to 8.2 per cent &mdash; and is well over 7 per cent even on the figures projected here.  It is unnecessary to add that the <Col N="1031" /> targets in relation to unemployment have likewise proved impossible of achievement.</P>
    <P>The targets in these two areas reflect the Government's own frontiers in economic policy.  They were selected, no doubt, with a view to their perceived feasibility and their attractiveness in political terms.  The Government's credibility is linked to their performance in these areas more than in any other.  It is for this reason that these particular failures evidence the near total impotence of Government to shape economic policy.  This impotence is curious in that there is widespread agreement about what requires to be done, at least in private discussion.  But this agreement has not been translated into action at the political level.  Thus, even in the programme which isolated the twin objectives to which I have referred, a great number of spending proposals were also outlined.  Many of these were of secondary importance and some were downright eccentric.  But they were felt to be politically necessary and were included at the cost of abandoning at the very start the Government's freedom of action.</P>
    <P>It is a political curiosity that aspirants to ministerial office should foresake, in the attempt to gain it, the very power to work significant change which makes it desirable in the first place.  But this is precisely what has happened.  In the lead up to this budget, and all recent budgets, a growing murmur was heard from Government sources that there is very little the Minister can do because a number of factors, mainly foreign debt and the interest on it, have tied his hands. This distortion justifies inaction from year to year.  But the reality is that the Government have failed to curb the expenditure within their power to control so that current spending, excluding debt servicing, has increased substantially in real terms since 1981.  This fact quite simply reflects the failure of political will. It has meant that in a time when every worker and housewife in the country is at least 15 per cent worse off in real terms <Col N="1032" /> than they were seven years ago, the State has simply exempted itself from these constraints.  This exemption is financed by destructive levels of taxation which severely threaten the capacity of the economy to recover its momentum.</P>
    <P>There are, however, two other approaches to our budgetary situation which lead to still gloomier, and broader, conclusions.  To place our economic position in the context of other developed economies is to realise that ours is uniquely threatening and to consider the specific measures of this budget in the context of the magnitude of the deficiencies and problems in specific areas is to realise the utter inadequacy of the measures we heard today.</P>
    <P>I propose to follow both of these approaches in commenting on the Minister's statement.  Before doing so, however, I should like to attempt to take my comments a little outside the usual run of political debate.  There are immense shortcomings but there are certain aspects of Government policy which require favourable notice.  It is right that they should receive this in an attempt to dilute the party political spirit which does so much to render these discussions ineffective and to further convince the public that the House is quite incapable of contributing to the solution of our immense problems.</P>
    <P>By far the most important such aspect is the realisation of the very great importance of misplaced capital expenditure as a contributor to our present ills.  Had the criteria of the 1984 public capital programme been defined and implemented earlier our position would now be very much easier.  Even now there is a widespread laxity about their implementation but they constitute the only evidence that any one of the major underlying causes of our economic <i>malaise</i> is understood and is being attacked. Secondly, there is some evidence that the potentially crippling growth in the public service, by contrast with the sectors which support it, continues to be restrained, though in a somewhat haphazard and politically expedient way. Thirdly, discussion on the concepts contained <Col N="1033" /> in &ldquo;A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances&rdquo; and the superior presentation of the facts of public expenditure in the comprehensive public expenditure programmes alike show an improvement in the approach to, if not the resolution of, economic questions.</P>
    <P>The publication by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy John Bruton, of the White Paper entitled, &ldquo;A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances&rdquo; in November 1981 was a landmark inasmuch as it was a genuine and serious attempt to face up to the huge problem that confronted us. Unhappily, little if any attempt has been made to put into practice the tenets in that document and we are suffering as a result of that failure.</P>
    <P>Considerable institutional changes are unquestionably necessary.  The control of public expenditure cannot even begin to be achieved within the structure of our present public service.  There is no accountability for value and there is no cost conscious line management.  For example, it is a feature of the approach of Departments and public agencies that they display towards the end of the financial year a considerable anxiety to spend money at all costs.  A civil servant is in far greater trouble if he leaves part of his budget unspent than if he spends it all or even if he overspends.  He is never encouraged to save.  It is not uncommon for public bodies to ring up in December people who are doing work for them to ask if they could pre-pay some of next year's bills so that they will use up their current allocation which they would otherwise be unable to spend within the financial year.</P>
    <P>The dominance of the bureaucrat as opposed to those directly dealing with the public, such as doctors, nurses and gardaí, is frightening.  Some months ago the Minister for Defence announced a proposal to spend £20 million on new offices for his Department.  There was not one murmur of protest.  Dublin, like Cork and Limerick, is full of empty offices. Will this ridiculous expenditure be of any value to the Army, to our external defence or to our internal security?  Who will benefit from it?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> Apart from the matters which I mentioned earlier under the three headings of the approach to capital expenditure and general expenditure, where I recognised the efforts of the Government to move in what I thought was the right direction, there is little else that one can endorse in Government policy or in the statement which we heard today.  To study our position in the international context of comparable economies is alarming.  To some extent this exercise has been performed for us by the managing director of the International Monetary Fund in a recent paper aptly entitled &ldquo;The growth of Public Debt and the need for Fixed Discipline&rdquo;.  This revealed that even in 1984 our debt to GNP ratio was twice the average of an array of comparable economies, that the external component of our debt was two and a half times their average and that our ratio of interest payments to GNP was two and a half times their average.</P>
    <P>The consequences of these figures in terms of domestic taxation are very severe.  Quite apart from the gross individual inequities which exist, the overall level of taxation seriously prejudices our chances of creating employment and stimulating production.  It has become quite usual for ordinary workers to pay tax at the top rate.  In the United States only 0.3 per cent of taxpayers pay at a rate of 60 per cent and in the United Kingdom only 1.3 per cent pay such tax. The Irish figure for the higher rate of tax is 16 per cent.  A legislative change in the mid-seventies did away with the term &ldquo;surtax&rdquo; but the reality remains.  In 1976 there were 60,000 surtax payers, by 1983 the figure was 363,000 and the present figure is higher again.  When these people protest at this oppressive system by supporting, for example, the Progressive Democrats, they are criticised by the left and others for being right wing, middle class or part of the fur coat brigade.  They are entitled to protest at a system which has given us more surtax payers on low income than in any other country examined by the Commission on Taxation.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister claimed credit for taking 65,000 taxpayers from the 45 <Col N="1035" /> per cent rate to the 35 per cent rate, thus cutting by one-sixth the number of people paying tax at the higher rate.  However, even on the Minister's figures it soon became obvious that the relief for these taxpayers would be short lived because of the way the allowances were adjusted. We have exactly the same situation this year with narrow expansion of one band and small increases in personal allowances which are more than wiped out provided some increase in wages in or about the level of inflation is achieved.  For 1985-86 there will be 140,000 taxpayers on the 60 per cent rate, although they will be changing for 1986-87 to a rate of 58 per cent.  Those people comprise 25,000 who were previously on the 55 per cent rate, 55,000 who remained on the 60 per cent rate and 60,000 who were previously on the 65 per cent rate.</P>
    <P>The figures quoted point out the savage unfairness of the present tax system. From a national economic point of view, however, the salient figure is that taxes account for 44.9 per cent of GNP.  Only the Scandinavian and Benelux countries rival our levels, but their economies have income levels nearly three times ours. More significantly still, they have neither current deficits nor large public borrowings so that taxes raised can be applied for the direct benefit of the taxpayer in those countries, unlike here.  In this sense we have succeeded in inflicting on ourselves all the drawbacks of a socialist economy without any of its benefits.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the saddest result of this spiral of taxation is the astonishing fact that last year a single man on average industrial earnings &mdash; £191.78 per week &mdash; had a marginal tax rate of 68.5 per cent on any additional income which he earned.  Any such person reaches the top rate of tax on a taxable income of a mere £7,300.  In last year's budget, the Minister cultivated a bogus reputation as a tax reformer by fiddling with tax thresholds so as to appear to reduce its burden.  So trifling were these reforms that their effect was almost wholly eroded in a matter of months by wage increases and the taxation which such increases attracted. <Col N="1036" /> Thus, at the very bottom level, a married man with three children earning £5,300 per annum was taken out of the tax net altogether but on his next £700 of income he paid £414.90 in tax which means that at £6,000 he was on a surtax marginal rate of 59.3 per cent.</P>
    <P>I have not had time to go through the tables issued after the budget but, from my initial glance at them, it seems that the same situation will arise again.  The figures will be slightly higher but wages will also be slightly higher so that people in effect are no better off.  Their marginal top rates will become operative at ridiculously low figures.  It may give point to the above illustration to emphasise that if the same person &mdash; the married man with three children to whom I referred &mdash; was in receipt of unemployment benefit he would have received a figure of £5,021.75 so that the surtax threshold for him was only £279 or 5.5 per cent above his social welfare level.  This is a direct result of non-indexation over the years of tax bands and it is quite ludicrous that a man receives social welfare benefits totally free of any tax up to a particular point but if he earns £279 a year more than he got in social welfare he then becomes a surtax payer at the top rate of 60 per cent on his marginal income.  Such indexation would change nothing in real terms but it would at least encourage fiscal honesty and avoid such obvious absurdities as that which I mentioned.  To compare these figures with those which apply to our nearest neighbour would be to risk encouraging emigration.  It is manifest that the tax bands require very significant broadening, but there was only a minor broadening of one of the bands today.</P>
    <P>If the term &ldquo;standard rate&rdquo; is to retain any meaning, it is clearly the rate that should apply to standard or average industrial earnings. It is an ironic commentary on a Government with some members describing themselves as socialists that they have brought surtax to the masses. The response to attacks on the level of taxation is to deny that there is scope for the economies necessary to change it <Col N="1037" /> significantly.  I believe there is.  Views to the contrary take too little notice of the expensive absurdities of much public spending and none of the economies possible by an exercise of political will.</P>
    <P>I turn now to capital expenditure.  To a significant degree this is a misnomer due to the application of funds to current purposes.  To the extent that the expenditure is truly capital, it is widely and notoriously misapplied in two separate ways.  First, there is no objective assessment of the projects undertaken leading to white elephants.  Secondly, there are gross and apparently inevitable cost overruns. All this is well known but what may be surprising is the extent to which years of bungled capital programming have contributed to our difficulties.</P>
    <P>Accumulative current budget deficits since 1973 account for about one third of our national debt of £20 billion.  The remaining two thirds are accounted for by capital projects which since 1950 have failed to remunerate their investment. One financial advisory firm in Dublin recently estimated that if the public capital programmes since 1973 had consisted of viable projects we would now have a substantial current budget surplus of about £600 million available for tax reductions.</P>
    <P>In 1983 the Government recognised the problems.  They said in the capital programme of that year that investment ratio, that is, investment as a percentage of GNP, is one of the highest in the OECD countries.  The results in terms of growth and net employment creation have been disappointing.  In the same document the Government said that public investment would not be undertaken unless it can be clearly shown on realistic assumptions that it would yield a sufficient return.  The 1984 public capital programme set out a detailed scheme for the appraisal of capital investment.  It set out guidelines for the definition of objectives and alternative projects.  Six criteria were listed in respect of each alternative and a recommended test discount rate of 5 per cent was included.</P>
    <P>The 1985 capital programme stated that some progress, but not enough, had <Col N="1038" /> been made during the year in having Departments and agencies apply the Department of Finance guidelines, and the Department of Finance were pressing forward on this point in consultation with them.  In the 1986 programme we are told that during 1985 extensive discussions took place between the Department of Finance and other Departments aimed at assessing the degree of implementation of the guidelines and encouraging their more widespread use.  It is obvious therefore that no progress has been made in the 1986 public capital programme.  A substantial economic problem was diagnosed in 1983.  Plans to tackle it received widespread recognition from economists and others when published in 1984 and action on the problem has been postponed until 1987 at the earliest.  That is precisely why we have a tax and employment problem in Ireland today.</P>
    <P>Capital investment appraisal is not an unknown part of economics.  Manuals and books on it are widely available.  The Minister for Finance has a public expenditure division whose function it is to carry out such studies and there are budgetary sections in all spending agencies and Departments.  It should not be difficult to solve a major problem in the Irish economy.  Bad investments leave a continuing tax and debt burden which reduces employment and increases taxation long after the first temporary boost has gone.  The inability of a Government to tackle the problem after they recognised it correctly and drew up the correct approach in 1984 is the sign of their inability to tackle the problem of their own spending.  That excessive spending, taxation and borrowing are at the heart of our high unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>Having seen that situation over the last number of years, one would have thought that the lesson might have been learned, but according to the latest Central Bank bulletin published within the last week the volume of public Government spending continues to rise.  According to the Central Bank Winter Bulletin the volume of net current public expenditure rose by ½ per cent during 1985 and the Central Bank predict it will rise by a further 1¼ <Col N="1039" /> per cent in volume during 1986, after inflation and so on have been set aside. That is a very sobering thought.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances it will hardly come as a surprise that the Government have failed to reach any of the budgetary targets, which they considered so important just three years ago.  Last year's budget deficit, equivalent to 8.2 per cent of GNP, was the highest on record both in absolute and proportionate terms.  At the same time, the Exchequer borrowing requirement rose from 12.4 per cent to 12.9 per cent of GNP.  It will be recalled that the Government's initial commitment, given freely in the Programme for Government, was to eliminate the current budget deficit within five years.  As Government resolution faltered, this was soon replaced with another and easier set of targets published in the autumn of 1984.  Those targets are wholly unattainable. More ground has been lost and the deficit announced today will be higher apparently in proportionate terms than that recorded in 1984, the year the plan was launched.  In so far as it still exists, all concerned would agree that that plan deserves a decent burial.</P>
    <P>This unfortunate record of failure, this catalogue of unfilled targets and array of false dawns, have not materialised by accident.  I believe they are the result of confused thinking within the Cabinet on economic and fiscal policy.  Two principles seem to have governed this Government's approach to economic policy, although I am sure they would not agree.  The Government believe that Government spending on the current side is unreservedly a good thing.  I believe the Government came to office believing that taxes were too low.  Of course, these sentiments are not expressed by the Government.  They too complain of excessive public spending and an excessive tax burden, but Governments must be judged by their actions, not their words. Between the end of 1982 and the end of 1985, current Government spending rose somewhat faster than inflation and is set to rise significantly more rapidly than prices again this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1040" /> Taxes too have risen more rapidly than inflation, particularly on the income tax side.  Between the end of 1982 and the end of 1985, taxes on income rose from £1,493 million to £2,260 million, representing an increase of 51.4 per cent. This is almost twice the accumulated inflation rate of 27 per cent recorded over these three years.  There is more, however. Over the last three years, the Government have collected more than £1,000 million from employees in the form of pay-related social insurance contributions. In all, some £2,631 million was collected in taxes and levies on incomes last year.  This is equivalent to a personal tax bill of almost £2,400 for each person working in this country.</P>
    <P>Those who remember the first budget introduced by the Minister, Deputy Dukes in 1983 will recall that it introduced particularly harsh tax increases. The apparent reasoning behind this approach &mdash; and it is one that has characterised the Government stance ever since &mdash; was that it was only a matter of putting up taxes to raise additional revenue and close the deficit.  Arithmetic may work like that; economics do not.  Prices and taxes act as signals to which individuals and enterprises respond.  In the face of rising marginal tax rates, people do not simply stand still and pay up.  They adjust their behaviour to the new environment where taxes are higher.  Rising marginal tax rates weaken the incentive to work, particularly where the workload can be readily adjusted.  Thus, employees refuse overtime or extra shifts on which penal rates of marginal tax are levied.  Managers refuse promotion where the extra responsibility is not recompensed adequately by the gains in after-tax income.  Absenteeism increases.  Many employers and employees drift into the black or grey economy, thus escaping or evading the tax authorities.</P>
    <P>Increasing tax rates is not a simple mechanism for raising additional revenue. Instead, the process triggers off a chain reaction which displaces economic resources, distorts the pattern of economic activity and suppresses economic growth.  The Government have <Col N="1041" /> used taxation as though it were an answer to the budgetary problems that confront them.  Taxation is part of the problem, not part of the solution.</P>
    <P>Expenditure and revenue raising policy have not been approached in concert. One is led to the inescapable conclusion that the Government first decide how much they want to spend and then sets taxes at the highest level the public will bear.  Expenditure has been allowed to dictate the level of taxation.  It has not worked.</P>
    <P>There is another way, one which sets a tax framework that will promote output, initiative and enterprise, a framework that will be fair to different groups of taxpayers as well as in aggregate.  Having set realistic taxes, expenditure is then accommodated to what can be raised in taxation and whatever deficit is thought appropriate.  In this way taxation can dictate expenditure rather than allowing a continuation of the present system which permits the level of expenditure to dictate penal impositions of taxation.</P>
    <P>To achieve what I regard as desirable, of having taxation dictate expenditure rather than <i>vice versa</i>, a whole new approach is needed on how the Government and individual Departments approach the question of their requirements for the coming year.  At present we have the meaningless annual ritual of Departments sending in huge demands in the spring and early summer, having these predictably cut by the Department of Finance and then cut again by the Government in the autumn.  A more meaningful approach would be for the Government to decide in June of each year the levels of taxation and revenue that would apply from the following January, then divide the revenue between Departments and agencies on the basis that the revenue would not exceed a certain amount and, therefore, that their expenditure would not exceed a certain amount, and then give them freedom to operate within that limit.  I am aware that this would entail reversing the present system, indeed of turning it on its head; but I wonder if anything less radical will work, given the inherent self-protection <Col N="1042" /> tendencies of bureaucracy and the vigour with which it defends its own institutional welfare.  The time has come to assert stringent political control and to take a grip on a system that is choking not just itself but, more importantly, choking the productive sectors of the economy that are the only ones capable of supporting it.</P>
    <P>I think I can sum up best the faulty approach of those who have let the present vicious circle of expenditure and taxation paralyse them by saying that they believe money comes from taxation. The truth is that money in the real sense comes only from production and output. If taxation and expenditure are geared towards that objective, no longer will they be the instruments of paralysis that they are now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tempted to go down the road followed by Deputy O'Malley but I think it is better to deal with the budget.  His objective appeared to be to abolish taxation or to bring it down to minimum levels &mdash; a very popular policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has been clear prior to this budget is that the policy of the Government to achieve financial rectitude has been a total failure.  There has been a <Col N="1043" /> huge increase in the current budget deficit and in Government borrowing and that is the most clear proof of the failure of the Government's policy and philosophy which was pursued at the expense of the living standards of our people.  Even though living standards declined, the books are in a worse state than ever.  In autumn 1982 we said the policy would fail because it was the negative policy of cutting expenditure which was reducing jobs and production.  We pointed out that what was needed was to increase production and thus increase earnings and income.</P>
    <P>What the economy needs is a production plan.  We had hoped that in this budget the Government would have exerted real pressure on those sections of the economy that have received massive subsidies but who have failed to increase output.  Deputy O'Malley thinks these enterprises are the backbone of the economy because they are the productive sector, but in spite of the subsidies they receive they do not respond in the way that possibly they respond in other countries. Subsidies and tax concessions should be linked to specific output targets in order to force private enterprise into productive activity.  It is also necessary to encourage the expansion of productive activities by State enterprises rather than restrict them by an ideological commitment to private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is the greatest blight and it is the greatest crime of this Government. The Government's economic and taxation policies have contributed to the loss of jobs.  Instead of creating employment this Government are creating unemployment.  We had hoped there would be a fundamental change in those policies.  What is required in this connection is a U-turn but that has not happened in this budget.</P>
    <P>The section on employment comprises just 20 lines of absolutely nothing.  This makes the point that has been reiterated constantly by the Taoiseach, namely, that it is not the job of Government to create jobs but to create the climate in which private enterprise can operate and thus <Col N="1044" /> eventually to create jobs.  In fact, the job of Government is to direct the economy towards the creation of new wealth that would be available for savings investment, spending on goods and services and so on.</P>
    <P>Multinational companies here are creating new wealth but they are exporting it.  In 1984 some £900 million of their profits were exported to their own countries and it is estimated that in 1985 this figure will increase to £1,200 million. There has been a jump of 30 per cent in the profits of the multinationals in the past year and it is expected there will be a further rise in their profits this year of over 16 per cent.  However, it will not benefit our economy.  Rather it will benefit the economy of the USA or their country of origin.</P>
    <P>Last year was a great year for profits all around.  The Stock Exchange had a boom year, their best year ever.  There was certainly no recession in that sector. A sum of £700 million was added in value to stock investment in 1985 and dividends to shareholders increased by £10 million. We were told by economists there were three causes for the rise in share prices. First, there was a fall in interest rates; secondly, we had lower inflation, but above all else there were rising profits. The top 25 industrial companies had a jump in profits of £57 million bringing their total figure to £142 million.  In 1985 those companies had an increase of 68 per cent in profits.  Who was the top profit maker in that year?  It was Allied Irish Banks with a figure of £84 million, some £32 million ahead of their nearest rival, the Bank of Ireland.  It was a boom year for AIB when everyone thought that the collapse of ICI would be a disaster for them.  The reason for that was that the taxpayer picked up the tab for ICI.  At the same time the Central Bank return to the Exchequer, as one finds from figures given prior to the budget, was £26 million less than the previous year's figure.  It decreased from £122 million to £96 million. In other words, the Central Bank had less to hand over to the Exchequer this year than was the case last year.  That reduction of £26 million had to be made <Col N="1045" /> up by the taxpayer.  The reason for this is that the Central Bank, and consequently the taxpayer, is bailing out ICI instead of AIB being forced to pick up the tab.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need for a payment from the Central Bank.  The banks' insurance companies are the ones who are bailing out the ICI.  Secondly, the figures the Deputy refers to relate to the previous year's surplus which would be paid over in the following year so he is talking total nonsense.  The reduction he refers to has nothing to do with the AIB.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the profits that have been made on the Stock Exchange, by the industrial companies and by multinationals who had their greatest year ever, the Taoiseach talks about creating a climate for the private sector to increase their profits which he says will result in the creation of jobs. We have ended a year in which we experienced the highest unemployment levels since the foundation of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course those who were making the money were laughing all the way to the bank and those who were laughing most were the banks themselves.  However, <Col N="1046" /> the unemployed were not laughing during the last year when their figures increased to 240,000.  In particular, the long term unemployed were not laughing because during that time 122,000 were on unemployment assistance.  There was no joy either for their dependants who numbered 190,000 making a total of 311,341 living without pride or hope on subsistence levels.</P>
    <P>After this budget I do not wish to hear the FUE, the CII, the IFA and the new self-employed association moaning about not getting such-and-such a grant, tax relief or some other handout.  I want to hear them say at last that they realise their responsibility to this society, that they will pay their fair share of taxes just as all those in the public service must contribute their fair share and as all their own workers in the private sector contribute their fair share.  If these organisations tell us they will no longer be parasites, that they will help to make this country great, as it can be great, that they will work together to develop our resources and make the country prosper we would all benefit, including the moaners and the groaners.  But to bring about that sort of situation and that type of thinking some leadership is needed.  Unfortunately, there is no such leadership forthcoming from this Government who in their Budget Statement today devoted only 20 lines to the matter of employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley spoke at length about taxation.  Indeed, I do not recall him speaking about anything else.  It is difficult to know precisely what he might do about reducing the level of surtax.  Is he advocating that the amount payable by those in the top bracket should be reduced while those at the bottom pay more?  If not, does he mean someone else should pay, or does he mean that we should cut the taxes at the top and that no one should pay?  If we cut a whole range of taxes who is to be left short? Do we take from those 1,300,000 of our people who are on social welfare benefits?  Do we tell them there is no more money for them?  Deputy O'Malley should tell us precisely what he has in mind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> There is a need for a spectacular move towards tax equity.  The Government have recognised the anger and the rebellion, almost, that is seething among the PAYE workers and have responded to that in this budget though in a very minimal way.  Six years have passed since the first tax demonstration in 1979.  In the meantime the tax system has become more unfair and inequitable to the extent that in 1985 the PAYE worker paid, on average, three times more than the farmer or, one might say, the few farmers who are paying income tax.  The average figure for the PAYE worker was £2,270 while for the farmer the corresponding figure was £790.  Only 36,000 farmers were in the tax bracket in that year.  More than 100,000 farmers were not in it.  That inequity in the system is not being solved by this budget.  The reductions are minimal when one has regard to the enormous burden that has been imposed on the PAYE sector in recent years.  That burden is so great that 16,000 CIE workers paid more by way of taxes, levies and PRSI in 1982 than was paid by the 180,000 farmers.  The CIE workers get nothing but abuse from everyone, farmers and self-employed alike, and from anyone else who benefits from the hand-outs. These handouts are provided for from the taxes paid by those 16,000 CIE workers and by everyone else who pays his tax.</P>
    <P>While the minimal increase in tax allowances is welcome it should be recalled that the PAYE allowance which applies exclusively to workers has not been increased since 1981.  The minimal increase announced today is a recognition of the need in this area but it is not adequate.  The PRSI allowance which also is confined exclusively to workers has been reduced since 1983.  The refusal to index allowances and to reform the tax system resulted in a greater proportion of workers' wages going in tax and in more loopholes being created for the wealthy and for the private sector in order that they would be paying less tax.</P>
    <P>In their Joint Programme for Government, the Coalition promised tax <Col N="1048" /> reforms.  They promised a system of tax credits but that has not materialised. They promised that there would be £100 million by way of capital taxation by 1984.  In 1973-74 capital taxes amounted to £14 million.  If we maintained that year's taxation levels in this area they would amount today, merely by increasing them by the inflation levels since then, to £55 million.  If it were increased, as it should have been, by the same amount as taxes generally were increased, without any new taxes, that figure should be £108 million today.  Yet the actual amount taken in capital taxes was £30.1 million last year.  In the meantime the wealth tax was abolished and the property tax was almost abolished since it brought in only £1.6 million.  We have neither wealth tax nor property tax and capital taxes have been reduced to one-third of their level in 1973-74.</P>
    <P>There have also been tax reliefs of all kinds in recent years.  There are tax reliefs for acquiring apartments for renting, for building toll roads, bridges and multistorey car parks.  There is an increase in the flat rate VAT refund to farmers, which is just a handout.  There is tax exemption for land leasing and tax relief for profit sharing schemes or for investing in manufacturing, etc.  All the methods of reducing taxation on the private sector, the self-employed and so on, have been added to over the years.</P>
    <P>Tax evasion is referred to in the budget in the context of the Taoiseach's statement last October.  He made a major statement on tax evasion and collection. This budget simply endorses the Taoiseach's statement and adds only that there will be an amnesty.  The Taoiseach's statement was made on 23 October and he was admitting for the first time that there was a major problem in tax evasion. He set out a series of measures to tackle the dodgers.  He said these would be a major step forward.  Special inquiry units were to be expanded; small local collection units of four each were to be established; sheriffs were to be appointed throughout the country in order to enforce seizure of goods, etc.  Three months later not a single thing has been <Col N="1049" /> done.  There has been no expansion of the special units, no establishment of the special collection units.  It can be seen from reading the Budget Statement that the new sheriffs have not been appointed. Not one person has been appointed to enforce the measures on which the Taoiseach made a major statement.  He got massive publicity for his new crackdown on tax dodgers, yet nothing has been done about it.  The Minister for Finance said the same thing.  But will anything be done about it?  I doubt it very much because the budget prediction for collection from tax dodgers this year, with all the amnesties, crackdowns and so on is £15 million.  Yet on 31 May last year £707 million was due in taxes, this after paring the estimates down to the bone in regard to the amount collectable in back taxes. The figure had gone up from £677 million in 1984 to £707 million in 1985.</P>
    <P>The black economy has been estimated by the ESRI to be earning about £1,500 million.  If they were paying taxes there would be a further tax yield of between £350 million and £400 million.  If that sum is added to the £707 million in unpaid taxes, the real amount of unpaid taxes would be £1 billion.  The Taoiseach knows there is a problem and that those who are paying taxes are very angry about it.  Not alone are sufficient taxes not imposed on these people but then they are not expected to pay them.  We are expected to believe that all this hype and publicity will do something about tax evasion.</P>
    <P>Why is there not a suggestion in the budget to do what every city and county manager is doing to collect the water rates?  If somebody who owes water rates applies for a grant for a house, it will not be paid until the water rates are paid or else that amount will be deducted from the grant.  They will give no concession to anybody.  They will not allow tenancies to be taken up or to be transferred until the water rates are paid.  If the Taoiseach accepts that there are uncollected taxes which are properly due to the State, why does he not make grants or handouts dependent upon the payment of taxes? No more VAT repayments should be made to traders unless they forward the <Col N="1050" /> PAYE and PRSI contributions which they have collected from their employees.  Instead of that the Government hand out the money while these people still owe £700 million to the Revenue. Of course the PAYE workers have to make it up and the Government know they can always find the money from them.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party in their campaign against tax rates have always rejected attempts to use demands for equity in the tax system to reduce the overall levels of taxation.  We have never requested a reduction in the overall levels of taxation in other sectors which have clearly not met their obligations to the community. We say the rate of tax on PAYE workers is too high; but lowering the taxes on the PAYE workers means that the amounts must be made up by increases on the wealthy, by improved collection systems and by taking strong action against tax evaders.</P>
    <P>Approximately £900 million could be gained in taxes but for the unemployment of 250,000 people.  Instead of contributing to the Exchequer, they represent a loss of £600 million in payments of unemployment benefit and assistance.  By investing money in job creation the State could gain massive tax yields in return, could save on social welfare payments and provide scope for increased public services and reductions for taxpayers. This is what we advocate.</P>
    <P>I want to mention some points which should have been tackled by the Minister. Magazines should have been rated at 10 per cent VAT, the same as newspapers, and I hope the Minister will consider this in the context of the Finance Bill.  The exemptions from tax on stud farming should be ended.  TDs' salaries should be subject to tax on the same basis as those of other PAYE workers.  There should be no special allowances.</P>

This constitutes another excuse for a further hand-out of over £60 million to farmers in what are described as VAT refunds to unregistered farmers.  After a total payment of £30 million in income tax, in one go, they are given £60 million back from the Exchequer.  There is no explanation from anybody as to what precisely that means. It is a figment of the imagination, a figure <Col N="1052" /> thought up by somebody.  It is a system devised simply to give hand-outs to farmers.</P>
      <P>The 4 per cent increase proposed in social welfare benefits will not keep pace with inflation.  Certainly in the course of this year nobody on social welfare will come anywhere near receiving sufficient to make up for the inflation rate over the year.  I note that the payment of these increased social welfare benefits has been put off for a further week: their payment will now be effective from mid-July, whereas last year it was 8 July, the year before 1 July.  Before this Government came into office such increases came into effect in April.</P>

      <P>Every week the payment of these increases is put off represents one-fifty-second loss &mdash; in other words, every week their payment is put off represents a 2 per cent loss to recipients.  The fact that such increases have been put off a further week this year represents another 2 per cent loss in 1986. The Minister for Finance is fooling this House and the public, telling them that the Government are raising the level of social welfare benefits to the level of inflation when they are not going even halfway toward doing so.  Probably next year the payment of such increases will be put off to 22 July or the end of July.  This is supposed to be the Government's recognition of the long-term unemployed, the 122,000 now on the poverty line.  The Government's recognition of their plight is to give them 1 per cent extra.  One might well ask: what is 1 per cent extra to the unemployed?</P>

      <P>It could be said that this budget is like a moneylender's contract: one has to read the small print to establish how one is really being done.  For example, the Minister for Finance did not mention in his Budget Statement the major cuts in education, health, environment and so on which appear in the orange coloured document called &ldquo;Principal Features of Budget&rdquo;.  If one had rather thick lenses in one's glasses one might be able to read it; I cannot read it so well.  I am told that there is to be a cut-back of £13 million in the Department of Education for 1986, £19.3 million cut-back in the Department of the Environment which will mean probably a further increase in local charges. And there is to be a cut-back in the Department of Health of £5 million. Interestingly enough, the Ministers' Budget Statement on health included the following very ominous sentence:</P>
      <P>Achievement of these aims will require some rationalisation of services by removing unnecessary and obsolete facilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Removing unnecessary and obsolute facilities and institutions&rdquo; is a very ominous phrase which, when taken in conjunction with cutbacks in Departments, means that we have not yet really seen the consequences of these budgetary proposals.</P>
      <P>The manner in which the Government have run away from the jobs issue is scandalous.  In fact the public capital programme, which Deputy O'Malley appears to hate, has fallen by 20 per cent. We are told today there is a cut of £25 million whereas we know it had already fallen by 20 per cent in real terms since this Government assumed office.  That is proof of the Government's lack of commitment to jobs, because the public capital programme should represent the Government's jobs programme.  Of course, the Taoiseach has already told me that he does not believe in this Government jobs programme at all.  He believes they have no responsibility for this.  A previous Taoiseach said he would resign if unemployment figures went over the 100,000 mark.</P>

      <P>A previous Taoiseach said so.  This Taoiseach maintains he is not responsible for jobs, that it is not the responsibility of the Government. Therefore, if the figure reached 500,000, obviously he would not feel he should resign; certainly 240,000 does not move him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The alternatives about which we heard today from Deputies O'Kennedy and O'Malley must have caused some dismay and despair among the electorate because none was offered.  They simply talked about different ways of doing the same thing.  It will be the same people who will be screwed into the ground. There will be the same cutbacks in health, education, welfare and so on, extending the level of poverty.  Neither Deputy mentioned where the money was to be found.  If they talk about reducing taxation in one area, where are they going to get it?  We say specifically where we <Col N="1055" /> are going to get it.  We are going to get it in the capital area, in tax on the wealthy, tax on property, corporation taxes etc. that we have pointed out, in the collection system, ensuring that the money is brought in, in not handing it out if it does not come back in.  We have specified a whole range of areas where the money can be got from those who can afford it, from those who have the money, rather than all the time screwing the workers into the ground and leaving a small number of rich entrepreneurs who make the major decisions.  The one golden rule that is very obvious here is that the man with the gold makes the rules.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing both these resolutions.  I should like to explain that we would not normally be inclined to vote against excise duty increases on beer or spirits, our philosophy being that these are avenues which are explored by all Governments in endeavouring to raise the necessary revenue to meet their commitments. In normal times, Deputies &mdash; and indeed the general public &mdash; are not too averse to some form of reasonable increases in the excise duty on beer and spirits.  On this occasion, we believe that a different situation applies.  First of all, there is the general state of the economy and the serious hardship that exists because of falling living standards.  This is plainly universal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1060" /> As far as beer is concerned, this additional imposition on what is known as the working man's pint is particularly inopportune. Apart from that, we believe the Minister is proceeding in the wrong direction. For some time we have been proposing the idea of selective self-financing cuts in taxation.  Everybody admits that our economy has reached a state of diminishing returns, that the decline and deterioration in the level of economic activity are so catastrophic that revenue yields are diminishing, and that higher rates of taxes are in many cases bringing in less revenue.</P>
    <P>We believe it can be shown that in carefully selected areas a reduction in tax rates would stimulate consumption and therefore be self-financing: even though you impose tax at a lower rate, because of the increased level of consumption you would get in as much if not more revenue. That is why I spoke of diminishing returns, and when you begin to get diminishing returns it is time to consider the tax rates you are imposing.  It would be quite feasible to reduce tax rates and get more revenue.  At the same time, you would have the advantage of stimulating economic activity and increasing employment with accompanying benefits.</P>
    <P>It is our contention that the experiments of the Minister for Finance last year were successful.  There is a suggestion by the Minister that that is not so, but all the evidence at our disposal, both from replies to questions by the Minister of Finance, substantiated by statements from the trade, indicates that the cuts in tax rates which were made by the Minister in regard to beer and spirits were self-financing &mdash; even though the tax rates were less, the returns increased.  I have before me a question by Deputy O'Kennedy to the Minister for Finance on 22 January last.  The reply showed that the returns in regard to beer were substantially increased last year as against 1984. The same applies to spirits.  The reply referred to excise duty and VAT.</P>
    <P>In view of that evidence we thought the Minister would pursue the experiment further and that apart from beer and spirits he would have looked at other areas <Col N="1061" /> in which the same process might have been engaged in.  This is particularly true because of our situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Border.  There is no doubt that increases in excise duties here immediately deflect trade across the Border.  Therefore, from the point of view of bringing trade back to this part of the country, lowering of duties on certain products would be beneficial. We are at a loss to understand the attitude of the Minister in this regard.</P>
    <P>All the information at our disposal leads us to believe that lower taxes here would be self-financing and would help to generate economic activity and consequently employment.  Therefore, we are opposing this resolution.  The Minister is only piling on the agony by imposing increased rates of taxes which will bring him in less revenue than he would otherwise get.  In present circumstances the duties in this resolution are unduly hard on the large section of our people who take a drink as a form of relaxation.  That, though, is not my real case.  It is that the Minister is wrong from the point of view of revenue to impose these increases.  It would be far better if he had left the rates as they were, or even reduced them again this year as an experiment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to be realistic in regard to our public capital programme of £3,055 million and current expenditure which is running at £8,042 million.  We have to find ways and means of finding that expenditure.  For instance we have to fund our commitments to social welfare and to other capital and current liabilities.  In order to do that we have to raise the necessary funds.  I accept that the House has a duty to do that. Guinness is our biggest brewery and is located in Dublin South Central, which I represent, so I have more than a passing interest in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the raising of excise, the House must meet its obligations and I would not object to a range of excise duties if they were to raise extra money to increase the very low rates of unemployment assistance for single people at the bottom levels.  When the Taoiseach is <Col N="1062" /> addressing the House on this motion I would like if he could tell us how this will tie in with the question of the deregulation of prices.  Will the State take measures to ensure that there is competition between licensed public houses?  What is the Taoiseach's hope in the immediate and long term for decreases in the marketplace because of competition?  Since it directly affects my constituency will the Taoiseach say if any examination has been undertaken regarding the effect on employment in breweries and if the effect was measured in the calculations made when arriving at the levels of excise duties set in the motion?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion has a very big bearing on the tourist industry, to which the Minister referred in page 6 of his speech, saying that tourism was playing an increasingly important role in our economic affairs.  It appeared that the Minister was very happy with the increased revenue from tourism last year. We will argue about that at a later date, because things are not quite as the Minister suggested.  Whatever one can say about last year's tourism receipts there is no question that this increase in excise duties on beer and spirits will have a further detrimental effect on tourism. Tourists always refer to the price of meals, the price of petrol and the price of alcohol here.  We are now in a situation of diminishing returns and the Minister is moving directly against the alcoholic beverages trade.  This can only result in losses of tourist revenue and in losses of employment in the hotel industry and in the beer trade generally.  We must put this in perspective.  It is still possible to have a pint of beer for less than 60p in the UK and there is no doubt that when news of this further increase in the price of beer and spirits reaches the tourist markets it will be a disincentive to those who might otherwise consider spending some time here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable money has been spent by Bord Fáilte and State agencies in the last 12 months to market Ireland as a cost competitive place in which to take holidays. It is a strange philosophy to spend <Col N="1063" /> millions of pounds on expensive marketing programmes to sell Ireland as a suitable place for tourist purposes and at the same time, despite the fact that it can be clearly shown that this imposition severely impinges on people attempting to come here, the Government persist in increasing the prices.  Added to that, in the past few weeks there has not been effective price control in the beer trade or on sales of drink.  Publicans, to defray increased costs, have been increasing their price levels just to stay in business. If we are to add on another increase of 3p and 6½p &mdash; and they are the prices that will be effective once the tourist season starts &mdash; there is no doubt to maintain their profit margins publicans will use the deregulated price control and these prices will be the minimum increase.  We can expect that the publicans, in order to hold their market share and their profit margins, to increase these figures further.</P>
    <P>This is a body blow to the tourist industry when it was just coming to life in terms of reaching its potential in employment, tax revenue and in our balance of payments programme.  This is once again the favourite source of revenue for the Government.  We are critical of the shortsightedness of this policy so far as the tourist industry is concerned. Because of diminishing demand it will lead to unemployment, not just in the breweries, but to short term employment in many of our seaside hotels and in the pub trade.  I would like to know the thinking behind the Government's attitude in spending money marketing Ireland as a tourist area where one can get value for money and at the same time putting this further impost on the travelling tourist who is an important source of revenue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the rationale behind this.  We know that at the moment the púnt is closer in parity to the English pound than at any time during the last three or four years, yet this price will be increased.  The 23 per cent will go up to 25 per cent in mid-June and it is not until 1 July that the reduction will take place in the restaurants.  We <Col N="1064" /> have a lot of British tourists here in May and June and from now until 1 July the price of the pint will be increased.  I do not know how much an English pint costs, but it is cheaper than the Irish pint.  With the closing of the two currencies the Irish pint will become even more expensive.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that the average English working man enjoys a pint and when he visits Ireland he hopes to be able to get a drink at a moderate price.  For years we have depended on British tourists, but this increase in the price of the pint will mean a reduction in the number.  I do not understand why it is being left so late to reduce the VAT on meals from 23 per cent to 10 per cent, particularly in view of the fact that the price of the pint will be increased from midnight tonight.  Many people visit Ireland for St. Patrick's Day, at Easter and in May and June and they will not find much to attract them here. I have no doubt that Bord Fáilte are concerned about these measures.  This action by the Government was very shortsighted and will hurt our tourist trade.</P>

      <P>We are all aware of the employment given by breweries in Dublin and Cork.  They provide jobs in city centre areas where little employment exists because of other policies pursued by the Government.  In dockland in Dublin Guinness was always a great employer.  The position is similar in Cork with Beamish and Crawfords and Murphys. I should like to say something about the social aspect of an increase in the price of the pint.  Some say that because it is the easy one to hit an increase in the price of a pint will not harm anybody, but we must remember that many people cannot afford anything other than a few pints.  The unemployed, who live in appalling conditions in delapidated parts of this and other cities, who are crammed into one room, cannot afford to be members of yacht clubs, golf clubs or have other social outlets.  A pint is the only social outlet they have.  The Taoiseach may not be aware that such people exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever about the argument put forward <Col N="1065" /> in regard to the increase in the price of cigarettes, that it may force people off the habit and be good for their health, I do not see how imposing an increase of 3p per pint, taken in conjunction with the 10 per cent tax on fish and chips, can be considered good.  This increase will hit the poor who cannot afford the facilities that others avail of.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House why he continually takes great pleasure from hitting those people? He must remember that since the price control was removed from drink the price of a pint increased by 4p and 5p in the city.  We were told when price control was discontinued that because of competition there would not be any increases but within two days all publicans had put up the price by 3p and 4p.  The only thing the Coalition can hit the underprivileged with is a tax on this small social pleasure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary that I should outline to the House, and the Taoiseach, the importance of the brewing industry to Cork city.  There is no doubt that we have reached the point of diminishing returns in regard to drink. In Cork, thankfully our two breweries employ a great number of people.  That is all the more important when one considers the extent of the unemployment problem in Cork city and county.  Many firms have closed in the three years the Coalition have been in office.  Obviously, any further increase in the price of drink will not help employment in the trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The views expressed by Deputy Flynn about the effect of this increase on the tourist trade are correct.  We must add to the budget increase the rise that occurred following the price deregulation.  I have no doubt that there will be a huge cutback in the consumption of beer and stout. Beamish and Crawford in Cork had their difficulties over the years but now, with a Canadian association and thanks to an excellent management team, they have succeeded in a positive way in consolidating employment in the south of the city. The north side brewery of Murphys has experienced difficulty in recent times but through Dutch involvement by Heineken many jobs were saved.  Every measure <Col N="1066" /> introduced by the Government is anti-working people and anti-family.  If less drink is consumed the return to the Revenue will be reduced and there is also a danger of more jobs being placed in jeopardy.  I oppose this resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my opposition to this punitive measure which will hurt the licensed trade throughtout the country.  As a Member whose family has a tradition in the licensing trade I am aware of the severe imposition this will be on most rural vintners who at present have to cope with a severe drop in their trade.  I wonder if the Taoiseach is aware that many country pubs will have to consider closing down for most of the day because of this increase. Many publicans do not do a lot of business during the week and depend on the weekend trade to make a living.  Most rural pubs are run by families who are not in a position to employ bar staff.</P>
      <P>Rural publicans must pay heavy local charges because of the severe Government cutbacks.  Rates and water charges are very high. The Taoiseach should take into consideration the fact that many publicans find it difficult to ask customers to leave their premises at 11.10 p.m. because they are only having their second pint.  He may find that amusing, but he should bear in mind that vintners who find persons on their premises after hours have their licences endorsed.  Does the Taoiseach realise that many vintners are having their licences endorsed for after hours trading which they engage in to try to make a living?  He should take into consideration that many responsible people who enjoy a few pints at night cannot do so because of the price of drink.  In rural areas the pub is often a meeting place, not just for drinking but for social activities and arranging meetings of the GAA and so on.  It is more than a licensed premises; it is a place where people meet to do business for voluntary organisations and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this is passed publicans will be at the mercy of a totally unjust law and will be unable to get a renewal of their licence if <Col N="1067" /> there are three endorsements on it.  This is discrimination against the trade and I do not see any justification for it.  It is common knowledge that the price of drink is too high and I do not see how the Minister can reduce VAT from 23 per cent to 10 per cent for hoteliers, people who take a greater flow of trade, while publicans, who only supply alcoholic beverages to their customers, will have this further duty imposed on them. The old reliables are being hit once too of ten.  It is no longer a case of people not being able to afford an extra pint in the evenings: the person trying to make a living from the business is in a very difficult situation.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter and I join my colleagues in opposing this measure.</P>

      <P>I also oppose Resolutions Nos. 1 and 2 on beer and spirits for the reasons outlined by other Members in regard to the effect it will have on the licensed trade, on the man and woman who enjoy a social drink and on tourism and employment generally.  I should particularly like to mention the effect it will have on cross-Border trade, because we should look back to the lessons which we learned over the last couple of years. This side of the House suggested to the Government right through 1984 that the only way to reverse the trend of cross-Border trade in spirits and petrol was to reduce the excise duty on these items. The Government took our advice and in 1985 revenue increased by 6.4 per cent. The Taoiseach is shaking his head, but those are the figures.  Despite the lessons learned then, the price of spirits is being increased again; and, if you add this increase to the increase on petrol, it is obvious that it will be the cause of restarting the cross-Border trade which dwindled last year.  The Government have made a major error in this area.  I strongly oppose this measure because it will cause havoc in the Border counties, right down to County Dublin and across to Galway. It will have a major effect on the licensed trade in these areas.</P>

      <P>I have enjoyed these <Col N="1068" /> reflections on the part of Fianna Fáil. They conjured up a very imaginative picture of the country in which, in the interests of the family, we must keep the price of spirits and other drink down and in which, according to Deputy Flynn, to hold the market share publicans will increase their prices.  It is a country in which, if you increase the price of drink by the modest amounts proposed, 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent, this will have a more discouraging impact on the tourist industry than a 10.5 per cent reduction in the price of meals, implying that the tourist spends four times as much on drink as on food.  If Fianna Fáil can believe all these things at once &mdash; although admittedly this seems only to apply to their leader and Deputy Burke &mdash; that the tax structures in these areas can be self-financing despite the facts, then such a party merits being in Opposition.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the people will give much credibility to these theses.  Let us go back over them.  It is anti-family to raise the price of drink. I wonder on what basis.  The family is brought into all kinds of theses in regard to the morality of different aspects of politics but I never heard that it is anti-family to modestly increase the price of drink.  I will not develop that theme.  I cannot.  I do not understand the concept behind it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flynn mesmerised me by his concept that, to hold their market share, publicans will increase prices further. This is a form of economics which certainly has never reached me academically, journalistically or any other way and if the Fianna Fáil Party intend to base government on these kinds of principles the longer they stay in Opposition the better because they are living in wonderland. Leaving aside such delusions as those of Deputy Allen, who thought we were increasing tax on chips when in fact we are reducing the tax by 10.5 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Deputy likes, I will go back over 25 years.  In the case of beer the tax content, duty and VAT of a pint of beer will, after the excise and VAT reductions in February and March, be lower than at any time since Deputy Haughey's last budget &mdash; and I mean last budget &mdash; which increased the share to 50.6 per cent.  After these increases that share will be down to 49.0 per cent, lower than at any time since then except briefly in February and March 1983 when a similar exercise regarding VAT was carried out.  The figure was fractionally lower for one month.  In the case of spirits the excise and VAT content will now be lower than at any time over the past 25 years, although there is some difficulty in getting figures for so far back.  In one month in 1964 the tax content on spirits was lower but, apart from that, one must go back to 1961 to find any time when the tax content of a glass of spirits was lower than it will be after this budget.</P>

      <P>On the question of self-financing tax increases and as a Government recognising the extent of diversion of trade to Northern Ireland in respect of certain articles, we took steps in the last budget in regard to spirits and television sets and these measures had certain <Col N="1070" /> effects which were beneficial in terms of bringing back to this side of the Border a volume of trade and activity which had been diverted and can be justified in that respect.  There was an increase of 18 per cent in the volume of spirits, sales of colour television sets were up from 68,000 to 104,000 and betting turnover up some 50 per cent.  These were beneficial effects but they were not self-financing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There are many arguments, social and economic, which can be advanced against both the increases proposed.  In the time available to us, my colleagues will be advancing these arguments.</P>
      <P>In regard to the argument we had previously, we on this side of the House are continuing to maintain in regard to all these resolutions that the Minister for Finance is being obscurantist and obtuse in not accepting the lessons of 1985 and opting for self-financing selective tax cuts because, despite the convoluted circuitousness of the Taoiseach's language &mdash; he has some sort of fanciful argument that these cuts could have brought in more than they might have brought in if they had not brought in as much or something of that nature &mdash; the lower rate introduced in 1985 in respect of spirits resulted in a greater return to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>Before the adjournment I intervened promptly when I heard Deputy Haughey use the word &ldquo;buffoon&rdquo; or &ldquo;buffoonery&rdquo;.  I had very good reason to be conscious of that word because when I was on those benches myself some years ago I accused the then Taoiseach of buffoonery or buffooning his way through a debate.  I was very promptly called upon to withdraw the expression and I did so.  This sort of language is calculated to generate heat and to encourage similar language and in that way the whole proceedings of the Dáil would be somewhat reduced.  However, if Deputy Haughey does not feel like withdrawing it and if after reconsideration he is still of that frame of mind, I do not propose to generate further heat and force an issue at this hour of the night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that attitude on your part.  I did not wish to generate any unpleasantness or heat but I did think I was perfectly in order in referring to the Taoiseach's reply as linguistic or parliamentary buffoonery, which is what I meant to say.  I think the Taoiseach and the Chair know very well that I would not use a personal epithet of an insulting nature towards the Taoiseach or indeed to any other Deputy in this House.  I thought the Taoiseach was using a very convoluted argument in regard to this matter of self-financing cuts and I felt I was in order in describing his particular use of language as parliamentary or linguistic buffoonery.  There was nothing more involved in it.  In view of your attitude I will not use that particular phrase or attribute anything in the nature of buffoonery to the Taoiseach on this occasion.  I feel that the Taoiseach is engaging in an artificial type of argument in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>His argument seems to be a totally artificial one.  He is suggesting that if the cuts had not been made then a greater amount of revenue might have been earned than was otherwise earned. The simple fact of the matter is that a reduction in rates brought in more revenue, more actual cash into the Revenue. That, as far as I am concerned, is a self-financing tax cut.  The Government are wrong during these difficult times in not following that course further and experimenting in that direction, thus saving the people these additional impositions whether on beer, spirits, petrol or motor tax.  A different type of approach, carefully judging the exact state of the market and introducing very finely balanced tax cuts, could bring in more revenue than this draconian tax policy.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach with his penchant for going back into the past was a little unfortunate to single out my last budget.  If he is an honest man &mdash; and I am sure he is; I would not make any other suggestion in this House &mdash; he will admit readily, graciously and generously that the last budget I proposed was the last balanced budget put before this House by a Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The current expenditure amounts to £8,042 million and the public capital programme comes to £1,681 million but if the supply services receipts are added, the total expenditure is £11,154 million.  That is a very substantial amount which must be raised by way of taxation or excise.  I would prefer from the point of view of my constituents and from the national point of view to avoid increases of this kind, but we simply have to meet these increases if we are to continue to provide these services.  The money must be raised in some way.  The Minister pointed out in his speech that there will be cost reductions estimated at £6 million which will neutralise any VAT increases.  However, following the reduction <Col N="1087" /> from 25 per cent to 10 per cent on the duty on motor vehicles last year, there is a further commitment to phase out that 10 per cent.  This will cost £3 million in a full year.  It will certainly help the motor industry, particularly in the sale and repair of cars.  It will also increase the level of employment in motor repair shops.</P>
      <P>With regard to the increases in excise duty on petrol and fuel, the Taoiseach might tell the House what the effect will be of recent movements in international markets; what is the likely long term effect on petrol prices, taking into account the budget excise and the long term market implications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because my constituency colleagues are anxious to put on record their amazement and disappointment at the extra tax on petrol and diesel oil.  What Deputy Mitchell has said is highly relevant.  We have seen a drop in the spot market price of oil.  Light Arabian crude has been hovering in the $20 and upwards bracket during the year but it may now drop to $15 a barrel.  This should be welcomed by the Government and passed on to the consumer because of its effect on the economy in general.  At a time when Sheikh Yamani is increasing production and causing an impact on the price in the world market, our Minister for Finance is raking it all in.  The answer to Deputy Mitchell's question will be very interesting, since the price will be dropping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that those of us who come from constituencies near the Border should protest.  Many traders have gone out of business because people are going North for petrol and diesel. The Minister for Finance is losing money and the British Government are getting the money.  Whatever services are provided for citizens in this State, they are not paid for by funds from the British Exchequer and this is what annoys and worries people in the Border constituencies. In rural areas the only way workers can get to their work in industry is by car, although we are losing jobs heavily.  An <Col N="1088" /> increase in motoring costs affects their livelihood, standard of living and whole way of life.</P>
    <P>We also have the spin-off effect of higher prices on everything in my area. The co-operative societies are really the bulwark of the economy there.  They are heavily involved in the purchase of hydrocarbons and this will affect these largescale industries which need all the support they can get.  They operate trucks, vans and so on.  The sand and gravel industry is important in Border areas. Companies involved in giving employment along the Border from Louth to Inishowen are under sufficient pressure because of competition from the Six Counties.  This increase in hydrocarbon duty will impose an extra severe burden on them.</P>
    <P>There is also the increase in road tax, which is also quite substantial.  When speaking today Deputy O'Kennedy pointed out the colossal drop in employment in the motor industry.  There are skilled mechanics from Border areas operating illegally in side streets in New York because they were made redundant in garages in those areas and, for that matter, all over the country.  If there is to be another reduction in international oil prices I would make a special plea that the Minister would look at it in a positive way so that these factors will not militate against the economy generally and in particular in my area.</P>
    <P>I mentioned co-operatives.  They have suffered a severe jolt from the imposition of the super-levy.  This latest imposition with regard to motor tax, diesel and petrol will not help them.  The price of diesel at some of the Dublin pumps today is 59.2p per litre.  Deputy Haughey spoke about self-financing.  I am convinced that in the limited area of the economy about which I am talking a reasonable price for petrol and diesel would be self-financing and that the Minister would gain therefrom whereas at present it is the British Exchequer that gains.  It is important that that be put on the record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not proposed to intervene. However, I want to put the record straight.  What Deputy Wilson has said is quite true, that there is now a tendency, an economic attraction, for people to cross the Border and buy petrol, oil and so on and that there is a depression in that trade at present.  But it would be quite wrong to say that this was brought about by the economic policies pursued by this Government.  If Deputy Wilson wants to be honest about this and looks at the record of his party he will see that this was brought about by the blindness of economic policies pursued by Fianna Fáil in office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy was making it a party issue.  He was accusing this Government of creating a situation in which it is advantageous for motorists in Border areas &mdash; and I represent a Border area just as does Deputy Wilson &mdash; to go to Northern Ireland to buy their fuel supplies.  That is happening and it is with no great sense of satisfaction that I say that.  There are people in filling stations along the Border areas in the Republic who have almost been put out of business.  But that was not as a result of policies pursued by this Government. It was as a result of policies pursued by Fianna Fáil in office.  They were never sensitive to the need to harmonise economies both sides of the Border.</P>

      <P>This decision to increase the price of petrol, diesel and motor tax will have devastating consequences for all people who use cars, and many do because there is no public transport available to them.  It will have very serious consequences for all people who purchase goods that must be distributed by way of motor transport.  Any benefit that might have accrued from the miniscule adjustments in income tax will be absorbed by the increase in excise duty, in the price of petrol and in road tax.</P>
      <P>There is a further problem obtaining throughout the country which has not been addressed by the Government, that is, the condition of our roads.  Not alone will motorists have to pay extra for their hydrocarbon products and motor tax but they will have to pay for repairs of damage done to their cars as a result of a serious deterioration in the condition of our roads, particularly over the past two years, because of the Government having given insufficient money to local authorities to maintain even the minimum standard expected on our roads.</P>
      <P>As regards the Border economy, the price of petrol across the Border at present £1.87p sterling while it will cost almost IR£3 here now as a result of this latest increase.  There are motorists who have not bought a gallon of petrol this side of the Border for the last three years.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked a question in the House last week about the quantity of petrol sold nationally and in County Monaghan in <Col N="1092" /> 1982 and 1985.  I was told that 1,321 million litres were sold nationally in 1982 and in 1985 1,149 million litres, a very serious drop.  I was also told that figures were not available for County Monaghan, an indication of a lack of interest on the part of the Government in exactly what is happening in Border constituencies.</P>
    <P>A point I have often made before, a Cheann Comhairle, is that if you yourself were sitting at the Cabinet table &mdash; because there is now no Minister representing a Border constituency at the Cabinet table &mdash; we would not be here discussing an increase of 11p in the price of a gallon of petrol, effective from 1 March next &mdash; and that on top of the increases already imposed and the reductions in the price of petrol that have been absorbed.  Is the Taoiseach aware that the price of petrol has been reduced by $2 a barrel again today?  Additionally, when further reductions in the price of petrol occur this year, would the Taoiseach say if the Government intend to absorb all of those reductions into the Exchequer?  Has the Taoiseach no relief to offer the very hard-pressed motorist carrying so much of the burden of taxation in this country, seeing nothing in return, particularly bearing in mind the present very serious condition of our roads network?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Increasing the cost of petrol and auto diesel in this manner is a lazy way of raising revenue on the part of the Government.  I would like to ask the Taoiseach, if he can answer it, if the Government have made any analysis of the extra cost that is to be imposed on industry in regard to distribution and transportation by reason of the petrol and auto diesel increase that we have of 10.8p. and 8.5p per gallon.  That is on top of two virtual increases <i>vis-à-vis</i> our competitors from abroad where the Government have subsumed or absorbed two reductions over the past six weeks in these areas.  As my colleague mentioned, is it proposed to adopt the lazy attitude again during the year and absorb further reductions in this manner?  It is a lazy <Col N="1093" /> attitude.  Can the Taoiseach assure us that his Government have made an analysis of the increase in industrial costs arising out of this obvious increase in distribution and transportation costs <i>vis-à-vis</i> our competitors?  It is quite apparent, without having the precise sums made out, that we are putting ourselves at a substantial disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> our competitors by adding substantially to industrial costs, particularly in a country like Ireland that depends so much on transportation and distribution by reason of our location away from export markets.  We are in a disadvantaged location, heavily dependent on highly efficient distribution and transportation, and here we are at the same time not alone turning reductions which will reduce costs over to the Exchequer but adding substantially in this budget to those costs.</P>
      <P>I would like the Taoiseach to give some indication of whether there is any concern on an economic analysis basis by the Government at the extent of what I call this lazy way of collecting revenue.  It is penalising.  It is hidden, it is easy and can be done without any great administrative expense; but the indirect effects of this form of tax are quite substantial, enormous, and act as a basic ongoing disincentive to business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear enough talk about business overheads, business costs, and here the Government are making a positive contribution towards putting up the commercial costs of distribution.  I am talking strictly of economics now and leaving other areas aside.  Sufficient has been said by my colleagues about private motorists and North of Ireland motorists.  I am concentrating strictly on the economic cost increase that is now affecting business here and in particular export business. I am asking the Taoiseach for his precise views on this aspect, on the contribution that has been made to increase costs by direct Government action in this respect with regard to absorbing decreases and imposing these increases. What is the Government's attitude to be right through this year in regard to further <Col N="1094" /> reductions that may take place in oil prices?</P>
    <P>It is all nonsense to start talking about tackling the economic problems and providing for economic growth and for further employment opportunities of which there is no mention at all in the Budget Statement.  It is all nonsense to pay lip service to the necessity for the sort of investment that we require and the social problem that we have in regard to providing more jobs if by actions of this kind we are deterring further investment and further expansion in regard to manufacturing employment and services employment and over the whole range of commercial activity.  I would like to hear what views the Taoiseach has on this matter and to what extent, before the Government took this lazy approach as I categorise it, the Government made any attempt through their various agencies and advisers to quantify the contribution made to increase commercial costs by this type of action.</P>

      <P>We are satisfied that this increase in the price of petrol will be counter-productive and anti-social in that it affects the family budget to a significant degree.  The average motorist uses ten gallons of petrol per week.  He must find £1 per week minimum to meet his petrol costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another very unsatisfactory side to this question that I would like to draw to the Taoiseach's attention is the number of uninsured motorists.  The reason that one in six of our motorists is uninsured, and perhaps a higher percentage untaxed, is the high cost of motoring at this time. The tax share of a gallon of petrol in 1980 was 45 per cent.  That has now increased to 62 per cent today.  It makes a lie of what has been said here about costs some <Col N="1095" /> years ago.  The average price of a gallon of premium petrol is £2.91 per gallon. The tax element of that is £1.75 and the pre-tax retail price in January 1982 was £1.16 per gallon.  Therefore, the pre-tax retail price has stayed stationary, but the amount of tax being drawn off it has increased year by year.  We are now the highest taxed motorists in Europe outside Italy.  This will impede our tourist industry further.</P>
    <P>Take the very simple example where we have been trying to improve our tourist industry market share in the UK market.  We lost that share over the years for various reasons.  One of the prime reasons we lost it was the price of petrol and the price of drink.  We have been making considerable efforts and spending quite some money in trying to woo back the British motorist as a tourist.  With the differential of £1 per gallon and beer prices double the cost of those in the UK, how can we expect to improve our position in that regard?  There is no doubt that this increase will result in a larger number of uninsured and untaxed vehicles using our roads, and we know the impact that has had on insurance costs when the Motor Insurers' Bureau have outstanding claims standing in excess of £80 million at this time.</P>
    <P>Let us look at some of the car sales figures.  They give a good indication of how an economy is going.  The last good year we had for car sales was 1981 when 106,000 vehicles were sold here.  In 1984 that was reduced to 56,000 and there was a slight increase last year to 59,000.  It all goes to show that fewer people can continue motoring.  Fewer cars are being sold.  There is a reduction in the revenue from motor spirit being sold for the simple reason that diminishing returns are now the order of the day in so far as forecourt sales are concerned.  We are upset that this will add significantly to business and transport costs.  There is no doubt that if the question of competitiveness in our export drive and business generally had been quantified the Government would not have proceeded as they did on this occasion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> Let us consider the self-employed person, the businessman who has quite an amount of mileage to travel and receives no travelling expenses.  He is really the victim of this very foolish fiscal policy. We must be critical of it.  We shall see diminishing returns.  This will affect the family budget and business and, in particular, will make nonsense of the efforts made in the past year to develop our tourist industry.  Does the Taoiseach accept these figures?  Does he accept that we are the most highly penalised motorists in Europe?  Does he propose doing anything to help us out in this regard?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach told this House on 29 January 1985: &ldquo;Our rates of excise are very high, at or near the top of the EC league.&rdquo;  Despite that, the Minister for Finance suggests to this House that we impose a further £15 million on what he already calls an excessive rate of excise tax.  That is my first point. Secondly, there is an increase proposed of 11p per gallon on petrol.  If you take an average consumption of 12,000 miles per annum, which is 30 miles per gallon, you are talking about roughly 450 gallons. That works out at approximately an extra £50 per year for the average motorist with average consumption.  I make that about £1 per week.</P>
      <P>It is very important at this stage of the debate on this resolution to be quite clear on what is happening.  This £1 extra cost to the Irish motorist makes up half the tax concession which the Government is giving.  Take a man with three children on £10,000 a year, according to the Government's figures he would be better off by £2 per week; but we will show where the rest of that £2, apart from the half I have mentioned, will go.  One half is gone on this Resolution No. 6 tonight. The other half is spread throughout children's allowances.  VAT and the like. That means that the £2 is long gone.  Most people will have spent £3 or £4 in return for that £2 which they are getting in regard to PAYE.  This is a net loss to the average taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That point cannot be hammered home too often.  As Deputy Flynn has said, the <Col N="1097" /> number of car owners has fallen.  That is a point which came out last year.  The point should be borne in mind.  It is not getting through that in real terms in 1982 we took in, under this heading, £245 million. The following year we took in £275 million and the next year £282 million. Last year we took in approximately £289 million, or £290 million.  I am putting these figures forward to show quite clearly that if the price went up the revenue from that price, mainly because of the reduction in the number of cars purchased, fell from £100,000 to £56,000 in two years.  The revenue from that tax came down.  That is quite obvious from the figures I have put before the House just now.  Of goods in this country, 95 per cent go by road freight, which adds to the cost of industry.  The cost of freight to Irish industry is 25 per cent higher than all our EC competitors.  That further erodes competitiveness, adds to the cost of Irish industry and in the end will probably reduce the final receipts under this heading of tax which makes the whole thing worthless.</P>
    <P>I cannot do any better than quote from the Confederation of Irish Industry budget submission to the Government. They put it extremely well, saying that road haulage is an internationally traded service.  The rapid expansion of exports offers an opportunity to Irish hauliers to transport these goods by road destinations across Continental Europe and to bring goods from these countries back to Ireland.  Irish road transport firms have today the potential to obtain at least half of this internationally traded business. Their current share falls far, far short of this target.  They conclude by recommending that taxation on auto diesel oil should be reduced by at least 20 per cent as a first step towards bringing Irish transport costs into line with the European average and therefore increasing Irish exports, with a net benefit to the Irish economy.  That submission from the Confederation of Irish Industry makes sense to everybody but the Government.</P>
    <P>I have two questions to put to the Taoiseach in conclusion.  First, what would the price of a gallon of petrol be today if <Col N="1098" /> the reduction in oil prices had been passed on to industry and the consumer? Secondly, what is now the total percentage tax take from the gallon of petrol?</P>

      <P>Despite the drop in world prices for oil, does the Taoiseach intend to fix the price at £3 per gallon for petrol?  That is basically what has been led up to from 1983.  The Minister for Finance agreed when we indicated the damage done to the complete trading structure of the Border regions by those increase.  The Government seem to be hell bent on keeping petrol at that price. Do they intend to keep the price at £3 a gallon or thereabouts?</P>

      <P>The question has been raised again of self-financing tax cuts and I must respond.  I am not taking exception to the phraseology of buffonery as far as I am concerned but I am putting to the Leader of the Opposition facts and figures given to me officially from the Department of Finance.  I do not think that material of that kind should be described in that manner, whatever about describing a politican in that way. The simple fact is that to keep revenue from spirits the same in cash terms in 1985 as in 1984 would only require a 19 per cent increase.  For the real value of the revenue to be the same, a self-financing tax cut means &mdash; and if the Leader of the Opposition does not understand that, I hope that he will not be in Government <Col N="1099" /> again, otherwise the revenue would disappear&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that would require a 24 per cent increase.  The actual increase of 17.6 per cent was not self-financing. If you are going to cut taxes in such a way that the value of revenue in real terms as purchasing power diminishes, then you will undermine the entire revenue.  That kind of self-financing would ruin the country and the Deputy opposite really ought to face that fact at this stage.  I think that he misunderstood me when I referred to his last budget. The fault was mine.  I was not referring to his last budget as Minister for Finance, but about his last budget as Taoiseach in 1982.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing this increase of 2 per cent in VAT on what is now known as the standard rate, that is increasing the VAT from 23 per cent to 25 per cent.  It is very difficult to understand the logic of the Government in proposing these increases.  Last year we had quite a performance by the Minister for Finance about his great efforts to standardise VAT, reduce the rates and generally reform the whole VAT system. Throughout the year the Government made a great song and dance about their success in bringing down the rate of inflation. We all know that it came down without any particular reference to them in response to international developments, but nonetheless they attached <Col N="1113" /> great importance and significance to a fall in the rate of inflation.  Despite all these attitudes and stances by the Government we now have this proposal to reverse the whole procedure and increase VAT rates substantially.</P>
      <P>This is the worst VAT rate of all because it affects practically every item in the household budget.  This is something that will bear very heavily indeed families which are already hard pressed. There are very few households who do not find it difficult to make ends meet between increasing costs of one kind or another, falling incomes and exorbitant rates of taxation.  The Government have decided to make this change where it hits the family hardest and impose this tax on families and the household budget.  There are many things in the budget which are objectionable and reprehensible but this is not just detrimental from the point of view of the economy generally and of families, but it is also difficult to understand what is the thinking behind it and why it was opted for by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to this resolution.</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), to delete paragraph (a).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to the increase from 23 per cent to 25 per cent in the VAT rate on practically everything. There is no use in the Taoiseach telling us that some of these items had been brought down from 35 per cent to 23 per cent last year when some items were at 23 per cent for a long time and will now carry the 25 per cent rate.  Many people are on the poverty line today.  We have all heard that in the region of one million people exist below subsistance level. There is no doubt that hundreds of thousands of people cannot live a normal life and do not have any prospect of a surplus income, not have any prospect of a surplus income, not even 10p.  With them it is a question of whether they should go short of food to buy shoes for the children.  An increase of 2 per cent on every item they buy for the house, apart from food which is rated at 10 per cent, will be severe. <Col N="1114" /> They must pay an additional 2 per cent for all services and bus fares.</P>
    <P>The most miserable part of this resolution is that the increase of 2 per cent operates from the earliest date possible &mdash; from 1 March &mdash; but the reductions will not come into operation until July. For instance, the reduction on chips will not apply from 1 March but from July. Those who are being hardest hit will not get the miserable increase of 4 per cent in their welfare benefits until 15 July. Therefore, between March and July those people will have to bear the increase on everything they buy.</P>
    <P>I should like to appeal to the Taoiseach, if he does not accept our amendment to delete this rate of VAT, to consider those who are unable to pay it and who will have to do without something to pay the increase in their shopping list weekly.  At least he should postpone the implementation of the increase until 15 July.  That will not be of much benefit to those people but it will help until they get the increase of £1.40 in their allowance. The Taoiseach should consider families who are unable to have a normal existence, who eke out a living daily and must spend a lot of time seeking benefits from the Eastern Health Board to help them pay their ESB bill or borrow money from moneylenders.  The Taoiseach, and the Minister for Finance should consider those people in connection with this increase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard rate of VAT is now being increased across the board from 23 per cent to 25 per cent and a lot of essential items will be subject to that rate.  My reading of this is that if I buy a part for a tractor it will be subject to VAT at the rate of 25 per cent but if I have the repair carried out by a garage I will pay a 10 per cent VAT rate.  There are many parts a farmer can fit to a tractor such as a ploughboard or points.  One does not have to be an experienced person to fit them, but a farmer who purchases those items or parts for a combine harvester or other farm machinery will have to pay the 25 per cent VAT rate.  The increase in the VAT rate will <Col N="1115" /> affect industry, farming and households. There is no doubt that it will result in increased costs.  My interpretation is that any items purchased over the counter will be liable to the 25 per cent VAT rate. We are opposed to the resolution because the increase in the VAT rate will affect many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In the nature of things the Opposition will go for the down side elements in the VAT increases and the Government will put the other side.  It is worth noting in section (3) of this resolution that VAT on a variety of food and drink, potato chips, repairing and servicing movable goods, certain works on immovable goods, hairdressing, promotion of and admission to cinema to graphic performances and the theatre as well as certain fairground entertainment supplied by travelling showmen is being reduced significantly from 23 per cent to 10 per cent.  Last year there was a very significant change in the VAT rate from 35 per cent to 23 per cent which brought the system very close to having two rates. We now have a zero rate, a 10 per cent rate and a 25 per cent rate but, effectively, the 10 per cent and 25 per cent are the rates about which most people will be concerned.  I am glad that the VAT rate has been simplified and I hope we get to the stage where we will have a single rate of VAT, perhaps somewhere in the region of 15 per cent, to ensure the continuance of the sort of public expenditure which exists at present.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the increase in the standard rate from 23 per cent to 25 per cent on inputs for industry will have any significant effect on the industry because they can claim back those inputs against their VAT outputs.  It will not have much effect on the consumer price index since inflation predictions for the coming year are minimal.  Given the level of continued public expenditure, the variation from 23 per cent to 25 per cent is understandable and the reclassification of a number of items to the 10 per cent rate is very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1116" />
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>With nearly 250,000 people without jobs, taking an additional £60 million in VAT out of the economy will obviously be extremely deflationary, will cost us dearly in jobs and is precisely the wrong policy for the country at present.</P>
      <P>It would be churlish not to welcome some of the concessions to the tourist industry and the motor trade which we advocated time and time again.  However, even with that, VAT as a percentage of gross national product is now over 9 per cent from a figure of about 8 per cent a few years ago.  It is clear, therefore, that the burden of VAT on the community has been greatly increased.  As it will cost us dearly in jobs it will also cost us dearly in PAYE revenue which will set off the spiral of depression all over again. I have two reservations to which I wish to refer.  The 10 per cent imposed on the take-away business should be looked at very carefully for practical reasons.  It hits the very young and the lower income groups.  It is difficult to enforce and I predict that there will be little or nothing gained in that area when bureaucracy and form filling are taken into account.  The State's energies should be exercised in another direction.</P>
      <P>I wish to remind the Minister for Finance that two or three years ago I suggested that he would not get £10 million from residential property tax.  I forecast that he would get £3 million and in the end he got £2 million.  He would not listen to us when we said that that kind of taxation was counterproductive and was not worth the effort of collecting it.  This tax will again show a net loss this year. Could the Taoiseach tell the House how much he intends to levy in VAT on the take-aways?  What type of estimate is there in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the major error in last year's budget, the doubling of VAT on the building and construction industry.  Are the Government aware that housing starts in the country are running 16 per cent below the previous year and that in the city and county of Dublin they are running at 20 per cent below the previous year?  Are they aware <Col N="1117" /> of the decline of output in the industry for the fourth successive year?  Output has declined in our second largest industry.  Are they aware that there are a further 12,000 people unemployed in the industry in three years and that the rate is now bordering on 40 per cent compared to a national percentage of 17 per cent in the rest of the economy?  If they are aware of those statistics it is hard to understand why VAT was doubled last year.  There is nothing in today's statement to indicate that that major blunder will be reversed.  We should have seen a reduction in VAT in this industry.  I ask the Government to reduce VAT even at this late stage because it is one of our most important industries and, if it deteriorates further, unemployment will get out of hand.  The extra tax on building societies further aggravates the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer the House to part of the Minister's speech today and I assume it is correct.  He said that it remains the view of the Government that the overall level of taxation is as high as it can reasonably go.  Immediately after that, the Minister imposed further taxation.  The net increases here in VAT are in the order of £60 million but when we are talking about reflation or, as Deputy Brennan said, deflation, in the figures published before today, estimates of receipts and expenditure for 1986, there is an increase of £107 million in VAT plus an additional £60 million as a result of this budget, making a total of £167 million increase in VAT.  I do not think that the economy can bear that huge increase.  The Minister went on to talk about reductions in VAT and the help it would be to various sectors of the economy, particularly in relation to tourism.  However, I cannot understand how any Minister could present these items as being of significance when at the same time they are increasing VAT in almost all those areas from 23 per cent to 25 per cent from now until 1 July.  That seems to be a major contradiction of any sort of fiscal policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also right to refer to the fact that <Col N="1118" /> in 1982 the VAT on all these items was 18 per cent, and even that was too high. In some cases since then, these rates have been increased to 35 per cent, reduced to 23 per cent and once again increased to 25 per cent.  While it was stated that this was necessary because of the level of borrowing and the budget deficit, even with all the damage that this nonsense which has gone on for the last three years has caused, we still have a 50 per cent increase in the budget deficit and a doubling of the national debt compared with that in 1982.</P>
    <P>I would like the Taoiseach to tell the House the amount being taken in from today until 1 July from the VAT increase from 23 per cent to 25 per cent on the items which will later be reduced to 10 per cent VAT.  I venture to suggest that what he is doing by increasing the VAT from 23 per cent to 25 per cent from now until July will more or less go the full way to pay for the reductions which will be subsequently made.  The Government are making a nonsense of fiscal policy, of the VAT régime.  When he adds the additional £107 million which it is intended to take under this heading compared with 1985, it will be another nail in the coffin of the economy and, in my view, will add significantly to the numbers of unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with my western colleague, Deputy MacSharry.  The Government are proposing many changes and are trying to create an attitude that they are doing something to reduce taxation levels.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have said inside and outside this House on a number of occasions that we have reached a point where taxation is far too high.  Yet today a budget was introduced which is pushing taxation still further and at the end of the day the consumer is asked to carry the can.  The net effect of this budget will be to increase the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, it is a hypocritical exercise in juggling with figures, particularly when we realise that we will immediately have an increase of 2 per <Col N="1119" /> cent on various goods and services, particularly those in the hotel and catering industry.  The reduction in the VAT rate for this industry, for which we have all been clamouring so long, will not take effect until 1 July.  This means that for six months that industry will be expected to bear a very high level of taxation and for the second six months there will be some reduction.  Where is the economic strategy in this type of taxation?  Where is the opportunity for the tourist and hotel industry to market itself?  We all know the tourist industry is a major contributor to our economic development.  How can that industry or Bord Fáilte sell this industry overseas when, for six months, prices will have to carry 25 per cent VAT and for the second six months there will be a reduction to 10 per cent?  It seems totally illogical and foolhardy to try to pursue this type of taxation.</P>
    <P>The one great hope for this country if we want to stimulate economic growth is the contribution that can be made by the private sector.  This Government have failed to recognise that and to realise that it is the private sector which can create the jobs, expand industry and make the taxation contribution the Exchequer needs.  Today we see the VAT on goods and services being increased to 25 per cent.  A person in the private sector, with a number of employees, will have to pay 25 per cent VAT on goods, he will have to pay staff, who in turn will have to pay income tax at 35 per cent or 45 per cent, and added to that there is something in the region of 10 per cent to be paid by the employer and employees by way of PRSI contributions.  Basically the private sector is being asked to carry in the region of 90 per cent taxation on business, or maybe more.  No sector of the economy could hope to expand or to create any type of economic growth when it is asked to carry such extraordinarily heavy taxation.</P>
    <P>Because of our high taxation, our main problem is that there is little or no disposable income.  We have diminishing returns.  The economic cycle of activity <Col N="1120" /> that is needed to stimulate economic growth is diminishing daily.  Consequently we have industries closing down, many of them private companies which are family run.  We have companies laying off workers; people are put in the dole queues and the State has to carry the burden.  At the end of the day it is the PAYE taxpayer who has to make the necessary contributions and the consumer who has to carry the can for this type of silly economics which is being pursued constantly by this Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses lobbied very strongly for the last two years to get the VAT changed along the lines announced today.  The real difficulty when dealing with the black economy arises with unregistered contractors.  If there is a low VAT rate on parts it becomes all the more difficult for registered contractors to compete with unregistered people because they have to take into account labour costs and the higher percentage VAT rate.  After today the competitive position is improved because the VAT on labour is reduced but VAT on parts is at a higher rate.  This obliges the unregistered contractor to become registered.</P>
      <P>I welcome the move today to reduce the VAT on meals.  This is the only area where the basic input is not rateable for VAT.  A retailer or wholesaler buys goods, adds his profit margin and the VAT is added to that, but in a restaurant there is no VAT on food.  This means that the 23 per cent VAT for the Revenue Commissioners has to come out of profits.</P>

    <P>I would like clarification on two points. First, in relation to general repairs, will motor repairs and general garage repairs be included?  Second, when studying the catering industry we were advised in writing by the Department of Finance that take-aways were exempt from VAT if they had fewer than four seats on the premises, that is, if people did not have an opportunity to eat on the premises. We are told that the VAT on chips will be reduced from 23 per cent to 10 per <Col N="1121" /> cent but this does not apply to the fast food outlets which does not provide seating on the premises.  What is the position of the take-aways <i>vis-á-vis</i> VAT?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure deals a severe blow to middle income and low income families in particular.  It is very important the Taoiseach should understand just how severely this measure will hit families.  The increase of 2 per cent is on essential goods, items a household must purchase each week.  Most of what the Taoiseach said earlier is nonsense when one considers the effect it will have on families.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan spoke about a claw-back of £60 million and this will come principally from families.  It cannot be forgotten that families can comprise up to seven persons and the household budget must meet the cost of goods for all these people.  This is tied in with the cut in food subsidies and it will affect the weekly budget of families.  The Labour Party appear to have forgotten that tied into this budget is a halving of the food subsidies and this will affect bread in particular. I do not know if the Taoiseach realises that the large sliced pan is now 62p &mdash; what we can call the Coalition sliced pan &mdash; and it will increase further in cost because of the further removal of food subsidies.  Where are the Labour Party now?  What are they saying about this? These matters affect their people and our people.  That is why we will be here making noises about the matter.  This is where all the Taoiseach's theories and economic mish-mash go out the window. He has forgotten about the struggle of families in Ireland today.  They have been forgotten in the budget.  All kinds of smokescreens have been put up but the reality is that there is nothing for families in this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Families who have to live on social welfare benefits will also be affected.  The increase in VAT will be applied on 1 March.  Once again, the Coalition is what is now their traditional style have pushed back the date of the social welfare increases.  We will not forget that.  The Taoiseach would like us to forget that <Col N="1122" /> social welfare increases which were introduced on 1 April have been put back not just to 1 July but to 15 July.  This is an extremely mean, Scrooge-like measure that has been noted outside this House. There is a great silent majority of families who know what the Taoiseach and the Government are doing to them.  The Taoiseach can have all the economists he wishes around him but the people know what has happened here.  Their action in putting back social welfare payments until 15 July has been mean and uncaring. It is somewhat like the Christmas double week that is not a double week any more; now it is £1.75 a week.</P>
    <P>There is a mean, uncaring, anti-social and anti-family streak in the Taoiseach, in his Minister for Finance and in his Government.  I tell the Taoiseach that the ordinary people realise what has happened, despite the way it will be presented on television and in the newspapers.  The Government are giving with one hand and taking away with the other.  Consider what happened with regard to the child allowance of £100. The allowance a family had for each child has gone even though they will be faced with higher costs.  They have been deprived of even that small allowance that was not adequate.  There is also the example of the unemployment allowance.  From mid-July people will get an additional sum of £2.25 per week and even in the case of a family with seven children that amount will remain the same.  This is the first time this has happened here.  I should like people to note that a major change is taking place here and for the first time people on unemployment assistance will not get an increase for their children&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is given to the Smurfit children, as the Taoiseach said.  It is given to the wealthy.  The Taoiseach is talking about the children's allowance.  Has he forgotten he did not give any increase last year and hardly any increase the year before that?  Does he not realise that people outside know that?  They know he <Col N="1123" /> did not give them anything last year and what he gave the year before was marginal. What has been given in respect of children's allowance will be clawed back by way of the £100 child's allowance. Even on the miserable 4 per cent figure of the Government, people should have got £1.60 per week for four children in addition to their allowance for dependent children.  They will realise they are being fiddled.  For a husband, wife and four children the sum of £2.25 per week works out at 37p per head.  When has there ever been such an increase for families on social welfare?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Woods in his statement that this Government are anti-family.  However, I disagree with him on one point.  At the start of his speech he seemed to imply that the Taoiseach and the Government have some theory about running the country. They have absolutely no theory about running the country.  If there had been anything worthwhile in the budget I would have welcomed it.  For the past three years the Government have had no idea about running the country and they <Col N="1124" /> have abandoned all hope of any semblance of economic sanity.</P>
      <P>Long before I was elected to this House I came here to listen to budget debates. I regarded the budget as a serious document setting out a Government's economic and financial policies.  If this Minister for Finance has occasion to present another budget to this House I suggest he should do so on the back of a cigarette packet.  What is in this budget is ridiculous.  In his Budget Statement the Minister gave us the following wonderful piece of information which will go down very well in Kildare.  He said:</P>
      <P>The ratio of the main indirect taxes to GNP fell from 17.7 per cent in 1984 to 17.4 per cent last year.</P>
      <P>Of what relevance is that to the budget? It means nothing.  There is no indication in this budget of any semblance of either financial or economic planning.  The Government's one theory seems to be that if you do not know where you are going, any road will take you there.</P>
      <P>Another change in relation to that which should make a very big impression in such places as Newbridge and Naas is that travelling funfairs are to be exempt from this tax.  That will have an extraordinary impact on the unemployed people of Kildare and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The people will be thrilled to hear that the Government have decided to introduce VAT on chips at the rate of 10 per cent.  One hears the expression sometimes, &ldquo;Let them eat cake&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Government's answer to the unemployment problem is &ldquo;Let them eat chips&rdquo;.  Surely a budget should give some idea of what the Government are doing.  The announcement of a £50,000 grant to this or that society could be made during an Estimate debate or by any Minister at any function. Instead, such announcements are included in the budget in an effort to give the impression that something big is happening.  This merely reflects the lack <Col N="1125" /> of any thinking on the part of the Government. We would be making a laugh of ourselves if we were to think that the people would be fooled by such nonsense. I am sure that Bord na gCon will be delighted with their subvention but there was no need to make the announcement in the budget.</P>
      <P>The increase in VAT from 23 per cent to 25 per cent will apply from 1 March and will represent a 2 per cent increase for the year but the social welfare increases of 4 per cent will not apply until mid-July.  Therefore, people will be worse off rather than better off as a result of this budget.  There is provision in the Estimates for the raising of £107 million by way of VAT.  Today's proposals will have a net effect of £59.2 million.  This means that a total of £167 million will be taken out of the economy.  That is deflation and will cause a worsening of the unemployment problem because it will mean that there will be less money available.</P>
      <P>I welcome the reduction in the VAT rates on meals from 23 to 10 per cent and also the reduction in respect of other items such as hairdressing and so on but this is taking more money out of the economy.  Any child in secondary school and studying basic economics could devise a budget such as this.  If a fellow wrote an essay for his leaving certificate examination based on today's budget he would fail.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware of the country's problems but I would prefer that instead of what has happened today the Government had told us that instead of concentrating on the public finances they would do something about unemployment and about emigration. That would be a legitimate political objective.  On the other hand, if for each of the past three years they had told us that they intended putting the public finances in order, something I advocated in 1982, and allowing unemployment to <Col N="1126" /> increase but would then tackle that problem when the initial objective had been achieved, that would have been fine but they have not taken either line.  Nothing has been done in regard either to sorting out the public finances or regarding unemployment in respect of which the figures have increased.  The number has increased by 70,000, that is 70,000 officially unemployed, since 1982.  There are another 70,000 in training schemes while a further 30,000 have emigrated. At the same time, borrowing is at a higher level than ever before, both in percentage and in absolute terms.</P>

      <P>Perhaps more than anyone else here, the Taoiseach knows what I am talking about.  As one who was critical on occasion of Fianna Fáil economic policy, a matter that was harped on by those who are now on the Government side, I am entitled-to comment that there are neither politicians nor representatives of the media saying now the Taoiseach is running the country into the ground, despite the fact that the position is worse than ever now.  What is good for the goose is good for the gander. I may have faults both as politician and on a personal level but a lack of a sense of fair play for everyone is not one of those faults.</P>

      <P>Regarding the reduction in VAT to 10 per cent on the touring coach business, I should like the Taoiseach to tell us how this will be put into operation.  It has been a bone of contention with the majority of those people that because they are exempt specifically they cannot register and consequently cannot claim back VAT on inputs by way of purchases of vehicles, parts and so on. Is it intended that it will be a once-off thing?  How will it work in the general sphere?</P>

This was regarded as one of the brighter areas for further development but the Government have a total lack of commitment to it.  The farm modernisation scheme has already been cut.  The money is being extracted from agriculture and nothing is going back in by way of VAT refunds.  We were told that incentive aids for agriculture would amount to £8.2 million but the figure is now to be a mere £2.9 million.  This Government are anti-rural.  They are a totally Dublin-oriented, Dublin 4-Government.</P>
      <P>The dairy and beef industries will suffer under section 84 by the extraction of about £10 million from the agri-business sector.  It will reduce he price of milk by 1p per gallon.  This budget will put jobs in jeopardy and stall the efforts being made to diversify in our dairy and beef industries.  Our beef and dairy exports have been worth about £2 billion in the past year.  This is the pride of our export area.  This Government talk about incentives and development but the budget totally lacks imagination and is unacceptable to the productive sector.  If we do not have a change of Government and if the Taoiseach does not vacate his chair there will be nothing left in Irish agriculture or industry.  They have failed miserably during their years in Government. This budget is a further failure.</P>

There will be sufficient money for disease eradication only until the late autumn of this year.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition has spoken very briefly and generally, leading into his party's general criticisms of the budget.  In the earlier discussion here I said it was my recollection that the first budget to have a deficit was in 1972.  The Leader of the Opposition has since assured me that it was in fact 1971 and that he was the last person to prepare a budget that balanced.  I want to accept that since I think he is correct.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla was anxious that we should postpone the VAT increases until July.  The cost of that would be about £38 million.  That money simply is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy accused us of having no strategy at all as a Government and no plan in this budget, but the opening of the Minister's speech makes it clear that we have to consider what is most appropriate for the economy at this stage of its development and this led us to the conclusion that we should try to avoid a <Col N="1131" /> deflationary budget, even if that meant having a larger deficit than in the plan. Secondly, we have to accept that there is a public finance constraint and while this constraint has been relaxed for this reason, it can only be relaxed to a limited amount.  Thirdly, we have shifted the balance of taxation so that the burden is being borne more by taxation on receipts from deposits in financial institutions rather than by the taxation of the individual, particularly the PAYE worker.  It is a very significant shift of the order of £120 million in taxation between those two areas which I think will be very widely welcomed in terms of its social equity, although that has not come through in the debate here.  That represents the general strategy of the budget but it is not possible for us to do what Deputy Mac Giolla suggested.  We cannot reasonably allow for a deficit in excess of £1,250 million and the excise duties and VAT increases have been necessary in order to hold the deficit down to that figure, while the income tax reductions are financed by the new forms of taxation in relation to bank deposit interest and insurance companies. That is the strategy of the budget and should be very clear to everybody.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell welcomed the reductions in VAT to 10 per cent on services.  I think Deputy Yates did so too and pointed out the value of these reductions in terms of their effects on the black economy.  It is important to do that. We tried to identify areas where the black economy is biting more severely and to reduce significantly the incentive to people to be in the black economy as well as to give them a strong incentive to get out of it by way of the tax amnesty procedure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Séamus Brennan claimed that the budget was extremely deflationary. The Minister in his speech said that the budget was neutral in respect of total revenue buoyancy.  It is not an extremely deflationary budget.  Had we adhered rigidly to the targets in the plan, disregarding the shortfall of revenue that has taken place, both tax and non-tax, then the budget would have been deflationary. <Col N="1132" /> And there are people &mdash; though their voices have not been raised significantly here tonight &mdash; who might say that we should have stuck to that and that to depart from the plan in those circumstances has been a mistake.  I do not think it has been.  On the whole I think the sense of the House is that we were right to relax the constraints to a degree here.</P>

      <P>On the question of growth in the building industry Deputy Séamus Brennan was suggesting that the building industry situation in 1986 would be extremely bad with further reductions in output.  All I can say is that the independent views that have been expressed by, I think, the Central Bank, the ESRI and our own advisers suggest that the fall in output in the building industry should level off in the current year.  Indeed there was one projection, I think that of the ESRI, of an increase of 2 per cent in output, although that is not one I am particularly standing over.  If one takes the different views that have been expressed they do suggest either a halt in the decline or perhaps the beginning of a recovery in the building industry.  Deputy Séamus Brennan was expressing a view which probably is held within the industry where there are still fears of a further decline, but the general economic view seems to be that the industry is levelling off at this point.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacSharry quoted from the Minister's Budget Statement but, with respect, a little out of context and a little unfairly.  He quoted what the Minister said about tax being as high as it can reasonably go.  If I may put the two sentences together, what the Minister said was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" /> While there must be some increases in taxation on this occasion, the burden of tax this year will be within the ceiling set by the Plan.  It remains the view of the Government that the overall level of taxation is as high as it can reasonably go.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacSharry should not take that out of context.  What the Minister was saying was that in the plan we fixed 36½ per cent.  We have held to 36½ per cent of GNP&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

      <P>It is quite clear there what is involved, that we have committed ourselves to holding taxation to a maximum of 36½ per cent of GNP.  We have, in this budget, held it there even though &mdash; because of the way the economy developed last year &mdash; this means a higher deficit than was envisaged in the plan.</P>

      <P>In that respect I think the other side of the House, with the exception of Deputy O'Malley, is generally in agreement with us.</P>
      <P>Again, Deputy MacSharry raised the question about the postponement of the social welfare increases to July.  I have already answered that.  Deputy N. Treacy came back again to the point of our saying that taxation has been too high and should be held.  We are holding it at the level we said we would hold it at.  He said the budget would increase the cost of living&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is what I said. The effect of the budget on the cost of living is about 0.5 per cent.  With the rate of inflation now falling below 4 per cent in the current year the net effect will be a rate of inflation &mdash; including the tax increases allowed for in the budget &mdash; of 4½ per cent.  When did we last have, after any budget in this House, of any Government, Fianna Fáil or Coalition, a 4½ per cent inflation rate after the tax increases in the budget?  Frankly I do not remember whether it was in the sixties or the fifties but it is well before the political memory of most people in this House that that happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anybody can maintain that this budget is inflationary given the very minimal effect on the cost of living index, and given the very low level of inflation reached.  While one Deputy opposite made the point that the low level of inflation owes a good deal to external factors, or indeed suggested that it was due entirely to external factors, that is not the case.  External factors have certainly helped.  But a very important element has been the manner in which this Government, by reducing inflationary expectations, have gradually persuaded those involved in pay negotiations on both sides of the table to moderate pay claims to such a point that their domestic cost in pushing up inflation has been reduced to a small fraction of what it was when we came into Government.  That has not been easy.  It has involved very fine negotiations and the Government giving a leadership that has been followed and accepted by both sides of industry.  I want to pay tribute to the leaders of the trade union movement who have faced up to the realities of the importance of getting inflation down, who have co-operated in this whole process of wage pauses and pay increases of an increasingly moderate amount.  We are a very long way now from the time in 1980 when the increase in public service pay in one year was 34 per cent when Deputy Haughey first took up the reins of office.  We are down now to a stage at which the increase in public service pay, including indeed significant sums of back payments of special pay <Col N="1135" /> increases of several years ago is about one-fifth only of the figure it was in 1980.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should be correct, 1980 saw a combination of factors arising between 1977 and 1980, just to be correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason it was as high in 1980 was because of the general operations of the Government over that period.  What really went completely wrong in that year was the giving up of all control on pay, the offering, for example, to one particular important group in the country of increases well beyond the arbitration award in order to get a settlement at all costs.  At that stage everything was blown and we had this massive 34 per cent increase in public service pay.  We have worked it down from there to the point at which the pay increase at present being considered by the trade unions involved for the current year is one of 3 per cent for eight months or 2 per cent year on year over and above the carry-over from last year in special pay claims.  That has been a very major factor in the reduction in inflation.  I would not accept that they were external factors alone though those also have helped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Yates raised several points, as did serveral other Deputies about VAT on general repairs.  I understand these are already subject to VAT at 10 per cent. On the question of take-aways he raised a point it is important to clarify.  Under the present system take-away food, whether hot or cold, except chips, is zero-rated if no facilities for consumption are provided on the premises.  If there are facilities for consumption provided, as he said, the 23 per cent rate applies.  After 1 July next all hot take-away food will be liable to VAT at 10 per cent regardless of whether facilities for consumption are provided.  Cold take-aways will be liable to VAT at 10 per cent if facilities for consumption are provided and they will be zero-rated if no facilities for consumption are provided.  The Deputy has been <Col N="1136" /> helpful in clarifying a point which perhaps was not entirely clear before.  I have been glad of the opportunity to clarify that.</P>

The net effect, taking one with the other, is a fractional increase only in the overall cost.</P>

      <P>Deputy Woods said there is nothing for families in this Budget, but if you look at the income tax tables you will see significant improvements. For example, a worker on the average industrial wage, if single, has his tax bill reduced by 7.5 per cent and if married by 10 per cent.  That is something for families in the case of married people. Taken together with the child benefit, the net amount taken in tax offset by children's allowances in the case of a family with three children is reduced by about 15 per cent.  These are very significant benefits for families.  It is worth while emphasising that point as it has been controverted here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On social welfare increases, Deputy Woods raised the point about operating from mid-July.  I would like to make the point that the increases we gave last year, <Col N="1137" /> as in every year that we have been in Government, were in excess of the rate of inflation of the succeeding 12 months.

    <P>(7)  That, notwithstanding paragraph (6) of this Resolution, a relevant deposit taker shall, for each year of assessment (being the year 1986-87 or any subsequent year of assessment), pay to the Collector-General within 15 days from the 5th day of October in that year of assessment an amount on account of appropriate tax which shall be not less than the amount of appropriate tax which would be due and payable by it for that year of assessment in accordance with the said paragraph (6) if the total amount of the relevant interest which had accrued (interest being, for this purpose, treated, if not otherwise so treated, as accruing from day to day) in the period commencing on the 6th day of April and ending on <Col N="1145" /> the 5th day of October in that year of assessment on all relevant deposits held by the relevant deposit taker in that period (and no more) had been paid by it in that year of assessment; and any amount on account of appropriate tax so paid by the relevant deposit taker for a year of assessment shall be treated as far as may be as a payment on account of any appropriate tax due and payable by it for that year of assessment under the said paragraph (6):</P>
    <P>Provided that, where the amount on account of appropriate tax paid by a relevant deposit taker for a year of assessment under this paragraph exceeds the amount of appropriate tax due and payable by it for that year of assessment under the said paragraph (6), the excess shall be carried forward and shall be set off against any amount due and payable under this paragraph or the said paragraph (6) by the relevant deposit taker for any subsequent year of assessment (any such set-off being effected as far as may be against an amount so due and payable at an earlier date rather than at a later date).</P>
    <P>(8)  That&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any amount on account of appropriate tax payable by a relevant deposit taker under paragraph (7) of this Resolution shall be so payable without the making of an assessment,</P>
    <P>(b)  all the provisions of this Resolution relating to the collection and recovery of appropriate tax shall apply with any necessary modifications to the collection and recovery of any amount on account of appropriate tax, and</P>
    <P>(c)  a return required to be made by a relevant deposit taker for a year of assessment shall contain a statement of the amount of interest in respect of which an amount on account of appropriate tax is due and payable by the relevant deposit taker for that year of <Col N="1146" /> assessment and of the amount on account of appropriate tax so due and payable; and a return shall be so required to be made by a relevant deposit taker for a year of assessment notwithstanding that no relevant interest was paid by it in that year of assessment.</P>
    <P>(9)  That, if it appears to the inspector that there is any amount of appropriate tax in relation to a payment of relevant interest which ought to have been and has not been included in a return, or if the inspector is dissatisfied with any return, he may make an assessment on the relevant deposit taker to the best of his judgment; and any amount of appropriate tax in relation to a payment of relevant interest due under an assessment made by virtue of this paragraph shall be treated for the purposes of interest on unpaid tax as having been payable at the time when it would have been payable if a correct return had been made.</P>
    <P>(10)  That, where any item has been incorrectly included in a return as a payment of relevant interest, the inspector may make such assessments, adjustments or set-offs as may in his judgment be required for securing that the resulting liabilities to tax (including interest on unpaid tax) whether of the relevant deposit taker or any other person are, so far as possible, the same as they would have been if the item had not been so included.</P>
    <P>(11)  That&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any appropriate tax assessed on a relevant deposit taker under this Resolution shall be due within one month after the issue of the notice of assessment (unless that tax or any amount treated as an amount on account of it is due earlier under paragraph (6) or (7) of this Resolution) subject to any appeal against the assessment, but no such appeal shall affect the date when any amount is due <Col N="1147" /> under the said paragraph (6) or (7), and</P>
    <P>(b)  on the determination of an appeal against an assessment under this Resolution any appropriate tax overpaid shall be repaid.</P>
    <P>(12)  That&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  all the provisions of the Income Tax Acts relating to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  assessments to income tax,</P>
    <P>(ii)  appeals against such assessments (including the rehearing of appeals and the statement of a case for the opinion of the High Court), and</P>
    <P>(iii)  the collection and recovery of income tax, shall, so far as they are applicable, apply to the assessment, collection and recovery of appropriate tax,</P>
    <P>(b)  any amount of appropriate tax or amount on account of appropriate tax payable in accordance with this Resolution without the making of an assessment shall carry interest at the rate of 1.25 per cent. for each month or part of a month from the date when the amount becomes due and payable until payment.</P>
    <P>(c)  the provisions of subsections (3), (4) and (5) of section 550 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 (No. 6 of 1967), shall apply in relation to interest payable under subparagraph (b) of this paragraph as they apply in relation to interest payable under the said section 550,</P>
    <P>(d)  in its application to any appropriate tax charged by any assessment made in accordance with this Resolution, section 550 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, shall have effect with the omission of the proviso to subsection (1) and subsections (2) and (2A), and</P>
    <P>(e)  notwithstanding anything in the <Col N="1148" /> Income Tax Acts, the provisions of section 419 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and section 30 of the Finance Act, 1976 (No. 16 of 1976), shall not apply in relation to any appropriate tax which is charged by an assessment made in accordance with this Resolution.</P>
    <P>(13)  That every return shall be in a form prescribed by the Revenue Commissioners and shall include a declaration to the effect that the return is correct and complete.</P>
    <P>(14)  That the provisions of sections 500, 501 and 503 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, shall apply as if there were a reference to this Resolution in column 1 of Schedule 15 to that Act.</P>
    <P>(15)  That, as respects the year 1986-87 and any subsequent year of assessment&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  subsections (1), (2), (3) and (6) of section 31 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976 (No. 7 of 1976), shall cease to have effect, and</P>
    <P>(b)  subsections (4) and (9) of that section shall have effect as if the references therein to arrangements made under that section being in force or being entered into by a building society were omitted.</P>
    <P>(16)  That, notwithstanding anything in the Tax Acts&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  no part of any relevant interest paid by a building society in respect of any shares in the society shall be treated for the purposes of the Corporation Tax Acts as a distribution of the society or as franked investment income of any company resident in the State,</P>
    <P>(b)  no repayment of appropriate tax in respect of any relevant interest shall be made to any person receiving or entitled to the payment of the relevant interest who is not a company within <Col N="1149" /> the charge to corporation tax in respect of the payment.</P>
    <P>(c)  subject to subparagraph (d) of this paragraph, no assessment to income tax shall be made in respect of any relevant interest on the person receiving or entitled to the payment of the relevant interest,</P>
    <P>(d)  subparagraph (c) of this paragraph shall not prevent an assessment in respect of income tax at the higher rates on any relevant interest in respect of which appropriate tax is deductible, and</P>
    <P>(e)  section 4 of the Finance Act, 1974, shall have effect as if a reference to appropriate tax deductible by virtue of this Resolution were contained in paragraph (a) of that section.</P>
    <P>(17)  That, where a deposit which is a source of income of any person (hereafter in this Resolution referred to as the &ldquo;lender&rdquo;) who is chargeable to income tax in respect of any interest payable on the deposit is not a taxed-interest deposit but at any time becomes such a deposit, then, notwithstanding section 75 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, section 77 (3) of that Act shall apply as if the deposit were a source of income which is directed to be separately computed under subsection (2) of the said section 75 and as if the deposit were a source of income which the lender ceased to possess immediately before it became a taxed-interest deposit:</P>
    <P>Provided that, in the case of a deposit which becomes a taxed-interest deposit on the 6th day of April, 1986, the said section 77 (3) shall not apply so as to require any adjustment of the total income of a lender for any year of assessment prior to the year 1985-86.</P>
    <P>(18)  That, where a deposit which is a source of income of a lender ceases <Col N="1150" /> to be a taxed-interest deposit, then, notwithstanding section 75 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, subsections (1) and (2) of section 77 of that Act shall apply, as respects the year of assessment in which it so ceases and the next subsequent year of assessment, as if the deposit were a source of income which is directed to be separately computed under subsection (2) of the said section 75 and as if the deposit were a new source of income acquired by the lender immediately after it ceased to be a taxed-interest deposit.</P>
    <P>(19)  That, for the purposes of paragraphs (17) and (18) of this Resolution, a deposit is at any time a taxed-interest deposit if, were the relevant deposit taker who holds it to make a payment of relevant interest in respect of it at that time, the said relevant deposit taker would be required to deduct the appropriate tax out of the payment.</P>
    <P>(20)  That section 344 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, shall not have effect as respects any relevant interest.</P>
    <P>(21)  That a relevant deposit taker shall, when requested to do so by any person entitled to any relevant interest on a relevant deposit held by the relevant deposit taker, furnish to that person, as respects any payment of such relevant interest, a statement showing&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the amount of that payment,</P>
    <P>(b)  the amount of appropriate tax deducted therefrom,</P>
    <P>(c)  the net amount of the payment, and</P>
    <P>(d)  the date of the payment.</P>
    <P>(22)  That a declaration of a kind mentioned in this paragraph is a declaration in writing to a relevant deposit taker which&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  is made by a person (hereafter <Col N="1151" /> in this paragraph referred to as &ldquo;the declarer&rdquo;), to whom any interest on the deposit in respect of which the declaration is made is payable by the relevant deposit taker, and is signed by the declarer,</P>
    <P>(b)  is made in such form as may be prescribed or authorised by the Revenue Commissioners,</P>
    <P>(c)  declares that at the time when the declaration is made the person who is beneficially entitled to the interest in relation to the said deposit is not, or, as the case may be, all of the persons who are so entitled are not, ordinarily resident in the State,</P>
    <P>(d)  contains as respects the person, or, as the case may be, each of the persons, mentioned in subparagraph (c) of this paragraph&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the name of the person,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the address of his principal place of residence, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  the name of the country in which he is ordinarily resident at the time the declaration is made,</P>
    <P>(e)  contains an undertaking by the declarer that if the person, or, as the case may be, any of the persons, referred to in subparagraph (c) of this paragraph becomes ordinarily resident in the State, the declarer will notify the relevant deposit taker accordingly, and</P>
    <P>(f)  contains such other information as the Revenue Commissioners may reasonably require for the purposes of this Resolution:</P>
    <P>Provided that a notice served, on or before the 29th day of January, 1986, on a relevant deposit taker under section 175 (4) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, shall, at all times before the 6th day of April, 1987, be deemed for the purposes of this Resolution, apart from <Col N="1152" /> paragraph (23) thereof, to be a declaration of a kind mentioned in this paragraph.</P>
    <P>(23)  That&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a relevant deposit taker shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  keep and retain for a period of six years, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  on being so required by notice given to it in writing by an inspector, make available to the inspector, within the time specified in the notice,</P>
    <P>all declarations of a kind mentioned in paragraph (22) of this Resolution which have been made in respect of deposits held by the relevant deposit taker, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the inspector may examine, take extracts from or copies of any declarations made available to him under subparagraph (a) of this paragraph.</P>
    <P>(24)  That a relevant deposit taker shall treat every deposit made with it as a relevant deposit unless satisfied that it is not a relevant deposit; but where it has satisfied itself that a deposit is not a relevant deposit it shall be entitled to continue to so treat the deposit until such time as it is in possession of information which can reasonably be taken to indicate that the deposit is, or may be, a relevant deposit.</P>
    <P>(25)  That this Resolution (so far as relating to income tax) shall be construed together with the Income Tax Acts and (so far as relating to corporation tax) shall be construed together with the Corporation Tax Acts.</P>
    <P>(26)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory <Col N="1153" /> effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>

    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to increase considerably both the allowances and the bands.  We regard the proposals by the Minister as minimal and derisory.  We put down the amendment to indicate that in our view something along the lines of our amendment would be required to give reasonably significant relief to the PAYE sector.  The amendment is not comprehensive but it is an indication by us that something of the order would be necessary to give any meaningful relief to the PAYE sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the budget, income tax plus levies were estimated to bring in £2,260 million.  As a result of changes today the income tax plus levies will rise to £2,477 million, an increase of £217 million, almost 10 per cent.  Let us look at the share of income tax in relation to total taxation.  The figures clearly show that in 1982 it was 36 per cent, in 1984, 38.5 per cent and in 1986 it will be 40.5 per cent, that is income tax as a proportion of total taxation.</P>
      <P>This clearly shows that the burden of income tax has risen and continues to rise, despite what the Minister said in his Budget Statement.  We quite clearly have a system which imposes an excessive burden on income tax payers.  I will be more specific.  Exchequer returns clearly show that out of every £100 collected in income tax in 1985, the PAYE sector paid £87.16.  That compares with £85.55 in 1984.  It proves once again that the PAYE sector is supporting the taxation system and that this budget does not do anything for that sector, overall, considering that there is an increase of £217 million in the tax take, or an increase of 10 per cent.  The abolition of the 1 per cent levy is very welcome.  It was introduced by the present Minister and it will bring in this year a sum of £36 million, so it has not been quite abolished.  Its abolition has only been announced.  The burden on income taxpayers, more specifically PAYE taxpayers, will continue to increase.  This higher income tax burden, the rise in the price of petrol, the higher VAT and the abolition of the £100 child allowance for taxation purposes has to be borne in mind when considering the so-called concessions which amount to between £2 and £3 a week for the average family man.  When one does the household budget it is clear that the average family is worse off.  It means that the commitment not to increase the overall level of taxation has no relevance to the ordinary citizen.  The real tragedy is that the additional income tax will not work for the economy but will service the external debt which has gone from £5 billion to £9 billion in three short years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said that the overall burden of taxation is reasonable. The Minister is aware that every domestic and international authority has stressed the need to reduce the level of taxation. In 1985 the OECD report on the economy stressed the need to reduce the already high level of taxation.  The OECD noted that the task of rectifying <Col N="1159" /> the public finances had fallen on taxation under the Government and not as per the Government commitment on cuts in expenditure and that the Government had opted for the soft options and dodged the more difficult ones which need to be looked at.  I do not need to tell the House that the budget was estimated to bring in £2,260 million.  It will take in £2,477 million, that is an increase of £217 million. I fail to see where is the reduction in the burden of taxation.  It is clear from the figures that the burden of taxation has been spread on a fewer number of workers.  The budget shows an estimate of £9 million for increased unemployment assistance to cater for additional people out of work, so we are clearly spreading the additional burden on a reduced workforce. It just will not work.  Taxation remains at levels that clearly encourage tax evasion, acts as a disincentive to work, to people seeking promotion and to rewarding enterprise.  It is now encouraging emigration.  It is not just those without jobs who are emigrating.  There is a more dangerous phenomenon now.  Those who have jobs are beginning to emigrate because of the taxation system.  Some genuine reforms in taxation are very urgent.  I have tried to demonstrate that the overall burden of taxation has increased by £217 million.  That is not grappling with the taxation system, it is tinkering with it and putting an increased burden on a reduced number of people.</P>

      <P>The motion before us deals primarily with tax rates and bands.  A point I have being trying to get across for some time in relation to people who are working, particularly parents <Col N="1160" /> with adult boys or girls who are on unemployment assistance, is that the benefit of a young person on unemployment assistance is means tested and based on his parents' income.  Parents who may benefit from tax benefits in this budget will lose them, in effect, as a result of increased deductions from unemployment assistance of their children.  The Government have not made any attempt to address the unemployment system.</P>
      <P>It is clear that one of the greatest injustices being done to our young unemployed people is that they are walking the streets with virtually no money in their pockets.  Unfortunately, if their parents have the opportunity to work overtime or if they are fortunate enough to get a pay increase, they will automatically lose it indirectly through deductions in the unemployment assistance of their children as a result of means testing.  It is high time the Government took it upon themselves to set a minimum unemployment assistance rate for our single men and women living at home with their parents so that they are not in a situation where they are virtually beggars in their own homes with nothing on which to live other than what their parents may be able to give them by way of pocket money.  It is not just young people who are affected in this way but men and women, of 30, 35, 40 and 50 years of age who have parents living who are working.  It is totally unjust.  Whatever benefits may arise in this budget for the taxpayers will be lost if they have young people at home or older people at home depending on them because the benefit will be wiped out because of means testing for unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point in relation to taxation relates to the loss of the child allowance and the transfer of that child allowance to the child benefit scheme.  A family of two adults and four children with an average annual income of around £8,000 will as a result of the loss of the child allowance of £100 lose approximately £140 a year and on the other hand because of the child benefit scheme they will gain in the region of £144 so the net gain for that family of six is £4 per year. <Col N="1161" /> That is an indication of the illusions the Government are attempting to create in this budget and in the last budget.  It has been suggested that the Government have no imagination.  I suggest that they do but that it is used in the wrong way to try to create an illusion by adjusting a few pounds here and there and juggling the dates of payments by shifting them into the middle of July and making any deductions early in the year, that something is being given to the taxpayer and to those on social welfare.  In a matter of five or six months the penny will drop and most people will realise that what they got in this budget is sweet damn all. It is a question of trying to create an illusion in order to stem the tide of disaffection from the Coalition.</P>
    <P>I must admit that the Coalition have learned some lessons since 1981.  They are now presenting their budgets in a more professional way.  They have learned how to present the good news first and the bad news last.  It struck me, listening to the Minister reading the budget speech, that he was following the maxim I hear is used by the PR men, &ldquo;tell them what you are going to give them; tell them what you are giving them and then tell them what you have told them you are going to give them in order to confirm the idea that something worthwhile is being done and something is being given away for nothing.&rdquo;  A favourite phrase of the Government is that there are no free dinners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Except for the press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>But of course they are not free either because we have to pay for them also.  The people who are expected to pay for all the dinners are those in the PAYE sector.  They will be paying after the budget, despite all the juggling with the figures, the talk about not taking any more tax between now and 1987 as a gross percentage of the GNP and all the gobbledigook about the figures.  The reality is that the PAYE sector will again pay more tax this year than they did last year.  They paid more <Col N="1162" /> tax last year than the year before.  I have no doubt that some stroke or other will be pulled between now and whenever the Government decide to call the general election to try to fool that sector once again by bringing in another series of illusions to create the impression that something worthwhile was being done to reform the tax system and spread the tax burden.  Taxpayers would be happy if they believed that the burden was being spread around, that everybody was carrying a fair share.  One of the greatest complaints I hear from taxpayers in my constituency is that so many people around them do not pay one penny in taxes.  They say that the Government appear incapable of devising a system that will ensure those who are earning money and are liable for tax pay that tax.</P>
      <P>It is not too much to ask that the burden be spread evenly and it is not beyond the capacity of the human mind to devise a fair system of taxation that would ensure that the burden is spread around.  We have been told that there will be an increase in social welfare benefits amounting to 4 per cent for short term and 5 per cent for long term but, based on a very crude calculation, I estimate that with the delay to the middle of July, that 4 per cent in reality will be about 2 per cent if it is spread between now and when those people can expect to get the next increase which, presumably, will be July 1987.  One must add to that the increase of 2 per cent in VAT on all items.  I am certain that the remaining 2 per cent to social welfare recipients will be halved, if not wiped out altogether. We must also remember that the Government are claiming that there will be a 4½ per cent inflation rate in the coming year. One can see from that that those who are hardest hit by the recession are those who will suffer most in the next 12 months as a result of the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am certain that as people read the budget speech, particularly the small print in it, they will see the implications underlying the cuts in the various estimates tucked away in the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;.  They will see the various implications of the VAT <Col N="1163" /> increase, the child benefit scheme and so on.  There are many anomalies and injustices that will become clearer as the days go by.  I admit to being a bit weary of the whole sham of budget debates. Certainly, over the last two years instead of debating a real effort to shift the resources in our economy towards the creation of jobs we end up debating petty issues which if the Government had any cop on or political will to change the direction of the economy, to lift it out of the crisis it is in, would be dealt with.  We could be spending this time debating now our resources, the taxes we collect and the taxes we could collect, could be used to create work to get the 250,000 people who are costing so much in unemployment benefit and assistance back to work. We should be considering not only putting the economy back on its feet but restoring a lot of dignity to the people who have been thrown on the scrap heap by the incompetence of so many Governments in recent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment tabled by our party.  In the debate we should include Resolution No. 12.  All evening we have heard about the change in the burden of taxation from the PAYE sector to what are described as the financial institutions.  The Taoiseach, in a slip earlier, said the shift was to a tax on investment.  He corrected himself immediately but the budget represents a tax on investment.  I should like to deal with the so-called benefits that have been given to the PAYE sector in Resolution No. 11. A figure of £76 million is mentioned.  The real bad news will not come until the impact of the measures imposed today is felt by the public.  When the Minister and the Taoiseach talk about income tax and the PAYE sector, are they suggesting that the PAYE sector do not have any life assurance policies, small savings, a car, do not have to pay VAT on the items they buy, do not buy petrol, drink or cigarettes?  Are they suggesting that these people do not have mortgages, do not have to face interest charges, pay ESB <Col N="1164" /> bills, increased CIE fares or telephone charges?</P>
      <P>The impression is always given on the night of the budget that there are changes in the rates of tax bands and so on.  The taxpayer is supposed to have received the sum of £121 million as a result of this budget.  The summary and the explanatory table accompanying the Minister's speech shows that a sum of £280 million has been taken in extra taxation and that a sum of £121 million has been given back.  That does not take into account the point made by Deputy Brennan that if no changes had been made today the PAYE sector would have paid £250 million more than last year.  I think the term used in finance is &ldquo;fiscal drag&rdquo;.  Am I right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going by the Minister's figures published in the document relating to receipts and expenditure where we had £2,103 million in 1985 going to £2,351 million in 1986, the difference being £250 million from the same taxpayers.  A sum of only £76 million is to be given back to the taxpayers because I am not including the income levy in those figures.  Therefore, we are taking about £200 million extra paid by the PAYE sector no matter how it is presented in relation to single people, married people or a married couple with a family.  The PAYE sector will pay hundreds of millions more this year than they did last year.  It is presented on the basis of a transfer of the tax from the PAYE sector to the financial institutions and I should like the Minister to comment on this.  Most of the PAYE sector will be paying the guts of £60 million extra in VAT.  All these increases will affect the unemployed also.  The increases in car tax and petrol will yield about £19 million or £20 million, but this is overlooked. There is also a retention tax of £75 million. That tax is already being paid at the end of the year, so there is no great change of burden; it is just bringing it forward to the beginning of the year.</P>

      <P>The Minister will not put me off by trying to justify the trick of the loop type budget which he introduced. Who is paying the retention tax? The consumer and the investor.  Priority must be given to investment by private individuals who through their investment in financial institutions help the economy. The Government should create confidence and hope, particularly in relation to investment; but this budget does exactly the opposite.  It is frightening to see the way in which it is presented because it is dampening any confidence which might be there and giving little or no hope for the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now wish to mention the sum of £38 million which will be collected from the life assurance companies.  Where do these companies get their money?  From <Col N="1166" /> the people who take out life insurance on themselves and their families, the PAYE sector in the main.  Where is the shift in the burden in this respect?  The banks, assurance companies and the building societies will transfer these tens of millions of pounds to the backs of the over burdened taxpayer.</P>
    <P>It is time for the Government to be straight and honest.  The thing that worries me about the future of the economy is the direction in which the Government are pointing as a result of the budget.  I am sure that the Government tried to find a way to present the budget as something which was great for the PAYE sector and that they were changing the burden of taxation on to those &mdash; referred to on television as the criminals in the financial institutions &mdash; the tax avoiders.  On television tonight tax dodgers were mentioned, but after today's budget the Government could be described as criminals and tax dodgers.  Is it any wonder that we have to borrow thousands of millions every year to keep our services running? It will get even harder in the years ahead. Any Irishman or foreigner considering investing in our financial institutions at present would need his head examined. The Government have put out the impression that these people are criminals, tax dodgers and so on.</P>
    <P>I know families who have a few shillings and whose children put their Communion or Confirmation money in the bank, the Trustee Savings Bank or the Post Office.  They opened a savings account because they were glad to get the few pounds interest tax free.  This meant their small sums were increasing each year.  The situation was bad enough two years ago when the Minister reduced the interest free allowance from £70 to £50, but now that relief has gone altogether. The Minister did not tell the PAYE sector in his television interview tonight that that allowance had gone.</P>
    <P>This budget means the average PAYE taxpayer will pay £4 less in tax each week. That is the only message the Minister had to sell.  There has been little mention of the fact that the taxpayers will pay £60 <Col N="1167" /> million extra VAT, £50 million extra on petrol, £12 million extra on tobacco and £12 million extra on alcoholic drinks, not to mention that the child allowance will lose the taxpayers £18 million, along with the retention taxes, financial institution taxes, life assurance and so on.  This budget can only be described as anti-business, anti-investment and anti-family. When I first came to this House postal charges, telephone charges, electricity charges, CIE charges and so on were all contained in one budget, unlike now when the present administration appear to introduce budgets weekly.  All these factors must be taken into account when we are discussing these resolutions. If ever a Government misled the Irish people, this Government did it today. They tried to create the impression that the PAYE sector are on the pig's back because they were given £76 million, while the Government have taxed those bad boys, those criminals, those tax dodgers, in the financial institutions.  We all know that the people who will end up paying are the majority of those in the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>I would like to continue along these lines but other speakers want to comment. I urge the Minister when replying not to go in detail into the tables supplied today about the single person, the married person, or the couple with two or three children who will save this, that and the other.  When we add all the factors in today's budget we see there is an additional tax on work, on the employer and numerous taxes on the ordinary working person, but the tragedy is that rather than trying to give the people hope and confidence in the economy &mdash; things which have been lacking for the past two years &mdash; the Government are doing the opposite.</P>
    <P>In today's television appearance the Minister's message was and in tomorrow's presentation on radio and in the newspapers will be that he is changing the burden from the PAYE sector to the financial institutions.  People are not fools and, above all, investors are not fools. <Col N="1168" /> As the weekend approaches and in the cold light of day, serious events could arise from this budget.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to Resolution No. 12.  I know it was to be taken without debate, but there are a couple of points which need clarification.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a change in this budget in regard to the abolition of the composite rate for building societies. Now the 35 per cent rate is to be paid. This means that if I am an investor in a building society and was getting away with the 28 per cent composite rate, I am now caught and will have to pay the 35 per cent rate.  There is a line in the budget which says that if I pay a higher rate, say 62 per cent, I should pay 62 per cent on my investment in the building society, yet the Minister says there is no disclosure. The impression is being created that the Minister will get extra revenue above the 35 per cent.  This is impossible without disclosure, and he said he is not going to ask for disclosure.  I would like that point clarified.</P>
      <P>My second point relates to foreigners resident abroad but who have investments in building societies here.  If such a person's name appears on the register for the inspection of the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; they are now paying the composite rate of 28 per cent &mdash; are they liable for the 35 per cent rate or does it mean that they will not pay any tax? Does this mean that huge amounts can be lost to the Exchequer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support our amendment. The Minister would have to admit that today's budget was a budget where figures were bandied about and an effort was made to try to create the impression that the taxation burden has been transferred from the PAYE sector &mdash; 800,000 workers, and that number is diminishing daily &mdash; to the financial institutions. The allowances the Minister has made are paltry, a meagre £100 per person at all levels.  There is £100 for the single person, £200 for the married couple, £100 for the widow and so on. <Col N="1169" /> He said the maximum allowance he could make was £100.  The rate bands have been moved slightly &mdash; from £4,500 to £4,700 in the 35 per cent band.  Could the Minister not have moved that band up to £5,000 and acknowledged the fact that because of inflation over the years and because of the prevailing economic situation, the people on £5,000 today are in the low income group?  If he had moved that band to £5,000 it would have eased the taxation burden on these people.  There has been no change in the 48 per cent band.  Could the Minister not have moved that to 45 per cent and increased the band still further? We must give some incentive to people and encourage them to contribute to the economy.  I accept that there has been a reduction of 2 per cent at the higher income level.  There has been much talk of financial rectitude on the part of this Government in the past few years.  If they had wished to bring about some semblance of tax equity they should have ensured that nobody would have to pay tax in excess of 50 per cent.  It is the case that in the other bands people will still have to pay PRSI contributions.  The Government have not given any recognition to the contribution they are making to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this budget there have been increases in the VAT rates, in excise duties and in the cost of petrol.  There has been an attack on the financial institutions but at the end of the day it is the consumers who will have to carry the can. Today the Minister took the soft option in his decision to take in one year the maximum amount from the financial institutions.  The banks and the building societies have been put on one level. There will be a retention tax and non-disclosure but what confidence will this create among people who may wish to invest?  Many people have invested money on the basis of complete confidentiality and on the understanding that they would make whatever contribution they were supposed to make to the Exchequer. Now the financial institutions will be used to collect tax and they will also have to make a major contribution this year to ease the financial pressures the Government <Col N="1170" /> have imposed.  The Government are travelling on a dangerous road. Economic growth will contract and confidence will be eroded.  Many Irish people who have prospered elsewhere will hesitate to invest here because they know that immediately they do so taxation will be imposed on them by the State.</P>
    <P>Last year the building societies contributed £70 million to the Exchequer and in 1986 they will be expected to contribute £100 million.  That will add to the administrative costs of the societies.  Provision has not been made by them for this kind of increased taxation and the consumers will have to pay the cost.  In a few months there will be increases in interest rates and mortgage rates.  We will have reached the stage of diminishing returns, there will be stagnation in our economic growth and more economic depression. There will be less disposable income and more unemployment.</P>
    <P>Once again the building industry has been hit severely.  Less money will be available for it.  Extra taxation will ensure that money will not be available in the economy for the financing of building projects.  There is no recognition in the budget of the skills and commitment of people in the house building sector.  We have one of the highest home ownership rates in the EC but there is no acknowledgement in this budget of the many people who are committed to providing homes out of their own resources.  What the Government are prophesing are discriminatory measures against these people.</P>
    <P>There is no acknowledgement in the budget of the need to provide funds for local authority loans or to raise the income limit.  If there is to be extra taxation in house building it is vital that we provide extra funds to meet the increased cost of houses. last year we warned the Government that the 100 per cent increase in the VAT rate from 5 per cent to 10 per cent would destroy the construction industry.  It did that and it also put severe pressure on the financial institutions.  Many of them, particularly the building societies, have had to dispose of houses at below cost price when their <Col N="1171" /> owners fell into arrears in paying their mortgages.  The course being charted by this Government and the Minister is completely wrong.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain what he means by the annual 1 per cent charge on property held under discretionary trusts.  The option that was designed to give people an incentive to invest in property has been stifled.  We have come to the point where even the medical position of a person will have to be clarified by the VHI <i>vis-á-vis</i> payments.  Obviously it will lead to an increase in premium and, again, the consumer and the taxpayer will have to carry the can.</P>

      <P>We will see.  The 1 per cent income levy is being removed and we welcome that.  That was a decision by the Minister three years ago to extract more money from the taxpayers.  However, in the light of the abolition of the child tax allowance, the meagre provisions regarding income tax and the extra taxation across the board, the net effect of this budget will be to increase the cost of living, reduce disposable income and contract economic growth.  That will result in lessening further economic stability and consequently in reduced returns to the Exchequer and in higher unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously at this late hour much of what is said will not be published so perhaps we can use this time to take the Minister to task on a few matters relating to the budget.  We consider ourselves entitled to say to him that he has not produced a budget that will be of any benefit to the PAYE sector and if any group are entitled to some concession on this occasion, they are.  No amount of manipulating the figures will result in anyone believing that in the final analysis they will be paying less in taxation before the end of this year.  One would have expected the Minister to have been more generous than merely granting a £100 increase in tax free allowances to single <Col N="1172" /> and married people.  On behalf of the entire PAYE sector we are entitled to comment that this is a miserly increase. It cannot be justified by any attempt at fancy economic talk or fiscal policy.</P>
      <P>Taking the child benefit scheme in relation to the removal of the allowance of £100 per child and taking it at a tax take of approximately 50 per cent it amounts to £50 or about £1 per week.  At best, the child benefit scheme compared with the ordinary children's allowances of £12.05 per month is £3 per month or 10p per day.  When one takes into consideration the removal of food subsidies, a target which is expected to be reached some time before summer, the Minister has not done anything to help the people concerned.  It is regrettable that having found himself bereft of cash and looking to the various sources for help in that area, he opted for place of last resort, the banks and other institutions.  That is no tribute to his management or economic skill.  They were an easy mark.  They presented an option that had been open to us all for many years.  It did not require any genius on the Minister's part or on the part of his financial wizards for him to become the first legalised bank robber in the history of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone could have used the option of resorting to the deposits in the banks and other institutions by way of bringing in a few hundred million pounds. The Minister has not explained sufficiently to the public what money he is taking, how he is taking that money and when he is taking it.  He says he will be taking an estimated £75 million from the banks and £38 million from the financial institutions but we must ask him who will be paying.  Surely the Minister is not suggesting that the banks will be paying out this money from their profit margins thereby putting their solvency at risk and leading to a position in which the Central Bank might be talking about takeovers by foreign operators.  The banks will not take the money either from their reserves or from their profit margins.  They will take it either from their borrowers or from their depositors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lowest rate on deposits is about 6 per cent while the highest is about 9 per cent.  Borrowers pay interest at rates of between 12½ and 17 per cent.  When the banks write the depositors' cheques on the two gale days of April and October, which happily coincide with the AIB and the Bank of Ireland balancing days, they will indicate that they will have to adjust the rates to accommodate the Minister. Consequently those in business who are short of cash and who may be not far from going to the wall will have to pay a little extra whether their borrowing is at the lower or at the higher rates.  Likewise, the depositors will have to take less.  The Minister should say openly that that is how the money will be raised.  He should have indicated also, that is if he was genuine in ensuring that the institutions and the corporate bodies pay for whatever goodies may have been delivered today, <Col N="1174" /> what the deposits were.  I should like to hear what those deposits amount to and how much the Minister considers to be on deposit in the associated banks both on behalf of residents and of non-residents. How much money is lodged in the other institutions, in the savings banks and in the Post Office?  It is not understood outside yet that all these other institutions are included.  I refer the House to the Principal Features of the Budget.  It is in that document that we read that these other institutions are all for the taking.  If the calculations from the last balance sheets of the associated banks are anything to go by, the Minister's figure of £75 million is very much an underestimate. If we take the lowest interest rate to depositors at 6 per cent, no matter how one calculates it, if the Minister is taking tax at 35 per cent of that and with more than £9 billion on deposit in the associated banks alone, and add to that the savings banks and the other institutions, one realises that there is a lot of money involved.</P>
    <P>There is something wrong with these figures.  There is no concession regarding the bank levy, which continues merrily on its way.  I wonder about the concession for non-residential depositors.  The Minister said that he proposes to introduce legislation to empower the Revenue Commissioners to require details of existing non-resident's deposits in certain cases.  That is certainly ambiguous and it can be taken to mean that it will apply in all cases.  This is how it will be interpreted by those who have their money on deposit.  A train load of money will leave the institutions unless the Minister does as he did on Monday when he discovered that about £600 million had taken flight in the previous four days.  He sent his henchmen to the Central Bank to tighten up the exchange controls to put a stop to the gallop.  How many of them will be there tomorrow morning to stop the outflow?  How many people in London town will be considering their position tonight, people who have had their money here working for our country? <Col N="1175" /> How many will feel safe against the allpervading action the Minister is taking today?</P>
    <P>The banks will not be the sufferers in this matter, despite the fact that the handlers have been putting out the message tonight that the institutions will carry the load and the PAYE sector will benefit because of it.  Banks will not suffer if their solvency is in question.  The Minister was eloquent on that matter when he was helping to bail out an institution during the past year in the ICI crisis.  The Minister will not sit by and see their profit margins so reduced as to make them vulnerable. It will be passed on; and because of the decartelisation and decontrol of bank interest rates, the borrowing rate will be moved up and the deposit rate will be reduced because of the money which the Minister intends to suck away from them.  If that is not legalised bank robbing I do not know what is.</P>

      <P>They are going to find out that this Government have decided that their hard-earned savings and deposits are fair game to bolster up the arrangements to keep this Government in office. This is foolish fiscal policy.  The Minister knows well that this is no great stroke <Col N="1176" /> of economic management.  It is no great stroke of genius to tell the banks that we need £75 million or to tell the insurance companies that their investment income will have to be depleted by 15 per cent. Those life assurance companies are handling the money of small investors.  Some of their managed funds have not delivered much more than the 15 per cent now being taken from them by the Minister. If administration costs and various slippages are taken into account, the Minister may be putting at risk some of the more vulnerable life assurance companies. That will be critically analysed in the near future.  While the Minister imagines that the ordinary punter outside does not really care if he takes a grab at the institutions and the banks as long as he is given something and nothing more is taken from his disposable income, the Minister must admit that he is doing both. That is the message in the convivial atmosphere of establishments around the town this evening.  They are being very nasty about the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on <Col N="1177" /> the smallness of the tax concessions in this budget.  A married couple without children, one spouse earning, will have a saving through the increase in the tax free allowance and the abolition of the income levy of £205 per year.  That will be made up of £105 saving in income tax and £100 saving on the income levy.  A married couple with one child will benefit by £206 through the tax saving, the abolition of the income levy and the child benefit scheme.  The man with a family will be £1 better off when the child benefit scheme comes into operation.  In his pay packet every week he will have a saving of £1.75 less than the married man with no children. He will lose the present £100 tax free allowance which cancels out the PAYE extra allowance.  He will have less money than his counterpart who has no children at all.  The man with a child will have £30 less money in his pay packet coming home but his wife will benefit by another £31 eventually, so the family will be £1 better off than the couple who have no children.  That demonstrates that the tax saving for a family man in this budget is less than that for a man who does not have a family.  It works out at only £4 a week either way.  That illustrates the smallness of the tax increases being given, puts them in perspective.  If I am not correct the Minister can contradict me, but I think I am correct in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A couple of years ago the tax free allowance for a child was £240, at another time it was £295, which was then reduced to £100 per child.  Perhaps it was inevitable that some Minister would abolish it.  That does not render the cost of maintaining children any cheaper.  I do not know what kind of convoluted economic thinking there was on the part of the officials of the Department of Finance which led to the child tax free allowance being whittled away.  There may be some kind of economic logic in it.  For example, a child over 18 years of age attending university costs his or her parents an awful lot of money.  In the Finance Bill the Minister should consider granting a concession in respect of non-grant students whose parents must pay university <Col N="1178" /> fees so that they would be fully allowable as a deduction in computing their income tax liability.</P>
    <P>I note that there was a tax amnesty announced in the Minister's Budget Statement.  I remember there was another in 1975-76.  It appears that it is an exact replica of that former tax amnesty, which did not work.  If the Minister wants to bring about a real tax amnesty then there is another way of going about it. The last one did not work and I think the one in the sixties was the same.  On a strict definition of a tax amnesty it is not that at all because, even though the Revenue Commissioners will implement regulations under the provisions of the Finance Bill, that will not achieve what the Minister really wants.  If the Minister wants to achieve a real tax amnesty there is a proper way of going about it which would be of benefit to the country in many ways.</P>
    <P>I notice from the Minister's Budget Statement that this famous land tax will not be introduced this year.  More importantly, it appears to me that the amount of land involved will not be 80 adjusted acres, that it will be a lot less.  The Minister did not say so in his statement but one can clearly deduce that it will amount to a lot less than 80 adjusted acres.  I am not contending that the Minister is wrong in that but it is just as well to point out that fact now.</P>
    <P>I might refer to the deposit interest provision contained in another resolution. There may be a slight dichotomy in my argument in this regard.  I welcome the non-disclosure provisions.  That will be beneficial and, in the social sphere, will alleviate many problems in areas such as the west where people have been attacked and mugged at night.  It will encourage them to put their money on deposit accounts in banks, which will be beneficial to them.  I believe it would suit many people to have that interest taxed at source in that way.</P>
    <P>However, there may be some problems encountered in this regard.  Under the Minister's proposal this will be done in the manner in which it is now done with regard to the building societies.  For <Col N="1179" /> example, a person who properly returns deposit interest, who does not come within the tax net, will pay no tax.  Under the provisions of the scheme announced a single person, say, earning £2,000 in deposit interest will not have to pay tax at present.  I act on behalf of such people and that is the only way in which they can operate.  Henceforth they will get into their hand £1,300 only.  If they submit a proper tax return my reading is that they will not be reimbursed the £700 involved, and there are many such people.  I welcome the non-disclosure requirement which will eliminate an anomaly that existed as between the building societies and the banks.  There are many people who would not be paying tax on their deposit interest who now will receive a lot less and will be unable to have that discrepancy redressed.  Perhaps the Minister could devise a provision in the Finance Bill to overcome that problem. While the scheme may be a good idea it will present problems for such people. There is much reference to non-resident accounts and so on which can be gone into in detail when the Finance Bill is before the House.</P>

There are more mysteries contained in it than there would be in an Agatha Christie novel.  I might pose one or two questions to the Minister with which he might deal when replying.  First, there is the statement:</P>
      <P>The present composite rate tax arrangement with the building societies will not apply for 1986-87 and subsequent years and the interest reliefs available on deposits with certain banks and other institutions will be terminated as from 6 April 1986.</P>

    <P>Perhaps the Minister would tell us exactly to what that refers.  A further question I would have refers to the interest payable to depositors in the commercial banks. At present a certain amount of interest <Col N="1180" /> is not disclosed and is also free of tax.  Is that concession to go in so far as these small depositors are concerned?</P>

      <P>Deputies opposite have been talking about the PAYE sector in the course of the evening, alleging that in some way I have singled out that sector.  I might make the general point that I have never been one of those people who picks out the PAYE sector &mdash; it is a mythical sector &mdash; and Deputies opposite seem to have some attachment to the idea of setting up an Aunt Sally just to knock it down.  For what it is worth, we can make some estimates of the &ldquo;PAYE sector&rdquo; contribution to taxation which belie the allegations made by Deputies on the other side of the House this evening.</P>
      <P>The amendment put down in the name of Deputy O'Kennedy is unacceptable in view of the Supreme Court decision in the Murphy case, in that the proposed income bands contained in part 2 of the table relating to a married taxpayer do not come to double the bands in part 1 of the table relating to a single taxpayer. The amendment is, therefore, defective on those grounds and for that reason alone could not be accepted.  I am surprised that the Opposition should put down this amendment.  I know they have done the same kind of thing in Finance Bills in 1983, 1984 and 1985 and do not seem to have caught up with legislation as it is now.  If it were to be constitutionalised in order to bring it into line with the decision in the Murphy case the additional cost of the proposal would be of the order of £42 million in 1986 and about £70 million in a full year.  Nowhere, at no stage this evening have I heard any suggestion from the Deputies opposite as to how that would be done.</P>

      <P>On the question of the PAYE group, to dispose of one thing, first of all Deputy Brennan, thinks that the income levy is not being fully abolished.  The 1 per cent income levy is being abolished with effect from the beginning of the 1986-87 tax year.  The reason that there is any yield at all from it in the forecasts for this year is that it will operate until the beginning of the 1986-87 tax year and the revenue that is put in is the revenue for the rest of the 1985-86 tax year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The levy is being abolished from the beginning of the 1986-87 tax year, as I pointed out in my statement <Col N="1183" /> this afternoon.  As far as we can estimate, the revenue that comes from income tax from the &ldquo;PAYE taxpayer&rdquo;, the increase in the total income tax take from PAYE, Schedule D and retention tax between 1985 and 1986 is an extra £250 million. The tax take from the &ldquo;PAYE sector&rdquo; as far as I can estimate &mdash; it is an estimate as the Deputies on the other side will know &mdash; goes from £1,830 million in 1985 to £1,985 million in 1986.  The income levy from that group in 1985 is estimated at £74 million; in 1986 it is estimated at £34 million.  The total goes from £1,904 million in 1985 to £2,019 million in 1986, an increase of 6 per cent.</P>
      <P>There are a number of factors to be borne in mind.  First, we will take during 1986, as I pointed out this afternoon, £121 million less from income tax payers than we would have had we not changed the system.  The second factor to be borne in mind is the fact that incomes increase. Nominal incomes increase and real incomes will increase during this year. That expands the base and, therefore, increases the total pool from which we are drawing taxation, and even at a lower rate of take from each individual the total amount of revenue increases.  Deputy Haughey knows well&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The income tax yield will rise in 1986 because the increase in incomes is such as to outweigh the effect of the reduction in the rates, the increases in the allowances and the widening of the bands.  That represents a real reduction in the burden of taxation on those people during 1987.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy asked about the comparison between the married taxpayer and the single taxpayer. I must say that Deputy McCreevy is arguing for bigger tax exemptions or bigger tax reliefs without saying where he is going to get the money.  He has made a certain reputation in the years since December 1982, and going back even further than that, of being the one who claimed that he would always say where the cost of the concessions he was looking for would come from.  Regarding his question, married persons with no children and married persons with children have now the same allowances.  They will get the same tax benefit from the changes I have brought in today.  The difference between them is that the married person has the extra benefit of the increase in the child benefit rate.</P>

      <P>I have only a very few minutes left.  I must say with great regret that there are many points that I will not reach but I want to come to one area to which I will make a passing reference as Deputies on the other side have done.  It is in relation to the steps I am taking with regard to the retention tax and the taxation of the gross investment funds and realised gains of life assurance companies. I want to point out to Deputy Haughey, lest there be any misunderstanding, that I detailed in my speech this afternoon and in the resolution before us exactly which institutions are concerned in relation to the retention tax.  The associated banks, the PO Savings Bank, the trustee savings banks, the ACC and the ICC are all detailed there.  I have given all of these institutions.</P>

      <P>I beg your pardon.  Perhaps Deputy Haughey did not, but some member of his party did.  One of the diminishing band did.  These institutions are all set out in the regulation.  I am dealing with this only in a partial way because I understood that we agreed that that resolution would be passed without debate &mdash; not at my suggestion, incidentally. It is perfectly reasonable to propose, as I have today, that we should widen the base of taxation in order to allow a relief on direct taxation which will benefit large numbers of people who do not have financial assets in these institutions concerned, by asking those who have these financial assets in the institutions concerned to make a contribution which is somewhat greater than they are making now.</P>

      <P>I cannot reply to the points being made by the Opposition if they keep on with this kind of interference.  I do want to make this point, as far as the relevant part of the script is concerned, that I have made it quite clear to the House that the exemptions on interest income from those institutions are being terminated with effect from the beginning of the 1986-87 tax year as part of the system that I am introducing to spread the burden of taxation in order to relieve the burden of direct taxation.  That is, in my view, an efficient reallocation of the distribution of taxation in our economy in order to restore and to improve incentives for people whose income comes directly from work.  In relation to the insurance companies, the tax, as I said, is on their gross investment income realised gains.  That inevitably will find its way into the returns on their insurance policies and the profits that they hand on to their depositors.  It is diluted; it takes place in the longer term.  I believe that is a perfectly valid substitution to ask people to make within our economy in the interests of the direct effect of changes which direct taxation will have on the incentives on people to work.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I have seen the article referred to in the question.  Measures to deal with any health risks to members of the Garda Síochána arising in the course of their official duties are matters for the Garda authorities.  I am informed by the authorities that special measures have been taken to protect members of the Garda Síochána, including members stationed at the Bridewell in Dublin, who may come in contact with AIDS or Hepatitis B and that the Garda surgeon is monitoring the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I have received from Tallaght Chamber of Commerce a copy of a submission seeking to justify the provision of a District Court in Tallaght.  The submission contains nothing of which I was not already aware when I replied to the Deputy's question on the subject on 23 October last.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the responsibility for providing the accommodation which would be required to enable sittings of the District Court to be held in Tallaght would rest with Dublin County Council.  The cost of the accommodation would depend on the arrangements decided on by the council but it is estimated that a purpose-built courthouse could cost as much as £500,000.  As I have said before, I am satisfied that Rathfarnham District Court is adequate to cater for Tallaght business and in the circumstances I would not feel justified in putting any kind of pressure on the county council to provide costly and in my view unnecessary facilities in these times of financial stringency.  If, nevertheless, the council decide to make a proposal to me in the matter I shall certainly consider it.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 15 and 64 together.  I have seen a copy of a document entitled &ldquo;Endorsement of a Publican's Licence&rdquo; prepared by the Vintners' Federation of Ireland and dated January 1986, in which recommendations are made for changes in the endorsement system.</P>
      <P>The Government recently approved proposals for the amendment of provision in the licensing laws which are considered to be an impediment to the full development of the tourist trade.  My Department are carrying out a more general review of these laws, which are also being examined by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Legislation.  The provisions regarding endorsement of licences will of course be considered in the context of that review, but it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the merits of any particular proposals for change until the review has been completed.</P>

      <P>To qualify for a free telephone rental allowance a person in receipt of a qualifying payment must be living alone or only with children under 15 years of age or other persons who are so permanently incapacitated as to be unable to summon aid in an emergency.  The person concerned applied for the allowance in 1983.  He resides with his wife and mentally handicapped daughter and he was requested at that time to supply medical evidence confirming that either himself or his wife were incapacitated as required by the scheme.  He failed to supply the necessary evidence and, accordingly, his application was rejected and he was notified of the decision at that time.</P>
      <P>In order that his case can be reviewed the person concerned has been asked to supply comprehensive medical evidence in respect of himself or his wife.

      <P>The conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance are set out at section 29 and 138 respectively of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  One of the conditions common to both schemes is that a claimant must be available for work.  The latter expression is not defined in the legislation or in statutory regulations.</P>
      <P>The availability for employment of any claimant is a question which is decided by deciding officers and appeals officers. The criteria which they use are broadly whether a genuine desire and intention to obtain work is present, whether commitments exist which might limit the person's freedom to accept, or might prevent acceptance of, full time employment which would normally be suitable and whether restrictions are being imposed by the person on the kind, place or hours of employment acceptable, any of which would unreasonably diminish the person's prospects of obtaining work.  The decisions on availability are made through the interpretation and application of any or all of these broad criteria in the light of, and in relation to, the whole facts and evidence available in each particular case.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that all questioning of claimants about their entitlement to unemployment benefit and assistance (including questions relating to whether a person fulfils the condition of being available for employment) is relevant and non-discriminatory, new guidelines in the matter are being prepared at present and will issue shortly to all staff concerned in the administration of the unemployment payment schemes.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state in relation to means test procedures for unemployment assistance: (a) if the 12.5 per cent maximum deduction for board or lodging shall apply to each individual application in a family or if it should be applied to the aggregate board and lodging deductions where more than one member of the family is being means tested; (b) when the parental allowance of £90 was last increased, the basis for arriving at that figure, and when it is intended to review it; (c) the reason unemployed family members on unemployment benefit are not included as non-earners; (d) the reason a wage earner's unemployed spouse is not included as a non-earner; and (e) whether the procedure which is adopted in practice in determining the cash income of parents includes preceding year basis, income on date of assessment or succeeding year estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 146 (1) (e) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, provides that the means of a person for unemployment assistance purposes must take account of the yearly value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by him. In practice this is taken to mean the value of board and lodging to an applicant for unemployment assistance residing in the home of his parents or a relative.  The purpose of the assessment for board and lodgings of applicants living with relatives is to achieve a degree of equity as between applicants living in relatively better off circumstances and those whose circumstances are poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criteria used are designed to ensure that each case is decided fairly having regard to the standard of living of the household and the circumstances of the applicant.  The relevant aspects of the <Col N="924" /> criteria are outlined below, by reference to the five parts (a) &mdash; (e) of the Deputy's question, on the assumption that the applicant is residing in the house of his or her parent.</P>
    <P>Re (a) &mdash; Where the head of the family is a wage earner the method of calculation is to deduct from net parental income, that is the gross income less income tax and PRSI contributions, an amount to cover such outgoings as rent or mortgage repayments.  In addition a parental allowance is deducted.  The remainder of net parental income is then divided among the non-earning members of the household to arrive at the value of board and lodgings.</P>
    <P>In order to alleviate the position of applicants from small households who often fared badly under the method described above, a provision was introduced in April 1980 which provides that the value of an applicant's share of the net household income should not be regarded as more than a maximum of 12½ per cent of that income.  The situation is therefore that the applicant benefits from whatever method is the most favourable to him or her.  Accordingly, the 12½ per cent limit where it comes into play, applies to each individual applicant in a family.</P>
    <P>Re (b) &mdash; The parental allowance currently in operation is £90 for a married couple and £80 for a single parent.  These allowances which were last increased in September 1983 and are under review at present are intended to cover the personal expenses necessarily incurred by the applicant's parents in a week.</P>
    <P>Re (c) &mdash; The income of employed family members, other than the applicant's parents, is totally disregarded from the board and lodging calculation.  Where such family members are in receipt of unemployment benefit or disability benefit they are regarded at being temporarily out of work, so their unemployment benefit or disability benefit is not taken into account as household income and they are not treated as non-earners for the purpose of dividing the remainder of net parental income among non-earners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> Re (d) &mdash; It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the unemployed spouse of a wage earner who is not a parent of the applicant but who lives in the same house. As mentioned under (c) above the income of the wage earner in that sitution would not be added to parental income.  It would be inconsistent to treat the unemployed spouse of such a wage earner as a non-earner for the purpose of calculating the value of board and lodging to the applicant for unemployment assistance. If such an unemployed spouse was in receipt of unemployment payments his or her payments would not, of course, be taken into account in the board and lodging calculation either.</P>
    <P>Re (e) &mdash; Cash income of parents is determined by reference to their income on date of assessment but account would be taken of any abnormal elements on that date.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>As stated by the Taoiseach in this House last Thursday, and by me on a number of occasions recently, a general review of the gaming and lotteries legislation is being undertaken with a view to introducing amending legislation.  In the review, options for amending the existing legislation will be considered.</P>
      <P>I could not in the context of parliamentary questions indicate what proposals I may bring forward for specific changes in the law relating to gaming and lotteries but no doubt, if the changes which I do propose do not meet with the Deputy's agreement, he will have the opportunity of putting down amendments.</P>

      <P>Tenders are being examined for the proposed extension to St. Patrick's national school, Stamullen, County Meath.  A recent review of enrolments has established a decline in average attendance, as a result of which only two, instead of three additional classrooms, will be required.  It has been necessary to consult with the planning authority about the change in the accommodation and the outcome of their consultation is awaited. I am not in a position at this stage to say when building works may commence.</P>

      <P>The applicant referred to in the question holds the leaving certificate of 1980.  The higher education grants scheme or VEC scholarships scheme, including the means test tables, applicable in the case of a candidate for a grant or scholarship is the scheme of the year he/she sits for the leaving certificate examination.  The person in question applied for a scholarship to the City of Dublin VEC in 1985.  However, the scholarships scheme of 1980 specified that awards would be made by reference to an order of merit based on the results of the leaving certificate examination of that year and as the applicant did not compete for an award in 1980 he is not eligible for consideration for scholarship assistance at this stage. No anomaly exists in either scheme; applicants are bound by all the conditions of the scheme, including means test, of the year in which they satisfy the academic attainments required by achieving prescribed successes in the leaving certificate examination.</P>

      <P>It is not possible at this stage to state precisely when tenders will be invited for the building of a PE hall at Portmarnock community school.  The hall will be built to a standard plan prepared by the Department's consultants.  However before tender documentation can be prepared some additional planning is required in regard to the development of the site and site services in connection with the hall.  While the project will be expedited as far as possible it is likely that it will be some months before the <Col N="930" /> Department is in a position to seek tenders.</P>

      <P>Since becoming Minister for Labour, I have had numerous meetings both here and in Britain with representatives of Irish organisations including the Federation of Irish Societies which is the <Col N="931" /> umbrella organisation for Irish associations in Britain.  I have also visited several Irish centres.  These meetings and visits have given me a keener insight into the problems of Irish people seeking jobs in Britain and a fuller appreciation of the extent of the invaluable services provided by the Irish Welfare agencies there.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the increasing pressure on the resources of Irish centres I have taken a number of initiatives to help them cope with the growth in the demand for their services.</P>
      <P>I have reconstituted the Committee on Welfare Services Abroad, now called DION.  DION has responsibility to advise on emigrant welfare services generally and, in particular, to make recommendations on the allocation of financial assistance provided by the Government towards the employment by Irish centres of professional workers to deal with the welfare problems of newly arrived Irish workers.  The Committee on Welfare Services Abroad was largely Irish-based.  In contrast, DION has four of its five members based in Britain and so, is clearly in closer touch with the situation there and is thus in a better position to represent the interests of the Irish in Britain.  DION is chaired by the Labour Attaché at the Irish Embassy in London.</P>
      <P>I am also in the process of improving the information and advisory services in Ireland for persons contemplating employment abroad in order to discourage unplanned emigration and to reduce pressure on reception services in Britain.</P>
      <P>Since I became Minister for Labour, the Government have increased substantially the grants for the provision of emigrant advisory services, most of which goes to Irish voluntary bodies in Britain. The amounts involved in the period 1982-85 are as follows: 1982, £38,000; 1983, £38,000; 1984, £68,000; 1985, 104,000.</P>
