    <Title>Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Bill, 1986: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism which was prepared under the auspices of the Council of Europe and opened for signature in 1977.  The Convention has now been signed by all 21 member states of the Council of Europe and remains to be ratified only by France, Greece, Malta and this country.  I shall deal later with the reservations entered by some of the signatories.  The aim of the convention is to assist in the suppression of terrorism by strengthening extradition and mutual assistance arrangements between the member states of the Council of Europe in cases concerning persons accused or convicted of acts of terrorism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the occasion of the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement at Hillsborough in November last year, the Taoiseach indicated the Government's intention to accede to the convention against the background of the commitment entered into by the Irish and British Governments to work together to achieve early progress in relation to certain matters of <Col N="1364" /> mutual concern in Northern Ireland.  The first step towards accession was taken when I signed the convention on behalf of the Government in February last.  This Bill represents the second step in that process.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the detailed provisions of the Bill, I should by way of background, say something about the relationship between this convention, the earlier (1957) Council of Europe Convention on Extradition to which Ireland is a party, and our own extradition legislation. The Convention on Terrorism is not an extradition treaty.  It is designed to complement and where necessary to modify, but not to replace, the 1957 Convention on Extradition.  Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965, which gives effect to that convention, provides the basis for our extradition arrangements with most of the member states of the Council of Europe, and also governs our extradition arrangements with other countries, such as the United States, with which we have an extradition agreement.  Part III of the 1965 Act provides for a different, more simplified, procedure &mdash; based on the backing of warrants &mdash; for the extradition of persons wanted in any of the neighbouring jurisdictions of Northern Ireland, England and Wales, Scotland, the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands. That procedure preserves, though in a form modified in important respects, the special arrangements which we had with Britain since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>Both the 1957 Convention on Extradition and the Extradition Act, 1965, provide that extradition shall not be granted for an offence which is a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence.  In the interest of brevity, I propose in the rest of this statement, to treat both those categories as being covered by the expression &ldquo;political offence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>An exception for political offences has been a common feature of extradition treaties since the 19th century.  There is no generally accepted definition of the term &ldquo;political offence&rdquo; and it appears to be generally accepted that it is a matter for the requested State to decide for itself what it means.  Partly perhaps for that <Col N="1365" /> reason, but probably more fundamentally because of the difficulty of finding an adequate and generally acceptable definition, the Convention on Extradition did not seek to define the expression, though it excluded the taking of the life of a Head of State or a member of his family from its scope.  Our 1965 Act followed the lead given by the convention. Similarly, the Genocide Act, 1973 &mdash; giving effect to the United Nations Convention on Genocide &mdash; simply provides that the crime of genocide shall not be considered to be a political offence for the purposes of extradition.</P>
    <P>The European Convention on Terrorism is also designed to strengthen mutual assistance arrangements between member states of the Council of Europe by complementing the 1959 Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. That convention permits assistance to be refused where the requested State considers the offence concerning which assistance is sought to be an offence of a political nature.  While this State is not a party to the 1959 Convention, provision exists in the Extradition Acts, 1870 and 1873 for the taking of evidence in the State for use in criminal proceedings abroad.  Assistance of this kind is not available, however, where the proceedings in question are a criminal matter of a political character.</P>
    <P>The period since the late sixties has been marked in many areas throughout the world by the emergence of new forms of terrorist violence and by the internationalisation of terrorist crime.  Individual acts of terrorism perpetrated in one country often had their origins in conflicts elsewhere and were carried out by persons who had no connection with the country in which those atrocities were committed.  The 1970 Hague Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft and the 1971 Montreal Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation were drawn up in response to the growth of offences involving commercial passenger aircraft.  Two 1973 New York conventions, namely the Convention on the <Col N="1366" /> Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons including Diplomatic Agents and the Convention against the Taking of Hostages, were likewise drawn up in response to the growth of the kind of crime they deal with.  Extradition was seen as a particularly effective measure for combating terrorism but it is a difficult matter on which to secure any major measure of agreement on a worldwide basis.  The Council of Europe, therefore, sought to deal with the problem at European level on the basis that, among the member states, a higher level of agreement should be possible to attain.  The underlying principle was that the perpetrators of acts of terrorism should not escape justice by leaving the jurisdiction in which the offence was committed and pleading that the offence for which their return was sought was a political offence.  Moreover the objective was to secure, as far as practicable, that justice should be administered in the place where the crime was committed rather than in the place where the wanted person happened to be.</P>
    <P>The result was the drawing up of the 1977 Convention on Terrorism.  The convention provides the basis for a common approach between the member states of the Council of Europe to the question of what does &mdash; or, rather, what does not &mdash; constitute a &ldquo;political offence&rdquo; for the purposes of extradition and mutual assistance. Such a common approach among the member states of the Council of Europe was considered possible &mdash; and here I am drawing on the language of paragraph 12 of the Council's Explanatory Report &mdash; because of the climate of mutual confidence among these democratic States and their common commitment to the protection of human rights as evidenced by their subscribing to the European Convention on Human Rights.  Structurally, the approach adopted is similar to that taken in the UN Convention on Genocide and the European Extradition Convention itself in the sense that it does not define but proceeds by way of exclusion.  Contracting States are required not to regard as &ldquo;political&rdquo; certain specified types of <Col N="1367" /> offence which are particularly associated with terrorist violence.  The convention also permits contracting states not to regard other specified offences as &ldquo;political&rdquo;&mdash; meaning, of course, offences in relation to which there was a claimed political content or motivation.</P>
    <P>Up to recently, successive Governments here have taken the view that Ireland was precluded from ratifying the convention for constitutional reasons. Article 29.3 of the Constitution states that Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in its relations with other States.  If non-extradition for political offences were a &ldquo;generally recognized principle of international law&rdquo; and if, in addition, the expression &ldquo;rule of conduct&rdquo; implied a binding obligation in every situation that might arise, this country would be prevented from allowing extradition for political offences.  The Irish side on the Law Enforcement Commission, which was set up in pursuance of the Sunningdale Agreement and which reported in 1974, took the view that this was, in fact, the case.  I do not think I should now involve myself in abstruse legal argument on such an issue.  Whatever is to be said on the legal issue, I think it can definitely be said that there has been a policy in favour of non-extradition for political offences.</P>
    <P>The Bill now proposed, however, does not &mdash; even in the context of the member states of the Council of Europe &mdash; propose to abandon the policy of non-extradition for political offences.  What it proposes is to limit the meaning of &ldquo;political offence&rdquo;.  It is quite clear that a process to that same effect has already taken place in the courts.  In a number of cases in recent years the Supreme Court decided that certain offences were not to be regarded as political notwithstanding that political motivation was claimed for them.  I refer to the McGlinchey case in 1982, the Shannon case in 1984 and the Quinn case in 1985.</P>
    <P>Some of the judgments given in these cases have been criticised from one standpoint or another but, especially during a <Col N="1368" /> period of development of the law, that is not only to be expected but to be welcomed. It is healthy.  Again, it was to be expected in such a situation that there should be some differences of view among judges of the superior courts on some of the issues that arose.  But, even where there were some differences, it seems to have been the general view of the judges that they did not think the interpretation of &ldquo;political offence&rdquo; should be regarded as something static but should, rather, take account of changing views and changing realities.  I suggest that is a view which acords with commonsense and to which we can all subscribe.</P>
    <P>There can be no serious doubt that court decisions in recent years reflect an attempt by the courts to respond to changing views and changing realities.  It is, I believe, inescapable that the courts will have to continue to undertake, at least to some degree, the task of responding to change in this area, and this Bill allows for that to happen.  But it is wrong, from several points of view, that the task of responding to changed circumstances should be left entirely or even mainly to the courts.  Essentially the matters at issue are matters of policy in the area of our international relations.  Consequently, it is both right and important that the Oireachtas should play its part by declaring, as this Bill provides an opportunity and a means for it to do, what is its policy.  As I have said, the Bill does not remove the need for the courts to continue to respond to change but it does not provide a benchmark, a point of reference for the courts.</P>
    <P>I now propose to outline the main provisions of the Bill and the considerations which influence the Government to implement the convention in the manner proposed.  The key provision of the convention is Article 1.  The corresponding provision in the Bill is section 3.  Under Article 1, contracting States undertake not to consider certain specified offences as political offences for the purposes of requests for extradition from other contracting States.  The offences in question include hijacking of aircraft, kidnapping <Col N="1369" /> and hostage-taking and offences involving the use of bombs and so on or automatic firearms if that use endangers persons.</P>
    <P>Article 1 is mandatory in its terms but under Article 13 a reservation may be entered in respect of it.  According to the Explanatory Report published by the Council of Europe to accompany the Convention, Article 13 recognises that a contracting State might be impeded for legal or constitutional reasons from fully accepting the obligations arising from Article 1.  Although the Government do not propose that we should enter such a reservation, I think it is only right to make it clear that, in quoting from the Council document, I am not adducing it as an argument in support of the Government's position because there appears to be nothing in the convention itself to prevent the entering of a reservation for reasons other than legal or constitutional ones.</P>
    <P>The effect of an Article 13 reservation would be to preserve, subject to a qualification, a State's right to refuse extradition for an offence which the requested contracting state considers to be political. The qualification is that the requested state is obliged, when evaluating the character of the offence, to take into due consideration any particularly serious aspects of the offence, including the fact that it created a collective danger to the life, physical integrity or liberty of persons, that it affected persons foreign to the motives behind it, or that cruel or vicious means were used in its commission.</P>
    <P>A number of other Council of Europe countries have entered reservations under Article 13.  Deputy Woods, in the House on Tuesday last and, according to a press report, in a public statement as well, has been somewhat critical of the fact that the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the Bill did not include the list of reservations made by other European countries and allegedly that, as a result, the true character of the convention could not be clearly seen.  I do not want to make too much of this but in <Col N="1370" /> fact the Deputy could have justifiably complained if the Explanatory Memorandum had contained the material he referred to since it has nothing to do with the content of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is a long-established practice that an Explanatory Memorandum accompanying a Bill should confine itself to being a neutral, factual, explanation of the purpose of the Bill and of the provisions that are in it.  In this instance, such an explanation could not be given without some reference to the content and purpose of the convention on which it is based, and the memorandum dealt with the convention to that extent.  But what other countries may or may not have done by way of implementation of the convention, however interesting it may be and however relevant to policy underlying the Bill, is far too remote from the content of the Bill to allow it to be appropriately included in the memorandum. I am not for a moment suggesting that that kind of information is irrelevant to the debate and I have arranged for it to be provided, separately, to the Library as requested here some days ago.  I propose, nevertheless, to include a summary of the information in this statement for the information of Members who may not have checked with the Library.</P>
    <P>Of the 17 countries which have ratified the convention, nine have entered reservations in accordance with Article 13 &mdash; Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Iceland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.  In addition, France, which has yet to ratify the convention, indicated its intention of making a reservation under Article 13 at the time of signature.</P>
    <P>These reservations for the most part simply say, in one form of words or another, that the State concerned reserves the right to refuse extradition for an offence which it considers to be political, having taken into due consideration the matters specified in Article 13.  For completeness, I might add that two other countries, Germany and Portugal, have entered other reservations &mdash; that is to say, reservations unrelated to <Col N="1371" /> Article 13, the German one being concerned with a situation in West Berlin. Six countries &mdash; Austria, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom &mdash; have ratified the convention without entering a reservation.</P>
    <P>The Government decided to frame the Bill on the basis that a reservation would not be entered under Article 13.  The effect of section 3, therefore, is that none of the offences covered by Article 1 of the convention is to be regarded in any circumstances as a political offence for the purposes of a request for extradition from any country which is a party to the convention.  I emphasise again a point I made earlier, namely that this provision would apply only in relation to other jurisdictions within the Council of Europe, unless the Dáil and Seanad at a later stage agree to its extension to some other specified country or countries.</P>
    <P>The Government decided not to provide for a reservation because of their commitment to the promotion of co-operation to defeat the use of violence for political purposes, above all on our own island but also on the wider European level.  The Government believe that this country should play its part fully in the extradition area in the international effort to combat terrorism.  The primary objective of the convention is to remove barriers to extradition because extradition is the most effective way of combating this kind of crime.  The effect of a reservation would be to leave open the possibility of extradition being refused in Article 1 cases on the basis that the offence was political.  The Government consider that it is not desirable that this should happen.  Realistically, the issue arises primarily in the context of violence in Northern Ireland.  In that context especially, the Government believe that, in the aftermath of the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the proposals in the Bill represented the correct response and the one calculated to advance most effectively the objective of aiding the achievement of peace and stability in Northern Ireland.  I propose to return to this point later in my statement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1372" /> The offences which section 3 excludes from the scope of the &ldquo;political offence&rdquo; exception are offences within the scope of the 1970 Hague Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft or the 1971 Montreal Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation; serious offences involving an attack against the life, physical integrity or liberty of an internationally protected person; offences involving kidnapping, the taking of a hostage or serious false imprisonment; and offences involving the use of an explosive or an automatic firearm, if such use endangers persons.  Attempts to commit those offences and participation as an accomplice are also covered.</P>
    <P>In the specifying of offences to which the section applies, section 3 follows closely the language used in the convention, though there are some differences. First, terminology used in Irish law is substituted in a few places for that used in the convention where this was considered desirable in the interests of clarity.  In addition, the Bill seeks to give greater precision to some expressions of a general nature that are used in the convention by defining them.  A few examples will illustrate this.  The expression &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo;, which is used without definition in the convention and which appears in sections 3 and 4 of the Bill, is defined in section 1 as meaning an offence which, if it had been committed in the State, would carry a maximum penalty of at least five year's imprisonment.  Similarly, it is specified in section 3 that the category comprising offences involving kidnapping, the taking of a hostage and so on is not limited to those particular offences but includes any offence committed in the course of or in conjunction with a kidnapping.  This seems necessary as it would be wholly unsatisfactory were it to be possible for a person to be extradited for the offence of kidnapping but not for the offence of murder where the kidnap victim had been murdered by the kidnappers.  Similarly again, an offence involving the use of an explosive or an automatic firearm is <Col N="1373" /> defined as including any offence, such as murder, committed by means of the explosive or firearm.</P>
    <P>In addition to making the provision necessary to give effect to Article 1 of the convention, section 3, following Article 8 of the convention, provides that proceedings in respect of those offences are not to be regarded as a criminal matter of a political character for the purposes of the provisions of the Extradition Acts, 1870 and 1873 governing the taking of evidence in the State for use in criminal proceedings abroad.</P>
    <P>Article 2 of the convention differs from Article 1 in that it is not mandatory but optional.  It allows contracting States to decide not to regard certain additional offences as potitical offences for the purposes of extradition.  These additional offences are serious offences, other than those covered by Article 1, involving an act of violence against the life, physical integrity or liberty of a person or involving an act against property if that act, that is to say, the act against property, created a collective danger for persons. Attempts to commit such offences and participation as an accomplice are also covered.  Implicit in the Article, of course, is the assumption that one is speaking of offences where the question of political motivation might be advanced by the wanted person.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided to take the option provided in Article 2 but with a qualification.  As I have already said, our concern was to give as full effect as possible to the convention in the interests of international co-operation to combat terrorism in Europe.  However, the Government were not satisfied that to exclude, from the political offence exception, the full range of offences coming within the scope of Article 2 would be warranted in all circumstances.  Instead of excluding those offences completely from the ambit of the exception, therefore, the Bill employs an approach similar to that provided for in Article 13 of the convention and used much of the language of that Article.  This does not, of course, create a requirement that a reservation be entered under Article 13 <Col N="1374" /> because Article 2 is, as I have said, optional and can be given effect to in whatever fashion and to whatever extent a contracting State decides.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill gives effect to the Government's proposal in relation to Article 2.  It provides that an Article 2 offence is not to be regarded as political where the court or the Minister, as appropriate, having given due consideration to any particularly serious aspects of the offence concerned, is of opinion that the offence cannot properly be regarded as political.  It is provided that due consideration must be given to certain specified aspects of the offence, namely, that it created a collective danger to the life, physical integrity or liberty of persons, or affected persons foreign to the motives behind it, or that cruel or vicious means were used in its commission.  This provision must, of course, be understood in the context of the provisions of the Extradition Act, 1965.  It does not mean that the Minister for Justice will have the right to decide that a person is to be extradited.  Even if the matter were to come before the Minister and he were to form the opinion that, having regard to the considerations set out in section 4, the offence cannot be regarded properly as political, the court might decide otherwise and, if so, the person could not be extradited.</P>
    <P>Article 8 of the convention creates an obligation to provide assistance in relation to criminal proceedings instituted abroad in respect of an offence coming within the scope of Article 2. Section 4 makes the necessary provision in this regard.</P>
    <P>Of course, extradition may be refused even for an Article 1 offence for a valid legal reason other than the &ldquo;political&rdquo; content of the offence or the motivation of the offender.  Article 6 of the convention takes account of this and requires a contracting State to establish jurisdiction over Article 1 offences in circumstances when a suspected offender is present in its territory and it does not extradite him following a request for extradition from a contracting State whose jurisdiction is based on a rule of jurisdiction existing <Col N="1375" /> equally in the law of the requested State. Under Article 7 if a contracting State refuses extradition for an Article 1 offence, it is required to submit the case to its competent authorities for prosecution. Section 5 provides for the establishment of extra-territorial jurisdiction over the offences in question.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) makes it an offence for a person to do or attempt to do in a country which is a party to the convention any act which, if he had done it in the State, would have constituted an offence under Irish law and which falls within the description of certain of the offences mentioned in section 3.  These do not include offences coming within the scope of the Hague and Montreal Conventions which are referred to in section 3.  It is not necessary to establish extra-territorial jurisdiction over those latter offences because the Air Navigation and Transport Acts, 1973 and 1975, have already done so.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 5 makes it an offence for a national of a convention country to do, outside the State and that convention country, an act constituting murder, manslaughter or any one of certain explosives offences, provided the act would have constituted an offence under the law of the convention country concerned and would have constituted one of the offences mentioned in the subsection if it had been done by an Irish citizen.  This provision is necessary because the obligation under Article 6 to establish jurisdiction extends to any circumstances where a rule of jurisdiction exists equally in the law of the requesting and requested States.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the obligation under Article 6 is confined to cases where a request for extradition has been received and refused.  Section 5, however, does not and indeed could not make jurisdiction dependent on a request for extradition having been received or refused. To attempt to do so would mean that at the time when an act which ought to constitute an offence under the section was done, the necessary condition that a <Col N="1376" /> request for extradition had been made and refused could not be fulfilled.</P>
    <P>However, to reflect the intention of the convention, certain restrictions are placed by section 6 of the Bill on the taking of proceedings in respect of section 5 offences.  A prosecution will require the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions and his consent may be given only when it appears to him that a request for extradition has been made by a convention country and has been refused or when, because of special circumstances, which may include the likelihood of extradition being refused, it is expedient that proceedings be taken.</P>
    <P>In accordance with precedent in cases where there are restrictions on the bringing of proceedings, section 6 allows the exercise of the ordinary powers of arrest, charge and remand without the need for the prior consent of the DPP.</P>
    <P>Another important provision in section 6 is subsection (5) which deals with the situation where something which is done abroad is an offence under our law by virtue of section 5 and is also an offence under our law by virtue of section 2 of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, or section 39 of the Extradition Act, 1965.  The effect of the subsection is that proceedings may be taken only under one enactment, as specified in the subsection.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 of the Bill deal with a possible ground of refusal of extradition that is allowed for by Article 5 of the Convention on Terrorism.  That article, which follows a similar provision in the European Convention on Extradition, permits the refusal of extradition if there are substantial grounds for believing that the request for extradition has been made for the purpose of prosecution or punishing a person on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion, or that his position may be prejudiced for any of those reasons.  Provision to that effect is already contained in Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965, which deals with extradition requests from places other than Northern Ireland and Britain. The Bill will incorporate a similar provision in Part III of the 1965 Act, thereby <Col N="1377" /> applying it to requests from Northern Ireland or Britain.</P>
    <P>The reason for the inclusion of this provision in the Convention on Terrorism is set out in the Explanatory Report of the Council of Europe.  I quote from paragraph 48 of that report:</P>
    <P>Article 5 is intended to emphasise the aim of the Convention which is to assist in the suppression of acts of terrorism where they constitute an attack on the fundamental rights to life and liberty of persons.  The Convention is to be interpreted as a means of strengthening the protection of human rights.  In conformity with this basic idea, Article 5 ensures that the Convention complies with the requirements of the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms as they are enshrined in the European Convention [on Human Rights].</P>
    <P>The report goes on, in paragraph 49, to say</P>
    <P>One of the purposes of Article 5 is to safeguard the traditional right of asylum.  Although in the member States of the Council of Europe... the prosecution or punishment of, or discrimination [against], a person on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion is unlikely to occur, it was deemed appropriate to insert this traditional clause also in this convention; it is already contained in Article 3.2 of the European Convention on Extradition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, if a request for extradition for an offence covered by Article 1 of the convention were to be refused on such a ground, whether by virtue of section 11 (2) of the 1965 Act or section 7 or 8 of this Bill, Article 7 of the convention would apply.  This would mean that we would be bound to submit the case to our competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution.  As I have already mentioned, section 5 of the Bill takes the extra-territorial jurisdiction over Article 1 offences that is necessary to enable that obligation to be met.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill confers a power to <Col N="1378" /> apply the provisions of the Act to non-convention countries.  The application of the earlier sections of the Bill is confined by their terms to countries which are parties to the convention, and the convention is open only to member states of the Council of Europe.  Section 9 enables all or any of the provisions of the Act to be applied in relation to a non-convention country with which an extradition agreement is in force.  The section, therefore, will leave open the possibility of a restriction on the scope of the political offence exception, similar to that provided for in the Bill, being negotiated with some other countries.</P>
    <P>Extending the application of the legislation to a non-convention country would of course, be a significant step in which both Houses of the Oireachtas would have substantial interest, especially as such an extension could, in principle, raise issues not arising in relation to convention countries.  The Government think it right, therefore, that there should be a requirement of Dáil and Seanad approval for such an extension.  Accordingly, subsection (3) provides that it is only if a motion of approval is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas that an order extending application of the Act to a non-convention country can be made. This provision ensures full parliamentary control.</P>
    <P>I come now to a short but important provision in the Bill, namely section 10, which is entitled simply &ldquo;Saving&rdquo;.  This provision is intended to preserve existing case law on the scope of the political offence exception and to ensure that the enactment of the legislation will not &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; the normal development of the law in this regard.  The section provides that nothing in the Bill will prevent a determination being made that an offence is not a political offence in circumstances or by reason of considerations other than those referred to in sections 3 or 4.</P>
    <P>If the Bill did not contain a provision like section 10, there might be a possibility that the legislation might be regarded as being designed to make exhaustive <Col N="1379" /> provision for the delimitation of the political offence exception.  The section is intended primarily to make it clear that it is not the intention of the Oireachtas that the courts should be precluded from continuing to take account of and reflect changes in the way in which terrorism is a threat to organised society.  It will also ensure, of course, that nothing in the Bill can affect the power of the court to hold that an offence is not political simply because the claim that it was politically motivated is based on wholly unfounded assertions.</P>
    <P>I come now to a very important provision of the Bill, namely section 12, which deals with commencement.  The Act will come into operation on 1 June, 1987 unless before that date resolutions to the contrary are passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It will also be open to both Houses to pass resolutions that the Act should come into operation on a specified date earlier or later than 1 June, 1987.  In that event the Minister for Justice will be required to make an order bringing the Act into operation on the date specified in the resolutions.</P>
    <P>This is an unusual commencement provision and to put it in context I must go back to something that was said in the joint communique issued at the time the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed. Paragraph 7 of the communique stated that the Conference would concentrate at its initial meetings on:</P>
    <P>&mdash;relations between the security forces and the minority community in Northern Ireland;</P>
    <P>&mdash;ways of enhancing security co-operation between the two Governments; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;seeking measures which would give substantial expression to the aim of underlining the importance of public confidence in the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>The communique went on to say that in the interests of all the people of Northern Ireland the two sides were committed to work for early progress in these matters <Col N="1380" /> and that, against this background, the Taoiseach said that it was the intention of the Government to accede as soon as possible to the convention.</P>
    <P>So, ratification of the convention was set against the background of progress in relation to a number of matters under the agreement, that is public confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland, relations between the security forces and the minority community in Northern Ireland and enhancing security co-operation between the two Governments. Progress on these fronts is a continuing process.  There certainly has been progress in a number of respects in the past year.  First, in January last legislation was passed in Westminster to allow a greater number of offences previously tried by a judge alone in Northern Ireland to go for trial by jury.  Second, a new set of safeguards regarding the emergency powers of the police and the British Army is being introduced, including a test of reasonable grounds of suspicion for the exercise of powers of arrest.  Third, increased rights for suspects in police custody in the North are now to be introduced. If, as may reasonably be expected, they are broadly on the same lines as the codes of practice that have already been introduced in Britain under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, they would be generally similar to the draft Regulations on the treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations which were approved by the Dáil and Seanad earlier this year.  Fourth, measures have been taken to reduce delays between arrest and trial, which will mean that persons will spend less time in custody on remand.  Fifth, the onus of proof in bail cases is to be shifted from the defence to the prosecution.  Sixth, the conditions for the admissibility of confessions in scheduled cases are to be brought more into line with those obtaining in ordinary crime cases.  Finally, certain court decisions, taken in conjunction with a statement of policy by the British Attorney General, appear to have greatly diminished the likelihood of cases being <Col N="1381" /> brought on so-called &ldquo;supergrass&rdquo; evidence without corroboration, especially against a large number of defendants.</P>
    <P>Some of the changes I have referred to are still in the course of being brought into effect.  The Government believe that further progress needs to be made and so do the British Government, though of course I am not saying that both Governments have agreed about what further changes might take place.  The important point is that the two Governments are agreed that dialogue should continue on measures to improve confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland.  In this connection I would recall the speech by the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 8 November in which he said that:</P>
    <P>We must seek constantly to develop and improve the arrangements we make for the administration of justice in terrorist cases.</P>
    <P>For our own part we look forward to the achievement of further progress in this area over the months ahead and this expectation has been further strengthened by his remarks of yesterday.  What has been achieved or foreshadowed so far in these areas does not measure up to the level envisaged when the Hillsborough communique was issued but the Government are firmly of the view that we can now have a reasonable expectation of satisfactory progress over the next six months.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances we think it is right that the Oireachtas should enact the Bill but that the Dáil and Seanad should have an opportunity to review the question of its commencement in the light of developments.  The commencement clause has been drafted to enable the two Houses to defer a final decision and to look again at progress in the building up of public confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The leader of the Opposition, Deputy Haughey, was quoted recently as having said that one would have thought that the appropriate way of dealing with this matter would be to postpone legislation <Col N="1382" /> on extradition until the necessary progress had been fully achieved.  As indeed might be expected, this was an option that was considered by the Government, but we are convinced that it is not one that would meet the needs of the situation adequately.  It is right and important that there should be a public recognition of the fact that what is happening under the Anglo-Irish Agreement is a process and a continuing one.  As I have said, certain changes in the administration of justice and in relations between the security forces and the minority community in Northern Ireland, as well as measures to enhance security co-operation between the two Governments are under way or in the offing; others are still being discussed. They represent progress.  But I must remind the House this is not a one-sided agreement.  We must be prepared to show the British Government and the Unionist community that we, on our side, are prepared to move, to show the Unionist community further evidence that the agreement is not a threat to them but rather something that offers substantial benefits to both sides and not just to the nationalist community.  We believe, therefore, that it is right to show a substantial response now.  The first step was taken with the declaration of intent to accede which was made at Hillsborough. The signature of the convention in February last was the second step.  The introduction of this Bill is the third step. Passage of the Bill will be a further step and the final step will be its commencement and the ratification of the convention.  The enactment of the legislation, even if it will not come into operation immediately, is a critical step in the whole process of implementation of the convention and is a very important earnest of our intent to proceed to ratification against the kind of background that was referred to in the Hillsborough communique.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that it is not the Government's intention that any direct and necessary linkage should be established between the bringing into operation of this legislation and any individual reform in the administration of justice in <Col N="1383" /> Northern Ireland.  What is envisaged is that up to 1 June next the Dáil and Seanad should have open to them the possibility of reviewing the introduction of the legislation in the light of progress made in relation to the administration of justice in Northern Ireland, relations between the security forces and the minority community in Northern Ireland and enhancing security co-operation between the two Governments.  The commencement provision is a flexible instrument designed to meet that need and, as I believe the House will readily perceive, a particularly appropriate mechanism, given the stage now reached in the process of implementation of the objectives set out in paragraph 7 of the Hillsborough joint communique.</P>
    <P>I now turn to another point.  In the normal course of events I would concentrate on what is in the Bill rather than on what is not in it.  On this occasion, however, I propose to refer to some matters not raised in the Bill because they have been the subject of a fair amount of public comment in the aftermath of some extradition cases in recent years and have again been the subject of comment in recent days in the context of this Bill.  I refer first to the question of a <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  In particular, some cases involving extradition to Britain or Northern Ireland were, rightly or wrongly, perceived to have &ldquo;gone wrong&rdquo; in one way or another, and this gave rise to suggestions that there should be a requirement that a <i>prima facie</i> case be made out in our courts before extradition could be granted.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that at least some of those suggestions were based on a belief that such a requirement is the international norm, and perhaps even a belief that Part II of the 1965 Act, which governs extradition to places other than Britain and Northern Ireland, contains such a requirement.  That is not the case. Under our law, no <i>prima facie</i> requirement is applied to extradition requests from any country.  There is a provision in Part II of the 1965 Act &mdash; specifically, section 22 &mdash; whereby any particular <Col N="1384" /> extradition agreement may require the production of evidence as to the commission of the offence by the wanted person but that provision is not applicable to countries which are parties to the European Convention on Extradition.  In fact, such a requirement forms no part of our extradition arrangements with any country at present, but the point I want to stress now is that it is not possible to apply the provision to countries which are parties to the Convention on Extradition because such a requirement is not provided for in that convention.  That is no accident.  Such a requirement is not in accordance with European norms.</P>
    <P>In adopting the convention in 1965, and thus adopting the continental approach on this matter, this country took the lead among common law countries which had traditionally favoured the <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  In the meantime, there appears to be an emerging trend now among major common law countries away from the general application of the requirement.  Within the past few years Australia has removed the requirement in its extradition arrangements with many countries.  Within the past few weeks the British Government have published legislation which will enable them to dispense with the requirement in their extradition arrangements. Britain have never, of course, applied the requirement in their arrangements with this country.  The British Government have signalled their intention to become a party to the European Convention on Extradition and that legislation is a necessary prior condition of its doing so.</P>
    <P>To put the matter plainly, we could not now impose a <i>prima facie</i> requirement, even if we wanted to, unless we were prepared to withdraw from the 1957 convention and to abandon the arrangements for extradition between us and the countries of continental Europe.  On the purely technical level, the position just at the moment is different <i>vis-á-vis</i> Northern Ireland and Britain, as the British Government have not yet adhered to the 1957 convention and we could, in theory, change our law so as to require a <i>prima</i><Col N="1385" /><i>facie</i> case in relation to those jurisdictions. But, apart from the fact that there would be strong objections to such a discriminatory change, most of all in the aftermath of the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the change could only be very short-lived because, as I have said, the British are preparing to subscribe to the 1957 convention and at that point we would no longer have the option of maintaining such a requirement &mdash; unless, as I have said also, we were to withdraw from the convention.  To withdraw at this stage from a convention such as the European Convention on Extradition would be a grave and, I suggest, virtually an unthinkable step to take, but, even if that major issue did not exist, there would be a very strong case against a reversion to the older approach.</P>
    <P>A requirement that a <i>prima facie</i> case be established would be a serious obstacle in the path of entirely proper and legitimate extradition requests from other countries.  The British have had such a requirement, though not in relation to Ireland.  A British White Paper published earlier this year, preceding their current legislation on extradition, acknowledged that Britain was widely regarded as one of the most difficult countries from which to secure extradition and that the principal obstacle was the requirement that the requesting state must establish in the British courts a <i>prima facie</i> case according to British rules of evidence.  The British are now about to abandon that requirement and to bring their practice into line with the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that there have been no problems in our dealings with the United Kingdom in the context of extradition.  There has, in fact, been a series of problems in recent years in cases involving the execution of warrants sent here from Britain or Northern Ireland. A tightening up of the administrative arrangements in those cases was shown to be needed and has been undertaken. It is now virtually completed.  Both sides have pursued this matter in discussions within the Anglo-Irish Conference and we have worked together to identify adjustments to the existing arrangements <Col N="1386" /> which would reduce to an absolute minimum, if not wholly eliminate, the risk of a recurrence of the kinds of difficulties that have arisen.  In saying this, I do not want to give any credence to impressions that any have been given by the publication of what, inevitably, was only a portion of the relevant facts in particular cases.  It is only right to say, despite what may have been appearances to the contrary, that, in the opinion of legally experienced persons with access to all the facts, there was only one case &mdash; and that only an arguable one &mdash; in which a question might have arisen about the sufficiency of the evidence to justify a warrant being sent here.  Nevertheless, a full review has taken place and it has been decided bilaterally that a warrant for the return of a fugitive will not be sought unless the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland, or the Crown Prosecution Service in Britain, has considered the evidence and is satisfied that it is sufficient to ground a clear expectation of a prosecution.  This means sufficient evidence of a kind that is admissible in court.  We, for our part, have made a reciprocal decision that we will continue our existing practice of having our warrants assessed for evidence by the Office of the DPP before they are sent for execution in Northern Ireland or Britain. In effect, this means that a warrant will not be sent from Northern Ireland or Britain for execution in the State &mdash; or <i>vice versa</i>&mdash; unless the case has been examined at a high legal level to see if there is sufficient evidence on which to bring a charge.  This accords with the principle that extradition is for the purpose of charging a person and not merely for questioning him.</P>
    <P>In practice, despite what may have been appearances to the contrary, much the more important point in the discussions between the British authorities and ourselves was the risk of technical difficulties about warrants.  On that point, work is also nearly completed on the drawing up of a memorandum giving guidance as to how warrants should be prepared which are to be sent to this jurisdiction for execution.  The aim of <Col N="1387" /> that memorandum is to reduce the risk of warrants and any associated documentation being found by the Irish courts to be defective after they have been sent here.  Again, we on our side will take any necessary corresponding action.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the revised arrangements will provide major safeguards against procedures being abused, though I must stress that I am not suggesting, and would have no ground for suggesting, that there has in fact been any abuse.</P>
    <P>I come now to my final point.  For some time now we have heard suggestions that the law should distinguish between the extradition of Irish citizens and the extradition of others.  Our law has never done that.  Let us not be under any illusion about what is involved here.  In practical terms, the issues we are dealing with are virtually entirely related to extradition to Northern Ireland or &mdash; to a much lesser extent &mdash; to Britain and, even in relation to the latter, the cases involved are almost all likely to be related to the problems in Northern Ireland and involve Irish people.  Our citizenship laws are very wide by international standards. Apart from the fact that nearly everybody in Northern Ireland is an Irish citizen, numerous thousands of people in Britain who are of Irish descent are also Irish citizens.  To exclude Irish citizens from extradition arrangements is, in our situation, tantamount to saying that we will not extradite at all.  We cannot in all conscience say that to those in Northern Ireland, whatever their creed, who have been at the receiving end of paramilitary violence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with care to the Minister's speech.  Extradition is an extremely sensitive issue affecting the basic human and civil rights of every citizen. It involves the surrendering by the State of persons, very often its own citizens, to another country for trial and punishment.  Therefore, this Bill must be carefully examined in a mature and responsible manner.  We in Fianna Fáil fully support and will co-operate with our partners in the Council of Europe in their efforts to combat international terrorism. As a country we have always been unequivocal in our support for measures to deal with those involved in international crime and terrorism within the established principles of international law.  In co-operation with most of our European partners, Ireland supported the European Convention on Extradition, 1957.  Britain has not as yet found it possible to sign this important convention which sought to harmonise the procedures for dealing with the extradition of all criminals excluding those involved in political offences because it insists on a <i>prima facie</i> case being proven before getting extradition.  As the Minister said, that matter is at present being considered in Britain but it is being considered for quite some time and is regarded as a very contentious matter there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Along with our European partners we recognise there is a heavy onus on us to ensure that any new arrangements we make will comply with constitutional and international standards and thereby have the full confidence of our citizens.  We must also ensure, as do our European partners, that adequate safeguards are included in any extradition legislation.  In this spirit of international co-operation we support the principle of this Bill and will support its Second Reading, but we unreservedly condemn the Government for their carelessness or for their calculated omission in not including any safeguards for Irish citizens in this European convention.  Accordingly, we will <Col N="1389" /> put down important amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is most extraordinary that the Government in this Bill do not envisage that a reservation be made and the Minister has confirmed that again here today. We will press for the inclusion of safeguards as reservations in the convention and we will be pressing for the requirement that a <i>prima facie</i> case be shown in extradition proceedings where appropriate. The Minister suggested that this will depend on other developments.  That is a matter that can be considered if other developments take place but in common with other European signatories, we must also reserve the right to refuse to hand over Irish nationals unless we are satisfied that accepted standards of justice will apply while the accused persons are in custody.</P>
    <P>We also note that many of our European partners, while signing and ratifying the convention and agreeing to take its provisions into consideration, have formally reserved to themselves the ultimate decision as to what is a political offence, whether it be for their own citizens or for political refugees.  We are amazed that in section 4 the Minister is taking to himself the extraordinary and highly arbitrary power to decide which offences are political and which are not.  We will seek amendments to the principal Act providing for more guidelines as to what offences can constitute political offences. We expect much debate on all these aspects of the Bill on Committee Stage. The issue raised by this Bill must be fully and honestly considered and discussed by us in Dáil Éireann.  There must be no ambiguity, obscurity or shortcuts in debating what is, in the last analysis, most important legislation affecting the fundamental rights and liberties of our citizens as well as the established principles of international law and co-operation.</P>
    <P>We fully support the principle of bringing requested persons to trial either here or abroad, but in accordance with the principles of constitutional justice and the generally accepted principles of international law and co-operation among our European partners.  The purpose of this <Col N="1390" /> Bill is to give effect to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism drawn up by the Council of Europe and opened for signature in 1977. The reason for the convention is to assist in the suppression of terrorism by complementing and, where necessary, modifying existing extradition and mutual assistance arrangements concluded between member states of the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>Successive Irish Governments, concerned at the constitutional implications, have refused to sign the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. They have also held that international agreements relating to extradition for political offences or for offences connected with political offences should be based on the well-recognised principle of <i>aut dedere aut judicare,</i> that is, the requested Government should have the option of extradition or of bringing the accused to trial within its own jurisdiction. The law of the State does not in accordance with the generally accepted principles of international law permit the extradition of citizens for an offence which is <i>inter alia</i> a revenue offence, a military offence, a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence.  This law has been observed by successive Governments.</P>
    <P>The special arrangements that exist between Britain and Ireland under the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act, 1976, are based on those principles.  They are very far in advance of any comparable arrangements between other States in Europe.  The Irish Government participated in negotiations for the Convention of Terrorism because we were anxious that similar arrangements based on the &ldquo;try or hand over&rdquo; principle should be introduced into our relations with other member states of the Council of Europe.  Ireland did not previously consider that it could sign the 1977 Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism because of constitutional difficulties.  In that respect the Minister has alluded to that problem and mentioned the law enforcement commission which was appointed jointly by the Irish and British <Col N="1391" /> Governments in December 1983 and which was unable to make an agreed recommendation about extradition and was equally divided on the question.  At that time, the Irish members could not recommend a change in the extradition law to enable extradition to be allowed for political offences.  They based their opinion on four considerations, public international law, the interaction of public international and Irish law, the European Convention on Extradition and the practical difficulties that would follow such change.  The four British members took the view that international law recognises the right, without imposing the duty, to refuse extradition of fugitive political offenders.  They also made the point that whatever the true extent of the principle or practice of international law, there can be exceptions where the enormity of the barbarism of the crime justifies them.</P>
    <P>British members of the Commission held the view that the terrorists operating in Northern Ireland, whatever their motivation, fall within such an exception. The Commission went on to deal with the various articles, in particular the two to which the Minister referred.  Article 1 of the convention provides for various offences, including kidnapping, unlawful detention, taking of hostages, use of bombs and rockets and automatic firearms, explosives and attempts to commit or participate in the foregoing offences. They said the non-signature by Ireland to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism &mdash; apparently Malta did not sign it either &mdash; gave rise to much criticism.  The thinking was that Article 29.3º of the Constitution prevented accession to the convention which would oblige the State to deviate from the generally accepted principles of international law relating to non-extradition for political offences.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister earlier to highlight the fact that other countries who are signatories have expressed substantial reservations. It was considered that if Ireland signed the convention, subject to the kinds of qualifications which have <Col N="1392" /> been made by other countries, it would not be contributing in any way to the suppression of violence in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In December 1979 the EC member states, including Ireland, signed an agreement in Dublin concerning the application by the EC member states of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.  The EC agreement provides for the prosecution of certain terrorist offences in cases where extradition is refused on the grounds that the offence is political.  It is based on the principle of &ldquo;try or extradite&rdquo;.  The efforts made at that time by Irish representatives were continued by successive Governments and Taoisigh.  They tried to develop the principle of &ldquo;try or extradite&rdquo; which would certainly seem to conform with our constitutional requirements.  It went to the stage of getting that kind of agreement with other member states.</P>
    <P>At that time the Irish view was that the enactment of legislation to permit extradition for such offences would represent a departure from the basic principles and would be repugnant to our Constitution.  It was seen that an amendment to the Constitution was required and the Irish concluded, in the circumstances and taking all aspects of the matter into consideration, that the balance of advantage in terms of promoting peace, reconciliation and stability and improving relations between the people of the two countries was against the promotion of any such constitutional amendment. That view was held in 1973 by the Law Enforcement Commission and by the Government in relation to those developments.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, is based on these principles and that there have been quite a number of prosecutions up to 1982.  The Act was effective and anyone whose prosecution was sought under it was pursued.  Of course, the Act requires the presentation of evidence against an individual and there must be sufficient evidence to form a prosecution.  If there <Col N="1393" /> is, the Act currently provides a mechanism whereby such persons can be prosecuted. The first prosecution in the State under the extraterritorial provisions of the Act occurred on 7 July 1980 when Messrs. Lynagh, McGurk and McNally were charged with the murder of UDR man, Henry Livingstone, at his farm at Tynan, County Armagh, on 6 March 1980.  However, in that case the Special Criminal Court ordered the three to be released, holding that the prosecution had not established even a <i>prima facie</i> case against them.  On 5 February 1981, Mr. Séamus Sorahan of Monaghan was charged under the Act with the murder of a former UDR man, Ross Hearst, in County Armagh in the preceding year. However, on 21 July 1981 the Special Criminal Court held that it had no jurisdiction to proceed with the murder trial because the accused man had not been offered the option of a trial in Northern Ireland in accordance with the Act.</P>
    <P>In June 1981 a further two men were sentenced to concurrent sentences of five years for escaping from custody while awaiting trial for murder.  In February 1982, four persons were convicted by the Special Criminal Court under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act of escaping from Crumlin Road jail in June 1981.  All four were sentenced to ten years on a charge of shooting at an RUC detective during their escape.  The court also sentenced the defendants to eight years on each of three further charges involving the use of firearms during the escape.  It also imposed a sentence of five years on a charge of escaping from custody while awaiting trial.  Two murder prosecutions have been instituted under the parallel British Criminal Jurisdiction Act, 1975.</P>
    <P>In March, 1982 Gerard Anthony Tuite was arrested in Drogheda and charged and convicted under section 4 of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act.  He was sentenced to ten years imprisonment.  I mention these cases to illustrate the fact that this process has functioned up to recently.  The legislation is there and it would be wrong to give the impression that there is not a means of dealing with a person against whom there is evidence. <Col N="1394" /> That legislation has been cited on many occasions.</P>
    <P>As a full member of the Council of Europe, we are anxious to play our part in contributing to combined approaches in tackling international terrorism. Ireland participated in the European Convention on Extradition in 1967.  The 1977 Convention on Terrorism did not receive the unqualified support of member states.  Ireland was not the only country which found constitutional and other difficulties in regard to it.  Many other countries found that in order to sign the convention they had to attach substantial reservations which radically changed the character of the convention. France at the time of signing declared that on ratification it would make the reservation that any moves to ensure efficiency in the struggle against international terrorism must be in conformity with the basic principles of French law and constitution which states in its preamble that anyone persecuted on account of his actions for the cause of liberty has the right of asylum in the territory of the Republic.</P>
    <P>Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Iceland, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Federal Republic of Germany, Sweden and Switzerland, which are contracting states, have also made reservations under Article 13 of the convention in respect of political offences.  These countries reserve to themselves the final determination of the character of such offences.  For example, the Belgian Government on ratifying the convention on 31 October 1985 made the following reservation under Article 13 which is typical of the reservations they entered:</P>
    <P>With the exception of offences committed upon the taking of hostages and other connected offences, Belgium reserves the right to refuse extradition in respect of any offences, mentioned in Article 1, which it considers to be a political offence connected with a political offence or an offence inspired by political motives.  In these cases, <Col N="1395" /> Belgium undertakes to take into due consideration, when evaluating the character of the offence, its particularly serious aspects including:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that it created a collective danger to the life, physical integrity or liberty of persons; or</P>
    <P>(b)  that it affected persons foreign to the motives behind it; or</P>
    <P>(c)  that cruel or vicious means have been used in the commission of the offence.</P>
    <P>Belgium made these reservations and decided that they would take into consideration these aspects of any offence but they reserved to themselves the final decision with regard to what is or is not a political offence.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, Cyprus, Switzerland, Belgium and France do not extradite their own nationals.  The Convention on Terrorism does not other than on the issue of the political offence affect any of the provisions of the earlier Convention on Extradition of 1957.  This means that if we want to see the true character of the new Convention on Terrorism we must also look at and include reservations made by other states with regard to the basic Convention on Terrorism.  The Minister mentioned reservations which are in the Convention of Terrorism but he did not mention the other reservations which are there already and which apply to the Convention on Extradition.  If we want to see the true character we have to look at the two sets of reservations together because it is only then that we will see how extensive the reservations actually are in practice.</P>
    <P>A brief overview of these reservations will illustrate further how other states in the Council of Europe exercise an intelligent and responsible approach to the safeguarding and protecting of their own nationals.  Under the Convention on Extradition Austria refuses to extradite its own nationals and will refuse extradition if any person claimed is to be brought before a special court or if that <Col N="1396" /> extradition should lead to the execution of a sentence or a detention order by such court.  It will also refuse extradition in order to carry out the death penalty.</P>
    <P>Cyprus refuses to extradite its own citizens. Denmark and Norway will not extradite any person if that person is to be prosecuted or proceeded before a special court.  They will not extradite any person if the extradition is liable to have particularly serious consequences for the person claimed and they will not extradite persons who may be tried or convicted by a military court.  In special circumstances they may insist that a requesting country produce evidence establishing a sufficient presumption of guilt.</P>
    <P>Italy will not grant extradition in respect of an offence punishable by death and it will not grant extradition for the purposes of carrying out a detention order unless the detention order is as a result of a sentence passed by a court of law.  The Netherlands reserves the right to refuse extradition if the extraditee is liable to the exaction of a penalty without guarantees of fundamental fairness in the hearing of any case under the provisions of Article 6.3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Therefore, the Netherlands insist on fairness in the state to which the person would be extradited. That is the question of a fair and just legal system.  The Netherlands will also not extradite its own nationals.</P>
    <P>Sweden reserves the right to refuse extradition unless satisfied that the person extradited will not be tried before a special or exceptional court.  It also reserves the right to refuse extradition if such extradition would endanger the extraditee on the grounds of his age, health or other special circumstances.  It also reserves the right in the light of individual circumstances to regard an offence as being political.  I understand that this reservation continues notwithstanding the provisions of the Convention on Terrorism. It also reserves the right to annul any extradition order made if the person to be extradited is not handed over or taken over by the State requesting on the date appointed.  Of course, they are trying to avoid some of the long delays <Col N="1397" /> which can take place and which we have seen in one particular case in this country.</P>
    <P>Switzerland refuses to extradite any person who is to be brought before a special or extraordinary court or for the purposes of carrying out a sentence passed by an extraordinary court.  It will not extradite its own nationals but will in certain circumstances put those nationals on trial.  Israel will not grant extradition of any person charged with an offence unless it is proved in the court of Israel that there is sufficient evidence that would enable that person to be sent forward for trial for such an offence in Israel. Finland will refuse to grant extradition unless it is satisfied that the person will not be tried before a special or extraordinary court.</P>
    <P>Surprisingly, the present Bill does not envisage any reservations being made by Ireland with regard to our citizens or Constitution while we are proposing to adopt and ratify the new convention.  The Minister in his contribution attempted to justify some aspects.  On the question of nationals he said that nationals would include Northern Ireland.  Of course, they are nationals but it highlights the problem which exists if we are going to be concerned about our nationals.</P>
    <P>Why is it that all these great countries have such great concern about their nationals while the Minister sweeps aside the question about nationals in this country. Under the Extradition Treaty of 1957 and the Terrorism Treaty of 1977 the Federal Republic of Germany, Belgium, Austria, France, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Greece and Cyprus refuse to extradite their own nationals. Belgium, France, Portugal, Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany, Cyprus, the Netherlands, Norway, Iceland, Sweden and Switzerland reserve the decision to themselves.  A <i>prima facie</i> case applies in Britain, Denmark, Norway, Israel and in our relations with the US.  Fairness is emphasised particularly by The Netherlands and the existence of a special court is highlighted by Austria, Denmark Norway Sweden, Switzerland and Finland.  &ldquo;Consistent with their constitution&rdquo; is particularly <Col N="1398" /> emphasised by France.  All our partners in Europe have entered very serious reservations which will have a very limiting effect on the application of this legislation and the convention.  That is why I say it is so surprising that the Government in proposing to make this major change do not envisage any reservations being made by Ireland.  That is extraordinary.</P>
    <P>We are concerned about the constitutionality under Article 29 of extraditing for political offences and we will be seeking the Minister's assurances in this regard.  For a country which does not require the presentation of a <i>prima facie</i> case for extradition, the Government propose to leave Irish nationals exposed to the danger of being extradited to another jurisdiction for interrogation and charging.  This approach of the Government contrasts starkly with the approach of the British Government which insist on a <i>prima facie</i> case being established in the courts before a British national can be extradited, no matter how horrific the alleged crime or terrorist activity.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach in this Bill would give unequal treatment to Irish nationals.  They would become the most easily extradited citizens in Europe. Unless the Bill is amended, it will be easier to bring an Irish national before the English or German courts even for a political offence than it is to bring a person before our courts.  There should be equal treatment and similar safeguards in both instances so that all persons who stand accused are treated equally, whether they are charged here or, for example, in Britain.  It is important to note that under this Bill if Annie Maguire was living here or seeking asylum here, the British authorities could extradite her without producing any evidence to sustain their charges.  This is a sobering thought.</P>
    <P>There is a common factor running through all the extradition treaties which the UK have entered into with other countries and that is that no person, either a citizen or a refugee found in the United Kingdom, shall be extradited unless a <i>prima facie</i> case is established <Col N="1399" /> before a competent magistrate.  The general wording used sets out the requirement for a <i>prima facie</i> case and it is as follows:</P>
    <P>When the fugitive shall have been apprehended he shall be brought before a competent Magistrate and if the evidence to be then produced shall be such as to justify, according to the law of England, the commital for trial of the prisoner, if the crime of which he is accused had been committed in England, the Magistrate shall commit him to prison to await the warrant of the Secretary of State for his surrender sending immediately to the Secretary of State a Certificate of the commital and report upon the case.</P>
    <P>That is how the British Government protect their citizens.  The Minister said they may change that in the future.  They may and they may not.</P>

      <P>The UK is not a signatory to the European Convention on Extradition. The requirement that a <i>prima facie</i> case be adduced before an English court is a consistent requirement running through every extradition treaty the United Kingdom have entered into.  The the test imposed by the British on requesting States with which they have extradition arrangements is stronger and more difficult to meet than the test laid down in the convention.  This is reflected in the Recent Command Document on Extradition, February 1985, which states:</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom is widely regarded as one of the most difficult countries from which to secure extradition. There is a notable failure of applications made to the United Kingdom for Extradition.</P>
      <P>While Ireland is a signatory to the convention, it would be very difficult for the State to introduce a <i>prima facie</i> requirement with fellow convention states. However, as Ireland's extradition arrangements with Britain are based not upon the convention but on a reciprocal backing of warrants legislation, there is no fundamental legal or constitutional bar to Ireland amending its legislation to provide that the UK authorities adduce a <i>prima facie</i> case in an Irish court in requesting any extradition, whether for a politically motivated offence or otherwise. Ireland may be required by Britain to meet such a <i>prima facie</i> test but we should have no fears in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the <i>prima facie</i> rule and the right to a preliminary examination, this rule is to the effect that a requested country will not extradite a fugitive unless and <Col N="1401" /> until the requesting country has produced sufficient evidence to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case against that fugitive.  The Extradition Act, 1965, had the effect of removing the <i>prima facie</i> rule completely. Whether it was intended to have that dramatic effect is open to question. As regards extradition between this State and places other than Northern Ireland, England, Wales, Scotland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, the requesting country no longer has to produce sufficient evidence to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case against a fugitive. Instead it has to furnish a statement of each offence for which extradition is requested.  Section 25 (b) requires that this statement specifies as accurately as possible the time and place of commission, that is the legal description of the offence, and the reference to the relevant laws of the requesting country.  The Irish courts have interpreted that section very literally.  A typical statement of offence will contain nothing more than a bald assertion of what it is alleged the fugitive has done: for example &ldquo;assaulted 'X' on the first day of January 1986 in Brussels, Belgium, contrary to the relevant Belgian law&rdquo;.  Strictly speaking, such a formula complies with the Act. The offence, assault, the time of commission, the date, the place of commission, Brussels, and the relevant foreign law are all specified.  The effect, however, has not merely been to abolish the technical difficulties once associated with the <i>prima facie</i> rule but to reduce the information available to the Irish courts as to what the fugitive is alleged to have done to a mere recital of the type of offence contained in the charge sheet or warrant.</P>
    <P>In Irish domestic law, persons charged with serious offences are returned for trial only when a <i>prima facie</i> case is made out.  The <i>prima facie</i> case is made out in the book of evidence which contains statements of the evidence of witnesses against the accused so as to enable the courts to decide whether there is a case to answer and the accused to know the case he has to meet.  Thereafter an indictment, containing a statement of the <Col N="1402" /> offence and bare particulars of the offence is prepared.  But an accused does not look to the statement of offence or to the particulars of offence contained in the indictment to ascertain the allegations made against him; for that he looks to the book of evidence.</P>
    <P>The result has been most unsatisfactory as Part II of the Act has been virtually reduced to a backing of warrants type scheme in that a fugitive sought under it is furnished with no more information that he would be able to derive from the warrant which is produced for the purposes of Part III of the Act.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Act has to be appraised in terms of the background against which it was enacted.  It provided for the easiest form of extradition possible between this State, Britain and Northern Ireland.  The safeguards are minimal and this fact should not be disguised by a few spectacular refusals to extradite, which entirely resulted from incompetence and ineptitude on the part of the British authorities. But in 1965, the present troubles were not anticipated.  Relations between North and South and between this country and Britain never seemed better, and the Extradition Act of that year was enacted against the background of the O'Neill-Lemass dialogue and the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Talks.</P>
    <P>The Diplock courts were not conceived of an Castlereagh-style interrogation centres or &ldquo;shoot to kill&rdquo; policies could not have been imagined.  Indeed, in the Dáil debates of the time, the then Minister, justifying the removal of the <i>prima facie</i> rule stated that as it rested upon &ldquo;the suspicion of inadequacy of proceedings under other systems of law&rdquo; and as no such suspicions then existed, the rule was unnecessary.  Can it be said today that such suspicions do not exist?  It is, in fact, Government policy to seek changes in the Northern Ireland judicial system precisely because of such suspicions.  In the McGlinchey case, it became clear that not only was there virtually no evidence against him at the time of his trial in Northern Ireland, but what little did exist was obtained after and as a result of his extradition, that is the affidavits he had <Col N="1403" /> sworn in this jurisdiction for the purpose of court hearings here.</P>
    <P>There are now very convincing arguments which show that it was never intended to abolish the safeguards which the <i>prima facie</i> rule provided.  In practical terms, this could be achieved by amendments to sections 25 and 47 of the 1965 Act, regarding that in addition to the documents now required before an extradition order can be made there must also be before the court a sufficient statement of the facts alleged against the fugitive as would, if contained in documents served on an accused pursuant to the provisions of section 6 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967 and pertaining to an offence committed within the State, justify his being sent forward for trial pursuant to section 8 (1) or (2) of that Act.</P>
    <P>The effect of such amendments would be that all requests for extradition from this State would have to be supported by a statement of evidence to enable the courts to see that a <i>prima facie</i> case existed against the fugitive at the time the request was made.  There would be no additional obligation imposed on any requesting country other than that it inform the fugitive, the Minister and the court with evidence supporting the charges against the fugitive.  No bona fide requests for extradition would be prejudiced, as presumably any bona fide requesting country would be in possession of such facts before a warrant for any alleged offender's arrest would be issued and before any request for his extradition would be made.  There should not even be any delay caused by such an additional requirement.</P>
    <P>The change would also enable the State to monitor the operation of its extradition arrangements with other states; for example, if another state consistently failed at trials following on extradition to produce evidence substantiating allegations of fact made in support of those requests for extradition, it would be open to serious doubt whether an extradition arrangement should exist with that other state.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1404" /> Such a safeguard is even more necessary in view of the increased scope for extradition proposed in the Bill before this House.  One of the main safeguards in the 1965 Act against the extradition of persons who might not, if extradited, receive a fair trial was the exclusion from the scope of the extradition process of persons wanted for political offences, or offences connected with political offences.</P>
    <P>In 1982, the Supreme Court in a judgment delivered by the then Chief Justice, Tom O'Higgins, in the McGlinchey case, overturned what had been the traditional approach of our courts to the whole concept of a political offence.  Chief Justice O'Higgins effectively abolished the whole concept of a politically-motivated offence, or an offence of a political character.  He held in a judgement which was <i>obiter dicta</i> that the offence McGlinchey was charged with was not political because it did not constitute &ldquo;what reasonable civilised people regard as political activity.&rdquo;  It follows that the McGlinchey judgment might include all offences <i>per se</i>.  Therefore any offence ceases by definition to be political activity and becomes what some would call terrorist activity.</P>
    <P>In the Shannon case, the Chief Justice went further and held that the Oireachtas had left it to the courts to decide &ldquo;on the particular facts and circumstances of each case viewed in the light of the standards and values obtaining in the country at the particular time&rdquo; what was a political offence.  The Supreme Court in deciding what these values are is at serious risk of entering the arena of politics and making decisions of policy, which is properly a province of the Oireachtas.  Indeed, the Minister has referred to this point.  It is a political distinction formed on subjective views of a political situation and is not an uncontentious legal definition, which is what we require.</P>
    <P>The distinction between political activity and terrorist actions was not only new to this country but to almost all countries which subscribed to the convention of 1957.  Indeed, it was precisely because the courts of virtually all states <Col N="1405" /> had the political offence exception to violent activity if politically motivated that the convention of 1977 was considered desirable.  The function of legislating is reserved under the Constitution to the Oireachtas and not the courts.</P>
    <P>But notwithstanding that fact, and the fact that this country has until now refused to ratify the 1977 convention and notwithstanding the fact that the refusal was a widely known part of our public policy, the decisions of the Supreme Court have in many ways gone further than was ever proposed in the convention. For example, the convention by excluding attacks with automatic firearms from the scope of the political offence, by implication do not exclude attacks with ordinary firearms.  But as the use of firearms of any type would hardly be viewed as &ldquo;reasonable politically activity&rdquo; by our Supreme Court, the question of what is a political offence will remain unanswered regardless of whether this Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>The need for some clear guidelines as to what does constitute a political offence becomes additionally important in view of the wide ranging powers which would be vested in the Minister under section 4 of the Bill.  We will know what is not a political offence, but huge doubts will remain as to what is.  Will the enactment of this Bill mean that only offences specified in it are not to be regarded as capable of being political offences?  This Bill, far from answering these questions, or resolving the problem, will only serve to compound the confusion and uncertainty which already exists as a result of the decisions of the Supreme Court in the McGlinchey and Shannon cases.</P>
    <P>The Government should consider whether in place of the existing and unsatisfactory negative test, an exception to the political offence rule would be where the crime could be considered to be wanton or indiscriminate.  We have already participated in conventions which recognise that aircraft hijacking is a segregated offence, and the Minister referred to that.  Presumably the intention here is to go further into other kinds of offences which are of a wanton or indiscriminate nature.  The inquiry as to <Col N="1406" /> the nature of the offence and whether it is political should turn solely on the motives of the suspected person, or the purposes of his organisation, but I believe should perhaps focus on whether the means used by the suspected person to achieve his organisation's political ends were direct and not wanton or indiscriminate.</P>
    <P>In consideration of an Extradition Act before the United States Congress, the House Judiciary Committee in 1983 in the proposed Extradition Bill provided that the protection of the political crimes defence should not apply to &ldquo;an offence that consists of international direct participation in a wanton or indiscriminate act of violence with extreme indifference to the risk of causing death or serious bodily injury to persons not taking part in armed hostilities&rdquo;.  Have the Government even considered such an approach?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a section which he regarded as a saver and which covers race, religion, nationality and political opinion.  He said:</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 of the Bill deal with a possible ground of refusal of extradition that is allowed for by Article 5 of the Convention on Terrorism. That Article, which follows a similar provision in the European Convention on Extradition, permits the refusal of extradition where there are substantial grounds for believing that the request for extradition has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion, or that his position may be prejudiced for any of those reasons.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that this was a safeguard in the convention and in this Bill but that is seen to be of little real effect, because that view has been put before the courts here in particular cases and did not stand up when it was applied to extradition to Northern Ireland.  On the surface it appears that this section covers the concern felt by many about the danger of prejudice in a particular administration or courts.  Members might feel that if there is evidence of prejudice, <Col N="1407" /> the provision would be a saver and that we could feel happy about that.  This is a point we can discuss further on Committee Stage.  To my knowledge that point has been put in court but it has not stood up in cases relating to Northern Ireland, the Diplock courts, the supergrass trials and so on.  I do not doubt that the Minister believed this would cover such cases.  I wanted to make those comments because the Minister made much of this in his speech.</P>
    <P>Once we begin to change the protections which exist for our citizens the question we must ask ourselves is, what doors are we opening in relation to what is a political offence?  Some of the terms used in this Bill are very open and loose. They are all-embracing and could be extended.  I could see difficulties in some of this terminology.  This is why other members of the Council of Europe have entered their own reservations.  Then I look to the United States to see how they tackled this problem.  They looked at a further category of offence which might cover the area the Minister is trying to cover, and which I am sure would have the support of this House given the fact that we have the means of dealing with any of these problems under the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Acts and other arrangements.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, Irish courts should be permitted to reject the presumption that States with whom we have an extradition arrangement can necessarily be trusted to do justice.  In the United States this presumption is known as the &ldquo;rule of non-enquiry&rdquo;.  This self-imposed blindness was evident not only in the McGlinchey case, but also in the approach of the Supreme Court in the Shannon case and the basis of extradition between Ireland and the United Kingdom was reinvoked to be based upon trust.  It is simply not politically credible to continue to base extradition arrangements on the premise that we can simply trust foreign courts. The objective of this Bill appears to be the defining of a political offence by exclusion of certain defined offences.  On <Col N="1408" /> the one hand, it is desirable that the legislature should define a term the meaning of which has caused such controversy in the courts.  It is unfortunate that the Government have decided to do so by reference to what are not to be regarded as political offences rather than by defining what is to be so regarded.  In this respect, by following the convention the Government have avoided the basic question posed by the McGlinchey decision which is whether acts of violence constituting offences under the laws of another State should ever be regarded as constituting political offences.</P>
    <P>There is a duty on this House to remove the uncertainty which surrounds this area.  Surely it is not beyond the capacity of the Government to put before this House a definition of what a political offence is as opposed to this hotch-potch of exemptions and exclusions.  Without such definition, it will be impossible for this Government or their successor to exercise the right and duty granted by the convention to make reservations designed to ensure the protection of our citizens or other persons within this jurisdiction. I accept that the concept of the political offence is not immutable, but it should not be tampered with on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis or left to the changing disposition of the Judiciary of the day.</P>
    <P>Change may be required but it should only be effected in tandem with further changes designed to protect the individual. We must ensure that no person will be extradited from the protection of our courts unless it is established that there is a genuine case for them to answer, unless we are satisfied they will get a fair trial and unless we have as much confidence in the judicial process and legal system of the other country as we have in the Irish courts.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are opposed to international terrorism and violence.  We are committed to the peaceful resolution of the problems that exist on this island.  We are equally committed however to the principle that the law must protect as well as punish.  We cannot and will not support an extradition process which would have the effect of turning extradition into a <Col N="1409" /> rubber stamp procedure for handing over anybody who is wanted anywhere for anything.  The safeguards which were associated with the old <i>prima facie</i> rule must be restored.  The expression &ldquo;political offence&rdquo; must be defined in terms of what it can be rather than what it cannot be.  The function of deciding matters of fact as well as of law must be reserved for the courts and not, as is proposed in this Bill, shared with the Minister.  Above all, extradition facilities should only be granted to jurisdictions in whose legal and judicial systems we have full confidence.</P>
    <P>The fundamental consideration with regard to extradition is that once the formalities of the extradition procedure have been completed the judicial process will take place in a foreign country under a foreign judicial system.  In this country a citizen can look to the Constitution and to the law to safeguard against abuses and miscarriage of justice in an environment with which he or she is familiar.  Therefore, when providing a legal process by which a citizen of this country is sent for trial in a country over whose legal system we have no control we must ensure that there are effective safeguards to reduce the risk of the extradition process being abused.  Of course we know the real dangers here; we have seen them so often. They are dangers that led Governments during the years to introduce and support the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act.  One of the great dangers is that someone will be extradited purely for the purpose of interrogation and questioning and possibly to get information about third parties when there is not really a case against the individual.  The Minister is fully aware of that.  I say to him that any changes that are made in relation to our shared desire to tackle international terrorism must provide adequate safeguards for our citizens.</P>
    <P>Let us recall the trial and convictions of the members of the Maguire family. Annie Maguire spent ten years in prison for an alleged offence and for one that she obviously did not commit.  Yet I do not believe that any Member of this House in any party who is familiar with <Col N="1410" /> the fact and circumstances of this case would deny that the Maguire case constituted a gross and tragic miscarriage of justice.  Let us take the case of the Birmingham Six who were also sentenced to long terms of imprisonment.  Many prominent people, including MPs from all British political parties, are convinced that in these cases also there was another gross and tragic miscarriage of justice due apparently to false confessions being beaten out of the people concerned and supported by flimsy forensic evidence. The Minister is well aware of these circumstances and of many others also.  We must bear these in mind when we talk about making major changes in our extradition procedures.  We have a duty to protect our citizens.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has said, the situation in the North of Ireland is very special. He said that the reservations for the most part say in one form or another that the State concerned reserves the right to refuse extradition for an offence which it considers to be political having taken into due consideration the matters specified. He said that two countries, Germany and Portugal, have entered further reservations, particularly relating to West Berlin.  Of course there are problems there.  These two countries have entered very substantial reservations in relation to West Berlin as indeed they must because that is a divided territory.  He mentioned that the Six Counties and various other countries have not entered reservations. He also stated that the Government decided not to provide for a reservation because of their commitment to the promotion of co-operation to defeat the use of violence for political purposes, above all on our own island but also on the wider European level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the Government considered it was not desirable that this should happen and that realistically the issue arises primarily in the context of violence in Northern <Col N="1411" /> Ireland, that they believe that in the aftermath of the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement the proposals in this Bill represent the correct response, one calculated to advance most effectively the objectives.  The Minister also commented on the position of our citizens in that respect.  He agrees that that is where the major practical problem is.  There is a real problem and a real danger of prejudice. That is something which must be faced by the Minister.  When he is proposing to extend the whole area of political offence and to open it up more widely for extradition he must ensure that there are adequate safeguards in that regard.</P>
      <P>The case of the Birmingham Six and the Maguire case are two of the more publicised cases.  Are there more and will there be more?  In introducing this Bill are we increasing the risk for further miscarriages of justice for other Irish citizens before British courts?  We must ensure that the judicial process, in so far as it is initiated in Ireland, contains adequate safeguards and limitations to protect our citizens from abuse or injustice.  Are we now to hand over our citizens on a mere charge sheet by rubber stamping the convention and without such protective reservations as most other European countries have entered?  Are we to extradite to the single judge Diplock courts where, contrary to our law, the onus of proof is on the accused to prove that a confession was obtained by inhuman or degrading treatment?</P>
      <P>Such a judicial process has been found wanting by public representatives of all parties in this House as well as by public representatives in the North.  These considerations are only some of the many which point in the direction of the need for careful and cautious consideration of any newly proposed extradition measures. It is therefore all the more regrettable that the legislation has been introduced at such short notice and has to be rushed through the Oireachtas before Christmas.  This rush is all the more disturbing in view of the fact that the legislation will not come into effect until June 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> The Minister has given us his views about the commencement date and has tied the Bill into other events.  That is disturbing.  Changes in our law should be made because we believe in them and because they conform to the principles on international law and the provisions in our Constitution.  They should be able to stand on their own no matter what arrangements or deals are made.  We have to be very careful when dealing with the area of justice.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister referred to what he described as an unusual commencement provision.  It is extremely unusual and confusing and I was interested to hear his elaboration of the reasons.  It appears that our legislation is being tied to matters that are uncertain.  The Minister has told us that the legislation is being put into place so that it can be used in the event of certain things happening.  He said he felt constrained a few weeks before Christmas to rush it through the Houses of the Oireachtas so that it could be implemented if other things happen.  He said in the course of his speech:</P>
    <P>...but the Government are firmly of the view that we now have a reasonable expectation of satisfactory progress over the next six months.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to introduce legislation on a &ldquo;reasonable expectation&rdquo;.  It worries me to see the Minister introducing legislation on that basis.  We must adhere to certain objective standards, and they are available.  If such standards require some modification over time, as occurred in regard to the hijacking of aircraft, the House can deal with that. Changes made in that way will result in us having good law.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if the Bill was given adequate treatment here with all Members assisting the Minister in teasing out the pros and cons we would have a much improved Bill.  It is unfortunate that that will not happen because of the procedure adopted by the Minister.  I am concerned because we are dealing with the fundamental human rights of our citizens.  It is not sufficient to set our <Col N="1413" /> citizens aside as the Minister has done and say that they will have to put up with this because a special problem exists.  We agree that the special problem will have to be dealt with but it must be dealt with in accordance with the principles of international law.  On Committee Stage we will try to bring the Bill into conformity with international law.</P>
    <P>The Bill is being rushed through not in the interests of Irish people or the rule of law but for some ulterior motive.  The Minister has told us what is going on and explained that he has great hopes that supergrass trials without corroborative evidence, the Diplock courts and other measures will be altered.  He has told us that it will be possible to have confidence in the system of justice in Northern Ireland.  The Minister should bear in mind that the period in custody is important. We should get assurances about the treatment of people in custody.  There is a blemish on the record of the British Government in that regard.  In 1971 the Irish Government had to bring the British Government before the Court of Human Rights because of inhuman and degrading treatment of persons in custody.  The British Government were found guilty of that breach.  We have been told today that there will not be a recurrence of such incidents but there is evidence that standards do not apply when Irish citizens are being dealt with.  The Minister may refer us to the section which deals with race, religion or political opinion but I do not see that having effect in practice.</P>
    <P>We must be prepared at all times to support new measures aimed at bringing criminals to justice here or abroad.  As the Minister's predecessors will emphasise if there is evidence against an individual that person can be brought to trial here under the Criminal Jurisdiction Act. It is wrong for others to suggest by innuendo or otherwise that such a system is not applied to all here.  I am not accusing the Minister of making such suggestions. Members on all sides have supported that legislation.  It is important to point out that an individual found guilty on evidence produced before any of our courts <Col N="1414" /> will have to suffer the full brunt of treatment by the courts here or be extradited. This House has stood by that commitment and that should be made clear, however distasteful it may be.  Members have never shirked their duty in that regard.</P>
    <P>Where the legislation governing extradition, particularly for political offences, is being radically altered it must be accompanied by suitable safeguards and limitations to guard against a miscarriage of justice and against the sending of citizens into a police state or into a legal system that is not above suspicion.  On Committee Stage we will be putting forward suitable amendments to meet those needs.  We are not opposing the Bill at this stage but we are looking to the Government for clarification of that fundamental issue.  All Members are aware of the concerns about the administration of justice in Northern Ireland.  The more one gets involved in this area the more one discovers how things happen and what is going on.  The written law is not adhered to in practice in all cases, not only in those that are publicised but in cases that occur abroad.  In recent times we have seen Irish citizens abroad being subjected to harsh interrogations of the type we do not see in our judicial system. In the Flynn case we are told that the interrogation was severe and lasted for a long time, and that the methods were not what we would stand over.  We must ensure that legislation will include necessary safeguards when we decide to abide by the convention.  Because of the time factor and the rush of legislation before Christmas it is obvious that today we can only scrape the top of the legislation without going into the details.  When member states' representatives come together in Europe to deal with these things we must try to develop a convention of safeguards that should apply throughout the participating states.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the difficulties involved in introducing the <i>prima facie</i> principle.  On Committee Stage we will have to go into this in great detail. The Minister must bear in mind that he is <Col N="1415" /> in the process of creating a new situation here, that Britain may change its position in future, and we cannot afford any more to be relying on other events in other places.  The question of equal treatment will have to be applied in all systems &mdash; whether people are to be tried in Irish courts or outside, they will have to be treated equally in the different jurisdictions. We have opened up the entire question of political offences and it will be difficult in future to know what a political offence will be.  That is another reason why we must tease out the entire Bill on Committee Stage so that we can decide what will be regarded in future as a political offence.  I have suggested that the power given to the Minister in section 4 should be removed.  There is also the matter of retrospection, and that must be given special attention.</P>
    <P>The Bill was circulated only recently, having been introduced on Tuesday with the requirement that it be taken today.  I would point out that that does not leave us much time to consider the entire ground to be covered.  I suggest it would have been appropriate to have this Bill sent to an all-party Oireachtas Committee particularly because in the time allotted we cannot give it the general consideration it requires.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish first of all to reply to a theme which Deputy Woods harped on, not just constantly but with an incredible variety of formulations.  I believe I heard his opinion on the matter not once but 25 times in the last hour.  I will refer to a point on which the Minister put some emphasis, the bearing of this Bill on citizenship. The Minister rightly said that, though many countries do not extradite their own nationals, if we were to take that line on this occasion we might as well not bother our heads with the Bill at all. Circumstances here are such that in the nature of things the people who have created the problem that we in our fallible way are trying to deal with are all Irish, some of them because they or their parents, or some other ancestor were born, in the jurisdiction in which we are <Col N="1416" /> now sitting.  Some of them, by courtesy of the action of the second inter-Party Government in 1955, through the mechanism of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act of that year, attained Irish citizenship willy nilly, because one of their parents or even one of their grandparents were born anywhere in the Thirty-two Counties.</P>
      <P>That necessarily conferred what naturally the unionists regarded as an insulting distinction &mdash; it conferred the distinction of Irish citizenship on almost everybody who was an adult in the north-eastern six counties of this country.  Mr. Paisley is an Irish citizen and is as much entitled as I to carry a green passport with a harp on it or a wine-coloured passport with a harp on it.  I had better not go into it and involve too many personalities, but any Deputy can make his little list in his mind of people who would be the fastest to disclaim the benefits of Irish nationality.</P>
      <P>They are all Irish citizens, thanks to a Bill introduced here by the late James Everett, then Minister for Justice; and, though I believe it gave more offence than it was worth, it was agreed to by all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not disagree with the general attitude of caution to extradition expressed by Deputy Woods, but I put to Deputies who have this thought uppermost in their minds this suggestion: suppose we found a refuge here &mdash; it is not impossible because it might be supposed that this is the place one is least likely to look for them &mdash; for a nest of loyalist murderers who had assassinated nationalist politicians in the North and thought they would lie low somewhere in Monaghan or Donegal for a week or two.  They would be Irish citizens, just as much as Deputy Woods and I and, on Deputy Woods's argument, as much entitled to all the safeguards.  If his argument is sound for a person with green origins, it is equally sound for one with orange origins.  I believe he would accept that.  I throw this out merely to drive home the point the Minister was quite right in making, that almost everybody in all the <Col N="1417" /> 32 counties of this island are Irish citizens in the eye of the legal system over which we preside.</P>
    <P>If we were to make a special case for citizens here, we would, because of that special circumstance, be making nonsense of the whole attempt to join this convention.  It is a quite different situation as between France and Germany. The French have not wished their citizenship on the Germans, and the Germans have not wished their citizenship on the French.  This is a special case.  God help us, but there are many criteria on which this unhappy country is a special case, and this happens to be one of them. It is not a particularly deadly one, I suppose; it does not very often surface in this House, but it is highly relevant to the measure which the Minister is promoting here today.</P>
    <P>I am very interested to hear Deputy Woods's enthusiasm for the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act.  I must admit I was enthusiastic for it myself, because it seemed to me that it did offer at the time, back in 1976, a way in which we could respectably &mdash; and I stress respectably and honourably &mdash; avoid having to get into the sensitive and disagreeable area of extradition.  I could see then no reason why people accused of offences committed in the North of Ireland, if apprehended down here, might not be tried here, and <i>vice versa,</i> but it somehow has not worked.  Although it is possible to point, as Dr. Woods did point, to a small number of cases in each jurisdiction in which the Act has been employed, the consensus among the police and the justice authorities on both sides of the Border is that, for one reason or another, it is not an adequate means of suppressing terrorism.  In other words, the bright hopes entertained for it have not been realised.</P>
    <P>But that is not the only reason for my surprise at Deputy Woods mentioning it. Although I cannot swear, without going back and looking at the Official Report, that his party actually voted against that Bill &mdash; it may be that they adopted a somewhat two-faced attitude to it &mdash; my recollection, for what it is worth, is that <Col N="1418" /> they were opposed to that Bill when it passed through here in 1975.  Most certainly I remember one expression used about it by Deputy Lenihan.  It may be that we are all so fond of Deputy Lenihan that any mention of his name takes the harm out of what will follow.  Perhaps it would have been better if I had said &ldquo;a prominent front bench member of Fianna Fáil&rdquo;, because he certainly is that; he is the acceptable face of Fianna Fáil, for my money.  But Deputy Lenihan described that measure as &ldquo;extradition by the back door&rdquo;.  I am quite certain in my memory about that; my memory is often enough not reliable but that does stick in my mind.  What this Government were aiming to do in order to avoid getting into extradition was denounced by Deputy Lenihan as &ldquo;extradition by the back door&rdquo;.  I make all allowances for Deputy Lenihan's hyperbole.  I make all allowances for the curious perspective he has of life and also for the fact that he is, politically speaking, shameless, that one might as well try to sink a cork floating on a pond by throwing stones at it as try to get Deputy Lenihan to admit shame about anything political.</P>

      <P>He is that too.  Perhaps I should not say it in the presence of Deputy McCreevy or others but in many respects he does a lot to redeem Fianna Fáil in my eyes because I feel he is a human being and has other qualities which are spread fairly thin among other members of his party.  However, at the same time, my clear recollection is that Fianna Fáil opposed that Bill at the time and I am amazed at Deputy Woods, even if they did not actually vote against it and spoke in the terms I have just indicated, calling it now a fair system supported by Members on both sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fair system and I do not dissent from that, and I am sorry that it does not seem to have worked.  Evidently it has not worked and it did not save us from the reproach which the unionists of all kidney &mdash; and I am not just talking about <Col N="1419" /> the savages and the madmen among them &mdash; level against us, that we provide in this State here a refuge for terrorists.  I am not particularly concerned about what Mr. Paisley or Mr. Robinson or any people of that sort say about us.  They are in the business of making people hate one another, Roman collar or no Roman collar.  That has been Mr. Paisley's life's work, getting Christian people to hate and fear one another.  I am not especially concerned about his ill-opinion or his good opinion; I care nothing for his opinion one way or the other.  For my money he is the person who carries the greatest individual personal share of responsibility for all the horror and cruelty and sorrow that has come over this country in the last 16 or 17 years.</P>
    <P>I say that although everyone in this House knows how bitterly I detest the IRA and everything they stand for too, but it was he who laid down the soil out of which that poisonous growth emerged. it was he who mulched it and dug it over. If the unionist people who believe in him and believed in him then could see it from that perspective, perhaps they would understand the situation that this parliament is in, in trying to deal with our madmen and our savages, in trying to marshal public opinion and keep public morale right about this matter, and go out on a limb to do so, as Liam Cosgrave and Jack Lynch did in order to keep public opinion more or less right on matters like this and went further out on a limb than any unionist leader ever did without getting pulled down.  At the same time, there are decent unionist people who genuinely think that this State is just a bolt hole for terrorists.  These are not just people whose opinion must be indifferent to us.  I am not speaking about the Paisleys.  I am speaking about decent, middle-of-the-road people whom we have to aim to convert, whose hearts we have to aim to win sooner or later.  None of us may be here to see that day and perhaps it never will arrive.  It is not ours to command, but that cannot be done for so long as they entertain suspicions of our bona fides.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1420" /> I am black in the face arguing with unionists whenever I meet them.  Whenever I do meet one I do not shirk arguing these points with him.  I make the point that the Border is as long on one side as it is on the other.  It runs through the very same bogs, crosses the very same hills, goes across the same lakes on the North as it does on the South.  I cannot see why it should be any more difficult or any more easy to guard on one side than on the other.  I cannot see why, if the resources of the British Empire plus the local resources of the Northern people themselves cannot guard the Border on one side, we should be held up to disgrace because we have not succeeded in sealing it off completely on the other, with far inferior resources.  I object very much to that line of argument which I hear coming from unionists, and I do my best to rebut them whenever I get a chance.  No sooner has one rebutted that argument than they are off to another one, about how the Protestant population has declined here in the Republic over 60 years.  When one has satisfied them on that, they go on to something else; but one has to keep trying and one may even have to do things which one would not think of doing if one were in a situation of a different kind.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose we were in a situation of this kind merely <i>vis-á-vis</i> the British who do not any longer, I presume, harbour the ambition to rule this Republic &mdash; nor do we harbour any ambition to run their country for them.  I would not be very pushed about a measure of this type but since we have to try to conciliate people with whom we aim one day to share a State &mdash; if that is God's will about it &mdash; we must contemplate bending over backwards, bending over further perhaps than prudence or other emotions might lead us to do in other connections and with other neighbours.  If the Government's judgment is &mdash; and I accept that it is a judgment which has been arrived at in the context of an agreement which I support &mdash; that this Bill is necessary in the very form in which it stands, I will support them and do so without the faintest reluctance or misgiving. However, it has to be said and <Col N="1421" /> should be made clear here that we are doing more, as Deputy Woods pointed out, than other countries would do towards one another, and if we are doing so it is intended as a gesture towards people who distrust us, who fear us, and many of whom hate us.  If it does not achieve some mileage in that direction it is not worth having.</P>
    <P>I said a minute ago, and I want to repeat it, that extradition is a disagreeable expedient, and although I detest and abominate everything the IRA stands for, to some extent it goes against my grain to send anybody out of the jurisdiction of this State, which I trust, into the jurisdiction of another state, whatever their offence or alleged offence.  It goes against my grain, and I am sure the same is true of any member of this party.  It is a thing we would all much rather avoid &mdash; not let people away with their crimes, not fail to punish them, but to hand them into another jurisdiction is something which I must say goes against my grain, and only the strongest considerations, bearing on the larger objective of which the Anglo-Irish Agreement is a symbol, would lead me to swallow it.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, which Deputy Woods talked on is not the only alternative.  There was the further alternative of all-Ireland courts which, of course, would be the best of the lot because it would be an all-Ireland institution. That was considered in 1974 by the commission set up after Sunningdale and was rejected partly because it would have involved colossal convulsions here with regard to amending our Constitution and harmonising two separate systems of criminal law, criminal evidence and criminal procedure.  I think nobody here would have objected to that system.  If we are aiming for an all-Ireland State I cannot see why an all-Ireland judicature should be anything other than welcome.</P>
    <P>However, we are stuck with what we have got, a Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act which does not adequately meet the case, in spite of the few instances, and they are only a few, that Deputy Woods produced.  The Government have come <Col N="1422" /> to the conclusion in the context of the Hillsborough Agreement that we should now sign the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism and enact the Bill which is before us.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words of a historical-legal kind about the question of extradition in the courts and in regard to the Constitution.  The Irish representatives on the 1974 commission &mdash; I mention them with great and unfeigned respect: two extremely distinguished judges who are still both judges of our courts, another gentleman who became a judge but has since died I am sad to say and a fourth member who was an official of very long experience and who enjoyed rightly, I say with pleasure because I know him personally, the very highest regard in every respect from his colleagues in the public service and from anybody in political life who had the good fortune to encounter him &mdash; these Irish representatives, I say, speaking under the hat of my pretensions as a lawyer, were wrong in taking the view in 1974 that our Constitution ruled out the enactment of law under which political offenders could be extradited.  It did, of course, make things easy for us emotionally, because we were spared the disagreeable necessity of considering enacting such a law.  I say with the respect owing to four such authorities that I think their opinion on the matter was not correct, and I grieve to say that I think that the other side of the commission &mdash; the Northern Ireland and British side &mdash; have the better of the argument.  We could say that it is an impertinence for them to interpret our Constitution for us, but the Constitution has an English version and our laws and Constitution are drawn up with a common law tradition and it is just as easy for a non-Irish lawyer who understands English to get to grips with the two instruments, compare them with each other and see to what extent they are inconsistent as it is for one of our own.  I am sorry to say this, but I have always thought that an impartial observer now reading the relevant pages of the 1974 commission's report will come to the conclusion that the Northern Ireland and <Col N="1423" /> British representatives had a better case when they said that there was nothing to prevent us from enacting legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Irish side took the view that the generally recognised principles of Article 29 included the principle that states must not extradite for political offences.  The English and Northern Ireland side took the view that international rule was not correctly expressed in that way, and that the most one could say was that international law permitted the refusal to extradite political offenders whose extradition was sought, but it most certainly did not forbid their extradition.  The Northern Ireland and British side were able to produce a decision of our Supreme Court in 1950 or 1951, delivered by Chief Justice Maguire, in which he said, and the court formally held, that there was no principle in international law which forbade the extradition of political offenders.  Here was an embarrassing and painful situation.  The Northern Ireland and British side were able to produce a judgment of our Supreme Court which asserted just what the Irish representatives on the Sunningdale Commission were denying or the other way round if one prefers.</P>
    <P>I think that is correct.  The authorities cited in the old case and the authorities who are citable since then establish that, although international law is very familiar with a principle whereby states are free to refuse to deliver a politically motivated offender or somebody whom they suppose to be that, no rule of international law forbids them to deliver such a person up.  Even if there was such a rule, that rule by itself would not invalidate legislation passed by this Oireachtas.  That was another leg of the Northern Ireland and British case which was, perhaps, not so strong as the first leg.  The first leg was very strong.  They might have added that international law anyway is a flexible system; it is still in a rather early condition of growth; it has not yet become rigid; it admits change and development.  We see changes happening under our eyes.  When everybody in this House was born the <Col N="1424" /> offshore three mile limit applied everywhere. That was all there was.  Take a simple incident to show what has happened since then.  All kinds of countries in all patterns in different regions of the globe have begun to extend unilaterally, then jointly, then by convention, then by limitation, the three mile limit to a six mile limit or a six mile limit to a 12 mile limit.  Unilaterally they have elected new limits for fishing purposes and further limits again for mineral exploitation purposes. A whole body of law has grown up in this area which did not exist when we were children.  That is not being done only by legislation or by treaty; it is being done by usage and practice, one of the means by which international law changes.  A rule of international law and a generally recognised principle are that a pattern of usage and a pattern of regional agreements can validly modify international law.  I am not an international lawyer, but I have sufficient smattering of knowledge of the subject to think that this is true.  The rules are suspectible to modification for regional purposes and according to usage.</P>
    <P>This Irish view was relied on by Governments here in subsequent years in perfect good faith, I have no doubt. The difficulty was in telling the British that there is no use in talking to us about extradition, because the best legal opinion we have is to the effect that you cannot extradite people charged with a political offence &mdash; that difficulty was cut at a stroke, like the Gordian knot by a sword, by the Irish Supreme Court in two or three cases at the beginning of the eighties, when that court, led, as Deputy Woods said, by the Chief Justice of the day and acquiesced in by the other judges, said that whether or not there is a principle of international law which forbids the extradition of people wanted for politically motivated offences or not, we decline to give the honourable title of political offence to a piece of barbaric savagery.  We decline to dignify with such a phrase an act of cold blooded cruelty, so that irrespective of what international law says about a political offence, we are not going to characterise this murder, <Col N="1425" /> explosion or whatever it may be as a political offence because it is so far below the level of what ordinary people regard as political as not to be entitled to that dignity.</P>
    <P>That got over the difficulty as far as extraditing two or three people was concerned. I want to come back to those individual cases in the afternoon; but let me say now that that decision reached by the Supreme Court was not wholly satisfactory from the legal point of view because &mdash; I say with the deepest respect to the court &mdash; if you are trying to define a political offence, and Deputy Woods seemed to be not far from scratching this problem, probably you cannot do it without reference to somebody's intention. If you are dealing with somebody who denies having to do with an offence at all, who says that it was not he, that he was not there, they have got the wrong man, how can you form any opinion, except by the circumstantial features of the case, about the intentions of the person who committed the crime?</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the procedure is that when vacancies occur, the National Manpower Service send over a list of names to the relevant Government Department, that the list is usually based on the length of time these people are on Manpower records, that jobs are subsequently filled but that in many instances the jobs are not filled from the supplied list but from an unofficial list supplied by a Minister or his political associates?

      <P>As I mentioned in my reply the position is that the Departments are advised by circular as to the procedure to be followed.

      <P>Internal promotions up to and including the grade of higher executive officer may be made by Departments under delegated authority.  Promotions above that level are authorised by my Department. Departments are required to certify that officers proposed for promotion are the most suitable and best qualified of all the officers eligible for the post.</P>
      <P>Personnel units in Departments keep up to date on a continuing basis with current ideas on assessment for promotion. Each Department is responsible for ensuring that their criteria for internal promotions are kept under review to ensure that they reflect best modern thinking and are appropriate to their circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years schemes of staff appraisal have been introduced for EO, HEO, assistant principal and principal <Col N="1431" /> grades.  While the primary focus of these schemes is developmental they also assess suitability and potential for future promotion.</P>
    <P>There are a number of inter-departmental schemes of promotion which cover promotions to grades in the administrative area.  The policy of my Department is to ensure that these inter-departmental promotion schemes are progressively widened to cover eventually all staff in administrative, professional, clerical and technical grades who have not already been included.</P>
    <P>Appointments at assistant secretary and higher levels are made following advice from the top level appointments committee.  This gives renewed emphasis to the importance of mobility at senior level in the service and it ensures that the best use is made of the management talent which is available.</P>
    <P>The criteria for promotion are kept under continuous review.  The last formal service-wide review took place prior to the publication of the White Paper <i>Serving the Country Better</i> published in September 1985.  Paragraphs 4.6, 4.7, 4.8 and 4.13 deal with promotion and performance appraisal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Changes occur on a minor basis at regular intervals.  For example, a scheme was introduced in December 1985 in relation to the promotion of clerical assistants under which they may be promoted to the grade of clerical officer within their own Departments. The basis for selection depends on suitability and experience but it is a matter for individual Departments to determine how they assess these criteria. The scheme of direct promotion to clerical officer is due to be reviewed and, obviously, consultations have to take place with the staff side early next year.</P>

      <P>The principle of merit underpins promotion to all posts in the Civil Service but that does not mean that work performance and experience are ignored in relation to the length of service.

      <P>The embargo no longer applies to any Government Department or office.  As envisaged in the White Paper, it has been replaced in the Civil Service with a system of staffing targets which take account of the different needs and resources of Departments. In fact, the new system enabled the staffing of the Department of Social Welfare to be increased by almost 200 posts in 1986.</P>
      <P>Future needs will be dealt with in the context of the end-1987 staffing targets for the Civil Service as a whole.  These are being considered in the context of the overall budgetary position.</P>

      <P>Yes.  When I settled the 1986 staffing target levels, the cuts amounted to about 536 posts and there were 236 additional posts.

      <P>The 25th round agreements for public service groups expire on 30 June 1987.  The standard terms of agreements concluded for the Civil Service, gardaí, Defence Forces, teachers and health workers provide for a 3 per cent increase from 1 May 1986, a 2 per cent increase from 1 January 1987 and a further 2 per cent increase from 1 May 1987.  Most manual workers in the public service have accepted an alternative agreement with increases of £5 per week from 1 May last and £6 per week from 16 February next.</P>
      <P>These agreements also provide for the implementation of special pay awards on a phased basis.  The first phase of some of these increases is being paid from 1 December; the first phase of the remaining increases is not due for payment until 1 December 1987.</P>

    <P>The Government's view of what should happen on the expiry of current rounds, in both the private and public sectors, is set out in their statement of 18 September last.  As regards the commercial State bodies &mdash; whose agreements terminate earlier than in the public service generally &mdash; the Government believe that, for a <Col N="1439" /> variety of reasons, settlements in these bodies should be below inflation, should last for a period of 18 months and should include a substantial pay pause.

      <P>On 20 November the <i>LE Aisling</i> was instructed by Naval headquarters to proceed to Bantry Bay to observe the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i>.  On 22 November Naval operations, Haulbowline, were called by Shannon and told the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> had lost her rudder. The approximate position was given.  The Naval Service undertook to act immediately. The <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> was tracked down and confirmation was received that the entire crew had been taken off by helicopter.  The initial message was that the crew had been in danger.  On 23 November a request was made by the oil pollution operations group for Naval Service assistance.  The <i>LE Aoife</i> reported the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> 11½ miles off Fastnet Rock.  The <i>Aoife</i> was instructed to proceed towards the ship. She observed the ship and reported it being grounded the following day, 24 November, on Stags Rock.</P>
      <P>On 28 November, the Naval Service involvement in this area was stood down by the oil pollution operations group as the threat of oil pollution from the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> had receded.  The Navy received a request from the local civil authority to provide a vessel to enforce a 1,000 metre exclusion zone.  This came about because of the action of the Receiver of Wrecks and because boats were approaching the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and allegedly stripping her of equipment. We provided a boat to undertake this work and ensure that the exclusion zone was observed.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also asked why we had to rely on British naval helicopters.  We have no operational craft to do this kind of work.  As the Deputy knows, we purchased a number of helicopters which are eminently suitable for search and rescue but because of the complicated equipment on board and the length of time it takes to train personnel they are not yet operational.  Personnel are being trained and will shortly be in a position to do the kind of work we have always been dependent on other people to do for us.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister <Col N="1442" /> agree that these helicopters were ordered over four and a half years ago and that we have been consistently told we would have them &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;?  Will they be ready to go into service soon rather than having this nation constantly embarrassed by the fact that we are not able to give a proper rescue service?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The <i>LE Aisling</i> was monitoring the progress of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> which was drifting helpless in the Atlantic for 30 hours.  Did the Naval Service consider putting personnel on board at any stage to switch off the engines and keep the ship on the high seas until such <Col N="1443" /> time as she could be taken in by a tug?  I am amazed that the Naval Service did not contemplate that.</P>

Will the Minister check with the Naval Service and find out why they did not consider putting people on board to try to knock off the engine and keep the vessel at sea until salvage tugs were able to take her properly in tow?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1980, Deputy Molloy might like to know, four cadets were appointed.  The fact is that female personnel in the Defence Forces are not <Col N="1445" /> asked to participate in all the activities that male members are asked to participate in.  In other words, they are non-combatant personnel and because of the demands made on the male members at the request of the civil power, for example, in relation to Border duty, escort of cash, explosives and so on &mdash; areas in which female members have not traditionally participated and activities in which they are not called to participate &mdash; I am advised that the Defence Forces are fully stretched to keep the services going.  That must be taken into consideration when we are considering the admission of female members.  I have no rooted objection to or antagonism towards this concept and should like to be in a position to have more female members in the Defence Forces, but we have a basic problem.  As the Deputy knows, initially a Women's Corps were established in the Army but they were disestablished because of difficulties which arose relating to size and the actual administration of the corps itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Bill was introduced into the Dáil to establish the Women's Corps in the Army, a very long list of military duties of a non-combatant nature was drawn up, duties that could be very ably undertaken by the female members of the Defence Forces.  There was agreement at that time among all parties that this measure should pass in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked if that is not true.  If the political will were there to enlist more female members, they would be enlisted.  I suggest that the will is not there and this is a fault for which the Minister will have to accept the blame.</P>

      <P>The fact is that pressures <Col N="1446" /> at the moment on the military are such that they are fully stretched to meet the demands made on their time and on personnel. If I had unlimited resources it would be an ideal situation where I could recruit female members who would not be involved in the combatant areas.  I mentioned three areas in which the demands are very strenuous.  Unfortunately for us, there is no diminution of these demands.  If there were, we could then have a choice and allow for the admission of more female recruits into the military services.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's personal credentials as to non-chauvinism. However, I would put it to him that the policy of this Government with regard to the admission of women into the Defence Forces is a sham, like so many of their other policies.  The numbers speak for themselves.  Surely it is indictive of a climate of opinion which says &ldquo;When economic times are bad, women go home&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 14, 16, 19, 21 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's defence policy is directed towards preserving the sovereignty and security of the State from a neutral position, outside military alliances, and towards supporting the Government's commitment to the pursuit of peace in the world.  The commitment to neutrality was reaffirmed in the <i>Programme for Government</i> in 1982 and there has been no dilution of that commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of my recent statements was not to suggest that there had been or that there should be any dilution of the <Col N="1451" /> commitment but rather to develop a more realistic dialogue on these matters. The financial burden of defence, more onerous when based on a neutral policy, is particularly heavy on smaller nations and the fact that, proportionately, certain other neutral countries spend considerably more on defence is indicative of the price one may have to pay to support a neutral status.  It is reasonable to question whether those who tend to be so emphatic in their comments in this area are willing to commit the country to higher levels of defence expenditure.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of any increase in expenditure there is, obviously, still a limit to the extent to which a country can defend itself, especially a country of our size in a world of super powers with vast and terrible potential for destruction.  Even without escalation to the nuclear level, modern warfare with highly sophisticated weaponry narrows the circumstance in which a capacity to defend against any attempted breach of our neutral position can be assured.  That said, any potential aggressor would have to weigh carefully the full implications of any contemplated aggressive action against this country.</P>
    <P>Currently, the Defence Forces are maintained and equipped to meet the demands made on them.  They are highly trained in modern weaponry and techniques and there is a planned capacity for an escalatory response should the prevailing circumstances so require.  I am more than satisfied with their commitment, morale and standard of performance and, if any proof were needed, I have only to refer to their proud record in peace-keeping operations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to put all my questions together because I will probably only get one shot.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister's commitment to neutrality, for what it is worth but I want to concentrate my question on the defence of <Col N="1452" /> the country in case of attack.  The Minister referred to financial restrictions, but what does he believe is essential in terms of expenditure for an appropriate defence, which we do not have at the moment?  In view of the fact that we are an island nation, attack would be by way of sea or air.  We have been told there are sufficient anti-aircraft SAM missiles. Will the Minister say what coastal defence he has in mind and what would be required in that area to put up a reasonable defence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I do not accept that our defences at the moment are not adequate in the kind of circumstances I envisage.  However, I can envisage other circumstances where our defences would not be adequate, and would not be adequate if we were to spend ten times the amount we spend each year.  That is the point I tried to get across in my statement.  There is a limit beyond which one cannot go, and beyond which one should not go, because the level of expenditure on land or coastal protection must be dictated by resources and by the wealth of the country involved.  I am satisfied that the level of expenditure on our defences is within the criterion I mentioned, that is, based on our resources to do the job.  In relation to coastal resources, the Deputy must accept that because of the offensive weaponry there is at sea from nuclear submarine level downwards, we have not got, and we will never have, the kind of defences which could save us from that kind of attack no matter how much we spend.  Despite the vast sums being spent by the Americans, they cannot guarantee themselves total security against that kind of attack, and the Deputy knows it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that his statement could have a serious effect on the stability and morale of our Defence Forces because it undermined our unambiguous position on neutrality which we have held for the past 40 years? Over the past year 84 per cent of the Irish people have clearly shown total support for and trust in our neutral position. <Col N="1453" /> Deputy O'Toole, in his privileged position as Minister for Defence, reporting to the Commander in Chief, has made a serious error and has undermined the confidence which our people and other countries have in our neutrality.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not interrupt the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  I came out immediately.  I did not attack neutrality.  I said I was totally in favour of neutrality and totally at one with my colleagues in Government on the whole concept of neutrality.  I alerted people to the fact that neutrality presupposes a certain level of one's capacity to stay neutral and I questioned our commitment, in money terms, and our ability to be able to do that.  Being neutral is not a passive thing.  You must work at being neutral.  I explained my position and made the point that people tend to confuse neutrality and partiality, which are two totally different things.  I should like to point out to Deputy Treacy that subsequent to my statement, and as a commentary on that statement, he said on radio that in the event of external attack he would, under his policy, and I assume the policy of the party to which he belongs, destroy every port and airport in this country to ensure that the external attacker could not land here or sail in, as if that attacker would need to land here or sail in.  We could be attacked from five miles in the air and from 150 miles or even further off the coast.  The destruction of <Col N="1454" /> our ports and airports was his answer to our defence of neutrality.  If that is the Deputy's level of defence then go bhfóire Dia orainn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the Minister.  The interview I gave was in answer to questions on Radio na Gaeltachta. To translate from the official language into the English language, basically what I said was that in the event of that happening we should render our facilities operable.  I did not say I would do it but I said there should be some type of policy there.</P>

      <P>I said we should make our position quite clear, that we are totally in favour of neutrality and that we should ensure that we would, as a result of the Minister's statement, have to clarify our position in the European Parliament and in the UN.  That is exactly what I said.  There is no point in the Minister trying to put a different interpretation on it to get himself out of this situation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service if he will give details of the result of his Department's staff reviews undertaken some time ago to examine the operation, fairness and efficiency of the embargo over the last number of years as this review was promised by the previous Minister for the Public Service and the results to date have not been made known to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>As already announced, the one-in-three embargo has been replaced by an arrangement whereby end-year targets are determined for individual Departments and offices.</P>
      <P>The first application of this arrangement relates to 1986.  End-1986 staffing levels have been set for each Department-office by reference to a number of factors including the continuing need to reduce the size of the Civil Service and reviews of the relative staffing levels, needs and demands of Departmentsoffices. These reviews identified areas of special concern which were taken into account in determining the levels.  The resulting end-1986 levels involve a reduction in numbers for most Departments-offices, increases in a limited number of cases &mdash; e.g. prisons where the end-year target provides for an additional 85 posts during 1986, and the provision of a reserve of 50 posts for computer, accountancy and welfare staff throughout the service.  The service-wide effect is a reduction of a nett 200 posts by the year's end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said in an earlier reply today that the embargo, as it has been understood by everybody in this House since 1981, has been abolished. Earlier in the year the previous Minister for the Public Service said there was a new system of reviews in operation where departmental heads would have an opportunity to review the staffing structures and to make their cases on where they felt staff was necessary or where staff could be transferred.  Is the Minister stating, other than in regard to the Central Statistics Office and the Department of Social Welfare, because of the high unemployment figures, that all the other reviews by the Departments led to a reduction in staff?  If that is so, and that is what he stated in reply to two questions today, how was that achieved?  Was it achieved through retirements, through transfers to the Department of Social Welfare or how?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there was considerable debate and discussion <Col N="1458" /> between my Department and the other Departments in relation to the requirements of some Departments for additional staff and the ability of other Departments to contribute towards the continuing reduction in the overall numbers in the Civil Service.  In addition, there were discussions between myself and other ministerial colleagues on these issues.  The result of those various reviews and discussions was an acceptance by the Government of the figures for the end of 1986.  There is no question of redundancies as a consequence because as the Deputy will be aware there is normal wastage.  In addition, the Deputy will also be aware, because of the initiatives we took in the job creation area of the public sector, that is, job-sharing and in particular the career breaks, recruitment to the Civil Service is continuing despite the fact that we are committed to reducing the overall numbers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the position that if a Department or a section of a Department have two, three or four vacancies and if they can justify that they require an additional head of staff from whatever grade, they do not have to refer back to the public service on the basis of the embargo, that they can fill that post from their own Department provided the number of staff is not over a particular figure?  Is that the structure?  The Minister will appreciate that the system was never outlined clearly in this House.  There were a number of questions answered vaguely by way of stating that there would be departmental reviews.  It was never clarified to the civil servants, to their unions, to their associations or to this House.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service if he will outline the role of his Department, their objects, functions, targets and their administrative structure; if he will quantify their achievements since their foundation and detail their value to the Civil Service and the public service at large and comment on the Government's view of their role, in terms of efficiency and effectiveness and their future role as a Department of Government into the nineties; and if he will state their standing in the Government's plans for implementing Civil Service reform as part of the White Paper policy <i>Serving the Country Better</i> and the Government's three year plan <i>Building on Reality, 1985-1987</i>.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In outline, the role of the Department of the Public Service is to develop and co-ordinate the management of the public service in the areas of personnel, including remuneration and conditions, systems and structures, with a view to providing the most effective, efficient and responsive service to the State, the Government and the public.</P>
      <P>More particularly, the Department aim to ensure, with full regard to the requirements of public policy and of good industrial relations, that:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the organistion, technology, systems and structures of the public service are those best fitted to carrying out the tasks assigned to it;</P>
      <P>&mdash;staff of the right quality are appointed on merit and developed to make the best contribution to the work of the service;</P>
      <P>&mdash;pay and conditions of service are determined in a way which endeavours to balance costs and the interests of the employing organisation, the staff and the community.</P>
      <P>The functions of the Department are set out in the Public Service (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order, 1973 and in various Statutes enacted since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1461" /> The objectives and targets of the Department are set out in considerable details in an internal management plan which is updated annually.  A useful summary is contained in Programme 53 of the Comprehensive Public Expenditure Programmes 1985 (Pl 3364), a copy of which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>The administative structure of the Department is set out in the organisation chart which will be circulated in the Official Report.  The Deputy will see from this that of the total staff of 366, 126 are in the Central Computing Service which provides a wide range of computer services to Departments and other public service bodies and 95 are engaged in service-wide personnel management, training, remuneration and industrial relations activities.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that much has been achieved over the years in the area of public service management and reform.  The achievements of the Department and their value to the Civil Service, to the public service at large and to the general public and taxpayer may be detailed as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;The explosive and unsustainable growth in public service numbers has been reversed.  Civil Service numbers have been cut by about 10 per cent since 1982;</P>
    <P>&mdash;A major programme of reviews has improved staff deployment;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Planning-based systems of management are being introduced in all Departments;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Public service pay has been contained with minimum industrial friction;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Building on the limited resources available when this Government took office, resources for information technology in Departments have been substantially increased;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Training of public servants has been increased and made more relevant &mdash;for civil servants through the Civil Service Training Centre and for <Col N="1462" /> other public servants through the provision of resources for the Institute of Public Administration;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Increased provision has been made for staff welfare &mdash; for example, an active programme to combat alcoholism;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Promotion to the higher Civil Service is now entirely based on merit;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Mobility within the Civil Service and between the Civil Service and outside organisations has been improved;</P>
    <P>&mdash;A system of job sharing and career breaks has provided employment opportunities for over 6,000 without increasing overall public service numbers and a very successful scheme of clerical trainees has been introduced;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Programmes have been developed to improve public offices and service to the public;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Tá béim níos láidre leaghta ar chur chun cinn na Gaeilge sa Státseirbhís &mdash;mar shampla Lá na Gaeilge;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Initiatives have been taken for the devolution of functions to local authorities;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Measures have been taken to provide equal opportunities and to avoid discrimination based on sex or marital status;</P>
    <P>&mdash;An Ombudsman was appointed in January 1984 and his remit was extended in 1985.</P>
    <P>The tasks which the Department of the Public Service at present undertake have to continue to be done if the country is to have an effective, responsive and costconscious public service.  For example, the Exchequer pay and pensions bill is now approximately half of current supply services expenditure and the negotiation of the terms and conditions of employment of public servants for the foreseeable future is going to demand the full time exercise, with increasing sensitivity and patience, of all the skills <Col N="1463" /> developed in the Department of the Public Service over the years.</P>
    <P>Again, given the demand for new personnel-intensive services, the Government must have on the one hand, a staff to deal with and control public service numbers and to ensure, where necessary, movement of staff across departmental boundaries and, on the other, the capabilities to examine how work is done in Departments and to advise on better and more cost effective ways of doing it.</P>
    <P>In regard to information technology, there must be a central focus in Government to ensure that, not only do we adopt the latest developments in the technology and maintain our place with our European partners, but also that we make the most effective use of our resources by <Col N="1464" /> adhering to common policies and standards and providing common services where that is most economical.  Finally, in this hard and competitive environment in which we must survive for as far ahead as we can see, there is need for an effective central direction and provision of training and development for public servants.</P>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's other points, the Department's standing in the Government's plan for implementing public service reform will be clear from the central role and additional functions which were provided for it in the White Paper, <i>Serving the Country Better</i>.  The White Paper stated in paragraph 8.18 that: &ldquo;The Minister for the Public Service will oversee the implementation of the reforms announced in this White Paper on behalf of the Government&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;(i)  This total includes a contingency provision of £108 million to meet the net cost of 24th round pay increases in the public service in 1985.  Since the distribution of this sum across Votes is only finalised near the end of the year it has not proved possible to apportion it over programmes. The comparable cost of pay increases in 1984 has been distributed across programmes.  The 1984 and 1985 aggregates are therefore not comparable.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The activities of Gaeleagras na Seirbhíse Poiblí, (1984 outturn £163,000; 1985 estimate £179,000) which is part of the Department of the Public Service are included in programme 51.  The figures shown here also exclude certain administration expenses recouped from the SIF and OIF which are included in the costs of the Social Welfare programmes.</P>

      <b>II: Programme Statement</b>
    </P>
    <P>This programme covers the activities of the Department of the Public Service, the Office of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners and the Institute of Public Administration.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Department of the Public Service</i> was set up in 1973, following the recommendations of the Public Service Organisation Review Group, as the central authority for (a) advising Government on, and implementing, policies relating to organisation and personnel functions within the public service and (b) the re-organisation of the public service.  The activities of the Department come under the following main headings:</P>
    <P>
      <b>Systems and Structures</b>
    </P>
    <P>Activities under this heading are directed at</P>
    <P>&mdash; advising Government on the most appropriate assignment of functions to public service institutions from the point of view of efficiency and effectiveness:</P>
    <P>&mdash; helping departments and other public service institutions to develop systems, processes, organisation and structures to enable them to carry out their assigned functions effectively and efficiently; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; helping departments to introduce the best modern management systems and practices and to promote these in the agencies for which they have responsibility.</P>
    <P>
      <b>Overall Public Service Development</b>
    </P>
    <P>Activities under this heading are directed at</P>
    <P>&mdash; developing and implementing proposals for fundamental change in the organisation, management and operation of the public service; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; improving, through research, understanding of the ways in which this change can most effectively be introduced.</P>
    <P>
      <b>Manpower and Personnel Management</b>
    </P>
    <P>Activities under this heading are directed at</P>
    <P>&mdash; enabling the appropriate levels of staffing in the public service to be determined within overall Government policies; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; helping to make available throughout the civil service the necessary skilled staff and promoting high standards of personal performance.</P>
    <P>
      <b>Remuneration and Conditions</b>
    </P>
    <P>Activities under this heading are directed at the development and implementation, within national incomes and employment policies, of policies on pay and superannuation in the public sector and on conditions of service in the civil service, bearing in mind the need to maintain uninterrupted services and good employer/employee relations.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Civil Service Commissioners</i> operate under the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, which relates to the holding of competitions and selection of persons for appointment to positions in the civil service.  The Commissioners also deal with</P>
    <P>&mdash; recruitment functions for an Garda Síochána, An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann;</P>
    <P>&mdash; promotion competitions in the civil service, An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Local Appointments Commissioners</i> operate under the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Acts 1926-1983.  Legislative provisions relating to their activities appear in various other Acts, e.g. Local Government Acts, Health Acts, the County Management Act 1940, and the Harbours Acts, 1946 and 1947.  Their function is the selection and recommendation of persons for appointment to professional and senior management posts under:</P>
    <P>&mdash; Local Authorities</P>
    <P>&mdash; Health Boards</P>
    <P>&mdash; Harbour Authorities</P>
    <P>&mdash; Fisheries Boards, and</P>
    <P>&mdash; Vocational Education Committees.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Institute of Public Administration</i> is a company limited by guarantee.  The Institute is involved in the training and education of public servants, in promoting and undertaking administrative research and in publishing sources of material on public administration.  The Institute will derive 38% of its income in 1985 from Exchequer grant-in-aid.  This grant-in-aid is a contribution towards the general expenses of the Institute and includes the corporate subscriptions on behalf of Government departments.  A further £125,000 is being provided from the Exchequer to fund a programme of administrative research bringing the total direct Exchequer contribution to the income of the Institute to 43%.  The balance of its income is derived from charges for training, publications and its other activities.</P>

      <P>It took the Minister almost five minutes to read that reply and, obviously, those who prepared it have a guilty conscience because they have found it necessary to make it so long.  My question to the Minister was if he considered the Department of the Public Service as it is structured to be relevant.  The functions the Minister has mentioned can be adequately carried out by other Departments.  In fact, those functions were carried out more successfully in the past by other Departments. The Department of the Public Service do not have any power or a role to play.  The points made by the Minister relate to administration and it appears that the Department was set up to coordinate the other areas of bureaucracy. That Department cannot do anything without the sanction of the Department of Finance.  In fact, it would be better if they were under the Department of Finance.  Will the Minister accept that 95 per cent of the tasks outlined in his reply could be better carried out by the Department of Finance?  The Department were established to organise, plan and help to finance the other Departments but that was not mentioned in the Minister's reply.  The Devlin idea was that there should be a three-line structure but the Department of the Public Service has failed in that regard.  The fact that the Minister in the course of his reply did not refer to the reason the Department were set up is an indication of their failure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before moving the Adjournment of the debate &mdash; I had been speaking immediately after Deputy Woods &mdash; and at the beginning of my contribution I relied on my memory in referring to the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976 which Deputy Woods was holding up to high praise here as being an adequate mechanism for joint suppression of terrorism.  He said it had enjoyed the support of all sides and was an obviously fair system.  My recollection was correct; that legislation was bitterly opposed by his party in 1975.  The Second Stage was passed by the narrow margin <Col N="1511" /> of 69 votes to 67.  Deputy Lynch led the Opposition to it as Leader of Fianna Fáil. He wanted the Dáil to decline to give a Second Reading to a Bill which Deputy Woods is praising on the basis that it is good enough for the suppression of terrorism and makes the measure before the House redundant.  Deputy Lynch's objection was on the grounds, as he put it, that the Bill did not contain a provision for an all-Ireland court, was unworkable and inconsistent with Ireland's obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and, if you do not mind, was repugant to the Constitution in that it contravened Articles 3 and 38. That information can be found at column 1706, Volume 285 of the Official Report of 20 November 1975.</P>
      <P>I do not want to make a great point of it because it could have been a slip of Deputy Woods's recollection, but that was an acrimonious debate.  I was the Taoiseach's Parliamentary Secretary and Government Whip at the time.  I participated in the debate, out of as well as in order.  The debate descended to the point when words like &ldquo;West Briton&rdquo;, &ldquo;Redmondite&rdquo; and so on were flung around.  Ostensibly, it was being conducted by the then Opposition, the present Opposition, on the basis that they had no sympathy with violence &mdash; we were inclined to accept it &mdash; and they had this and that nit to pick on the Bill.  In other words, they wanted on the one hand to be able to say they were against violence as much as we but on the other hand they wanted to keep their place in the continuous relay of the race, running themselves at a certain remove from the lads.  They put all the obstacles they could in the way of the Government, but 11 years later that Bill has got the plaudits of Deputy Woods because there is another Bill on which he can take the same attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all against terrorism and I unreservedly accept that Deputy Woods means that, but just the same the tradition to which he belongs requires him to pick every nit he can find and every hole he can find over and above that <Col N="1512" /> which the duty of an Opposition spokesman requires.  If he and his party were half as eloquent in and out of season in condemning violence and trying to give a lead to people to dissociate themselves, even emotionally, from people who commit violence and who tout for violence as they are in picking holes in the Government's flesh and blood in their efforts to do something about it, that party in general would be more impressive.</P>
    <P>Before the Adjournment I told the legal story of extradition in cases of political offences and I told the House that the Supreme Court in a number of cases in the eighties cut the Gordian knot of the so-called obstacle in international law for extradition for political offences. Effectively, the court said:</P>
    <P>Whether international law contains a general principle which forbids a State to extradite people charged with politically motivated offences or not there are certain offences of so barbarous a character, so cruel and inhuman, that they are not entitled to the dignity of such a description.  They are not entitled to the association which the word &lsquo;political&rsquo; would give them.  So whatever international law would say about political offences in the context of extradition, this offence will not get the benefit of it because it is too low to be called a political offence in any defensible understanding of the word.</P>
    <P>It is not the first time in living memory that the Supreme Court has been left to do things which the legislature had left undone.  The court took that bull by the horns, just as in the seventies it had to do in Mrs. McGee's case in regard to contraception what this House had been too holy to do earlier and remains too holy to do in this decade.</P>
    <P>I recognise the court's argument and sympathise with it &mdash; I have an instinctive feeling for it as others have &mdash; but as I said before the Adjournment, I cannot believe it is a satisfactory position in the long run, legally speaking, because sooner or later the court will be up against <Col N="1513" /> and faced squarely with the problem of constructing a statutory definition of the concept of a legal offence.  Parliament will not be fair and will not make sense unless it inserts some motive or some intention behind the offence.</P>
    <P>You cannot necessarily conclude anything with certainty about the motive for a particular act of violence even though the circumstantial evidence might be compelling.  If a bomb is put in the boot of a car and there is an anonymous telephone call to a police station, and the district has to be cleared and if before it is cleared the bomb goes off and murders unfortunate policemen, the evidence is compelling or as good as compelling that there was some kind of twisted political motive behind the offence.  But in the case of a particular defendant who denies the offence and whom the law does not require to say anything about it, how can we fix on that defendant any conclusion about this state of mind or the motivation behind the offence?  In the first place, he has not been convicted of committing the offence by definition because his extradition is sought into another jurisdiction where he can be put on trial.  That person has not even been put on trial and the sheer physical authorship of the offence has not been brought home to him.  Until it is, and even then until he perhaps says something in defence of himself by reference to his motives, one cannot with certainty say that it is a politically motivated offence.</P>
    <P>I say with respect, as one must do when offering any critique of a judgment of a court, that I think in the long run that it will be an unsatisfactory situation for the State to have to reply on.  Sooner or later the court will come up against the problem of how to observe objectively a set of facts, a bomb exploding or somebody found with his body riddled with bullets, and have to say that is a political offence. How can that be done unless one knows something of the state of mind which inspired it, and how can one know that until one has got to know the person whom one has succeeded in convicting of the offence?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> Needless to say, that difficulty is not peculiar to us.  It can operate anywhere. Therefore, the only way to deal with this sort of thing is to take a short cut, to characterise certain categories of offence which typically tend to be politically motivated, but not to characterise whole categories of offences as ones which are automatically excluded from the political offence category for extradition purposes.  I do not think there is any other way to do it.  There may be one case in ten or in 100 in which we could extradite somebody wrongly or in which we will fail to extradite somebody who should been extradited, but the problem about motivation is insoluble unless the person who has been arrested admits the offence and says: &ldquo;Yes, but I was a member of the IRA, or the UDA&rdquo;.  I do not think it can be done in any other way. A person who is arrested may say: &ldquo;Yes, it was I who shot so and so, who put a bomb in this or that place, but I believe in liberating the six north-eastern counties by force, that has been a political tenet of mine all my life and was at the time I committed the offence and, therefore, I come under the defence of the political offence umbrella&rdquo;.  That, of course, might enable one to come to a conclusion about the motive behind the offence.  It puts the accused person in the position that he has admitted the offence. In other words, he has owned up in order to benefit from the political offence exemption.  One has to forego one's chance of defending oneself against the substance of the charge by admitting it. Needless to say, not many people are in that category, but one of the persons in those eighties cases was in that category and owned up and gave a political motive as the explanation.  In the long run there probably is no other satisfactory way to deal with this thing than not to bother about the motivation by selecting categories of offence in which one can assume with a fair degree of probability &mdash; we are all fallible &mdash; certain things about the motives behind the committing of the offence.  These would be deeds of an intolerably violent type and we could simply exclude them from the benefit of <Col N="1515" /> the political offence description.  That is what the Minister has sought to do, and even if there were no such thing as the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Hillsborough Accord, we could hold up our heads and fairly say that we were willing to cooperate and go along with other western European democracies in taking this line. Even if there never had been an Anglo-Irish Agreement, even if we had no special problem in the North, I think this is a defensible and reasonable way to go about the suppression of terrorism which is a notoriously and internationally practised evil.  In general I support the measure.</P>
    <P>There is of course another reason why I think that we ought to get away from the idea that in the case of an offence that was politically motivated the perpetrator should be entitled to some privilege, the privilege of non-extradition, which other offenders do not have.  I simply cannot see that people who are charged with acts of inhuman savagery, cold blooded butchery, should enjoy a privilege which a common or garden embezzler, or a common or garden forger, or common or garden defrauder of his employer or someone he is doing business with, does not enjoy.  I cannot see the justice of the system &mdash; and I believe the ordinary layman would see the point too &mdash; whereby if I embezzle in the North £1,000 from my employer, or if I forge some kind of an instrument in the North whereby I achieve some unfair or illegal advantage, or if I defraud somebody that I am in a business partnership with, I can be sent back over the Border but if I put a bomb in a supermarket or set fire to a disco, or if I go into a public house and rake it with machine gun fire, I am somehow entitled to a privilege which the embezzler or the forger does not have.  I cannot see why my deed should be vested with the dignity of a political offence which privileges me in some way and may even lead to me not being prosecuted at all.</P>
    <P>That is a fairly general reflection but I <Col N="1516" /> want to make a few more specific ones relating to the Constitution.  One of them has been made in the Supreme Court in the most recent of these cases, when it said that it could not admit or allow the political offence privilege, whatever it is, to operate to the benefit of somebody who, by his own avowal, was dedicated to the overthrow of this Constitution by force and the objects of whose own organisation included the overthrow of this State by force.  For a State to accord a privilege of this kind to somebody, the reason for whose claim of privilege is that he intends to subvert and destroy the whole State here, would be a piece of lunatic Quixotery.  I will go further than the court has gone and say that to accord a privilege of this kind, over and above the sort of treatment which an ordinary or common or garden embezzler or someone accused of an indecent assault or something of that kind would have, to somebody who has murdered innocent people conflicts, and plainly conflicts, with several of the values which are explicitly established and guaranteed in our Constitution.  One does not have to go any further than the preamble to the Constitution in which the Irish people are made to speak with their own voice:</P>
    <P>We, the people of Éire,</P>
    <P>This is what the people of Ireland say:</P>
    <P>seeking to promote the common good, with due observance of Prudence, Justice and Charity, so that the dignity and freedom of the individual may be assured,</P>
    <P>How are we assuring the dignity and freedom of an individual if such an individual, on our own territory, according to Article 2 of this very same document, can with impunity, because of the operation of a rule like this, be blasted to pieces, his children and wife left sorrowing and the country demoralised and shamed by the photographs of heartbroken children in the paper every day?  Is that assuring the dignity and freedom of the individual? How much will we give for a legal privilege which privileges someone accused of <Col N="1517" /> a deed like that far above the common or garden customer who embezzles or defrauds?  The Irish people, out of their mouth, commit themselves to protecting the dignity and the freedom of the individual, and if they do not make sure that anything in the nature of a privilege is denied to people who commit the worst of crimes, they have made a joke of their own Constitution.  Article 40 deals with personal rights.  Article 40.3.1 declares that the State guarantees in its laws to respect, and as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.  Article 40.2 provides that:</P>
    <P>The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen.</P>
    <P>Every citizen means virtually everyone in this island, as I was saying before lunch. Where is the vindication there if somebody accused of murdering not just one but a whole rake of people in one foul incident is privileged in a way that somebody whose crimes have been non-violent is not privileged?  Where is the vindication of life there which is the primary personal right?  Where is the righting of the injustice there?</P>
    <P>I say all that even though I began by saying something which may seem inconsistent with the amount of feeling I have worked myself into, namely that I, like everybody else, essentially would have cold feet about not dealing with an offender myself and handing him into the hands of somebody else to deal with.  I would far prefer we had a system of an all-Ireland jurisdiction, or if the system we created in 1976 worked well.  But since it is not working and since we are open to the destructive reproach, quite unjustly and maliciously, that we afford a bolthole and a refuge for murderers, we have no option but to go some distance &mdash; and we are going quite a long distance as Deputy Woods is right to point out &mdash; to try to disarm those suspicions.  We have a <Col N="1518" /> respectable vehicle for doing so by reason of the fact that the European Convention, springing from the Council of Europe of which we were one of the originating members, has found it possible to get this convention on its feet supported by the majority of civilised western European countries.  It is disagreeable and I would far sooner we did not have to do this.  I would far sooner we had a system which saved us this bitter necessity.  But I do not see that we have, and so we must do it.</P>
    <P>I have two reservations to make about it.  I do not mean to make difficulties for the Minister, but having said so much I do not want to sit down without adding a couple of words of reservation about this measure.  While I understand the Minister's point that the requirement of a <i>prima facie</i> case is not normal in European extradition arrangements, nevertheless there is a certain substance in the point of view which Deputy Woods articulated, and I had it in mind to say something of the kind myself.  I can see the objections from the police point of view in being asked to present in every particular case a complete dossier of their own proofs to a foreign jurisdiction.  I can see the objections of that kind and there may be other objections that I have not thought of but I do think the Minister would do well to look at this Bill to see whether he could go some distance towards meeting Deputy Woods' point and mine, namely, that we have not had a uniformly good experience with Northern Ireland courts and police procedures. I will not be any more inflammatory that that.  I think we are entitled, before we operate this Act, to have as concrete assurances as the Minister can get &mdash; whether built into the Act or given to him on the side, but in some form that he can regard as adequate &mdash; that when the extradition of someone is sought from here it will be on grounds which will substantiate the successful bringing of a charge.  There were two cases here in the last few years &mdash; and Deputy Woods mentioned one in particular &mdash; in which people, on warrants issued in the North, were brought before the courts here, sent <Col N="1519" /> back by the Supreme Court by the operation of the principle which I have just tried to explain, and then, subsequently, and in one of these cases after a very long delay, were acquitted by the Diplock court in Belfast because of the indequacy of evidence.  You cannot expect a police authority to be able to guarantee that a certain volume of evidence will suffice for a conviction.  No police force in the world can do that, but evidence which is no better evidence than what a police force expect to be able to extract by way of confession from a extradited person once they have him in their grip is not evidence on which I would willingly consent to or consent to at all, to extradite someone from this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>A point that Deputy Woods did not make is that one of these cases was that of an arrest which was effected by the Garda here only after a bitter gun battle in which, thank God, there were no fatalities but there might easily have been.  It is not good enough to expect our police to expose themselves to death, which they do bravely and unhesitatingly and have done for 64 years, in order to apprehend someone to send him over the Border to a jurisdiction in which there is not enough evidence on hand to make a case against him stand up even before a one judge court, let alone a jury court.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be inflammatory about it.  I know the Minister has the problem of trying to reconcile his instincts, which I am sure are much the same as my own in this matter, with his praiseworthy efforts, which I support, to put some substance into the Anglo-Irish Agreement, but there will be an expression of dissatisfaction, of warning, of admonition from this Government if this Bill becomes law that we will not tolerate the operation of this system in such a way that the police here are exposed to physical risk in making an arrest in order to send someone over the Border who, when he gets there, cannot be convicted even in a single judge court.  Needless to say, a similar thing applies if there could <Col N="1520" /> be any question of falling below acceptable standards of propriety in police behaviour in the North or in the judicial procedures there.  I appreciate there have been visible improvements in these areas; they are too delicate for me to wish to tread with a firm step on, and I will say no more about them than that.</P>
    <P>While what we are doing in this Bill is to delay the coming into force of the law until 1 June and subject it to the possibilities of resolutions in the Dáil and Seanad, the Minister might hint in whatever way the Government think diplomatically possible to the authorities on the far side of the Border that the Oireachtas which passed this Bill can just as easily suspend it again.  While I have said what I have said about the need for a measure of this kind and how I support it, I would not support it if it turned out that people were being sent over the Border and were not treated there as well as they would be treated whether by police or by courts in our own jurisdiction. I do not want to go into more detail about that.  I do not want to say anything wounding or offensive, and I have no reason or knowledge which would make me apprehend that it would be so.  The House in passing this measure should emphasise that it reserves to itself the right to review how the thing works and that the same authority by which the Bill may now be made into law may just as easily unmake it in the future if the standards which we are entitled to demand and expect are not met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kelly has gone to the kernel of the various problems pertaining to this Bill.  Even though the Bill is entitled the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Bill, it is impossible to discuss it in a context other than the State in which we live and the problems pertaining to Northern Ireland.  I am sure I speak for all representatives in this House when I say that I have no ambivalence towards terrorism or the use of physical force to attain what most people on this side of the Border want, a Thirty-two County united Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1521" /> However, we cannot discuss this Bill in a rational manner and look upon it as just an extradition Bill because impinging on it all the time is the overhanging problem of the past 17 years and the terrible atrocities that have been committed in the name of &ldquo;Irish nationalism&rdquo; and &ldquo;republicanism&rdquo;.  If that problem was not there and had not been there for the past 60 years and we were not tied by our history and upbringing of the past 800 years, I do not think that any Government would bring in a Bill such as the one we have today which is very restrictive and illiberal.  Therefore, we must discuss the Bill in the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, as the Minister has pointed out, but in particular of the problems facing us regarding the atrocities that have been committed in the past 17 years.</P>
    <P>In all that time regarding the Northern Ireland problem the UK Government have on innumerable occasions pressed that security on this side of the Border is not adequate and if only they had extradition then all security matters could be resolved.  After the Sunningdale Agreement in 1974 the Government decided to bring in the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill because we were not prepared to bring in extradition as such.  The matter has proceeded; we have the Anglo-Irish Agreement and now the Government bring in this Bill which could be classified as an extradition treaty with the UK and we are enacting it under the provisions of the convention which was ratified by the Council of Europe in 1977.</P>
    <P>I will not say we are being dishonest but we may be tampering with the real facts.  We are discussing all this in the context of the suppression of terrorism while really we are talking about the problem we have had in this State with extradition of fugitives whom the UK Government wish to bring back to their mainland or to Northern Ireland.  We bring in this Bill in an abnormal situation. The problem is that we are going to put on our Statute Book a Bill which is to deal with all extradition offences with any of the countries named or with any other country the Minister for Foreign Affairs <Col N="1522" /> may designate in the future.  As a principle we should not put Bills through this Oireachtas which do not stand up to the real test and the real questions.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Kelly, I have serious reservations about this Bill.  The danger is that when you try to make a case pointing out the flaws of this Bill everyone in the State thinks of only one matter, namely, extradition.  They think of all the atrocities that have been committed with which very few people in this part of the country agree.  Less than 2 per cent of the population would agree with them at any one time, but when you try to point out the flaws in a Bill such as this you are in danger of being regarded, as a journalist used to say in the seventies, as a member of the Provisional IRA or you are accused of being ambivalent towards violence. That constrains a number of Deputies and public representatives from ever speaking about matters such as this.  They feel that by doing so their attitude to physical force would be questionable.  I am prepared to leave myself open because I am very concerned about this Bill.  If the atrocities of the past 17 years were not to the forefront of our minds this Bill would not be before us.  It is a most illiberal Bill and it inhibits civil liberties.  I utterly condemn atrocities committed by the Provisional IRA, the INLA, the UVF or any other organisation. I recognise that we want to be seen to be good Europeans and to play our part in the suppression of international terrorism but it is important not to put flawed legislation on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>This legislation effectively does away with political offences.  Political motivation will no longer be a defence against an extradition warrant.  I am not talking just about extradition warrants to and from the UK and Northern Ireland but about extradition warrants from any other signatories.  We should forget about Northern Ireland and the UK and look at what this Bill is really setting out to do.  As far as I can see the Bill does not mention the UK or Northern Ireland. This Bill is to recognise the convention agreed by the Council of Ministers in <Col N="1523" /> January 1977 which we ratified in the past couple of months.  The Bill has a range of sections which effectively wipe out the concept of a political offence.  We should look at the concept of political offence and ask ourselves why there has been a long established precedent in most democracies that one cannot extradite for political offences.  The 1957 European Convention on Terrorism specifically excluded political offences or an offence connected with a political offence in relation to extradition.  Why, 30 years later should we change that concept?  The 1977 convention was passed in response to a spate of hijackings and international terrorism which had become an abnormal feature of life in the seventies and that is why the concept of a political offence is under threat.  Under Article 13 of the January 1977 convention there is a reservation clause which can be enacted by any State who ratified the convention.  It is strange that we decided not to invoke Article 13.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister's problems because he is dealing not only with European suppression of terrorism but with the issue of the faulty extradition procedures we have and the problems we have had over a long number of years in relation to extraditing suspects to or from Britain.  This Bill gives effect to the provisions of the 1977 convention without any reservations.  I know the Minister and his Department have difficulties in trying to introduce legislation which will effectively make extradition easier between here and the UK but they are doing so under the aegis of the European Convention which gives an escape clause to any State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly questioned why we should call criminal offences anything other than criminal offences.  I can appreciate the Deputy's reasoning and the potency of his argument as to why an embezzler or other criminal should not be put into a different category than a person who might have committed a heinous crime with perhaps the loss of dozens of lives.  Why should one person escape the law and the other cannot?  I <Col N="1524" /> acknowledge that there is logic in the Deputy's case but we in this island for the most part are prisoners of our historical background.  I admire people who can look at things more objectively than I can but although I consider myself as being pretty rational about Irish history, I am sure I have been influenced by an historical perspective on things, a perspective which has been ingrained in me since I was a small child and nurtured by the unusual education system that operated here in the fifties and sixties. However there are good reasons why political offences were always excluded for extradition purposes in most democracies. Whether or not we like it if this legislation were on the Statute Book from 1916 to 1921 the forebears of Deputy Kelly, Deputy Andrews and others who have a greater historical political background than myself would have been extradited to Britain from wherever they might have been in Europe.  I know that it is not appropriate in the late 1980s to resurrect these old chestnuts but there is a certain ambivalence on all sides of this House about that era in our history.  We might as well recognise that ambivalence and acknowledge that we are all prisoners of that past and of the past 800 years. The Minister and I are nearly the same age and he went to the same type of school as I did.  We were all indoctrinated about deeds of Irish patriots.  We all learned songs which would be banned now.  They were taught as poems.</P>
    <P>There has been a great change in the past 17 years.  We all shouted &ldquo;Up the Republic&rdquo; in the seventies until we turned on our television sets and saw people being scraped into bags as a result of deeds done in our name.  We had to think about these matters a little more objectively and rationally.  Some years ago people in pubs would sing republican songs and, after five or six pints, the customers would want to rush across the Border and shoot everyone on sight. They were referred to as Guinness republicans. Of course there is an ambivalence in our attitude towards the events of the last 800 years.  Some of the people fighting <Col N="1525" /> for what they term freedom see themselves as the legitimate inheritors of that tradition and it is very hard to shake off that mentality.</P>
    <P>In classifying a political offence we must have regard to the decision given by Chief Justice O'Higgins.  Our definition of a political offence tends to be subjective.  The Supreme Court said that a political offence is something that is not regarded as normal political activity. However, what is normal today may not be acceptable in 30 years' time.  What we looked upon as normal political activity 60 years ago is not relevant today.  If the decision of Chief Justice O'Higgins was to be applied all the time, no act in the name of Irish nationalism over the past 800 years could be regarded as a political offence and would warrant a person being extradited.  It is outrageous intellectual snobbery for any State in modern Europe to tell those in countries which are not democratically run that they have no right to express their views in whatever way they choose.  For example, South Africa is not a signatory to the European Convention but, if it had been, we would be telling the African National Congress that they would not be recognised.  You could apply the same analogy to Kenya and Jomo Kenyatta who was a freedom fighter.  If, 30 years ago, Kenyatta had come to Ireland and the UK wanted to extradite him we would have had to send him back under the terms of this Bill.  We cannot decide what is right for everybody else.  Political offences have always been looked upon differently because they were not always classified as offences. Under the Act dealing with extradition in 1965 they were classified differently and most European countries also regarded such offences as different from others.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to superimpose my views on people in other countries as everyone must make up his or her own mind.  As Deputy Kelly pointed out, it depends on a person's intent whether his actions are regarded as a political offence.  I have the utmost admiration for Deputy Kelly's speeches and the eloquence and sincerity with which he <Col N="1526" /> delivers them.  I can see the logic of his argument in regard to political offences and he makes the case that the only acceptable resistance to any regime is passive.  That is a very potent argument but I do not subscribe to it.  People sincerely believe that argument but if there had never been any other resistance, we would still be living under imperialism and half the countries in the world would be living in slavery.  It is all right to advocate passive resistance from the snug atmosphere of a Twenty-six County State which is free in the sense that we can say as we please, march on the streets and protest against taxes or anything else.  We enjoy the freedom and independence of the courts and we have a free parliament with elections held as often as we like. That applies to our European neighbours also but it is not the case for many other countries.  Those who say that passive resistance is the only way to achieve freedom have been proved wrong by history.</P>
    <P>The 1965 Extradition Act specifically excluded political offences.  The next most relevant decision was that given by Mr. Justice Finlay in 1974 when an extradition case came before him.  The defence was that the person should not be extradited because it was a political offence. Chief Justice Finaly summed up in a far better way than I have been trying to do in the past 20 minutes when, while dismissing an extradition request for a woman charged with the murder of three British soldiers, he said that there could be no doubt that murder, even such a dastardly murder as that described in that case, if carried out by an organisation which by such methods sought to overthrow the government of a country by force, was a political offence.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Kelly rightly pointed out, what had to be taken into account was the intent of the person who committed the offence.  Since one of the objectives of the organisation to which the person in that extradition case belongs was to overthrow the government of a state by force then the intent clearly was political. Deputy Kelly was also right to point out that the intent will always have to be looked at.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1527" /> The decision of Chief Justice O'Higgins in 1972 stood all previous decisions regarding extradition more or less on their heads.  He said that judicial standards had been rendered obsolete by modern terrorist violence and the test he put forward on what constituted a political offence was the question of what reasonable civilised people would regard as normal political activity.  That is a very subjective argument.  It may be a reflection of what we in this nice litle cosy State of ours regard as legitimate normal political activity but it is because we are conditioned by the society we now live in that we are able to form that perspective.</P>
    <P>With respect to the Supreme Court decision it stands logic on its head.  As Deputy Kelly has pointed out, the court system has moved with the times and has overturned decisions which they would not have overturned 15 to 20 years ago.  The Deputy instanced rightly the McGee case on contraception.  The decision in that case was a result of the fact that the mores of 30 to 40 years ago had changed.  I do not think it would be a good basis for extradition proceedings in the future if the decision in 1982, which related to the McGlinchey case, was to be taken as a precedent for the future in respect of all extradition cases.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill any offence could be classified as political because it brings in the use of firearms etc.  When the crossbow was invented it was regarded as the most dangerous weapon of that time.  It would be laughed at today in terms of any conventional type war weapon.  It would not measure up to any standard. To commit an offence with a crossbow at that time would have been described as a barbaric act: not so now.</P>
    <P>We have to look at the reasons for this legislation.  There is a <i>quid pro quo</i> arrangement with the United Kingdom arising from the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The Minister did not put it in as blunt as terms as that but I compliment him for putting this aspect into his speech.  It is obvious to everyone that the reason this legislation is being put through in what I <Col N="1528" /> submit are the dying days of the Government is to honour a commitment which was given with regard to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  We are proceeding with undue haste to put this Bill on our statute books.  What I would prefer is that the Bill would be referred to an all-party committee of the House who after some months of deliberation could be expected to come up with what they considered to be the best possible Bill.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might tell me if there is an agreement between the United Kingdom Government and our Government that if we enact this legislation they will end the Diplock courts? The Taoiseach implied in his speech in London last week that this may be so.  I presume that is the reason there is a delay with regard to the commencement date. The Bill will not come into effect until 30 June next year.  I would also like the Minister to say if we may take it that if the United Kingdom does not suspend or replace the Diplock courts we will not make an order on 30 June 1987 to effect this Bill?  I would also like the Minister to state whether the British Government have promised, if we enact this legislation to deliver on their side of the bargain? The House is entitled to that information.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976 generated much heated debate in this Parliament.  I was not a Member of this House at that time but I read a lot about that Act.  Its introduction arose out of the Sunningdale Agreement.  Why was an extradition treaty not agreed with the British Government at that time and the idea of a political offence scrapped?  I submit that the Taoiseach at that time, Mr. Cosgrave, would not agree under any circumstances to extradition for political offences.  The present Minister was not a member of the Cabinet at that time but it would have been as easy then to depoliticise an offence as it is now.  It was not done at that time because the then Government, who were not a Fianna Fáil Government, would not agree to extradition for political offences.  I submit that they would not agree to this for some of the good reasons I have outlined here and probably for a lot more besides.  The <Col N="1529" /> Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, was a major step forward in relation to these types of crime.  As Deputy Kelly pointed out, it was extradition by the back door.  That is how it was preceived. The then Government were not prepared to go the whole hog and have extradition <i>per se</i> for political offences.</P>
    <P>That Act has only been used on a limited number of occasions.  The Government of that time were under severe pressure to bring in an extradition procedure with the UK.  For ten years the British Government have said that if there was extradition for political offences there would be greater security. There are ample provisions under the 1976 Act under which suspects can be tried but it has never been used.  When this Bill is passed the 1976 Act may as well be scrapped.  It will just lie dormant. There is no need for this legislation as there are ample provisions which could be used in the 1976 Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods made a strong case for <i>prima facie</i> evidence to be established here but the Minister contends that because of the 1957 European Convention it is not possible to introduce that now.  He said we could not now propose a <i>prima facie</i> requirement even if we wanted to unless we were prepared to withdraw from the 1957 convention and abandon the arrangements for extradition between us and the countries of continental Europe.  I submit the Minister is incorrect.</P>
    <P>Article 3 of the 1977 convention states that the provisions of all extradition treaties and arrangements applicable between contracting States, including the European Convention on Extradition, are modified as between contracting States to the extent that they are incompatible with that convention.  Under that article that convention overrides the 1957 Convention and that is not consistent with what the Minister said.  I cannot reconcile what the Minister says with the provisions of Article 3.  Under Article 13, which is a general reservation clause, any State has power to make any kind of changes it so wishes and to bring in the <i>prima facie</i> requirement Deputy Woods spoke <Col N="1530" /> about.  The arguments put forward by the Minister do not stand up.</P>
    <P>The 1982 Supreme Court decision by Justice O'Higgins was very subjective. The case he was dealing with was that involving Dominick McGlinchey.  At the end of the day he was extradited on the basis that he could be tried for the murder of Miss MacMullen.  Although the British Government were very anxious to have him charged with other offences it was specifically agreed that he could only be tried for that offence.  After a year he was acquitted of those charges and sent back to this jurisdiction to face the more serious charges relating to the time of his capture.  Under this Bill Dominick McGlinchey could have been charged on any number of offences when extradited. When the decision was made to extradite him he could only be tried on the basis of the warrant which was executed here and which related to a specific offence. When this Bill is enacted it will contain no such provision.  A person could be tried for any number of offences.  There is nothing in the Bill to prevent that and it is a serious omission.  It strengthens the case for <i>prima facie</i> evidence to be established in our courts before a person is extradited.</P>
    <P>The UK do not extradite people unless a <i>prima facie</i> case is established.  I understand they now propose to change that legislation.  They expect us to enact a Bill which has no safeguards at all even though they have had safeguards for many years.</P>

We will end up with a most draconian measure. It is not good enough to have that kind of legislation.  We will be dealing with 21 or more European countries who <Col N="1531" /> are members of the Council of Europe. It is not good enough to enact legislation which is seriously flawed.</P>
      <P>When the extradition of a person is sought the system of justice in the requesting country and the chances the person has of getting a fair trial there should be looked at.  Obviously, in the recent past the record of the administration of justice to Irish people charged in the United Kingdom has not been good.</P>

      <P>It gives me great pleasure to introduce this, the second Supplementary Estimate for my Department for 1986.  The original Estimate for my Department passed by Dáil Éireann on 20 June last was for £1,530,695,000.  On the same day the House passed a Supplementary Estimate for a token £1,000 to provide for the pilot schemes for the unemployed, bringing the total provided for the Department in the current year to £1,530,696,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second Supplementary Estimate which we are now discussing is for a further £22 million and is required principally to meet the extra costs resulting from the Christmas bonus payments to be made this week to recipients of long term benefits.  Extra expenditure also arises from the special measures agreed by the Government to assist those who are affected by the implementation of the provisions of the EC equality directive. The Supplementary Estimate additionally provides for a number of other adjustments of the voted provisions to take account of emerging excesses and savings on various subheads and I will <Col N="1536" /> refer to them in more detail later in my speech.</P>
    <P>Of the £22 million now being sought, the bulk &mdash; £18 million approximately &mdash; is required to finance the Christmas bonus which the Government are again providing this year.  We have been over the ground on this subject already in the House and I do not intend repeating all that has been said before.</P>
    <P>The Christmas bonus &mdash; an average payment of £36 to our claimants &mdash; is, under our difficult circumstances and at the end of a period of huge increases in spending on social welfare, a considerable achievement.  Let us put it in context &mdash; a further £18 million is being put into the pockets of our claimants, on top of the extra money for the 46,000 families who have benefited under the equal treatment directive.  Who would not, in this House, be happier if twice or three times that amount were given to those among the Christmas bonus recipients who are the genuinely needy but who in this House is unaware of the intense pressure our finances are under, pressures which if not controlled will threaten the welfare of those very people we most want to protect.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the Government were able to find £18 million for the bonus payment this year.  I want to emphasise that this money was found from specific identified savings in the Votes of other Government Departments.  It was not raised by borrowing.  This may not mean very much to the people on the other side of the House who see absolutely no difficulty about borrowing more money if this means buying popularity.  Of course, this Government would have liked to make money available for the Christmas bonus, but we decided to approach this in a responsible way and to finance the bonus without increasing the burden on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>By any standards £18 million is a very considerable sum of money.  We have found this money and are happy to be able to use it in this way.  I have said it before and I will say it again, those who propose a higher level of bonus should say where the money will come from, <Col N="1537" /> but they never do.  As we all know, it is very easy to spend money when you are in Opposition and when you do not have the difficulty of finding it.</P>
    <P>I also know from the debates we have had on this subject that the people on the far side of the House like to convey the impression that they are the guardians of the poor and to parade their concern for people on social welfare payments.  It bears repeating, therefore, what this Government have achieved for social welfare recipients, though I know that the Opposition find it difficult to cope with this reality.  We have succeeded in reducing the level of inflation and, as everybody knows, the people who suffer most from high levels of inflation are people on social welfare payments.  Furthermore, we have increased social welfare payments generally by amounts well ahead of the rate of inflation.  In the period from June 1983 to July 1986, social welfare benefits have increased by 30 per cent for short term recipients, 33 per cent for long term recipients and by 40 per cent for the long term unemployed. These increases represent very considerable real increases in benefit levels over this period &mdash; real increases of 6.5 per cent for short term payments, nearly 9 per cent for long term payments and 14.5 per cent for the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>Again, I have no doubt that everyone in this House would like to see double those increases at least, but a good step forward has been made.  Taken together with the massive improvements in housing over those years, the help for disadvantaged areas in education and the establishment of modern health clinics and other support services, as well as the special fund for voluntary organisations dealing with the disadvantaged which this Government established and which has given almost £2.5 million to some 470 organisations, there has been an impressive leap forward in support for social welfare recipients of all kinds.  In future, the Combat Poverty initiative &mdash; again, this Government's achievement &mdash; is relevant in the context of directing resources to where they are most needed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1538" /> I say all of this to refute absolutely any impression given by any Member of this House, or any other element whose methods of attention-seeking stoop as low as violence on the streets, that this Government have anything less than an outstanding record of concern for the disadvantaged in Ireland.  This Government have never tried to conceal or minimise the difficult financial situation which faces all areas of Government expenditure and the need to direct our limited resources in the most effective and equitable way.  Our achievements in operating within these constraints are there for all to see.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention a few words about those initiatives on which I spoke earlier which all amount to support for the disadvantaged.  One of the problems which we identified when we came into office was the very poor and disorganised state of buildings in the community care area.  Significant progress has been made since then especially on the buildings front.  Over 15 new health centres have been or are in the process of being developed.  We constantly monitor this area because we give priority to the development of the whole area of community care.</P>
    <P>An additional capital programme, which is called the small community care premises programme, was established in 1984.  The aim here is to establish small-sized health centres equipped and staffed to high levels.  On a larger scale, an action research programme has been set up in Waterford and this is now at the detailed planning stage.  The objective here is to establish a large health centre suitable to the needs of a sizeable urban population. In the Dublin area negotiations are now nearly complete on the acquisition of a site for a major health centre in the Townsend Street area.  This, as Deputies may be aware, was promised on foot of the closure of Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital. We have an impressive record in the area of establishing community health facilities which had been very much neglected in previous years.</P>
    <P>Another area to which we have given considerable attention is public housing <Col N="1539" /> for the disadvantaged.  It is important that the Dáil recognise that local authority housing has been virtually revolutionised. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Boland, gave very detailed figures when he was speaking on the Housing Bill.  At one time it was said regularly that we had a housing crisis, but we now have adequate housing for those in need.  I do not believe the present position could be described as a crisis.  At the end of 1985 the number of those on the housing list for the Twenty-six Counties was 22,000 applicants which compares very favourably with the figure for one inner London borough of 26,000 applicants.  This has been achieved through a combination of factors &mdash; the continuing high output of high quality local authority houses by the Government over a number of years, the introduction of the £5,000 grant scheme, the introduction of the Housing Finance Agency loans &mdash; and lately the restructuring of those loans &mdash; the increase in the income limits for SDA loans, the increase in the amount which can be borrowed under the SDA system and the introduction of a third type of loan.  This means that many purchasers who might otherwise have been on local authority waiting lists now have the opportunity to purchase their own house.  People are moving out of local authority houses and others can move into these vacant houses.</P>
    <P>The combination of these incentives has meant that the target of making 9,000 dwellings annually available for letting, which was assessed in the national plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>, as being the target which should be striven for in order to adequately meet housing needs, has been exceeded comfortably in the last few years.  Through a combination of the high output of new local authority dwellings completed and the impact of the £5,000 scheme, last year there were 11,500 dwellings made available for letting by the local authority which was considerably in excess of the target.  The indications are that for this year we will <Col N="1540" /> again considerably exceed the target set out in the national plan.</P>
    <P>The third area I mentioned was education. When I came into office as Minister for Education, one of the first things we did was to establish a special fund to help primary education in disadvantaged urban areas.  This year we have allocated £750,000 to this project, 155 schools are benefiting, covering about 50,000 pupils. The fund is used mainly for the following purposes: purchasing books and materials, developing home and school community links, special grants to supplement the capitation grant to schools in disadvantaged areas, in-service training of teachers, and a special provision to some schools to enable them to purchase the necessary hardware to be associated with the project on computers in primary schools.  That sort of initiative was positive discrimination in favour of the disadvantaged and, taken together with the Government's record on improving social welfare payments, is clear evidence of our concern for the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>This year more than 500,000 long term social welfare recipients will benefit from the Christmas bonus, including the long-term unemployed who were included in the Christmas bonus last year for the first time.  Recipients will receive an additional 65 per cent of their normal weekly payments and arrangements have been made to pay the bonus this week so that families can plan their spending coming up to Christmas.</P>
    <P>Two million pounds of the additional amount now being sought is required to meet the cost of the special measures which the Government have decided on to cushion the effects for some families of the implementation of the Equality Directive provisions.  This question has also been debated a number of times in the House in recent weeks and Deputies will be aware of the issues involved.</P>
    <P>Let me say first of all that I am very pleased at the long overdue arrival of equality in our social welfare system.  For a long number of years women have been blatantly discriminated against in that <Col N="1541" /> system and I am proud that this Government grasped the nettle and that I personally have been able to see to it that the discrimination is ended for once and for all in 1986.</P>
    <P>Nearly 50,000 people were treated as second class citizens until this measure was brought in this year.  They were treated in a totally different way from married men, single men and single women. Why was that?  Because of the old established and long out of date tradition that all married women were economically dependent on their husbands.  Because of that, they got less money from the social welfare system if they were unemployed or sick and they got that lesser amount of money for a shorter time than anyone else.  This was indefensible, and had to be put right, which it has been, at a cost of £18 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Another important area of discrimination in the social welfare code was that married women were effectively debarred from applying for unemployment assistance.  This was based on the outmoded concept that married women are dependants and should be treated as such and not as independent persons with independent rights.  The whole approach of the social welfare system was to treat married women in this way by treating them as dependants even where this was manifestly not the case and, on the other hand, to make it virtually impossible for a married man to be treated as a dependant.  A husband could only be regarded as a dependant of his wife if he was incapable of self-support through mental or physical infirmity.  And we had the ludicrous situation where, so long as a married woman was living with her husband, he was entitled to increases of social welfare payments for her, even though she might have substantial earnings of her own or might herself be getting a social welfare payment at the full personal rate.  Quite obviously the whole system had to be changed as the entire approach was indefensible in a modern world and was bitterly resented by many people who were not so fortunate as to have two sources of income coming into the house.  As has been mentioned in <Col N="1542" /> this House on previous occasions, that perception of injustice in our system was clearly seen in 1978 by the then Minister for Social Welfare, the present Leader of the Opposition.  He made it quite clear that Ireland would be adopting the approach to remove this inequity between men and women in the system by not paying adult dependant increases to people who were not adult dependants.</P>
    <P>The changes which have now been implemented have for the first time introduced a rational approach to the question of dependency in the social welfare system.  This has been at a cost to some people and this was inevitable.  We recognised from the outset that in applying the new concept of dependency losses would arise for some families.  This is why we built into the legislation enabling powers to permit alleviating measures to be taken.  Initially we provided for a £10 a week transitional payment in cases where both spouses were on benefit and where the application of the new dependency arrangements would have resulted in the loss to the household of the adult dependant increase.  We have now doubled this payment to £20 a week.</P>
    <P>The second type of case affected is where the spouse is in employment.  The application of the legislation in such cases would mean that the husband would be at the loss of the adult dependant allowance and half the child dependant allowances. The initial alleviating measure exempted from this rule cases where the spouse is earning less than £50 per week.  There is no loss whatsoever in such cases.  Where the spouse is earning over £50 per week, the additional measure now proposed by the Government will provide for the restoration of half of the child dependant allowance plus a payment of £10 per week.  This will considerably ease the application of the equality legislation in those cases also.</P>
    <P>I am glad we have succeeded in having the equality legislation implemented and that we have, not without some difficulty, put in place a system of cushioning payments which will make the loss of income <Col N="1543" /> to some 20,000 married men less burdensome than full and immediate implementation of the directive of the EC.  This Supplementary Estimate includes the cost of the extra help this year &mdash; some £2 million &mdash; on top of the £9 million which we have already provided by way of alleviating measures. I am very glad the Government could afford me the funds to do this.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are being made to have payments made to all the relevant people, with any arrears due, well before Christmas and in the vast majority of cases by the end of next week.  Advertisements have already appeared to this effect in the newspapers, and will continue to appear.  As well as that, the offices of my Department are all fully aware of the situation and are informing people of it.</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to another area of the Supplementary Estimate, that is, the pilot schemes for the unemployed which, I consider, are a very significant and farreaching initiative in providing active support for the unemployed.  As I mentioned in my introductory remarks when the House passed the Estimate for my Department in June last, it also passed a Supplementary Estimate for a token £1,000 to enable me to introduce pilot schemes for the unemployed.  The likely out-turn on these schemes during the current year is estimated at £27,000 and a further £26,000 is, accordingly, now being sought.</P>
    <P>There are three schemes involved aimed at helping the long term unemployed get back into jobs.  The overall level of unemployment continues to be the major social economic and political problem of our time, not just in this country but also in most other developed countries in the western world.  It is not just the level of unemployment that has given rise to concern but the fact that the proportion of persons unemployed for a prolonged period has increased.  We are all too well aware of the demoralising effect that long term unemployment can have and the implications that it can have on the financial circumstances of people <Col N="1544" /> and their families.  Conscious of the needs of people in this category, the Government responded by introducing a new higher rate of unemployment assistance in 1983 for persons long term unemployed but while making better income maintenance provisions is essential it cannot be the only response and we must continue our search for other ways in which to help.</P>
    <P>The pilot schemes which I introduced a few months ago are, I think, a worthwhile attempt to focus on the long term unemployed as a special target group.  The schemes are attempting to tackle the problem by offsetting the difficulties which, perhaps, made some people unemployed in the first place and kept them in that state for so long.  In a similar fashion, a special focus was placed some years ago on youth unemployment and a whole range of services was developed specially for them with very considerable success.  In Ireland youth unemployment is now well below the level in the rest of the EC.</P>
    <P>The pilot schemes have set out to tackle, head on, features of long term unemployment which keep some people out of the active labour force for months rather than weeks.  In the first place, there is the well known fact that the longer people are unemployed the more rusty they are with regard to work habits and the less confident they become in their ability to compete for a job.  They can also suffer from anxiety at failure to find jobs and this can result in depression and an acceptance that unemployment is their lot in life.  The Jobsearch programme was specifically designed to tackle this problem.  Under the programme, selected groups of persons, who have been long term unemployed, are given intensive coaching in jobseeking techniques and are given access to extensive facilities to put their training into practice.  While participating in the course, which lasts for four weeks, a participant receives his or her normal unemployment payment entitlement.</P>
    <P>The first Jobsearch programme got under way in three pilot locations, that is, Letterkenny, Limerick and Tallaght on <Col N="1545" /> 15 September 1986.  The pilot programme will run for a period of six months.  At this stage, two courses have been completed and a third is nearing completion.  There is no doubt that the knowledge and skills imparted during the course were significant for the individuals concerned. However, feedback from the participants indicates that what was more important to them was the motivation they received from the course and the structure of the course itself which, in practice, helped them to carry out intensive job seeking activities.  These skills will, undoubtedly, be of continuing benefit to them.  I should say, also, that apart from those who have found employment as a result of the programme, quite a number of people who had the various options outlined to them have opted for places on suitable training courses with AnCO or have expressed an interest in the various other State schemes.</P>
    <P>The second feature of long term unemployment that the pilot schemes were designed to tackle was the unemployment trap, that is, the fact that benefits can be withdrawn very sharply when a person finds even temporary and part time work and this, in itself, can be a disincentive to taking up such work.  Of course, this is a reflection of one of the rigidities in the present system, rigidities which will have to be carefully examined and removed where possible to ensure that our welfare system is capable of responding to the changing needs of our society.  It is important that our system offers as much encouragement and practical help as possible to people in these circumstances.  Under the pilot part time allowance scheme a fixed allowance is paid to persons who are long term unemployed and who are able to secure regular part time work.  Their earnings from the employment do not affect payment of the allowance which is paid instead of their unemployment payments.  The allowance is payable so long as the person does not work for more than 24 hours per week.</P>
    <P>This scheme also started in September and will run for a period of six months.  It is in operation in Letterkenny, Limerick and Tallaght and in the catchment areas <Col N="1546" /> covered by Gardiner Street and Cork employment exchanges.  The scheme has started slowly but I am confident that as knowledge of the scheme spreads it will prove to be attractive to a wide number of persons.</P>
    <P>The third feature of unemployment we are aiming to do something about is the well known association between low levels of educational achievement and long term unemployment.  This is an area I have a great interest in and one which I became even more conscious of while I was Minister for Education.  I was, therefore, very pleased to be able to introduce the pilot educational opportunities programme which provides long term unemployed persons with the opportunity to attend full time education courses provided by the VEC.  At the same time, they receive an allowance equivalent to their unemployment payment entitlement. The scheme will run to the end of the current academic year.  We have managed to set up three classes with a total of 53 persons.  One class has been set up in Tallaght and two in Limerick. Already we have received some very worthwhile feedback regarding the enthusiasm of the participants.  It must be remembered that these people have been unemployed for some time and have made a great effort to overcome what I would consider understandable inhibitions in taking the decision to become students again.  The level of interest expressed generally for this type of scheme is also very encouraging and is a recognition that there is a need for schemes on these lines.  I hope that participants' aspirations will be met by the scheme.</P>
    <P>As I have said previously, the three schemes will be professionally evaluated with a full report on their success at the end of the pilot period.  While it is too early yet to form any definite conclusions about the outcome of the evaluation, the preliminary indications are that the schemes are proving to be a measure of real help to the long term unemployed. Of course, before we can take a decisions about extending these scheme to other areas we will have to await <Col N="1547" /> results of the evaluation that is currently being carried out.  I would like to thank Deputy McCarthy for his co-operation when moving that Supplementary Estimate last June so that we could continue with these pilot schemes.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Supplementary Estimate to which I would like to refer specifically is the provision in item 11 in subhead K &mdash; miscellaneous grants, a new division of the subhead &mdash; which is being opened to provide the necessary finances to continue with the national fuel scheme in the present season.  A sum of £3.3 million is sought but this does not represent additional expenditure as there is an offsetting saving on item 10 of the subhead &mdash; supplementary welfare allowance &mdash; where the money for the national fuel scheme was initially provided.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of this new item arises from the recent court decision holding the regulations made governing the scheme to be <i>ultra vires</i> and the resulting need to provide for the 113,000 persons who would otherwise lose their entitlement to fuel allowances.  It is a short term measures to preserve the entitlements of the existing beneficiaries pending a fuller examination by my Department of the implications of the court decision.</P>
    <P>I should like to explain to the House the background to this decision.  The national fuel scheme was introduced in October, 1980 to rationalise and extend haphazard arrangements then being implemented by various health boards to assist needy persons with their heating needs in winter.  The scheme catered, as had the previous arrangements referred to, mainly for the old and the incapacitated and also for widows, deserted wives and others.  It did not, however, include recipients of short term payments such as unemployment benefit and assistance, and disability benefit.</P>
    <P>As the national scheme was a development of the former home assistance arrangements it was reasonable that it should operate under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which had replaced home assistance and this is what <Col N="1548" /> happened.  The health boards administered the scheme under guidelines conveyed annually to the boards by means of departmental circular.</P>
    <P>In December, 1984, in a case taken by a recipient of unemployment benefit, the High Court ruled that the issue of a circular did not constitute the exercise by the Minister of his powers to make regulations under supplementary welfare allowance legislation and that the exclusion of persons of any particular category was void and of no effect.  The opening up of the scheme to persons not originally included would have had serious financial and administrative implications. Some 200,000 additional persons could be eligible at a cost to the Exchequer in a full year of £30 million extra.</P>
    <P>Accordingly my predecessor made regulations in February, 1985 under the supplementary welfare allowance legislation, authorising health boards to pay fuel allowances to persons receiving specified long-term social welfare payments provided certain other conditions were fulfilled, such as the claimant living alone or only with dependants or other specified people.  However, these regulations were also challenged and on 23 July 1986 in the High Court in the case of McLoughlin v The Eastern Health Board the judge ruled that these regulations too were <i>ultra vires</i> in that they purported to limit entitlement to fuel allowances to certain categories of social welfare recipient.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court has now upheld the decision of the High Court but has further decided that the article in question is not severable from the rest of the regulations governing the scheme and that the regulations in question are <i>ultra vires</i> in their entirety.  This means that from now there is no fuel scheme under the regulations.</P>
    <P>In order to avert the situation in which the 113,000 persons eligible for allowances under the conditions in those regulations could no longer be paid the Government decided that for the present the national fuel scheme will be operated on an administrative, non-statutory <Col N="1549" /> basis.  The scheme will not form part of the supplementary welfare allowances scheme and will not be subject to the legislative provisions underlying that scheme.  The scheme will continue to be administered by the health boards with the same financial and other arrangements as heretofore.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that the urban scheme, which operates in 17 cities and towns, mainly in the east and south of the country is unaffected by the judgment and that the 70,000 beneficiaries under that scheme will continue to receive their fuel vouchers as heretofore. Obviously the present arrangements are in the nature of a holding operation until the scheme is reviewed in its entirety.  I felt it necessary to mention those facts to the House.</P>
    <P>Looking to the other main components of the Supplementary Estimate, Deputies will see a saving of £2.4 million on Subhead C.  This, however, is more in the way of being an accounting adjustment as between the social insurance fund and the Vote in relation to the payments to An Post for the services which that body perform in the payment of pensions for the Department.</P>
    <P>An additional £12 million is required for Subhead E &mdash; payment to the social insurance fund this year.  The additional requirement is a net position taking account of likely savings and excesses in the expenditure of the various insurance scheme and a shortfall variation on the expected yield from contributions by employers and employees.</P>
    <P>On Subhead G an additional £7.0 million is required for old age non-contributory pensions.  Part of this arises because of the Christmas bonus and the remainder is by way of an adjustment with the old age contributory pension provision in Subhead E.</P>
    <P>These are the main features of the Supplementary Estimate.  This additional £22 million which we are devoting to the social welfare services at a time of continuing acute pressure on the public finances is an indication of the concern of the Government for those who are dependent on the social welfare system <Col N="1550" /> and highlights the efforts we are prepared to make, and will continue to make, to do the best we can for the weaker sections of the community.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to emphasise once again the position in regard to calls for any additional expenditure on social welfare. There is an enormous budget for this area and there are various pressures that have driven that figure upwards each year. Some of these pressures are demographic and others are economic and those factors will be with us for the foreseeable future.  I should like to put spending on social welfare into some context by reminding everybody that about 1.3 million people or about 30 per cent of the population, are in receipt of some form of social welfare each week.  The total budget is £2.5 billion, the largest single block of Government expenditure and it runs at a staggering 27 per cent of total gross current expenditure.  Another way of putting this is to say that we are spending £7 million for each day of the year. In the four years since we took office an increase of 50 per cent has been seen in the total expenditure on social welfare. Obviously, some of that comes from an increase in unemployment but a considerable amount comes from the real increases we have been able to give to those at the lowest level of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>We have had many calls for further expenditure in this area and I expect I will hear more today.  It is time we realised we are at a financial crossroads.  The debt we carry takes money away from the kind of provisions we would like to make in many areas of social expenditure but if we do not make strenuous efforts to reduce that debt there will be a squeeze on social expenditure that will make life for the people we most want to help even more difficult.  Unfortunately, short term popularity can be bought by calls for more expenditure but that will be at the expense of the long term benefits of those on whose behalf the calls are being made. Interest on that debt is taking £9 out of every £10 paid by PAYE workers.  If we did not have that type of debt not only would we be able to run the country with <Col N="1551" /> current taxation but we would have a surplus.  We would have £2,000 million available to do all the things we want to do in regard to expansion and, in particular, job creation for our young people.  That is the type of financial scenario we are facing.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to make such points so that Members will be aware of the implication a further increase in that debt will have for the disadvantaged in our society.  I expect that the matters covered in the Supplementary Estimate, the Christmas bonus, pilot schemes for the unemployed and the additional alleviating measures under the Equality Directive, will receive the support of the House.  I commend the Estimate to the House.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate for £22 million is further evidence of the Government's dismal failure; it is clear testimony of their failure in any way to relieve unemployment or create employment in the past four years. The proposed further expenditure on social welfare is bleak testimony of the Government's incapacity to take decisive economic action to create jobs.  The result has been a tragic slide to near destitution in the living standards of thousands of individuals and families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The October unemployment figures reveal a total of 232,691 persons on the Live Register.  Since the Government came to office in 1982, 70,000 people have been put out of work and in the 1984 to 1986 period more than 51,000 have emigrated, including a large percentage of highly skilled young people, educated at great expense to the State.  It is particularly sad that our young people, so well educated, many of whose parents have made enormous sacrifices, found little or no hope at home and reluctantly had to go to other countries.  If you were to walk the streets of New York or Boston you would be as likely to meet somebody from your little village at home as an American.  Most of those young people did not take that decision of their own volition: they were forced to do so by the <Col N="1552" /> stark reality of the options before them. They were without hope.</P>
    <P>We have heard Ministers suggesting that emigration, <i>per se</i>, is not a bad thing. They have said it could be a good thing for young people.  In specialised areas, of course, it can be beneficial for young people who wish to acquire particular specialist qualifications, especially if such expert knowledge is not available at home.  Unfortunately, however, that is not why the vast majority of our young people now abroad emigrated.  Most of them did so because they knew that if they had stayed at home they would have been forced to live with their parents without hopes of jobs and with little or no State support because of the peculiar condition about benefit in kind in the social welfare code which precludes young people from getting any decent payments.  It is very degrading for young people who have no jobs to be living with their parents and to find themselves without money to go out and socialise, even in the smallest way, with their friends. One can note what is happening in the passport office day after day.  The unending queues there clearly emphasise what has been happening.  If the Government have specialised to any degree in anything, if they have succeeded in exporting anything, they have been very successful in exporting our young people. If we are to develop in the way we should&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I defer to your judgment. The Government's policy towards <Col N="1553" /> job creation is the root cause of our problem. It is a far cry from the lofty sentiments in the &ldquo;Joint Programme for Government&rdquo; and that other aspirational document, <i>Building on Reality</i>.  I was very surprised that the Minister even mentioned it because I thought it had been consigned to the dustbin long ago. A much better title for that document would be &ldquo;Building on Unreality&rdquo; because it is full of false projections.</P>
      <P>Indeed it is more full of unreality than any document I have ever read.  When we examine what has been achieved most of the Minister's colleagues would now wish to disown that document which is an indictment of the Government.  Four years ago the &ldquo;Joint Programme for Government&rdquo; set as its main and over-riding priority &ldquo;halting and reversing the growth of unemployment&rdquo;.  Firm and decisive action was promised in 1984. <i>Building on Reality</i> assured us that unemployment would peak at 220,000 at the end of 1984 and fall to 210,000 by the spring of 1987.  We are now in December 1986 and we are led to believe that by the spring of next year, two or three months from now, unemployment will have fallen by 22,000.</P>

      <P>I have the greatest respect for the Chair.  In fact, I am even terrified of you if you realised it.  Between November 1982 and October 1986 employment increased by some 40 per cent or some 70,000 people.  I wonder where were the economic policies which would have helped to fulfil the Government's pledge to create jobs and halt the spiral of unemployment?  They were non-existent in my opinion.  In spite of this Government's apparent large complement of economic wisdom, they have by their actions created prohibitively high interest rates which have depressed investment to an all-time low.</P>

The facts are that when this Government came into office the national debt was £12 billion and this Government have increased it to £23 billion.

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the facts and the Government cannot run away from them.  The Minister made considerable play of applauding herself and her Government on their achievements in relation to improving social welfare payments over a four year period.  It is not true that social welfare recipients are better off now than they were four years ago.  Successive Fianna Fáil Governments from 1979 to 1982 gave increases which far exceeded inflation at the time even though inflation was quite high and the amount of disposable income of social welfare recipients, short term and long term, far exceeded the increase in the consumer price index over that period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to have quite a short memory.  She is trying to tell herself what she and her predecessor achieved as if they had achieved something never achieved before.  In the last four years this Government have granted increases which barely exceeded inflation at particular times and were payable from the end of June or early July, while the increased costs imposed at budget time were effective from budget time onwards.  These are the stark realities. This Government has ensured that social welfare recipients &mdash; the old, the poor, the sick, the unemployed &mdash; have far less disposable income than had the same recipients under successive Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the cost of social welfare payments.  Of course it costs a lot of money.  No one would disagree with the concept of controlling public expenditure but this must not be done at the expense of the poorest section of our community, those on social welfare payments.  Any attempt by the <Col N="1556" /> present Government to further reduce benefits to social welfare recipients will be opposed at every level by us on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I have great personal respect for the present Minister.  She has not had this portfolio for very long and she is in a difficult job that she does not like, as was clearly implied in an interview which she gave to a certain newspaper not too long ago.</P>

      <P>I apologise.  The Minister's own performance over the past number of weeks is clearly an object lesson in how not to run a Government Department.  She has adopted an amazing zigzag approach to implementing the equality directive on social welfare and has succeeded in performing a bewildering series of U-turns.  That clearly underlines yet again that this Government are totally adrift.  The Government have all the poise and balance of a headless chicken and it is truly disconcerting to have to witness their bungling and pathetic performance.  The Minister's performance in relation to the equality directive casts serious doubts on her veracity and her competence to deal with <Col N="1557" /> her own Cabinet colleagues.  Today the Minister alluded to the equality directive and I will refer to it at a later stage.</P>
      <P>We are asked under subhead E to sanction an extra £12 million of which we are told £8.6 million is going to fund the Christmas bonus which the Government in their magnanimity have reduced to 64 per cent of the weekly payment from last year's level of 75 per cent.  I am puzzled about this allocation because the Minister has said repeatedly and said again today that the £18 million for this year's Christmas bonus was to be found through departmental savings in other areas.  In Dáil Éireann on 20 November the Minister said that the reason underlying the decision to make the Christmas social welfare bonus 64 per cent of a week's allowance is that the Cabinet were able to gather only £18 million in savings in other areas.</P>
      <P>During the debate on the Fianna Fáil Private Members' motion on the social welfare bonus on 25 November 1986 the Minister repeated the statement, &ldquo;The Government, following a review of their expenditure have been able to find within the overall spending targets some £18 million to give a Christmas bonus to the more needy sections of our community&rdquo;. I am puzzled.  If this is the case, why does an extra £8.6 million have to be provided for the Christmas bonus in this Estimate under subhead E?  Again today the Minister in her speech stated, &ldquo;I am very glad that the Government were able to find £18 million for the bonus payment this year&rdquo;.  She might explain that to us before this debate ends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated in this House on 30 October that the supplementary welfare allowance scheme would act as a cushion for families who would lose out by the introduction of the new equality legislation on 17 November.  On that occasion the Minister did not refer to any modification or expansion of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which would enable it to bear the extra burden of coping with the consequences of the introduction of phase 2 of the equality treatment.  A week later the <Col N="1558" /> board of the Eastern Health Board were informed that the EHB were not in a position to provide financial help for families who would lose out, and could not give any commitment to operate any new scheme for the Department of Social Welfare and that, furthermore, the Minister had been warned by letter on 23 October against expecting the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to cope, according to a report in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 17 November 1986.  Yet the Minister went blindly ahead with her assurance to this House that the supplementary welfare allowance scheme would act as a cushion for families incurring losses without clarifying how this was to be done.</P>
    <P>A further meeting was to take place on Monday, 10 November between the Minister's officials and the health board to discuss changes in the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to alleviate hardship.  This was related to us in an article in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 17 November 1986 also.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department announced on Tuesday, 11 November 1986 that the social welfare changes &mdash; which were to see a fall in payments for nearly 20,000 families &mdash; were to go ahead despite objections by community welfare officers that the Minister's scheme to soften the impact of the cuts was &ldquo;equally questionable and impracticable&rdquo; as stated in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 12 November 1986.</P>
    <P>All this activity culminated in the Minister's final political somersault on 25 November when belatedly she announced her last change in the operation of the directive which created enormous anxiety and doubt among thousands of individuals and families.  I do not know whether the Minister and her colleagues in Government realise that those who live on the poverty line could have been spared this insensitive approach by the Government and by the Minister in particular.  We should remind ourselves that the alleviating measures introduced by the Minister will operate for only one year and will not be applied to new social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>It is also important for us to realise <Col N="1559" /> that, despite the so-called alleviating measures, where both parents are on social welfare payments they will lose an average of £350 per annum and where the husband is on social welfare payment and his wife earns over £50 in income the family will lose over £800.  I would like to ask the Minister if any other section of the community would accept an income diminished by those amounts.  It is an appalling exercise in social obscenity to subject the poorest and most deprived sections of our society to losses of that great extent.  It was particularly sad to see members of the Labour Party, a party who for many years in this House had performed in a typical and real fashion in accord with their political views and ideologies, now hell bent on ensuring that more and more suffering is imposed on those on the lower end of the income scale.  Present members of the Labour Party seem to have forgotten that some four years ago these were the very people whom they said they would support and defend in this House, and every time they have had the opportunity to do so they have turned on them and ensured that their living standards were diminished more and more.  I have no doubt that in the near future the wrath of the electorate will fall on those conscienceless people and that they will receive their due reward from that electorate.</P>
    <P>The Minister went into a series of self-complimentary comments on how she had succeeded in implementing the Equality Directive and ensuring the rights of equality of women.  Let me say that the Members on this side of the House are totally supportive of the concept of equality.  We feel it is only right that the equality part of the directive should have been implemented to ensure that women were paid the same as men and that they could claim for as long as men could claim.  That part of it was fine and we agreed with it wholly but we felt that equality should not now or in the future be achieved at the expense of families. There were two ways of achieving equality: moving people upwards or <Col N="1560" /> bringing people downwards as has happened in this case.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of equality to which the Minister adverted was the right of married women to claim unemployment assistance from which hitherto they were virtually debarred.  I had hoped that the Minister, who has always indicated her supportiveness of the rights of women, would have made some changes.  I had hoped that when married women were being investigated in relation to unemployment assistance claims, a special addendum would be added to the conditions of the investigating officer to prohibit him from asking sexist questions. The Minister, I thought, would specifically ensure that questioning along those lines would be excluded so that a married woman seeking unemployment assistance would not be asked, for instance, who would mind her children if she worked.  I put down an amendment to that effect but unfortunately it was voted down.  I, as did other Members on this side of the House, felt that women's rights should be properly guaranteed. Perhaps the Minister will give an absolute assurance that this type of questioning will not take place in future.</P>
    <P>There is still a large cloud of ambiguity hanging over the Department circular dealing with withdrawal of allowances and fringe benefits to pensioners.  The Department stated on a number of occasions that old age pensioners affected by the new EC equality directive would not lose their free television allowance or licences but later a spokesman admitted that new applicants would probably be disqualified if the spouse had an income of over £50 a week.  This was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 12 November 1986.  Will the Minister give the true position in relation to these fringe benefits?</P>
    <P>It is disconcerting that the numbers on unemployment assistance have increased and continue to increase.  That indicates that the numbers on long term unemployment are increasing.  I hope the Minister and the Government are aware of the consequences of long term unemployment. Long term unemployment has <Col N="1561" /> a terrible psychological impact on the individual, on families and on society in general.  There are now well documented medical comments on the psychological impact of the dole which creates so much unhappiness and despair and which eventually leads to psychosis.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the way in which small farmers are dealt with in their applications for unemployment assistance. During the past two years farmers have suffered a huge drop in income, in the region of 24 per cent.  That is a shattering blow to anybody.  Many small farmers whose crops have failed but who have some stock were put under enormous pressure from the banks although they had no income and many have had to sell out.  People are led to believe that the assessment of small farmers for unemployment assistance is done on a factual basis directly related to gross income of the previous year, less gross costings and taking into account interest payments. Many farmers have proved that they had a bit of land and some stock but no income but in some cases the value of stock seems to be included as part of the income.  It is very wrong that small farmers, most of them with families, owning a few acres of land and some little stock should have to sell their land and stock because of bad weather and the failure of the Department of Social Welfare to provide them with an income. Such a state of affairs will further break up the family farm unit.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister give special consideration to the assessment methods being used for small farmers for unemployment assistance?  At a time when the needy people in society have multiplied, with 50 per cent of social welfare recipients having dependants, it is incredible to note that the bulk of the combat poverty allocation for 1986 will not be spent and will probably be returned to the Exchequer for the second year in a row. Why has the Minister not approved allocations to the large number of worthy projects seeking funding?  There has been a dramatic and distressing increase in the vulnerability of young and old people and <Col N="1562" /> the many excellent voluntary organisations concerned with alleviating poverty should be aided by the Government and have access to combat poverty funds to help them in their efforts to fight the debilitating effects of poverty and unemployment. The Government's failure to ensure full utilisation of the combat poverty allocation is in line with their shameful failure to maintain accommodation for homeless young children since last April.</P>
    <P>Once again this year there have been political rumblings regarding the expected return to the Exchequer of most of the £1 million designated for anti-poverty work in 1986.  The meagre and inadequate funds, roughly £1 per head per week for the poorer sections of the population, designated in the State's budget for anti-poverty work has not been spent despite the rising levels of poverty and need and the requirements of groups working among the poor and the working class.  The Government have a tragic record in relation to combating poverty. They cut back on workers' pay-related benefit for which workers had already paid; they cut food subsidies and raised the price of milk, bread and butter.  Ironically, a Labour Minister for Social Welfare denied the free fuel allowance of approximately £1 per week for 30 weeks to people on unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  They are currently cutting the incomes of the lower paid unemployed, using the EC directive on equalisation as an excuse.</P>
    <P>It is important that State resources for the support of the old should be increased as the number of elderly citizens increases.  I know that the problems of the aged will get worse and they demand a very definite policy response from the Government.  The findings of a report by Dublin's south inner city community development association revealed that over 50 per cent of elderly people in the area are living alone in bad health, loneliness and fear.  That finding is applicable to many urban centres all over the country and I should like the Minister to closely study the report.</P>
    <P>On the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme <Col N="1563" /> on 18 September, the Taoiseach claimed that the Government are moving towards a greater level of social concern.  Pious expressions of social justice have been constantly reiterated by the Taoiseach over the past four years.  However, in early September the Taoiseach was contemplating social welfare cuts in the forthcoming budget.  At a time when tens of thousands of families are barely existing on social welfare payments, any move towards eroding the position of such families is completely unacceptable and will not go unchallenged by Fianna Fáil.  Further evidence that the Government intend to penalise social welfare recipients for their own economic failures was contained in a sinister and ambiguous statement by the Minister for Finance in early October when he said that social welfare spending would have to be reorientated into a form which increased the incentive to work and the creation of wealth.  This unsubtle implication seems to indicate that social welfare recipients are in some way responsible for the paralysis of the economy.  It was a pathetic attempt by the Minister for Finance to divert attention from the Government's responsibility for an extra 70,000 people being unemployed since 1982.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Desmond and the present Minister have continuously whined about the enormous demands placed on their Departments in relation to overall budget allocations.  This is true because, since a growing and major part of the overall costings have now to be provided for unemployment benefit and assistance payments at an alarmingly increased rate since the Government came to office, it is patently obvious to anyone that therein lies the kernel of the problem.</P>
    <P>The Government have allowed company after company and industry after industry to go to the wall over the last year.  Approximately 1,000 businesses of all shapes and sizes have been forced to close with a consequent huge increase in unemployment.  When one considers that for every 1,000 persons on the unemployment list&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I heard Deputy McCarthy speaking on a radio programme one morning recently and he said that if Fianna Fáil are returned to power they will restore the payments which existed before the EC directive on equality.  That would involve paying £20 per week to one large category and £10 to another by way of subsidy.  Assuming that the Opposition are in power next year and that Deputy McCarthy &mdash; fortunately or unfortunately &mdash; is Minister for Social Welfare, he will have to find about £50 million to continue funding that subsidy and to pay the full 100 per cent Christmas bonus which he also promised.  Some of us will be fortunate enough to be returned to office and we can remind him of his promises from the Opposition benches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that Deputy McCarthy is an honourable man, and, therefore, he will ensure that the money is paid.  If not, he will be reminded very forcibly of what happened this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I received information from the Minister's Department that the Christmas bonus would be paid at the full rate.  I estimated that that would cost about £18.5 million.  However, this is not the case in relation to people on unemployment assistance and whose spouses may be receiving unemployment or disability benefit.  I now understand that the Christmas bonus will be paid at the reduced rate and a positive explanation <Col N="1565" /> is required because it is contrary to the information given to me by the Department. I am not blaming the Minister because social welfare is a very complex area and one cannot have one's finger on the pulse all the time.</P>
    <P>I know the equality measure has caused serious problems.  I made that statement on foot of information I had received and I feel very sore about it.  However, I feel twice as sore about other information which I received with regard to this category. Those on unemployment assistance whose spouses were on disability or unemployment benefit had been granted an additional £10 but we fought for a revised payment which was subsequently granted and that £10 was increased to £20 for men on unemployment assistance. Effectively, what has happened is that the unemployment assistance level has been reduced.  In other words, the basic rate has been reduced from £36.70 to £22.75 in most cases and in some cases to £26.  Today, I carried out exhaustive inquiries on those rates and I found that a ceiling has been applied.  The Minister did not indicate that in her speech.  I assume, therefore, that she was not aware of it and was not advised by her officials to that effect.</P>
    <P>The loss to some unemployment assistance beneficiaries will be more than for other claimants because of the ceiling which has been built into the scheme since the introduction of equal treatment. This ceiling means that the total unemployment assistance paid to a family cannot exceed the amount which the family would receive if the spouse on benefit was receiving increases for a spouse and children.  This effectively means that the information which was given to us on that category &mdash; at this stage I do not know how many other categories are involved &mdash; was incorrect. Looking at the details supplied in the Minister's speech, I am coming to the conclusion that she was misinformed in that respect.  I am not saying the Minister was in any way responsible for misinforming the House but I am saying we were not aware that this important category of people who are on the lowest <Col N="1566" /> level of social welfare will lose £14.25 instead of the figure which was quoted in the national press of £1.60.  Had it not been for the subsidy of £5 which applied on the equality measure to women, the loss would have been £19.25.</P>
    <P>For example, the pre-equality rate for a man on unemployment assistance was £36.70, for an adult dependant £26.45 and children's allowances for three children were £26.30.  At that stage his wife on disability benefit was receiving £41.10 which included £5 subsidy paid on equality, giving a combined total of £130.55. Following the equality directive, the personal rate has been reduced to £26.60, the adult dependant rate is now nil and children's allowance at half the rate based on unemployment assistance, is £14.30 plus the special payment of £10.  This gives a total of £50.70.  His wife on disability benefit receives £14.30 as her share of the children's allowances, with her personal rate of £41.10.  This gives a total of £55.40.  The combined total is £106.30 or a loss of £24.35.  Subsequently, an extra £10 was added, giving a total of £116.30, a loss of £14.25.  A loss of £14.25 may not seem significant to some people but considering that they received an extra payment of £20 the loss could have been £34.25.  A sum of £14.25 to a family surviving on social welfare two weeks before Christmas is a substantial amount of money.  It makes a difference between being able to make do and not being able to cover the normal running costs of the home and keeping three children.</P>
    <P>That example arose as a result of the ceiling which was introduced without the knowledge of the Members of this House.  I claim to know a little bit about social welfare, yet I knew nothing about it until a considerable number of people called to my office and to my home wanting to know why their social welfare payment was reduced from £36.70 to £27.25. I do not know who is responsible for this in the Minister's Department or whether she was advised, but I want to know in very positive terms what measures are going to be taken to redress that position. Those on unemployment assistance are in the very lowest category and in the <Col N="1567" /> most dire need.  I will pursue that vigorously and I will ask the Minister to use her good offices to remove that ceiling.</P>
    <P>How can a married man with three children have his unemployment assistance reduced from a figure of £36.70 to £27.75 while, at the same time, a single man will have a higher personal rate than his married counterpart?  To add insult to injury, if a man left his wife and began to live with another woman he would have a higher personal rate than the man who stays at home and minds the family. I do not know how this ceiling came about but I have to say I am very sore about it. I made a statement in this House on behalf of my party and in support of the Government on the basis of incorrect information.  In that category, the Christmas bonus was based on what is effectively a lower level of basic payment. I do not know how many other categories are involved and to what extent, but that will come to light very quickly.  People are confused as the Christmas bonus and the arrears of benefit are being paid at the same time.  Therefore, for the next two weeks there will be confusion regarding the total make-up of the moneys being paid by the employment exchanges.</P>
    <P>Possibly, there will be a double payment at Christmas which, again, will add confusion but in the New Year when they get back to basics and when it is explained what has happened in this and other categories there will be very many angry people around.  I have met quite a few already.  What makes me mad is that I explained to the people that this obviously was an administrative error and was something which could be corrected if they saw the manager of the employment exchange when, in fact, it was introduced by a circular letter which was issued on behalf of the Minister to the managers of the employment exchanges throughout the country.  I received a copy of that from two employment exchanges this morning.  I take a very serious view of it. I was quite annoyed when I saw it.  No one in my party was aware that this was happening.  Someone said it would only affect a few thousand people.  At this <Col N="1568" /> stage I do not know how many people are involved but the next time I talk about it I will know exactly what categories are involved.</P>

      <P>We are happy to facilitate the Minister.  I welcome some of the points made by Deputy Bell.  He asked a number of questions which I had intended to put to the Minister.  Had I made some of the points he made it might have been taken as criticism of the scheme.  There are a number of points he made which are exactly the same kind of queries I receive every day from people in Tallaght and Clondalkin in relation to assistance.</P>
      <P>Following the Private Members' Motion last week when Deputies Taylor, Cluskey and O'Leary threatened to withdraw their support from the Government, Deputy Taylor gave the impression in the constituency we represent that the Christmas bonus was to be paid out.  I do not intend to be critical of my colleague as this is not something which I practise in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy McCarthy spoke at the outset the Ceann Comhairle was in the Chair and there was a difference of opinion about whether the question of employment and so on could be raised in <Col N="1569" /> this debate.  The Minister spoke about the Jobsearch programme and mentioned various areas, including Tallaght.  Any measures that would help to create employment would be welcome.  I am sorry to say that the schemes which have been introduced do not even scratch the surface of the problem.  In so far as Tallaght is concerned nothing has been done by the Government to alleviate unemployment. The schemes which were introduced were unproductive.  They may help people for a few weeks or months but not as regards long term employment. I invite the Minister and her officials to come and visit Tallaght and Clondalkin and then she will realise who is and who is not in touch with reality.  I make that plea honestly and sincerely.  If she comes to Tallaght she will see the position for herself and will then be in touch with reality.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to equal treatment and to the fact that 50,000 people were treated as second class citizens until this measure was introduced.  I have been unable to find anyone who has benefited from this scheme in the area I represent or in the adjoining areas.  Perhaps we do not understand the scheme properly.</P>
    <P>At a meeting convened last week in Tallaght which Deputies Taylor and O'Leary attended, the people demonstrated in no uncertain fashion the way they felt about how the EC directive was introduced.  Fianna Fáil did not convene that meeting but as a result of that and of the threat by Deputies Taylor and Cluskey not to support the Government the Minister decided to change her mind in relation to the scheme.  Following last Wednesday night, Deputy Taylor made it clear to the people that there would be an increase in the Christmas bonus but now we hear something different.  It is important to clarify the position.</P>
    <P>I am quite happy to accommodate the Minister and also Deputy Tunney who wishes to ask some questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>In order that the Minister will have an opportunity to reply, I am not insisting that she should reply to my question.  However, she will not be able <Col N="1570" /> to accuse me of having consumed the time which prevented her so doing.  I am going to resist the temptation for any politician to say that the colossal amounts which she and the Minister for Health claim they pay in social welfare benefits are an indictment of the Government in respect of the absence of any real economic policy.  I leave that aside.  I have one question which I want to put to the Minister.  I am accepting that she has an interest in what is called equality.  This question does not refer to equality as between man and woman but as between woman and woman.  I give the instances of two ladies, one of whom is working in the public service.  If and when that lady is pregnant, she is entitled to 14 weeks' leave, part of which she must take before the baby is born and the rest afterwards. Normally that is divided, say, six : eight or seven : seven.  The point I make is that the public service and the Government of which the Minister is a member require of that lady to be back at work seven weeks after the baby is born.</P>
      <P>If the lady is not employed in the public service but is working in industry and if she has her baby, six months after the baby is born if she looks for unemployment benefit or assistance the officials of the Minister's Department will tell her that she is not entitled to it because she is not really available for work and they will say that she is not available for work because her baby is only six months old.  This has even happened in cases where the baby was a year old.  The question to the Minister is: does she accept that this is equality?  Does she accept that that is the exercise of equality as between one lady and another?  She cannot say yes, therefore I must ask her what is she doing about it?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1571" /> Deputy McCarthy raised an important point with regard to the questions regarding care of children being asked of women who were applying for unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit. That has been a matter of considerable concern to a great many people for some time.  This issue arises particularly now because of the fact that married women are now entitled under the equality of treatment provisions to claim unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that there is no difference in relation to the availability for work condition as between unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  Of course, as we are all aware, married women do claim and are getting unemployment benefit. Before unemployment payment can be made to any person, man or woman, it must be established that the person is available for and is genuinely seeking work.  To determine whether a person is available for work a number of questions are asked of claimants.  These questions are the same irrespective of whether the claimant is a man or a woman.  There is no discriminatory questioning in this area.</P>
    <P>I might add that if a special addendum was made to the rules governing the question of married women, that is if, we took up the suggestion and put an additional special aspect into what questions could be asked of married women as opposed to married men that in itself, in my view, would be unacceptable.  I want to make it clear that there is no discriminatory question asked of married women as opposed to married men.  It is done in exactly the same way.  I have made considerable inquiries into that area and am satisfied that those arrangements we have made are not discriminatory.  We have issued directives to the staff of the Department who deal with unemployment payments that there will be no question of any discriminatory treatment of applicants from the point of view of payments.  That is important for everybody to realise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1572" /> Deputy McCarthy also sought clarification on the total amount of money which is allocated for the Christmas bonus.  The £18 million allocated by the Government for the Christmas bnous is the total amount required and it is also towards the cost of paying the bonus to health benefit recipients.  Of course, that is borne by the Health Vote.  In relation to the Social Welfare Vote, the amount of Christmas bonus is £17.5 million.  The Deputy referred to £8.6 million.  That relates to the cost of the bonus that will be paid with social insurance benefits. Payments of this nature are made out of the social insurance fund and the Exchequer makes up the shortfall in this fund each year.  That is the purpose of subhead E to which the Deputy referred at some length.</P>
    <P>The cost of the bonus paid with assistance is borne direct by the Exchequer and is included in the revised Estimate under each relevant subhead.  The Deputy seems to be concerned as to why that arose in the manner in which it did. He also referred to the question of the benefit and privilege assessment made for people living at home.  I got a clear impression that he was suggesting that that should be abolished.  The problem there is that we would be expending a further £30 million if we abolished that benefit and privilege condition and would therefore be giving full rates to people not involved in accommodation or food expenses and irrespective of the means of their parents or the people with whom they were living.  He also seems, in reference to what I have said about the fuel scheme, to be asking for a change in that scheme, to spend yet a further £30 million on an extension of that widely.  Perhaps he did not mean to do that, but that was the impression one got.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Bell's question, this arises because of the provision in the Act. He put the case where one spouse is on unemployment assistance and the other is on disability or unemployment benefit. The Act of July 1985 provided that in the situation as he outlined the household could not get more than they would if the spouse on benefit claimed the other as a <Col N="1573" /> dependant.  The limitation to which he refers has nothing to do with the alleviating measures that are the result of the Act which was passed in July 1985.  I understand that the reason behind this was that when the Bill was being passed, which it was without opposition and with this clause in it, a married couple where one spouse was engaged full time in home duties should not receive less than where both spouses were available for work.  I understand that was the reason behind the question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1574" /> That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1986, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Ard-Chláraitheora), and certain services administered by that Office, including grants to Health Boards, miscellaneous grants, and a grant-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The original net Vote for Health for 1986 was £1,153,476,000 including a capital provision of £58,160,000.  As will be seen, I am taking a token sum in order to bring to account extra Appropriations-in-Aid which will become available before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>This is in line with my strategy to maximise income wherever possible and, in particular, not to seek a supplementary sum for any extra costs &mdash; a commitment I gave at the beginning of this year.  I want to stress that this has been an ongoing policy on my part.  I am pleased that since the end of 1984 the consistency of that policy has been maintained, despite great pressures.  The extra receipts are most welcome and will enable me, first, to provide for the Christmas bonus for cash allowance recipients directly out of the Health Vote, and then to alleviate to some extent, a difficult cash situation in health agencies, principally the General Medical Services (Payments) Board, the medical card area.</P>

    <P>As I have mentioned, a bonus payment <Col N="1575" /> in respect of certain welfare benefits and allowances administered by the Department of Health is being paid this month. The health allowances included in this arrangement are, the disabled persons maintenance and rehabilitation allowances, the infectious diseases maintenance allowances, the blind welfare allowances and the constant care allowances in respect of handicapped children maintained at home.  This is something which tends to be overlooked in the centering of attention on the social welfare payments, the 65 per cent, because this also applies to 33,000 recipients on the health side.  They too will benefit from this arrangement.  The extra provision of £0.8 million sought will bring the total provision for cash allowances administered by the Department of Health to £66.005 million for 1986.</P>
    <P>The extra provision sought for general medical services is £3 million.  This, together with the provision of £1.122 million from Vote 51 needed for the general and special pay awards approved under the 25th round, will bring the total provision for the General Medical Services (Payments) Board in 1986 to £105.622 million. This represents an increase of about 7 per cent on the 1985 provision.  I stress, that that is a record provision.  Contrary to the propaganda by the Opposition party about medical card holders the reality is that during a period when inflation was at 3 per cent, we provided a record figure of £105.662 million or 7 per cent over the 1985 provision.</P>
    <P>The extra provision sought is required to enable the cash needs of the board to be met in 1986.  The increase in expenditure on general medical services is largely a consequence of a continuing increase in the visiting rate, the extra cost of drugs prescribed at these more frequent consultations and an increase in the number of persons covered.</P>
    <P>As regards cost of drugs and medicines, a reduction in the cost of drugs has been achieved following negotiations with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries.  The revised pricing structure which took effect last August will yield <Col N="1576" /> greater benefits to the Exchequer in 1987. The industry has also agreed to a significant level of additional rebates in 1986 in view of the favourable exchange rate against sterling.  These measures have contributed considerably to reducing the extra funding which is now required.</P>
    <P>I am aware that concern has been expressed regarding the adequacy of the level of resources that my Department are providing for the board.  My officials are keeping in close touch with the board regarding funding and their cash requirements are monitored on a daily basis.  I can assure the House that arrangements are now in place to ensure that the board's cash needs to the year end are adequately met.</P>
    <P>I am concerned, however, about the demand led nature of the scheme, which is at variance with virtually every other health service and I am currently examining measures which will assist in controlling costs while at the same time ensuring that those in greatest need receive the best possible level of primary health care.</P>
    <P>I am providing an additional sum of £2.327 million to meet the balances of grants due to health agencies for years prior to 1986.  The disbursement of these funds will assist the cash position of the agencies and keep overdraft requirements to a minimum.</P>
    <P>Statements made regarding an impending cash crisis in the health services are totally unfounded and in fact as of last Thursday the combined overdrafts of all health boards was £12 million as compared with £24 million in the first week of January 1986.  One hears Deputies on radio and television hysterically working themselves into a frenzy about the provision of health services, a frenzy designed presumably to impress the electorate and with no regard for the facts of the occasion, but this statement puts that kind of political flurry into a correct perspective.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1,999,000 million is being made available for grants to research bodies.  A token sum of £1,000 was included in the original Health Vote for 1986 and this extra sum now brings the <Col N="1577" /> provision to £2 million.  The extra funding is required due to the discontinuation of the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes.  The two bodies involved, the Medico-Social Research Board and the Medical Research Council are in the process of being dissolved following the Government's decision to rationalise the very important area of health research. A new body, the Health Research Board, has been established and will become functional in January 1987 giving a new impetus to this vital area.  I have no doubt that the basic rationalisation of research in the health area which has been achieved, not without some difficulty but with agreement, is a major advance and a very important advance for the future of health research in our country.  The board will in future be funded from the Health Vote.</P>
    <P>In regard to appropriations-in-aid I mentioned an increase of £8.125 million. This increase falls under two headings: firstly, receipts from health contributions.</P>
    <P>The pattern of receipts from health contributions is not regular and consequently precise estimation is not possible. In the current year, an adjustment from 1984-85 resulted in a receipt of over £2 million.  The additional £1.45 million arises from an increased buoyancy in collection and that is very much welcomed.</P>
    <P>The second heading is recovery of cost of health services provided under regulations of the European Economic Community. In accordance with EC regulations certain health services are provided to employed persons, selfemployed persons, pensioners and dependants of such persons from other member states while visiting or staying in Ireland.  The cost of these services is recoupable.  The increased yield is brought about by a number of factors, firstly, the number of persons availing themselves of services in Ireland, secondly, increases in average costs agreed in Brussels, and, thirdly, changes in exchange rates which are extremely difficult to predict in advance.  However, we have done well under this heading.  We got an additional £4.675 million.  Some <Col N="1578" /> of those who are preoccupied about the Single European Act might ponder on those benefits and receipts.</P>
    <P>The draw from Vote 51 must equally be referred to in this Supplementary Estimate. A sum of £21.934 million is being drawn from Vote 51 by my Department to meet the cost of general and special increases under the 25th Round.  That is the general remuneration Vote.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal also with some of the features of our health services.  These are entirely germane to the Estimate.  They certainly refute the kind of scurrilous allegations made in the House last week by the third spokesman stringer for the Opposition, Deputy John O'Connell when he accused me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>And by Senator Higgins in Mayo this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of, in particular, acting in a totally parsimonious and, to use the phrase, callous manner.  This is a classical example of scurrilous debate.  I want to state very emphatically that our health services are by international standards extremely good.  They provide a general practitioner service which is available free to almost 38 per cent of the population &mdash; that is almost four out of every ten, or over 1.3 million people. This is the first port of call for persons needing medical attention and is available at all times.  Over £112 million will be spent on the general practitioner service in the current year.  Secondly, we provide, hopefully on a rational basis, emergency and casually services on a 24-hour basis.  That is very difficult in a country like ours with such a dispersed population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, we have high quality diagnostic and treatment services at hospital level which are available to deal with emergencies and, in addition &mdash; in a country with a population of three and a half million, which is quite unique to any in the world &mdash; we provide surgical techniques such as transplants, open-heart surgery, haemodialysis, and intensive care, particularly neo-natal intensive care <Col N="1579" /> where there have been major developments over the last ten years or so.</P>
    <P>I have had particular concern on the paediatric side.  There has been a substantial improvement in that area, particularly outside of Dublin.  The services at that level are exceptionally good.  We have a high level of psychiatric care services which are currently being re-organised, as the House well knows, with the objective of making them more community oriented.  We have a comprehensive range of services for the mentally handicapped and services for the deprived and disadvantaged groups in our society.  I am proud that in the past four years I have, with very limited additional resources, developed these services on a much better basis.</P>
    <P>As regards the evolution of the health services, one of the most striking features of the health services in this country over the past 20 years has been their rapid evolution into a highly modern and sophisticated service from much humbler origins in the sixties and the fifties.  This progress has, of course, brought its own problems.  All inputs to health services are costly.  The technological revolution in medical care over the last ten or 15 years has demanded the recruitment of very skilled and often highly specialised staff to provide services.  In addition, the introduction of high technology items of equipment which have very significant acquisition, maintenance, operational and replacement costs has led to an escalation of non-pay costs.</P>
    <P>I recall the debates we had when the Estimates for health services were £143 million a year.  I remember in 1973-74 when my predecessor, Brendan Corish, had a budget of that amount, but the health services are costing £1.3 billion or over 7.5 per cent of GNP in the current year.  This latter figure represents almost 20 per cent of total Government expenditure on current services.</P>
    <P>During the period 1982-86 total Government expenditure on health has increased by 30 per cent and has kept pace with an increase in the consumer price index during the same period.  In <Col N="1580" /> each of these years, expenditure on health services has been increased significantly as can be seen from the following table:</P>

    <P>The foregoing represents a very firm basis for a rational development of services in line with the Government's strategy as outlined in the national plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>.  The level of funding provided by the Government has ensured that essential services have been maintained and that much needed developments have been implemented despite the serious financial difficulties which the country has faced.</P>
    <P>Recent developments have included satellite renal dialysis units in Ardkeen General Hospital, Sligo General Hospital, Letterkenny General Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital.  We have a 100 per cent increase in the level of cardiac surgery at the Mater Hospital. We have a new cardio-thoracic surgery unit at Cork Regional Hospital&mdash;I think they will have performed approximately 150 open heart operations by the end of this year.  We have the National Liver Transplant Centre at St. Vincent's Hospital.  We have developments in orthopaedic services at Croom, Cappagh, Cork and Tullamore.  We have developments in geriatric services at St. James's and the Royal Hospital, Donnybrook.  We conducted a most successful measles vaccination campaign which achieved a 90 per cent coverage of the children targeted with the consequence that measles notifications dropped to 311 for the first eight months of 1986 compared with 9,363 notifications for the same period last year.  As a general practitioner, I am sure Deputy <Col N="1581" /> O'Hanlon is aware of the phenomenal drop in the number of notifications.  In ten years' time, the impact of this on general health, and particularly on young pregnant women, will be profound.  This is on a par with other successful major campaigns which we have carried out against infectious diseases over a number of decades.</P>
    <P>Regarding services for the handicapped, including the commissioning of St. Michael's House Adult Special Care Unit, Belcamp, we have had major renovation work at St. Mary's Drumcar &mdash; I am going back next week to open more units there &mdash; we have had the redevelopment of St. Patrick's, Upton, and the commencement of building of the new residential accommodation at St. Joseph's and St. Mary's Schools for the deaf in Cabra.  In addition, there has been a considerable increase in the capital resources devoted to the health services during the period of the plan despite the overall financial constraints. Between 1982 and 1986 expenditure on capital has increased from £49 million to over £58 million and considerable progress has been made in the development of our general hospitals.</P>
    <P>Since, 1983, I have approved a large number of capital schemes.  These include new general hospitals or major new extensions to hospitals which have been completed or are under construction. Among them are major developments at St. James's, the Mater, Tralee, Cavan, Castlebar, Mullingar, Galway Regional, Portiuncula, Cork Regional, Victoria-South Infirmary, Cork, Limerick Regional, Ardkeen, Ennis, Tullamore, Croom and a number of Dublin voluntary hospitals.  The Government have also recently provided capital moneys for the building of development projects at Ardkeen, Sligo and Wexford Hospitals.  In fact, by the end of December this year £3.5 million will have been spent on Ardkeen, £800,000 on Wexford and £3.6 million on Sligo on design, planning fees and site works.  The total estimated cost is £100 million for these three hospitals, and <Col N="1582" /> careful planning, design and rigorous tendering procedures are being implemented.</P>
    <P>When these are finished, as they will be because the capital moneys will be provided in the capital budgets in the years ahead, we will have completed the major health capital programmes for the whole country.  We will have some of the finest hospital complexes in the EC and we will have made an enormous investment in this area.  The Government, who tend to hide their light under a bushel, have not emphasised the exceptional work that is being done on the capital side.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a tribute particularly to the staff in the Department of Health who have been working very hard and have made an enormous contribution towards these developments.  I have been accused many times during my period of office of indulging in health cuts.  &ldquo;Health cuts&rdquo; have almost become part of the political folklore &mdash; they are like the GAA or going to Mass on Sunday.  These accusations are completely false.  I agree I have attempted to cut out waste and duplication, and God knows I came across plenty &mdash; not in the Department because it is a very small Department of about 350 people &mdash; in the delivery of those services.  However, I have been, and always will be, committed to the provision of a high class health service that is in a position to respond to the real needs of the population.  This involves not only maintaining existing services at an appropriate level but also identifying and meeting needs, particularly for the less well off sections of our population. Nobody can expect in the present financial climate that the growth in expenditure which has been a feature of our health services in the past can continue. In fact it is obvious we will have difficulty even in maintaining the existing level of funding in the short term.  It is imperative, therefore, that a rationalisation of the use of the very significant amount of resources in financial and personnel terms must be achieved to eliminate unnecessary and wasteful expenditure if we are to respond to the needs of our <Col N="1583" /> society.  We must create a rational, costefficient and integrated health service.</P>
    <P>The financial constraints of recent years have required health agencies to place all areas of expenditure under close scrutiny.  Given the present Exchequer position and the increasing demands on the available resources because of demographic factors, technological advances and the development of improved services, it is inevitable that the health agencies will need to continue to identify and implement cost saving measures to ensure that essential services can be maintained.</P>
    <P>In any large organisation, potential cost savings exist and must be identified and implemented.  Every effort is being made to obtain value for money in the health services.  My Department have recently been re-assessing their own role in securing efficiency improvements in the health services.  It seems clear that the best results will be achieved from a structured approach which enables those at local level and those at central level to contribute to the fullest extent.  Without motivation and accountability at local level, the identification and implementation of potential improvements cannot be assured.</P>
    <P>However, the central level can make an important contribution also, by providing agencies with the fullest possible support information, co-ordinating the exchange of new ideas to ensure that the benefits of worthwhile initiatives are widely shared, and also by providing agencies with a yardstick against which to measure their success in achieving savings through increased efficiency.</P>
    <P>There have indeed been some exchanges of cost saving ideas and approaches on an informal basis between different health agencies, but it would obviously be far more effective to have a central source of information to ensure that all agencies are aware of new ideas and the experience in implementing them.</P>
    <P>My Department will undertake this role in future.  They will discuss with each individual agency the potential efficiency <Col N="1584" /> improvements which are most appropriate to their particular circumstances, and will ensure that each agency will have all the support information necessary in order to implement them.  The Department will also monitor each agency's progress in implementing these improvements and in securing savings as a result.  Agencies will also be encouraged to develop initiatives of their own, which can then be applied elsewhere as appropriate. I ask all those working in the health services to be alert to the opportunities for achieving such savings.</P>
    <P>My Department will also continue and expand their work in the area of comparative costing.  Hospitals will be given data on their costs under various categories, in comparison with those of similar hospitals.  This type of information will help them to identify particular areas of weakness in their own operations as regards financial performance.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health in the past four years have been and will be in the years ahead a more dynamic Department, taking a much more direct active role in the health services and in the implementation of Government decisions.  I hope there will be the authority and the skilled personnel available in the Department to do that.  That capacity has emerged in recent years and it is a welcome change from the ethos of the old Department, hoping that everybody would stay quiet and get on with their work.  Those days are gone and the change will have a profound impact in the Department in future.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential, in addition, that there be readily available detailed information and data on the financial consequences of decisions taken by the medical profession.  We need to identify clearly the expenditure involved in treating individual patients and specified categories of patient categorised by specialty or otherwise.  The new management information systems currently coming on stream will be extremely useful in this regard by providing ample opportunity and scope for the introduction of much more sophisticated costing systems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1585" /> The report <i>Planning for the Future</i> has pointed the way for the future organisation of our psychiatric services, based on a comprehensive service which is community based and which is an integral part of the general health service.  Rather than the present large catchment areas, services will be organised on the basis of small sectors of 25,000 to 30,000 people with a multi-disciplinary psychiatric team based in the sector having responsibility for the psychiatric needs of the people of the sector.</P>
    <P>Facilities, therefore, will be provided close to where people live and work. Obviously, the expansion of community services has implications for the largely institutional services now in existence which were planned at a time when more modern treatment methods were not available.  The contraction of hospital services is a prerequisite to the expansion of community services.</P>
    <P>The massive resources at present spent on institutional care in the psychiatric area have to be freed in order to develop new services in the community.  The possibility for this redeployment of resources is not wishful thinking.  A recent assessment of in-patients in psychiatric hospitals indicated that there are some 3,000 people in psychiatric hospitals who could be discharged to community residences.  Faced with these statistics, it is incumbent on me and the Department to switch resources as quickly as possible to ensure that patients are given services in the appropriate location.  I have already advised the health boards that I will provide the capital resources to enable this switch to take place and this year I have approved £2.2 million for the provision of new community psychiatric facilities.</P>
    <P>Each of the eight regional health boards have drawn up plans to implement the report in their respective functional areas.  My Department are actively following up the implementation of these plans with the individual health boards and considerable progress has been made to date.  The reorganisation of the services will result in significant improvements for people suffering from mental <Col N="1586" /> illness and is one indication of the steady improvements which have taken place in the overall health services since I took up office.</P>
    <P>Expenditure in the general hospital programme accounts for more than half of total non-capital expenditure on health.  The last decade has seen a major review of the organisation of these services. The plans which emerged from this review have as their main elements the rationalisation of the multiplicity of small hospitals and the distribution of workload away from traditional in-patient care to other delivery modes, such as out-patient and day-care and special units like five-day wards and programmes investigation units.  The plan envisages, therefore, the closing of many of our existing old, cost inefficient hospitals and the establishment of a lesser number of larger sized well equipped modern hospitals located in the major population centres. Considerable progress has been made in the implementation of these plans.</P>
    <P>However, the full potential of the redistribution is very far from being realised and will require further impetus. Consideration must be given to the appropriateness of services being provided at present on an in-patient basis and to the precise role and function of each individual hospital in the acute hospital area.</P>
    <P>The general hospital rationalisation plan adopted for Dublin which provides for the development of six major acute hospitals, that is, St. Vincent's, St. James's and Tallaght Hospitals to serve the south side of the city and Beaumont, the Mater and James Connolly Memorial Hospital to serve the north side of the city is well down the road to completion. The State is investing considerable resources in the programme and I am satisfied that this network of major acute hospitals will be more than adequate to meet the needs of the total population of Dublin both in the inner city and suburban areas.</P>
    <P>Mercer's Hospital, Teach Ultan, St. Patrick's Infant and Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital have been closed, without reducing service levels and I propose to <Col N="1587" /> implement the other closures comprehended in the plan as the new facilities come on stream, starting with the closing of St. Laurence's and Jervis Street in mid-1987.</P>
    <P>There has been much publicity recently about the opening of Beaumont Hospital &mdash; much of it ill-informed.  I would like to take this opportunity of putting the record straight.  This hospital should be fully operational in 1987.</P>
    <P>I am unbending and unrepentant in respect of the unfortunate and quite wrong allegations that have been made about my role in that regard.  I ask people to reflect sincerely on the mischievous information which some Deputies have been fed in this respect.  Discussions with all of the unions involved in the transfer from the existing hospitals are progressing satisfactorily and should be completed in the near future.  I propose to phase in services to Beaumont Hospital commencing in January 1987 and the necessary equipment to allow for this has been ordered.  I have the full agreement of the St. Laurence's Board and of the St. Laurence's medical staff to the transfer of certain of their out-patient services from 20 January 1987, and I am hopeful that the board of Jervis Street and its consultant staff will agree to do likewise.</P>
    <P>Other services will then follow as the equipment and other back-up facilities are put in place.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Beaumont board for having advertised the two psychiatric consultant posts on a joint basis with the Eastern Health Board in the past week or so.  I have no doubt that with the applications in by about 14 January these appointments will be made in the very near future with the support of the Department of Health, Comhairle na nOspidéal and the other agencies directly involved.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it perfectly clear, as Minister for Health, that my policy and that of my Department is that every child should be brought up in his or her own family.  I stress that to particular Deputies in this House and I am unbending and unrepentant in respect of the <Col N="1588" /> unfortunate and quite wrong allegations that have been made about my role in that regard.  I would ask people to reflect on the mischievous misinformation with which some Deputies have been fed in relation to this situation.  Nothing in our present policies or our proposals for the future diminishes the principle that a child is best cared for in a family setting if at all possible and every effort will be made in that regard.</P>
    <P>Every thoughtful and informed person involved with the child care services recognises the incomparable benefits of a family upbringing.  The main thrust of future developments will, therefore, be to provide family support services which will prevent or diminish the need for parents to part with their children on either a short term or long term basis. There are, unfortunately, and will continue to be, unhappy, abused and neglected children from inadequate and broken families with multiple problems. The State, representing our collective responsibility as citizens, and operating through the health boards, has an obligation to seek a secure and a happier future for such children.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies are aware, I have now two Bills before the House which will radically transform and improve our children care services.</P>
    <P>There have been many calls over the years for changes in the adoption laws to enable the adoption of children born within marriage who, for varying reasons, have been separated from or abandoned by parents who are unlikely to resume, or incapable of resuming their parental role.  Most of these children would at present be in the care of health boards and would be either with foster parents or in residential children's homes.  Some of the children would, however, have been placed previously with friends or relatives and would be unlikely to have come to the attention of the public child care system.</P>
    <P>The Adoption Bill provides in certain severely restricted circumstances for the adoption of a legitimate child with a parent or parents alive or of an illegitimate child whose mother has <Col N="1589" /> not given the initial consent to placement for adoption.  It provides for such adoptions only in those instances where for a continuous period of not less than 12 months immediately preceding the time of the making of the application for adoption, the parents of a child, for physical or moral reasons, have failed in their duty towards the child; that it is likely that such failure will continue without interruption until the child attains the age of 18 years; and that such failure constitutes an abandonment on the part of the parents of all parental rights (whether under the Constitution or otherwise) with respect to the child.</P>
    <P>The new Bill does not propose to change in any way the existing criteria for prospective adoptive parents.  I am pleased that by and large within this House there seems to be a great unanimity that this legislation is long overdue and will be enacted, I would hope, with no delay on the part of the House.  The Children (Care and Protection) Bill, 1985, aims to update and extend the law in relation to the care and protection of children, particularly those who are abandoned, neglected or abused.  The existing law in this area is based on legislation dating from 1908.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the following:(a) new arrangements for the regulation of certain child care services, namely, day care services (nurseries, creches etc.) private foster care and children's homes; (b) strengthening of the powers of health boards to provide child care and family support services; (c) updating of the law in relation to foster care; (d) new procedures to facilitate effective intervention in cases of child abuse or neglect; (e) the extension of the grounds on which the courts may place children who have been neglected, ill-treated or are otherwise at risk, in the care of, or under the supervision of, health boards; (f) new procedures for granting custody rights to foster parents and other persons having care of children; and (g) the repeal of existing legislation dealing with the care and protection of children.</P>
    <P>Because of its complexity, this Bill has been referred by the Dáil to a special <Col N="1590" /> committee consisting of eleven members of the House under the chairmanship of Deputy Michael Bell.  I am very pleased that our colleague, Deputy Rory O'Hanlon, has been so constructively involved in the work of the special committee in its initial stages to date.</P>
    <P>It has been obvious for some time past that there is a clear need to up-date the Voluntary Health Insurance Act, 1957, so as to take account of the very significant changes which have occurred in health services structures since the Voluntary Health Insurance Board was originally set up.</P>
    <P>At present VHI provides for full recoupment of hospital in-patient expenses but only limited cover for general practitioner and other out-patient expenses.  The out-patient cover applies only after a threshold £105 for a single person and £170 for a family has been reached.  The thrust of health policy in Ireland, as in many developed countries, is to reduce the demand for costly in-patient services and as far as possible encourage the provision of services on a community or out-patient basis.</P>
    <P>I have been anxious to encourage the development of VHI's primary care coverage so as to influence patients to make greater use, in appropriate circumstances, of primary care rather than hospital treatment.  I have commissioned consultants to examine voluntary insurance schemes in other countries and to assess their suitability for adaptation to meet our requirements.  The consultants will also provide an analysis of how suitable models would operate under Irish conditions.  The VHI are co-operating fully in this exercise and VHI executive staff are participating on the steering committee.  I hope that all this will lead to the early introduction by the VHI of a comprehensive general practitioner and out-patient scheme.  I think that such a scheme would be warmly welcomed and subscribed to by the general population. As part of this approach the VHI will also have to turn their attention to a radical re-appraisal of existing in-patient schemes.  The re-appraisal will have to be <Col N="1591" /> radical if we are to achieve our long term objectives.</P>
    <P>Ultimately this will all form part of a general re-organisation of our health services which I have in mind and which I will shortly be putting before my Government colleagues.  Indeed as part of this exercise, as you are aware, I have already obtained Government approval to an amendment of the VHI Act, 1957. The drafting of that legislation is already in train and present indications are that I will be in a position to introduce it early in the new year.</P>
    <P>I have referred many times previously to the need for a shift in emphasis in our demands and expectations of the health services.  In summary, the essential thrust of the health services in the immediate future will be directed towards: measures needed to be taken to promote health and prevent illness; the provision of suitable services on a community or out-patient basis so as to bring about a redistribution away from institutional services; the closure of out-moded or non-essential institutional facilities in tandem with the commissioning of large cost effective &ldquo;flag ship&rdquo; hospitals which will be in a position to respond to the acute hospital needs of the population; the maintenance of a range of care and welfare services with particular references to children at risk, the needs of the disabled and other disadvantaged persons; increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of all services.</P>
    <P>The adoption of this thrust is not motivated by any crisis in our health services however.  Rather it is an attempt to maximise the benefits which the population can legitimately claim is their right from the major contributions which they make to the services by way of taxation.  I make no apology to anybody for attempting to make the services for which I have responsibility more efficient and more responsive to the real needs of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something unreal about a Minister coming in to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for <Col N="1592" /> £1,000 while at the same time the health boards and voluntary hospitals have an estimated deficit of £30 million to £40 million.  All the health boards have increased their overdraft accommodation in the current year.  For example, the Western Health Board have requested overdraft accommodation from the bank for £10.5 million to carry on to the end of this year, otherwise the board will be unable to pay wages, according to the chief executive officer.  All the health boards and the larger voluntary hospitals will have a major deficit this year, as high as £5 million in the Western Health Board and the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that statements made regarding impending cash crises in the health services were totally unfounded and that last Thursday the combined overdrafts of health boards was £12 million as compared with £24 million in the first week of January 1986.  What does that mean in the context of 1 January 1987?  Is the Minister telling us that the combined overdraft of the eight health boards would be only £12 million in 1987 from 1 January?  I am sure that that is not what the Minister is telling us or he would have said it in his statement. Last Thursday the combined overdraft was £12 million.  In answer to a question in the House recently the Minister told me that at the end of September there was no deficit in the GMS.  Presumably there was no deficit in the GMS because only three-quarters of the year had gone by, but obviously from the Supplementary Estimate before us there would be a serious deficit in the GMS which would have very serious consequences had the Minister not come into the House this evening and introduced this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Western Health Board seem to have a problem because on Monday last they requested overdraft accommodation for £10.5 million.  The also voted and gave authority to their CEO to change from their present bank if that bank persisted in implementing charges that would amount to £200,000.  Again in this House on 22 October when I asked the Minister about the funding arrangements and what <Col N="1593" /> new funding arrangements might be made between the banks and the various health agencies, the Minister told me that there was no departure from what has happened in the past.  I understand that it is a new departure for the banks to insist on charges to the health boards and it is an indication of how the banks feel about the position of the health boards. The estimated deficit between the health boards and the voluntary hospitals is between £30 million and £40 million effectively because of the Government transferring that money into the 1987 Estimate.</P>
    <P>Why are moneys not included in this Supplementary Estimate to look after the necessary financing of the health boards and the various voluntary hospitals and health agencies?  The Supplementary Estimates before us amount to nearly £100 million, not for health alone but for all the various Departments of State, but they indicate how wrong the Government got their figures.  Add to that the deficit in the health boards and many other deficits and we see the very serious, precarious position the finances of the State are in after four years of this Coalition Government. Why has the Minister not included in this Supplementary Estimate the moneys to provide for the needs of the health boards and health agencies?  Are his Department, like other Government Departments, accumulating debts which will have to be taken up by a future administration?  There is no indication in this Supplementary Estimate before us that the Minister is prepared to face reality when he comes in and looks for £1,000 when we know the size of the deficit.  Each health board in turn have had this serious problem.</P>
    <P>This morning on radio Senator Higgins from Mayo criticised the health board members and executives for the manner in which they are providing the service at present and he was very critical of the effect this is having on the poor.  In other words, he stated that a conscious decision had been made by health board members and executives to be hard on the poor in some way.  No health board have sufficient money to deliver the services that <Col N="1594" /> are their statutory obligation.  We have talked about this many times in this House not alone this year but over the last three years.  For example, no dental service is available to adults who hold GMS cards in any health board area except to pregnant women, people awaiting operations and who must have their teeth attended to first and to the mentally handicapped.  The Minister told us tonight he was satisfied that there was no fall off in the level of essential services, but I have just given an indication of one area.  The same could be said about the optician service.</P>
    <P>It is more difficult when looking at the hospital service to point out, say, the patient who should have been in hospital a week earlier only for the cutbacks.  We cannot identify specific patients, although in the House just two weeks ago on a Private Members' motion I was able to point out to the Minister, with evidence in writing, the case of a patient who was delayed 13 weeks waiting for an appointment for what was potentially a very serious illness.  That was a direct result of the cutbacks.  In the hospital services there are delays for people waiting for outpatient appointments and for persons waiting to be admitted to hospital.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about comparative costing.  Has anybody looked at the cost, first of all in human terms, to the patient of these long delays of, say, 13 weeks waiting for a hospital appointment which in the case I have mentioned was made for 5 August and postponed until 21 October?  Has anybody looked in economic terms at the cost to the State, to the GMS where patients are coming along perhaps weekly to their doctor while they are waiting for their outpatient appointments or for admission to hospital?  Has anybody considered the cost to the Department of Social Welfare of paying out sums of money to persons who are out of work and waiting for appointments at hospitals?  Is any research being done into this?  It appears that in the public service generally one of the problems is that one Department look very carefully at what they are doing without reference <Col N="1595" /> to what effect it may have on other Departments and on the expenditure of other Departments.  However, to the people who are providing the money, the taxpayers, it does not really matter which Department of State the expenditure is in because at the end of the day they have to provide the finances anyway.</P>
    <P>Therefore, instead of these <i>ad hoc</i> cutbacks &mdash; and there have been cutbacks in spite of what the Minister said &mdash; there should be some sort of proper planning to ensure that maximum efficiency is delivered in our service and that the proper level of service is available to all those people who are unable to provide it through their own resources.  In relation to hospital services one area where there could be improvements is in the operation of outpatients' departments.  Some of the buildings are very old, for instance the North Infirmary in Cork where one consultant operates from one room.  A lot of time is wasted as the patients must undress and dress again in that room. It would be much more efficient if the consultant had appropriate working conditions and if there were an appropriate number of dressing rooms for the patients.</P>
    <P>Something else that could be looked at is the waiting time for patients for operations.  It is unacceptable that a person should have to wait six months for a surgical appointment.  I know there are also long waiting lists, which are equally unacceptable, for persons suffering from severe joint pains and who are waiting for replacement joints. The number of times a patient returns to the outpatients is something that should also be examined.  We should encourage closer co-operation between the family doctor and the consultant and between the family doctor and the hospital and we should encourage closer integration of the community care services and the hospital care services to ensure maximum efficiency in the delivery of outpatient care.  Family doctors should have access to facilities in hospitals, to laboratory and X-ray facilities.  There is something <Col N="1596" /> wrong where, if a family doctor sends a specimen to a laboratory, the patient can get a bill for £40 but if the person goes to the outpatients' department of a hospital where more expensive tests than the one the family doctor ordered may be carried out, they are carried out free of charge.</P>
    <P>The length of time people have to wait in an outpatients' department is another matter that should be looked at.  The Minister spoke about closing down hospitals without any serious effect on the level of service.  One serious effect I could mention is in the area of nose, ear and throat services which were provided by Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital.  The hospital is now closed but I understand that there is a very serious problem in St. James's Hospital which is not able to provide the necessary level of ear, nose and throat services to cater for the patients of Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital. This does not just affect south east Dublin, but many parts of Ireland including many areas in the North-Eastern Health Board region which used Sir Patrick Dun's.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Beaumont. We have been talking about Beaumont for the last four years.  The Minister and the Government did a U-turn on Beaumont. The Government should have accepted in 1982 when they came to office, what they accept now as sensible, that consultants should be allowed to carry out their private practices on the campus of Beaumont, provided there is no cost to the Exchequer, something that we always supported because it is in the best interests of all the patients, including public patients that a consultant should be on the campus for as long as possible. The Government rejected that, although they never had a logical defence of that rejection but over the last few months they have come round to accepting that that is the correct way to proceed.  Now they are going to open one section in Beaumont, the outpatients' department, and ask patients to go to Beaumont for the outpatient facility and to go to the centre of the city for their tests, their bed and so on in Jervis Street or the Richmond Hospital.  Consultants will <Col N="1597" /> have to go out to Beaumont to see their outpatients and then come back to the Richmond or Jervis Street as the case may be.  It is another illogical approach to the development of the Beaumont complex.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider that.</P>
    <P>The CAT scanner in Galway is still idle and people are going to Cork and Dublin for CAT scans.  The Minister for Finance in his budget told us that money is being provided to make the CAT scanner operational. That money has not been provided to date and so we have another area where cost effectiveness has not been considered.  It costs a lot to drive patients to outside hospitals many miles away for this expensive high technology.</P>
    <P>One of the areas in the Supplementary Estimate for which a large sum is being provided is the GMS.  There is no doubt that there is greater demand on the GMS now because when the economy is not going well and people are dejected, there is a greater reliance on health services. People are going to their doctors more frequently because of the long waiting lists for outpatient facilities, for inpatient care and because of earlier discharges from hospital.  Because district nurses are not being replaced when they go on holidays or for their first month on maternity leave this too increases the workload on the family doctor.  It is not any wonder that increasing costs are involved in the delivery of the GMS.  I wonder if any research has been done on the consequences of what is happening in the hospitals in the GMS, in relation to medical cards and so on.  The guidelines are being rigidly imposed in all health board areas and indeed persons who would have got health care because of hardship in the past will not receive health care if these guidelines are rigidly imposed.  Rather than being guidelines they are now a rigid cut-off point for medical cards in many community care areas.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister in relation to the transfer of resources from hospital to community care.  The transfer of resources and the building up of community care services sufficiently to ensure <Col N="1598" /> that we have an appropriate level of community care is not cheap.  There is no indication in any country where they have done this that one can actually save money on it.  It is important however in human terms to develop community care services.  While it may not cost less, if we provide the essential services, more public health nurses, physiotherapy services, and chiropody services in the district, we will get to more people.  Not alone will we get to those who would have benefited if they had been inpatients in hospital, but we will also get to a number of people who could avail of these services without going into hospital. It is important from that point of view and in human terms that we should try to ensure that as many people as possible can be treated in their own homes and communities.</P>
    <P>The elderly will create a major challenge to the health services in the years to come because, in the next six years, the number of persons over 65 years of age will increase by 10 per cent and those over 75 will increase by 20 per cent.  There is a problem at present in finding suitable residential accommodation for people who need it.  There are not sufficient community care services to ensure that people can be looked after in their own communities, particularly those who are living alone.  We must look into this area and, as well as the Department of Health, the Department of the Environment should be involved in providing proper and adequate accommodation for the elderly.  Perhaps a more liberal interpretation of the regulations concerning reconstruction grants for disabled people could be made so that if a family wanted to bring an elderly parent to live with them they would get some assistance for building on a room.  Economically, apart from the human value, the disabled person's reconstruction grant amounts to £5,000 and the average cost of keeping an elderly person in residential care for a year is £6,200.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the Minister has provided new residential units for the mentally handicapped.  Nevertheless, there are very serious problems as a result of <Col N="1599" /> the cutbacks and the most serious is that young adults are being sent home, having been in residential care for ten, 15, or 20 years, to parents who, because of age and infirmity, are unable to look after them. This is a very serious problem for which the Government must stand indicted.</P>
    <P>I supported the Minister's campaign for vaccination against measles and I complimented him on bringing in that scheme.  I accept what he said tonight, that we would see the benefits in the years to come.  I have doubts about the amalgamation of the Medico-Social Research Board and the Medical Research Council because the Medico-Social Research Board, being directly under the Minister, might be influenced not to proceed with certain research for political reasons.  I am not referring to the present Minister but a future Minister might influence them in regard to research.</P>
    <P>We must face up to AIDS and there should be research into the disease.  In the past we made a very valuable contribution to research in the world context, even with our limited resources.  We must also ensure that people know about the prevention of AIDS.  In this context education is necessary.</P>
    <P>The Children (Care and Protection) Bill is held up on Committee Stage and has run into difficulties because the Minister is bringing forward a number of amendments.  I am glad of the fact that, before the Bill was published, we did not press for its circulation because we always said we would like to see a good Bill introduced and that it was better for the Department and the Minister to take their time instead of bringing in an inadequate Bill.  The Minister did not mention the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill which would give him the power to close any hospital or unit of a hospital or to discontinue any service in a hospital without any reference &mdash; apart from some consultation &mdash; with the health boards. That Bill was introduced in the House about 18 months ago but we have not heard anything about it since.  It is an indication that somebody recognised that <Col N="1600" /> it was a draconian measure which would be totally unacceptable to the Members of the House and would have had no chance of being passed.</P>
    <P>We fully support planning for the future in relation to psychiatric services but I am critical of the Government for the way they turned that excellent document on top of its head and discredited it by starting at the last page and announcing on 30 January that they intended to close hospitals at the end of June.  That caused tremendous anxiety to patients, their relatives and other interested parties who thought that all hospitals would be closed and that everybody would be back in the community without a proper service to care for them.  We support that document in a phased programme of development over ten or 15 years.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to amending legislation in relation to the VHI.  Will such legislation put more restrictions on the VHI?  The thrust running through Government thinking at present seems to indicate that there will be more centralisation and the Minister referred to it tonight.  He said that without motivation and accountability at local level, the identification and implementation of potential improvements cannot be assured.  I do not know what that means, it is a very vague statement but it appears to be a further indication that the Government want more centralisation of services, which is something to which we would be opposed.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a comprehensive over-view of the health services as he saw them, far beyond what we would expect in a debate of a Supplementary Estimate. Perhaps it is his final major contribution to the record of the health services over the last four years.  However, he did not mention drug addiction or the present position re facilities which were promised, including a detoxification unit and facilities for the inner city.  The problem of alcoholism was debated last weekend at the seminar organised by the Irish National Council on Alcoholism.  The Minister did not say when we would have the policy document of Dromoland before us.  He said there would not be a <Col N="1601" /> Green Paper but, from everything he has been saying since, it appears that possibly there will be such a paper.</P>
    <P>We are opposed to centralisation to the extent that it has been articulated in that document because it would do away with the local democratic input by the statutory bodies and the voluntary organisations. In terms of availability and accessibility of service I have no doubt that people living away from the centre would be much worse off.  For that reason, we could not support that concept and it is totally in conflict with the stated policy of the Government and the Labour Party on decentralisation which advocates devolved power going back to local authorities and setting up regional boards for education.</P>
    <P>The £30 million to £40 million estimated deficit is the responsibility of the Government.  I should like to ask the Minister why he is not providing finance in the Estimate and who he expects to provide the money.  Does he expect the incoming administration to pay the debts which appears to be the case in relation to other Government Departments?</P>
    <P>Over the last four years the Government have presided over a serious reduction in the level of health services. There is no dental service for adults who are holders of medical cards.  Patients, particularly the elderly, are on an intolerably long waiting list for admission to hospital and for out-patient appointments. Mentally handicapped adults have been discharged from residential care and their parents are unable to look after them.  Much of this hardship could have been avoided had the Minister been more realistic and engaged in consultation rather than confrontation.  He has succeeded in the past four years in creating undue anxiety and hardship for patients and their relatives.  Morale among those working in the health services is at its lowest ever level.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Minister, he was not alone in getting involved in confrontation but, perhaps, his confrontation lasted longer.  The Taoiseach's remarks in this House about the health boards, particularly the South-Eastern Health Board. <Col N="1602" /> the Western Health Board and the Southern Health Board, were totally unacceptable. In this House he accused the CEO of the Southern Health Board of producing fictitious figures, that not alone were they fictitious but they were known to be fictitious when they were produced. That is not how you run a health service or get co-operation from people in a time or recession.  We all recognise that health care is expensive and money is scarce but surely the way to proceed is through consultation with the health boards and with the people who are working in the health services?  I pay tribute to the CEOs, the staff and members of health boards for the manner in which they have contributed to ensuring that some level of health service was provided in the past four years.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are concerned and aware of the ever-increasing costs of health care, but that does not mean we must abandon what has been traditional in Ireland, which is a caring, social philosophy. Through consultation and planning we must ensure a proper and adequate level of health care for those who are not able to provide for themselves out of their own resources.  It is the responsibility of a civilised government to ensure an adequate level of health service.  Fianna Fáil in Government in the not too distant future will provide, as we have done in the past, a proper and adequate level of health care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, it would be fair to say that you, sitting in your neutral Chair, would over the past four years have noted in Deputies on this side of the House a sense of despondency, oft-times frustration, sometimes bordering on cynicism, at the lack of response to any request emanating from this side of the House.  I am sure you detect also the inevitable feeling of uselessness when we find ourselves pitted against certain Ministers who seem to be concerned only with the cultivation of their own delusions and who resist any attempt at dislodging such delusions and who oppose any proposal that is contrary to what they articulate. <Col N="1603" /> I was a member of Clonliffe Harriers whose motto is <i>Nil Desperandum</i>.  I do not include the Minister in the category to which I have referred.  That is not to say I would give him full commendation but over the past four years there have been at least one or two occasions when I did receive a response and was heartened by that.  I am taking the Minister entirely at his own word.  I listened to his speech while in my office.  He said he would make no apologies to anyone, that he was concerned with looking after the people and providing them with their rights in respect of health entitlements. Straightaway, I am going to give him a presentation of cases in my constituency, which I know are being reproduced in his own, and ask him, having listened to these cases, if he is responding to his own target of giving people their rights?</P>
      <P>I am talking of cases where members of a household are expected to provide medical, psychiatric and geriatric treatment for an older member of the household. These cases do not exist in my imagination.  I have been on to the hospitals and the health boards.  One case comes to mind in the past fortnight, that of a family who because of their willingness to accept an aunt from hospital find that their house is now in total disarray and the domestic humour of the house is affected.  The lady in question rises at 2 a.m. and goes into the bedrooms of the girls or the boys and upsets them. She interferes with the sleep and the studies of the young people.  She has upset the whole household.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the case of a lady in Finglas who was referred to the Master Hospital by her local doctor and instead of being admitted to the general hospital, she was taken into the casualty ward where she was held for eight hours.  She was asked for the name of her neighbour and, in the name of community care, that neighbour was asked to come into the hospital to collect her.  That unfortunate lady even though there were no services and no free meals, was left to the tender mercy of her neighbour.  Is this what the Minister is talking about when he speaks of looking <Col N="1604" /> after the rights of people?  Is this what the Minister is talking about when he speaks of the introduction of community care?</P>
    <P>Community care is a worthwhile objective but where we will the end we must also will the means.  Community care is only a euphemism for a &ldquo;do it yourself&rdquo; type of health policy.  In the past four years I am not aware of any improvement in community care.  Rather am I aware, week in week out, of institutions which were designed to look after the needs of our people unloading patients in some cases onto reluctant relatives and in other cases onto relatives who feel they would be letting the side down by not accepting them.  If the Minister thinks that the case I am making is wrong, let him say so, but I know it is not, I know that what is happening in my constituency is happening in every constituency in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am aware of another case of a young deserted wife in employment who has to look after her family.  Because her mother is living alone and is in need of attention in a psychiatric home, this lady was obliged to give up her employment in deference to the understandable natural feelings she has towards her mother.  The Minister spoke about the introduction of a new policy of community care. I hope he will apply himself to that policy in deference to his expressed hopes and objectives of attending to the rights of our people.  I hope he will provide staff for our institutions and that he will see to it that elderly people are provided with the care they cannot receive at home.</P>
    <P>My own mother who lived until she was 95 was blessed with good health and it was a pleasure to have her about.  We were all delighted to have her but I can also visualise the circumstances which obtain in other homes where an elderly person is not capable of coping with physical or mental ailments.  I hope the Minister will either dismiss what I say as being wrong &mdash; I know in all honesty he cannot do that &mdash; or indicate that he accepts it as part of the work which he should be attending to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £2,500,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December 1986, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Communications and of certain other services administered by that Office, for a cost alleviation payment and for payment of certain grants and grants-in-aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate arises principally from the need to make provision for a shortfall of £2.7 million in the appropriations-in-aid from Eurocontrol, £1.2 million for final payments on <i>The Irish Spruce</i> and £0.5 million for a new Cork-Swansea ferry.  It also provides for new subheads for the Dublin runway project and a new grant-in-aid for capital purposes for the Dublin Transport Authority. These two new subheads do not involve extra Exchequer expenditure but rather the transfer of funds from existing subheads.  Finally, there are other miscellaneous small expenditures and receipts not provided for in the original Estimates.  The gross amount required is £4,250,000.  This is offset by savings of £1,750,000 on other subheads, giving a net excess of £2,500,000.  Following are details of the major extra expenditure items in sequential order by subhead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Telecommunications equipment may be connected to the national telecommunications network subject to two conditions: it must be approved as being compatible with the network and it must be supplied under licence granted by the Minister.  In 1984-85 the cost of testing was borne on subhead C2 of the Department's Vote and recovered through licence fees.  The Minister decided in 1985 to rationalise the system with effect from 1 January 1986 by making applicants pay <Col N="1606" /> the costs of testing directly to the testing houses.</P>
    <P>It was necessary, however, to include an amount in the 1986 Estimates to cover the cost of testing equipment for which applications had been made and paid for in 1985 but were not completed until 1986.  The additional sum now sought arises because at the time the 1986 Estimates were being framed it was not possible to make an accurate estimate of the number of applications which would be outstanding due to the wide range of telecommunications equipment available and the liberalisation of the telecommunications market.  In addition, a glut of applications was received towards the end of 1985 in anticipation of the rationalisation to which I have just referred.</P>
    <P>An increase of £140,000 is sought under subhead D1 to meet interest charges arising on borrowings by CIE to purchase buses from GAC (Ireland) Ltd. In March 1985 the Government authorised additional borrowing by CIE of £10 million for the purchase of buses and also that any extra financial charges incurred on the additional borrowings would be recouped to CIE out of the Vote for this Department.  The interest charges for which recoupment is now sought arose in 1985 but could not be paid until now due to lack of supporting documentation.</P>
    <P>Subhead F1 provides for a grant-in-aid to RTE in respect of the net receipts from television licence fees.  It is now estimated that net receipts will exceed the budgeted figure by £520,000 necessitating an equivalent increase in the grant-in-aid to RTE.</P>
    <P>The task of collecting television licence fee revenue and of detecting unlicensed and incorrectly licensed sets is delegated by statutory order from the Minister for Communications to An Post.  Gross licence fee revenue is paid by An Post to my Department and is brought to account as an appropriation-in-aid (Y17) of my Vote.  A payment equivalent to gross receipts less collection and other minor costs is made from subhead F1 to RTE.</P>
    <P>Subhead G provides for payments to <Col N="1607" /> An Post in respect of issuing television licences, collecting fees and detecting and prosecuting licence fee evaders.  I am seeking an additional provision of £237,000 under this subhead.  The increase arises from the introduction this year of a new agreement between An Post and RTE which provides for tiered payment rates and incentive bonuses. depending on the number of licences sold.  The increases sought under subheads F1 and G, totalling £757,000 are offset fully by the additional Appropriation-in-Aid under subhead Y17, £532,000, and savings under subhead F2, £225,000 &mdash; grants to RTE in respect of relay licence fees.</P>
    <P>The extra receipts reflects the continuing efforts of both An Post and RTE in reducing the number of unlicensed and incorrectly licensed television sets.  While full credit is due to An Post for their success to date, much work remains to be done in this area and I am considering how the present arrangements can be improved upon.</P>
    <P>On 12 December 1985 the Government approved the construction of a new runway and associated facilities at Dublin Airport at an estimated cost of £31.26 million in 1985 prices.  Traditionally, developments at State airports have been financed by means of voted capital grants from my Department's Vote.  However, in view of the heavy demands on the Exchequer, the scale of expenditure involved, the expected commercial rate of return on the project and the strong financial performance of Aer Rianta in recent years, it has been decided that the project should be financed primarily from non-Exchequer sources.  Under these arrangements, Aer Rianta will finance about 75 per cent of the cost of the project from their own resources and from borrowings. The remaining 25 per cent of the cost will be financed by Exchequer capital grants.</P>
    <P>Preliminary expenditure of around £900,000 is being incurred on the project in 1986, mainly in respect of the provision of infrastructural services.  This expenditure is being financed by way of <Col N="1608" /> Exchequer capital grants which had already been provided for in the existing subhead H2.  Because of the size of the project and the expected level and nature of expenditure on it, it has been decided to create a separate subhead to provide for the Exchequer investment in the runway.  This is being done in a new subhead H3.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that an excess of £120,000 will arise on subhead L in respect of contributions to international organisations.  This arises principally because the draft Eurocontrol budget did not become available until after my Department's Estimate had been framed and our contribution to that organisation was greater than expected.  In addition, provision is now being made for a contribution to the International Telecommunications Union.  A substantial portion of this contribution will be met by Bord Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transport Authority was established on 12 November.  The provision under subhead S2 is a technical adjustment in order to create a new capital grant-in-aid subhead for capital expenditure by the newly formed Authority.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the subhead is to continue the traffic management work previously carried out by the Dublin transportation task force.  Projects to be financed by the Authority in 1986 will include ongoing work on Dublin Corporation's urban traffic control system involving the computerised co-ordination of city centre traffic signals and the incorporation into this scheme, on a pilot basis, of closed circuit television.  By allowing direct observation of traffic situations as they arise, CCTV will make the traffic signalling system more responsive to actual traffic demands at any given time and help to maximise the benefits of UTC.</P>
    <P>Funds will also be required to meet costs arising from the pilot electronic bus priority system through which buses, which are behind schedule, are given priority at signalised junctions.  The Authority are currently examining proposals for the wider development of this <Col N="1609" /> scheme.  In addition to capital expenditure, the Authority will also be incurring expenses of a current nature such as staff, accommodation and administrative costs.  These will be kept to the minimum and I am confident that the Authority will produce concrete results and recommendations.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £1.2 million is likely to be incurred under subhead V and will represent the final payments that will arise on my Vote in respect of the <i>Irish Spruce</i>.  From the date of liquidation of ISL to September 1986, total care and maintenance and other payments on the ship are payable from the Communications Vote.  The sums involved amount to around £3.1 million.  Of this sum, two initial such payments totalling £376,631 were made in December 1984 and January 1985 from the central fund under the 1982 Act.  These payments were made under the guarantee on the basis of advice from the Attorney General that the Minister for Finance had power under the 1982 Act to meet these expenses.  Subsequent legal advice did not confirm this, but indicated instead that these costs were not liabilities under the guarantee.  Following this advice, the Comptroller and Auditor General was informed on 29 July 1985 that this situation would be regularised and arrangements made to reimburse the central fund.  This is being done under this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>Under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, statutory responsibility for the operation and development of the postal and telecommunications services was vested in two semi-State bodies, An Post and Telecom Éireann respectively, with effect from 1 January 1984.  In the period to end December 1985, the traditional financial arrangements provided for in that Act were effected.  During this period, the bank account of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, held at the Bank of Ireland, College Green, Dublin, was held open to clear various transactions associated with the transitional financial arrangements and to honour cheques and <Col N="1610" /> other negotiable instruments drawn on the account up to 31 December 1983.</P>
    <P>At the end of 1985, cheques and other negotiable instruments to the value of approximately £180,000 had not been presented for payment.  At the beginning of 1986, the bank account was formally closed following the provision of a token subhead X in my Vote to honour any such negotiable instruments presented for payment following the closing of the account.  It is expected that by the end of the year negotiable instruments to the value of £41,000 will have been presented for payment, leaving a balance of approximately £140,000.  It is probable that the bulk of these outstanding cheques will now never be presented for payment, but in order to cater for such an eventuality I intend to provide a token subhead in the Estimate for my Department in 1987 for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Following a recent Government decision, this Supplementary Estimate makes provision for a grant of £500,000 towards the cost of a car ferry service from Cork to Swansea in 1987 by Swan-sea-Cork Car Ferries Limited.  I understand that the promoters of the service are at present actively engaged in preparations for the commencement of the service.</P>
    <P>Eurocontrol, the European organisation for the safety of air navigation, was set up in 1960 to provide a common system of air traffic control in the upper airspace of member states.  Ireland joined the organisation in 1965.  The principal task of the organisation is the collection of the charges levied on user airlines on the basis of a fixed unit rate relative to each state's costs of providing en route air navigation facilities and services and its airspace.</P>
    <P>We have recently been informed by Eurocontrol that receipts for the current year will amount to only £8.8 million, a shortfall of £2.7 million on the original estimate of £11.5 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to deal with the individual amounts as outlined in the Supplementary Estimates.  I got two versions of this, the first being for £2 million and the second for £2.5 million.  I presume that the sum of £500,000 that appears in the second version here is the money allocated to the Cork-Swansea ferry service.  The title says that it is a Supplementary Estimate of the amount required for year ending 31 December 1986 for the salaries and expenses of the offices of the Minister for Communications and certain other services administered by that office, for a cost alleviation payment and for payment of certain grants and grants-in-aid.  I do not know what the cost alleviation payment is if it is not that same £500,000.  There does not seem to be a cost alleviation payment in the sense that we had in this Estimate, £5 million to Aer Lingus for the transatlantic service.  I am a little puzzled about that.</P>
      <P>There is a CIE grant here &mdash; this refers to subhead D.1.  It is only a few short hours since we were dealing with CIE on the broad basis of their reorganisation into four companies, or into Córas Iompair Éireann itself and three subsidiary companies, so that I shall not delay very much on this.  However, it is significant that this subhead relates to the bus building operation at Shannon.  I, as well as other contributors to the debate on CIE reorganisation, indicated the foolishness of having a facility at Shannon such as we have there and not using it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House has been led to understand that the building of buses for CIE is being phased out.  They are finishing off 25 buses at present.  I pointed out to the House that the total capital investment is <Col N="1612" /> still there and still belongs to CIE, that all the machinery, tooling and so on necessary for the building of buses of whatever size are still in place and belong to CIE.  I take this opportunity to ask the Minister of State to talk to his Minister and impress on him the desirability of using these resources, particularly as there are also skills available in the area to make use of these resources.</P>
    <P>The next item I see here in which I am interested is Aer Rianta.  Deputy Leyden will deal with some of the An Post and Telecom Éireann items.  I should like to make the point &mdash; and I am dealing with subhead H.3 &mdash; that a tendency has started and is well under way now of not giving that company their proper name. I believe Aer Rianta themselves are responsible for this &ldquo;Irish Airports&rdquo; we are reading about.  Aer Rianta is a well recognised name and I want to put on the record my objection to what is happening with regard to that name.</P>
    <P>I am a little puzzled about a provision for Aer Rianta, that is, for the new Dublin runway.  In the original Revised Book of Estimates, 1986, in the breakdown of subhead H we read that Dublin Airport was allocated an estimated £2,139,000, Shannon Airport £1,271,000 and Cork Airport £501,000.  Subhead H.2 seems to be wiped out and a new subhead H.3 inserted.  Why is this necessary?  If the money is being allocated for Dublin Airport, why is it not under subhead H.2 (1)  as on page 180 of the Book of Estimates? What is the purpose of changing the actual subhead?  There must be some reason for it because it is not done without reason.</P>
    <P>The Minister this evening reiterated what the Minister, Deputy Mitchell said last June when we were taking the general Estimate.  He said that the method of financing Aer Rianta has changed.  The Minister said today:</P>
    <P>However, in view of the heavy demands on the Exchequer, the scale of expenditure involved, the expected commercial rate of return on the project and the strong financial performance of Aer Rianta in recent <Col N="1613" /> years, it has been decided that the project should be financed primarily from non-Exchequer sources.  Under these arrangements, Aer Rianta will finance about 75 per cent of the cost of the project from their own resources and from borrowings.  The remaining 25 per cent of the cost will be financed by Exchequer capital grants.</P>
    <P>According to the general Book of Estimates, Dublin Airport was supposed to get £2,139,000 and now, under a different subhead another £900,000 is being added. I am puzzled about that.  Why do we not have subhead H.2 &mdash; Dublin Airport &mdash; £3,039,000?  Is there any reason for this? I am sorry the Minister did not avail of this opportunity to let us know how much has been spent on the runway this year. We know what provision the Minister is making but we do not know what borrowings Aer Rianta have made, and we do not know what capital from their profits Aer Rianta have provided for this project.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>Preliminary expenditure of around £900,000 is being incurred on the project in 1986....</P>
    <P>That seems to indicate that the only money spent on the runway in 1986 is the money provided under subhead H.3.  I do not know if that is true but I would like the Minister to tell me.  A question arises immediately from that: what money has been returned to the Exchequer from Aer Rianta in 1986?  As the House knows, Aer Rianta send their profits to the Exchequer each year.  Has that happened in 1986?  A preliminary expenditure of £900,000 for this runway has been mentioned, but it seems to be the money provided by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have a number of notes to hand about various points connected with this matter, but I am puzzled about why we have a new subhead.  It may mean that the new subhead caters exclusively for the Dublin Airport runway and that other expenditure for Dublin Airport will be shown separately.  I suppose I should welcome that seeing that transparency is the <Col N="1614" /> in word for all accounts in public companies. If that is a move towards greater transparency, I welcome it.</P>
    <P>At column 1489 of the Official Report on 27 June last the Minister said that some months earlier the Government had approved the provision of a new 8,650 ft. runway at an estimated cost of £31 million and he mentioned the change in funding.  The only point which is opaque, rather than transparent, is how much Aer Rianta will be able to fund out of profits and how much they will have to borrow.  We will be able to see how much is involved because the Dáil will have to vote the money for this project.</P>
    <P>On the subhead in this Estimate making provision for the bulk carrier, the original Estimate was for £400,000 and we are now voting £1,600,000.  This subhead under which we are being asked to provide extra money to the tune of £1,600,000 is the saddest aspect of the whole communications and transport area.  If the Minister and his Department have achievements, they will all be vitiated by the fact that Irish Shipping were liquidated and we are continuing to pay for that.  I will oppose this Supplementary Estimate to show the distaste I have, that Deputies on this side of the House have, and that many Members of the Government parties have, with regard to what happened to Irish Shipping.  In <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i>, 31 October, the most recent copy I could lay hands on, it is stated that £51,267,290 was issued under Irish Shipping Limited Acts, 1947 to 1984 and that £40,350,752 was paid out in 1985.  It is a disgrace that a fine Irish public company was destroyed.</P>
    <P>I have in front of me a record of payments of £90 million plus, and we have nothing for it.  At the price <i>The Irish Spruce</i> fetched on the market, we could have 30 <i>Irish Spruces</i> for the money spent and recorded in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> and in this Supplementary Estimate.  We do not need 30 Panama vessels at 70 million tonnes.  If that money was husbanded and invested properly in the handy size ships, we could have a substantial fleet.  For that reason the Government and the Minister deserve the castigation of this House. <Col N="1615" /> The Minister set up a committee to examine this problem and they told him that we need a fleet.  He told me that in this House.  Yet he has deprived us of a deep sea fleet and he has deprived long-serving loyal workers, right up to the masters rank, of their profession in which they took pride.  The objectives and hopes of many young students who were training for this profession have been dashed.  I have a short time to deal with this but I could spend all the time on this subhead which seeks to provide £1,600,000 and all for nothing.  It is a big investment with nothing at the end of it.  I invite Members of the House to examine the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> to see the scandal with regard to public funds that is implicit in the figures.  I hope I never see the like of that performance again.</P>
    <P>The figures of £51,250,000 and £14,350,000 have been mentioned.  On top of that there is £25 million for the B&amp;I but that is not under discussion at present.  This House should be alerted to what is going on.  If the Minister had a cooler head and the Government a steadier nerve &mdash; and I am making no excuses for the mistakes that were made in the chartering of vessels &mdash; they would have put out of business the man from Hong Kong, who was in charge of the company that was involved, and we would still have our fleet.  We would than have been in a position to sell, even in a bad market, and not have a receiver doing it for us by getting rid of a fine serviceable vessel to the Yugoslavs for a mere bagatelle.  That is all one could call it considering what it cost</P>
    <P>Moneypoint will now be served totally by foreign ships.  The Fianna Fáil Government, when making a decision to have <i>The Irish</i><i>Spruce</i> built, specifically thought of it in the context of Money-point. Now the ESB will pay out moneys to foreign companies, not to Irish companies. I hope that when the Minister considers this he will make better plans. I am not indulging in any kind of gigantism. I would not like anybody to set forth on a policy of major investment or major <Col N="1616" /> purchasing at present but I would like to see a start made on the building of an Irish deep sea fleet, even if that is only a 6,000 tonne ship.  I feel very strongly about that.</P>
    <P>There are provisions under subhead W2 for the pensioners of Irish Shipping Limited.  There is not enough provision for those people.  They continue to dun this House and they are right.  They have stated that they will not give up as long as the injustice lasts.  They look around them and see people who, without ever taking their feet off dry land, have been generously rewarded by this House and by the State while wholly owned State companies were wound up or went into liquidation.  It is difficult to remain dispassionate when dealing with that problem.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on the Cork-Swansea provision.  There seems to be a note of optimism in what the Minister said.  I examined it carefully and I could not see that there was a positive statement that there would be a Cork-Swansea ferry next year.  I do not know what the objective is; I have an idea that some people are thinking in terms of a summer service. I welcome the provision and I hope the ferry will be provided.  It is difficult to tease out the economic implications of a ferry.  Losses may occur in the actual running of a ferry but despite that the country may gain substantially.  I do not suppose there ever was an actuary who could give a tight account of that.  The people in the Cork-Kerry region are convinced that the ferry is a major economic contributor to the tourist industry in that area.</P>
    <P>I know there was talk of an offer of £500,000 but that finally was not taken up.  I understand there are business interests who want to provide this service. Naturally enough they want to embark on it if they think it will be a viable service.  I do not want to be profligate in my suggestion but if nudging the £500,000 upwards would mean the provision of a service, let us not spoil the ship for a hap'orth of tar.  I hope it will become a reality.  Representatives from the region have indicated in this House <Col N="1617" /> and to me privately that they are very anxious that this service be got under way.</P>
    <P>Under subhead K1 there is provision of £1,000 for wreck and salvage.  It is particularly <i>ad rem</i> here.  I had representations from a citizen of this city asking me to indicate to the Minister that as far as the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> is concerned he, on behalf of the Government, should try to do the salvaging and perhaps make some money out of that disaster.  He feels that the insurance company will pay the owners and that the large cargo of iron ore could be salvaged.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of the Supplementary Estimate which I welcome but one thing that perhaps perturbs me is the whole sorry saga of Irish Shipping Limited.  As I said in June it is enough to vitiate the good the Minister has done. He has done some good by way of legislation, apart from the fact that the legislation had been made ready in his Department before he took over. However, the one rotten apple is Irish Shipping Limited and that is enough to spoil the barrel for me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Wilson I should like to comment on the discrepancy between the draft estimate we received and the Supplementary Estimate issued today.  The Supplementary Estimate today deals mainly with the proposed Swansea-Cork ferry.  I would regard that as a last minute decision by the Government for electoral purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the Government's move.  Deputy Wilson has for a long time been campaigning for that service on behalf of our party.  The Government's decision today is an indication of their last ditch efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with the postal and telephone services and the broadcasting area.  The Minister should request Bord Telecom to adopt a better sales campaign for the connection of telephone equipment. I note with concern that there is an embargo on the connection of private <Col N="1618" /> internal phones to the system.  It appears that it is illegal to connect such phones to the system although many people bought private phones and connected them efficiently to the telephone system.  The Minister should, if necessary, amend the Act, by order or otherwise, to ensure that that petty provision is omitted.</P>
    <P>I note that in the year ending 30 September 1985 the total amount collected in licence fees was £32,981,628 and that the cost of collecting those fees was £3,616,500.  When one bears in mind the amount collected in licence fees one must ask why viewers do not get more home produced programmes.  The most popular programmes on the RTE 1 and RTE 2 schedules are home produced, such as the daily news, &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo;, &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo;, &ldquo;Encore&rdquo;, &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; and other current affairs programmes. We need more drama on television. For a country that is so fortunate in having the finest theatres in the world it is surprising that we do not have more drama on our television stations.  We should have more home produced shows and less of the imported material such as &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dynasty&rdquo;, &ldquo;Falcon Crest&rdquo; and other soap operas.  I do not think those programmes are that entertaining.</P>
    <P>We should concentrate more resources on Irish music and dancing.  We do not give sufficient coverage to Irish cultural events which would prove very popular on television.  There is a great need to extend the regional coverage of news events.  A regional news service should be introduced for the different regions.  I note with concern that the Kevin McDonald news round-up programme after the 6.30 p.m. news on radio is to be phased out in the new year.  I appeal to the Minister of State to endeavour to have that decision changed.  He should ensure that all regions get adequate coverage.  That programme gave people an opportunity to put forward their point of view on national radio.  There is a need to provide more regional studios and I recommend that some of the money being given to RTE should be devoted to building them. I suggest that such a studio be provided <Col N="1619" /> in my constituency, Roscommon-East Galway.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling abroad that RTE transmit too many current affairs programmes, particularly on radio.  From 8 a.m. with &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; to the late evening, RTE radio have many current affairs programmes.  We have reached the stage at which the station have difficulty in getting different people to interview on those programmes.  We must have a greater variety of topics and people to interview and there should be a recruitment of new personnel for RTE. Some of the presenters are very popular but they have been with the station for some time and irrespective of how good they are we should get new talent on radio and television.  There is a view abroad that RTE have a club of people they choose from to appear on their shows regularly.  It appears that those who are in the know are called on to appear on quiz shows and other programmes. I do not know if the Chair will permit me to discuss all aspects of broadcasting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant in that we are providing finance to RTE.  There is widespread concern about the future of RTE.  There is great scope for joint productions by RTE and private enterprise. In regard to section 31 of the Broadcasting Act 1960, will the Minister indicate if he proposes to review the working of the order made under that section in view of recent political developments, including the highly successful broadcasting of Dáil and Seanad business?  I strongly recommend that &ldquo;Today in the Oireachtas&rdquo; be repeated in the morning. When the Minister comes to deciding whether to renew that section or not he should carefully consider the submission made by NUJ members in RTE and those made by the Repeal Section 31 Committee. One must ask how effective section 31 has been since its introduction. <Col N="1620" /> With modern developments such as cable systems and direct satellite broadcasting surely there is a contradiction in the implementation of that directive.  RTE, which owns Dublin Cablesystems Limited and the Galway Cable Company, are responsible for piping BBC1, BBC2, ITV and Channel Four directly into the homes of many people in the country and those stations are not constrained by section 31.  The Minister has approved the provision of receiving dishes for direct satellite broadcasting but he did not impose any restriction on the type of programmes to be relayed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am in order in discussing the use of the money being allocated to RTE.  I sympathise with producers and programme managers because of the constraints under which they operate in relation to section 31. When we provide funding for RTE it is to cover them until 31 December 1986. By then RTE will have had 25 years of broadcasting.  On behalf of Fianna Fáil I wish to extend to the RTE Authority, the management and the entire staff my sincerest congratulations on the work they have been doing in that quarter of a century.  They have provided a first-class television service, second to none.  From time to time we may criticise RTE, but fair constructive criticism is good.  We provide the finance and we are entitled to criticise programmes we think could be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The birth of RTE 2 was a welcome addition to the station's available programmes, but after 25 years of broadcasting I suggest it is time to review the operation of section 31.  I appreciate the background against which the section was introduced and put into operation and I fully support the idea that it was needed at the time.  After 25 years, though, I suggest the Minister should initiate a debate on the issue and set up a review group of qualified, experienced people to advise him and the incoming Minister for Communications on the operation of <Col N="1621" /> section 31.  That section has made it extremely difficult for producers and framers of programmes in deciding whether to interview certain people. Without giving any commitment about changes that may be made before the order on section 31 is reviewed next January, I ask the Minister to consider amending it.</P>
    <P>The Minister so far has failed to put through legislation setting up a local radio authority.  It is four years since he was appointed, but we still have as many as 16 unlicensed radio stations throughout the country.  On 5 July 1985 a debate was opened here on the Second Stage of a Bill to regularise this matter and to establish local radio by statute, but when the Labour Party voiced their objections the Bill was shelved and we have not seen it since.  The Minister and the Minister of State have neglected their responsibility in this respect.</P>
    <P>Of course there are ideological differences between Fine Gael and Labour on this issue and consequently it will be the duty of the incoming Fianna Fáil Minister to establish a local radio authority and have it in operation within six months so that order and regulation will be brought into this area.  At the moment the position is chaotic.  I have had many complaints about the abuse of the airwaves in this connection.  People have been forced into setting up local radio but they want to come out of that twilight zone.  They want to be licensed and to make their contributions to the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed local communities by not providing legitimate local radio.  We stand behind the people who want commercial and communityoriented radio services and when we are returned to power in the near future we will have no hesitation about bringing in legislation that will provide local radio for the Irish people in their localities. When local radio is established statutorily RTE will have a role to play in it.  They can be useful in training personnel, in providing services and in giving advice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the licence fee goes towards RTE for the provision of community radio on a trial basis.  Therefore, I am in order in referring to that matter.  As I have said, RTE will have a service to perform when local radio has been established.  Some of the money is going towards Radio na Gaeltachta, which Fianna Fáil are proud to have established.  After 25 years of television broadcasting it is time to provide a television service for the Gaeltachtaí to be named Teilifís na Gaeltachta.  Have RTE been advised to carry out pilot schemes in preparation for such a service for Gaeltacht areas?</P>
      <P>I do not think there is adequate provision for long wave radio.  I would ask the Minister to expedite a decision and to approve the joint venture with Radio Luxembourg for broadcasting into Europe.  It would give great opportunities to RTE staff, and we have the finest producers and broadcasters in the world. It is my intention, when Fianna Fáil return to office, to provide an opportunity to RTE to set up and establish a long wave radio service in conjunction with Radio Luxembourg.  This will be established in the not too distant future and will give an opportunity to people in the broadcasting area to establish themselves in this new market.</P>
      <P>Finally, the events of the next year will be a great opportunity for RTE to look at their position again.  I recommend the Minister to take my advice and review the workings and operations of RTE in the light of 25 years of service to the Irish people.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made no money available for the completion of Sligo Airport.  That is a shame because we had a wonderful service from Sligo to Dublin at one time.  I once had the opportunity to fly from Sligo Airport to Dublin, and a journey that takes three and a half hours by car takes a half an hour by plane.  An airport in Donegal has a daily service from Donegal to Scotland <Col N="1623" /> and I do not see why the Minister could not, before an election is called, make an announcement that money will be made available to complete Sligo Airport so that there will be regular flights from Sligo to Dublin.  It is a very fast way to travel from Dublin to Sligo for industrialists and business people.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus has serviced the main routes between Dublin and London for many years now.  We have competition so that fares are cheaper: it is always said that competition is the life of trade.  We have competition, too, on the seas.  It is much cheaper for a family to go to Britain today than it was years ago.</P>
      <P>I have one thing to say about Aer Lingus and it saddens me to have to say it.  I had a brother-in-law in New York who, on 3 November had occasion to come home from New York for his mother's funeral.  My sister, Mrs. Irwin, telephoned Aer Lingus direct to ask for a booking to Dublin on an Aer Lingus flight.  They said they were booked out but that they could facilitate her husband at a cost of $1,000.  It is unfortunate Aer Lingus are doing that to emigrants who always used their airline to the US.  They had no option but not to use Aer Lingus on that occasion.  They got a flight with British Airways from New York to London and from London to Dublin at a cost of $476 for the round trip, a saving of $500.  Mr. Irwin stayed one week in Ireland.  Unfortunately he was refused the opportunity of flying with Aer Lingus from New York to Shannon and from Shannon to Dublin.</P>

If anything <Col N="1624" /> can be done to provide money to finish Sligo Airport so we could have regular flights to Dublin and perhaps to Britain and the Continent, it would be a good thing.  I am delighted that in recent times the airlines have decided they will use the Connaught Regional Airport.  Money has been spent on it and it can do nothing but good for the west, just as Shannon did for the south.  I hope the day will come when that airport will be continuously used, and I am sure it will because industrialists will be flown into Knock bringing industry to the west.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the fine contribution by Deputy Wilson the H.3 subhead is a transfer of £900,000 from H.2; it is not additional money.  It is simply to show the runway expenditure separately.  I think the word Deputy Wilson used himself was to get some &ldquo;transparency&rdquo; into it.  Traditionally, developments of State airports are financed by means of voted capital grants from this Department's Vote. However, in view of the heavy demands on the Exchequer, the scale of expenditure involved, the expected commercial rate of return on a project and the strong financial performance of Aer Rianta in recent years, it has been decided that the projects should be financed primarily from non-Exchequer sources.  The detailed financing arrangements for the projects are as follows: 25 per cent Exchequer grants; 25 per cent Aer Rianta own resources, that is, retained profits; and 50 per cent borrowing by Aer Rianta, <Col N="1625" /> supported by State guarantee.  These arrangements were agreed between the Minister for Communications and the Minister for Finance and were subsequently endorsed</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one problem there, that is, if the EC stops the trading in the duty-free area, a large source of income will be lost for Aer Rianta, but we will have to cross that bridge when we come to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The preliminary expenditure, around £900,000 expected to be incurred on the project in 1986 is in respect of the provision of infrastructural services.  This expenditure has been financed by way of Exchequer capital grants which are provided in a new subhead H.3, the one I referred to.  Because of the size of the project, the expected level of expenditure from it and certain administrative aspects it has been decided to create this separate subhead to provide for the Exchequer investment in the runway.  As the Deputy said, it will show clearly where we are and what is happening and this would be a good thing if it were carried on more broadly as far as major capital projects are concerned. It is expected that £900,000 will be expended in 1986 and I explained the breakdown.  The Deputy asked about the surrender money.  Aer Rianta expect to surrender £11.5 million in 1986 to the Exchequer through our own Vote for Communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the phased expenditure.  It is over a number of years but I do not know the expenditure for each year.  They will be paying out of their retained profits, so it would be foolish to borrow if they had retained profits to finance their service.  I do not know the exact flow of expenditure over each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have given careful consideration to the question of a strategic fleet.  This arises out of the great tragedy of Irish Shipping.  This concept <Col N="1626" /> was last reviewed in 1963 when the tonnage requirements were fixed at 155,000 tonnes dead weight.  There are now substantially more vessels on the Irish register and now we have also the State owned B&amp;I company.  The Government are satisfied that the winding up of Irish Shipping is not a cause of concern in terms of our current strategic needs.  The Government regret particularly the loss of jobs for employees of Irish Shipping.  Over the years those employees have served Irish Shipping well and they and their families were the victims of these developments. This is one of the most unfortunate and tragic aspects of the liquidation of Irish Shipping.  That is the common sentiment of all of us.  I know there are great differences across the House about the handling of this issue, but the Minister on many occasions made his position clear.</P>
    <P>There is a provision of £500,000 for the Cork-Swansea car ferry which is a grant payment.  Subsequent to Deputy Wilson's contribution Deputy Leyden asked about the timing of it and suggested that it was perhaps timed in connection with a possible election.  The Government made their decision to make available a grant of £500,000 on 23 October this year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson asked about progress. A submission from Swansea-Cork Car Ferries Ltd. has been made and received in which progress made to date is reported.  The service will be a 38 weeks service from 15 April 1987 to 4 January 1988.  In addition to five trips weekly to Swansea, in the peak season there will be one trip per week to Roscoff in France. The charter of a vessel has now been signed and the company have a suitable ferry for the 1987 season with an option for 1988.  Therefore, there is considerable progress in that respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson asked about receivers of wreck.  The Minister for Communications is empowered under section 566 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894 to appoint receivers of wreck.  Each appointment is made in respect of a specified area of coast.  Receivers, who are usually officers of the Revenue Commissioners based locally, are vested with wide powers under the Act to deal with <Col N="1627" /> situations where vessels are wrecked, stranded or in distress in any place on or near the Irish coast.  The receiver is entitled to take such action as he thinks fit for the preservation of the vessel, for the lives of persons on board and for the vessel's cargo and equipment and so on. He may requisition any assistance necessary. Put at its broadest the function of a receiver of wreck is to preserve the vessel and its contents in order to allow restoration to the owners at a later stage after the deduction of salvage and other expenses due.  Unclaimed wrecks in the possession of a receiver become the property of the State after one year.</P>
    <P>Given the gravity of the incident involving the <i>Kowloon Bridge,</i> Captain James Kelly, deputy chief surveyor in the Department of Communications, was appointed as receiver of wreck for the area extending from the Kenmare river to Galley Head in order to deal with the situation.  Captain Kelly has taken possession of the vessel and has placed an exclusion zone of 1,000 metres around it which is a prohibited area to unauthorised vessels and personnel.  This area is protected on his behalf by the Garda, the Naval Service and Customs officials.  In addition, Captain Kelly has liaised with representatives of the local fishermen and between them they have agreed that it is in the fishermen's interest that they should be on the alert to prevent unauthorised entry.</P>
    <P>That gives in fair detail an outline of the position as regards a receiver of wreck which is very pertinent at this moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden seemed to suggest that I should take a more active part in the day to day running of RTE's affairs and programmes.</P>

      <P>When I was appointed to the position giving me responsibility in the areas of broadcasting in the Department of Communications, Deputy Leyden alleged that I was interfering.  Of course, I put it on the record &mdash; which <Col N="1628" /> was entirely unnecessary &mdash; that at no time in any of my various reincarnations &mdash; so to speak &mdash; did I interfere because professionally I objected to any interference when I was there and I thought that I should carry on that standard when I turned gamekeeper, so to speak.</P>
      <P>Deputy Leyden made a number of interesting points about the programmes and I suppose as a turned TV critic I would have to agree with him as regards the home produced programmes, and RTE when dealing with the money aspect of it would also agree with him because only in the home produced programmes in the future will we be able to compete. Now with satellite television, national frontiers have gone totally.  We will have ten or 20 channels coming in here in two or three years' time and the only way to beat them is to have home produced programmes.  I know that RTE share that view.</P>
      <P>Deputy Leyden mentioned section 31. We would all like to see conditions arising whereby, if possible, we could forget about section 31, but I regret that that time has not yet arrived.  I note the Deputy's remarks about the difficulties this creates for the journalists working in RTE.  I worked under it myself, though not perhaps in the exact form it is now. I believe that Members on all sides of the House and everyone in the country &mdash; or at least almost everyone &mdash; look forward to the day when it will be entirely unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that the RTE Authority will streamline and strengthen the organisation and their financial base to enable them to face the current and future demands of their customers.  This will entail greater labour flexibility in RTE, increasing substantially the amount of home produced material transmitted and containing all input costs.  RTE can and must give licence holders better value for money.  In dealing with the many excellent suggestions that Deputy Leyden made the cost factor is enormously important because providing the type of regional news service that he talked about and providing drama which we would all like to see, involve a high cost factor and, <Col N="1629" /> unfortunately, we can bring in imported programmes which are extremely popular and cost only a fraction of what a home produced programme would cost. That is the difficulty, but RTE on this occasion have made a major push at the parameters as far as home produced programmes are concerned.  To a great extent that is where the future of our national television station lies.</P>
    <P>We appointed a local radio commission and they have done much work in endeavouring to formulate the policy that would be adopted by the statutory commission in relation to the areas where a local and community radio service can be established and in relation to the type of service that may be allowed within the framework of the Bill.  Deputies will appreciate that this type of work will be the statutory responsibility of the commission in due course and to the extent that the ground rules have been laid, legitimate local and community radio can be established quickly.  I am very disappointed, as is the Minister, that it has not been possible to make progress with the Bill despite the Minister's efforts to resolve the difficulties that have arisen.</P>
    <P>I have given consideration to the application from RTE to extend its Cork local radio service.  While I accept there is an unsatisfied demand for legal local radio, whether RTE based or otherwise, the development of such services should proceed in a coherent, balanced and integrated fashion.  In these circumstances it would be inappropriate to make any decision on Cork local radio until the future format of local radio in general is clear.  A detailed submission by RTE proposing the establishment of a long wave radio service has been received and is currently under consideration.  There are major policy, legal and financial issues associated with the project to be taken into account before a definite decision can be reached.  That is something in which there are great possibilities.</P>
    <P>The provision of a television service is a matter for RTE in the first instance under existing legislation.  However, RTE would require Government <Col N="1630" /> approval if they were to embark on the provision of a television service for the Gaeltacht.  The major stumbling blocks to a project of that sort, apart from the heavy capital expenditure that would be involved in establishing a station and transmission network, are the unavailability of adequate programming and the cost of producing programmes for such services.  Whether one produces a service for a station which has a limited audience or for a station which has a massive audience, the cost of the production of the programme is the same and cannot be shared as can the cost of the programme which is going out to millions of people where revenue can be raised towards off-setting the cost through advertising.  The recently established Welsh channel 4 television service is providing 40 hours of Welsh language programming with an annual operating budget of around £16 million.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan, my constituency colleague from Sligo, spoke about the value of a commuter service from Sligo Airport to Dublin.  We all appreciate the great importance of that because not only does it cut time and save TDs and businessmen a lot of difficulties in travelling by road, but it will enable them to enjoy the scenery as they are passing over the beautiful lakes of Cavan and the sylvan pastures of the area.  I fully agree with Deputy Brennan about the necessity for this.  It is not a question of money for the Sligo Airport, because Sligo Airport is excellently equipped to take planes.  The difficulty is in getting an airline who will operate it on a successful commercial basis.  We have had lots of good news in recent times for Sligo.  Getting an airline is something in which I have had a great interest and I have been trying to progress it as fast as I can.  I am hopeful that Deputy Brennan will not have too long to wait before his desire for a commuter service from Sligo to Dublin is fully satisfied.</P>

Níl a fhios agam céard a dúradh i mbliana a chuir ina luí ar an Aire an phráinn a bhí leis an airgead seo a chur ar fáil don Údarás.  I dtrí cheisteanna Dála ón Teachta Máire Geoghegan-Quinn agus mé féin agus Teachtaí eile de bhunadh na Gaeltachta, d'iarramar ar an Aire an t-airgead seo a chur ar fáil níos luaithe mar go raibh a fhios againn céard iad na deacrachtaí a bhí ag an Údarás maidir le postanna a chur ar fáil.

Tá oifigigh forbartha sa chuid is mó de na Gaeltachtaí agus theastaigh sé sin.  Tá mé cinnte go bhfeicfear toradh maith de <Col N="1634" /> bharr an eagair atá á chur aige ar an Údarás.  Ba mhaith liom, chomh maith, tréaslú leis na baill uilig agus na baill a thogh an tAire.  Ar a laghad tá an méid seo le rá fúthu, gur daoine de bhunadh na Gaeltachta iad, agus tá mé cinnite go dtuigeann siad céard atá ag teastáil ón nGaeltacht agus go bhféachfaidh siad le cur ar a son.  Maidir leis an Ghaeilge féin, sílim go bhfuil gá le cabhair airgid a thabhairt don Údarás lena n-aghaidh a dhíriú ar fhorbairt na teanga sna Gaeltachtaí ar fad, ach gur tábhachtaí uilig gur beag an mhaith a bheith ag caint faoi phostanna má fhaigheann an Ghaeilge bás.  Tá sé mar cheann de phríomh-aidhmeanna an Údaráis go bhféachfaidh siad leis an teanga a chur chun cinn.  Sílim go bhfuil gá feasta le go ndíreodh an tÚdarás aghaidh níos mó, b'fhéidir, ar an gecist sin.  Tá brú iontach ar na Gaeltachtaí, brú teilifíse, brú raidió, agus is deacair do mhuintir na Gaeltachta an Ghaeilge a choinneáil slán leis an mbrú atá orthu.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Aire faoi rud atá faoi chaibidil i láthair na huaire.

An Siopa Leabhar le Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath, a thug seirbhís an-mhaith do phobal na Gaeilge.  Bhí sé gar go maith do lár na cathrach, bhí tarraingt mhaith air ó gach uile cheantar den tír.  Deirtear go bhfuil sé i gceist go mbeidh an siopa seo á dhruidim faoi dheireadh na bliana.  Ní shílim, a Aire, gur cheart go dtarlódh sé sin, más ceist airgid atá ann, más ceist deontais ó Roinn na Gaeltachta atá ann, nó laghdú ar dheontas ó Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Níl mé ag rá gurb ea.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé i gceist go mbeadh laghdú ar dheontas ó Roinn na Gaeltachta agus dá bhrí sin go mbeadh an chomhdháil in ann an siopa a choinneáil ar siúl.  Sílim go mba mhór an éagóir é ar phobal na Gaeilge, go mórmhór anseo sa chathair agus, go deimhin, ar fud na tíre uile go léir, agus go mba cheart dúinn iarracht a dhéanamh an siopa seo a choinneáil ar siúl.  De réir an eolais atá agamsa deirtear nach bhfuil siad ag cailliúint airgid, agus má tá sé sin fíor tá an scéal níos measa.  Dá bhrí sin, <Col N="1635" /> má tá míniú ag an Aire agus má tá a fhios aige cé atá ciontach, ba mhaith liom go dtabharfadh sé míniú agus go n-inseodh sé dúinn cad chuige a bhfuil sé seo ag tarlú.  Tá, sílim, le scaitheamh, fás míorúilteach i bhfoilsiú leabhar Gaeilge.  Ba mhór an trua é da ligfí don siopa seo a dhruid agus nach mbeadh na seirbhísí seo ar fáil.  Arís, cuirim fáilte roimh an Meastachán seo ach, mar a dúirt mé, is é an trua go mb'éigean dúinn, nó don Údarás, fanacht go dtí seo lena fháil.</P>

      <P>Cosúil leis an Teachta Gallagher cuirim fáilte roimh an Meastachán seo agus is mór an trua nach bhfuil níos mó ná uair an chloig againn chun caint mar gheall ar an nGaeltacht agus na nithe a bhaineann leis na Gaeltachtaí. Le déanaí, nuair a bhí Lá na Gaeilge againn sa Dáil agus ar fud na tíre sa tSeirbhís Phoiblí chuir sé ionadh ar mórán daoine an méid daoine atá sa tír agus a dhein iarracht an teanga náisiúnta a labhairt an lá sin agus déanaim comhghairdeas leis na daoine a thosnaigh é.  Ba cheart i bhfad níos mó laethanta a bheith ann i rith na bliana ná lá amháin agus is é sin mo ghuí.  Nílim chun leanúint síos an bóthar a shiúil an Teachta Gallagher nuair a bhí sé ag caint mar gheall ar an Údarás.  B'fhéidir nach bhfuil a fhios aige go bhfuil trí chás os comhair na cúirte faoi láthair i gcoinne an Údaráis.  Tá ceann acu sa Daingean, tá ceann acu i gcoinne Réalt Teoranta agus tá ceann eile ag oifigigh a bhí ag obair san Údarás i gcoinne &ldquo;Success&rdquo; magazine.  Mar sin, pé rud a déarfaidh mise, níl mé chun rud nua a rá mar sin.  Ach caithfidh mé a rá leis an Teachta Gallagher, nuair a bhí an Teachta Flynn mar Aire na Gaeltachta is é a dhein an dlí go gcaithfeadh oifigigh an Údaráis teacht thar n-ais chuige féin sara bhféadfaidís airgead éigin a chaitheamh agus ba é an Teachta Flynn a dhein sin.  Níorbh é an tAire O'Toole a dhein é sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taim ag caint anois i dtaobh Chiarraí agus measaim féin go bhfuil croí an Údaráis i nGaillimh, Maigh Eo agus Dún na nGall agus muintir Chiarraí agus Chorcaí agus Phort Láirge agus Chontae na Mí <Col N="1636" /> níl ach sop beag ag teacht síos chucu.  Níl a fhios agam cén fáth é sin, mar tá muintir na Gaeltachta sa taobh theas den tír chomh maith leis an muintir atá ag maireachtaint i nGaillimh, Maigh Eo agus Dún na nGall.  Is féidir leis an Aire a rá gur cuireadh oifig ar bun sa Daingean, ach sa tslí ina bhfuil mise ag féachaint air &mdash; táim ag féachaint anois go hoscailte ar an Údarás &mdash; tá imní ar dhaoine áirithe toise gurb iad na daoine céanna atá ag fáil deontas gach uile lá.  Cén fáth?  An é easpa eolais atá ar an nghnáth dhuine sa Ghaeltacht sa taobh theas den tír?  Ach má fhéachann tú ar an bpáipéar atá curtha amach ag an Údarás gach bliain i dtaobh a chúrsaí tá na hainmneacha céanna ag teacht aníos arís agus arís. B'fhéidir go bhfuil an scéal mar an gcéanna i gConamara agus i nDún na nGall, níl a fhios agam, ach sin é mar atá an scéal i gCiarraí.</P>
    <P>Na comharchumainn atá sna Gaeltachtaí, tá an chuid is mó acu i gcruachás.  Cén fáth &mdash; an é nach raibh an bhainistíocht i gceart nó go bhfuaireadar an treoir mhícheart agus nach raibh Aire na Gaeltachta nó Roinn na Gaeltachta nó Údarás na Gaeltachta in ann an t-eolas ceart a thabhairt dóibh.  Ach is mór an trua sin mar caithfidh gach duine a admháil nuair a bhí na comharchumainn faoi lán seol gur dheineadar mórán maitheasa sa tír, go mór mhór leis na coláistí samhraidh. Agus ag caint i dtaobh choláistí samhraidh, caithfidh an tAire athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar an méid airgid atá á fháil ag na mná tí.  Tá na coláistí samhraidh an-tábhachtach ar fad ó thaobh eacnamaíocht na nGaeltachtaí.  Tagann na céadta páistí ó gach aird den tír go dtí na Gaeltachtaí agus uaireanta ag deireadh na seachtaine tagann an t-athair agus an mháthair nó an deartháir nó deirfiúr ag féachaint orthu, an bhfuil gach rud ag dul i gceart, agus is fíor a rá go mbíonn siad ag cur fúthu i gcuid de na Gaeltachtaí. Mar sin, caithfidh an Rialtas, nó aon Rialtas atá i gcumhacht, i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh faoi na coláistí samhraidh.</P>
    <P>Istoíche bhí mé féin agus an Teachta Geoghegan-Quinn, an Teachta Haughey, an Teachta Prendergast agus an Teachta Mac Fhionnlaoich ag ócáid i <Col N="1637" /> dtaobh Fundúireacht na mBlascaodaí agus measaim féin go mba cheart do Roinn na Gaeltachta bheith istigh sa rud sin.  Caithfidh tú cuimhneamh, muintir na n-oileán nó muintir na mBlascaodaí, ní raibh aon Bhéarla acu san.  Bhí sé cosúil le hOileáin Árann.  Ní riabh aon Bhéarla riamh sna Blascaodaí ach ag na strainséirí a tháinig isteach.  Anois tá sé bánaithe le tríocha bliain nó mar sin.  Ach tháinig Poncánach isteach agus cheannaigh sé an chuid is mó de.  Anois tá fundúireacht tosnaithe agus measaim féin go mba cheart do Aire na Gaeltachta agus Roinn na Gaeltachta nó b'fhéidir Udarás na Gaeltachta tacaíocht láidir a thabhairt don Fhundúireacht sin ionas go mbeimid ábalta páirc stairiúil a dhéanamh den Bhlascaod.  Agus bí cinnte go n-aontódh gach duine san Teach seo leis an aidhm sin.  Dúirt an Teachta Haughey anocht go raibh sé laistiar dó; labhair an Teachta Prendergast, Páirtí an Lucht Oibre, agus mhol sé é agus dúirt muintir Fhine Gael go rabhadar laistiar dó.  Ba cheart don Aire cuimhneamh air sin agus buail leis an bhFundúireacht agus cuireadh a thabhairt dóibh teacht isteach chuige agus suí síos leis agus rud éigin a dhéanamh faoi.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí an Teachta Gallagher ag caint mar gheall ar na tithe, measaim féin go raibh pointe ana-mhaith aige, i leith na coinníollacha atá ag an Roinn Comhshaoil chun deontas a fháil chun tithe a dheisiú.  Chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le muintir na Gaeltachta níl an oiread sin béim acu ar PAYE agus rudaí mar sin.  Daoine macánta iad agus an chuid is mó den deisiúchán is iad féin a dheineann é agus nílid abálta a rá go bhfuil uimhir PAYE acu agus ba cheart don Aire seans a thabhairt dóibh a shean scil a thabhairt ar ais.</P>
    <P>Táim ag caint arís i dtaobh na mbóithre sna Gaeltachtaí.  Tá na bóithre go hainnis agus cuid de na bóithre níl ach duine amháin ag maireachtaint ag deireadh an bhóthair.  Agus de réir na gcoinníollacha nua atá tugtha isteach sa Teach seo toisc gur deineadh rud éigin mí-cheart leis an airgead in áit éigin, tá sé ag cur isteach anois ar gach duine atá ag deireadh an bhóithrín, agus níl sé sin ceart.  Ta an <Col N="1638" /> fear atá ag maireachtaint i ndeireadh an bhóithrín chomh tábhachtach leis na daoine atá ag maireachtaint i mbóithrín a bhfuil trí agus ceithre agus cúig tithe ann.  Agus ba cheart don Aire arís athbhreithniú ar an scéal seo.  Tá seans mór ag an Údarás, measaim féin, i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh faoi.  Nuair a chas muintir an Tí seo leis an bhfoireann i nGaillimh dúradar linn nach rabhadar ach ag caitheamh beagáinín den bhuiséad a bhí acu.  Nílim sásta leis sin &mdash; beagáinín den bhuiséad chun leasú na teanga ar fud na tíre &mdash; cuid an-bheag ar fad, 2 faoin gcéad nó rud éigin mar sin.  Bhí sé go hainnis.  Agus measaim arís gur cheart don Aire a rá le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta i bhfad níos mó béime a chur ar na páistí an teanga a labhairt.  Mura bhfuil an teanga ag na paistí níl aon seans aici.</P>
    <P>Tuigim go bhfuil ganntanas airgid ann, ach caithfimid cuimhneamh go bhfuil an teanga ag imeacht.  Tá na daoine ag imeacht thar sáile arís, cuid acu, b'fhéidir, go raibh job maith acu, cuid acu, agus tá siad ag dul thar lear.  Is cailliúint mhór é sin.  Measaim féin mura gcuireann an tÚdarás i bhfad níos mó béime ar Chiarraí agus ar Chorcaigh, ní bheidh na Gaeltachtaí ann.  Bhí an Teachta Gallagher ag caint mar gheall ar na tograí feirmeoireachta bradán agus an rath atá ar chuid acu &mdash; agus deirtear liom go bhfuil cuid acu go han-mhaith ar fad, agus tuigim é sin, an ceart aige &mdash; ach tá taobh eile den scéal nuair a théann an tÚdarás isteach in áit éigin gan bualadh leis na hiascairí ar dtús agus caint leo, agus nuair atá an tÚdarás ag dul isteach cosúil le graibeirí agus ag tógaint farraige a bhí ag na hiascairí ó thosnaigh an saol seo, níl sé ceart.  Tá easaontas mór anois i gCiarraí Thiar, agus ba cheart don Údarás cuimhneamh ar na focail a dúirt mé anseo anocht.  Agus tá mé an-chúramach leis na focail atá á rá agam.  Arís &mdash; níl ach cúpla focal eile le rá agam &mdash; deirim leis an Aire blianta eile a chur leis na coláistí samhraidh.  Measaim gurb iad eacnamaíocht na Gaeltachta iad.  Má tá deireadh leis na coláistí samhraidh ní bheidh punt sa phóca ag aon duine sa Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Labhair an Teachta Begley faoin ócáid dheas a bhí againn i gCeannáras Bhord Soláthair an Leictreachais, do Fhundúireacht an Bhlascaoid.  Tharla rud iontach ann chomh fada is a bhain le Páirtí an Aire. Is é sin gur sheas an Teachta Begley agus gur labhair sé go poiblí thar ceann an Taoisigh.  Meas tú ar chosúlacht é seo ar rudaí móra atá le tarlú sna seachtainí agus sna míonna atá amach romhainn i bPáirtí Fhine Gael?  Fágaimis é sin faoin Aire. Ba mhaith liom píosa a léamh from the magazine of the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staff called &ldquo;Neart&rdquo; in the winter edition of this year, page 21, and I quote from an article entitled &ldquo;Údarás na Gaeltachta Suffering from Success&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>There was a time when one could safely assume that a new full time manufacturing job created anywhere in Ireland was a source of satisfaction to all.  It appears now that there are first and second class jobs and that somehow jobs in wealth creation in the Gaeltacht are not as valuable as elsewhere in the country.  There should be an end to such nonsense.  The country needs every viable job it can get, wherever in Ireland they can be provided without discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Go háirithe leis an lagmhisneach atá orthu ó thús na bliana seo nuair a chinn an tAire agus an Rialtas an Údarás a fhágáil gann ar an leibhéal airgid a bhí uathu don bhliain seo.  Agus dúirt an tAire linn, agus é ag labhairt linn ar an 5ú lá de Mheitheamh, 1986, in a ráiteas ar Mheastachán na Gaeltachta: &ldquo;Tá súil agam go mbeidh réiteach ar an bhfadhb sin agam go han-luath&ldquo;, agus an fhadhb a bhí i gceist aige ná na deacrachtaí airgid a bhí ag an Údarás ag an am sin.  &ldquo;Go hanluath&rdquo; a dúirt sé.  B'shin an cúigiú lá de mhí Mheithimh na bliana seo.  Anois tá sé i ndeireadh na bliana, go leor míonna ina dhiaidh sin, agus tá an tAire ag teacht ar ais ag rá, sa dara cuid dá óráid anseo, go raibh éileamh thar an gcoitiantacht i mbliana ar íocaíochtaí deontas ón Údarás i gcomparáid le cúpla bliain anuas.  Agus deir sé, &ldquo;Chothaigh sé sin deacrachtaí don <Col N="1640" /> Eagraíocht&rdquo;.  Deirimse gurbh é cinneadh an Rialtais agus an Aire ag tús na bliana a chothaigh na deacrachtaí sin don eagraíocht, agus go bhfuil damáiste thar an gcoitinne déanta aige sin don eagraíocht í féin.  Aontaím go hiomlán leis an Teachta Gallagher, cé go bhfáiltím, mar a rinne seisean, roimh an Meastachán Forlíontach seo.  Aontaím go bhfuil sé ag teacht, b'fhéidir, ró-mhall don Údarás. Tá súil agam nach mar sin atá an scéal. Níl aon dabht i mo intinnse ná go bhfuil an t-uafás dochair déanta aige don chomhoibriú agus don bhá a bhí idir agus atá idir Údarás na Gaeltachta agus pobal na Gaeltachta go ginearálta.  Agus sin é an chéad rud a chaithfear a chothú i gcónaí.</P>
    <P>Creidim go bhfuil dochar déanta aige freisin do na tograí is fiúntaí a bhfuil ag éirí leo ar fud na Gaeltachta ar fad agus a bhfuil 4,000 duine fostaithe iontu nach mbeadh fostaithe murach go raibh Gaeltarra agus anois an tÚdarás ann.  Ach, níos measa ná sin, tá amhras cothaithe in intinn aon tionsclóra le bliain anuas a bhí ag déileáil leis an Údarás, a bhí i mbun comhráite leo, nó atá ag plé leo faoi láthair faoi thionscail a bhunú sa Ghaeltacht agus fostaíocht a chur ar fáil atá ag teastáil go géar agus tá amhras cothaithe freisin in intinn an dreama seo i mbancanna, i bhfoinsí airgeadais eile na tíre a chuireann airgead ar fáil i bhfoirm iasachtaí do na tionsclóirí seo.  Agus creidimse nuair a tháinig Bord Údarás na Gaeltachta i bhfeidhm go ndearna siad aon rud amháin agus go mba rud é a thug misneach do phobal na tíre i gcoitinne. Bhí tionscail ann ag an am sin a bhí ag cailliúint go leor airgid.  Agus chinn an chéad bhord go ndúnfaidís síos na tionscail sin agus go dtosnóidís ag obair as an nua agus go gcuirfí an t-airgead sin isteach i dtionscail a raibh súil mhór go n-éireodh leo.  Chothaigh sé sin go leor deacrachtaí, go mór mhór do na baill a bhí tofa go daonlathach ag pobal na Gaeltachta.  Mar go minic an tionscal a dúnadh bhí sé i gceartlár a gceantair féin, i gceartlár a muintire féin.  Agus in ionad tacaíocht a thabhairt don bhord agus don Údarás as ucht cinneadh den sórt sin a thógáil, céard a rinne an tAire agus an Rialtas seo ach <Col N="1641" /> cic a thabhairt dóibh agus a rá i mbliana nach bhfaighfidís an méid airgid a bhí ag teastáil uathu, agus a gcoinneáil ar an méar fhada ó mhí an Mheithimh seo caite ag cuartú an airgid sin.  Mar a deirim, tá deacrachtaí thar an gcoitinne cothaithe acu do aon tionsclóir a bhí ag deileáil leis an Údarás.</P>
    <P>Creidimse agus creidim go daingean é, go bhfuil tionsclóirí caillte ag Údarás na Gaeltachta nach dtiocfaidh ar ais go deo le lonnú sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá cuid acu sin goidte ag an Údarás Forbartha Tionscail, agus tá eolas agam faoi cheann amháin acu, ceann mór atá gafa go dtí Tuaisceart na hÉireann.  Agus ní raibh aon fáth leis sin ach amháin nach raibh an tÚdarás in ann an t-airgead mar dheontas a bhí tuillte ag an tionsclóir sin a chur ar fáil taobh istigh de achar áirithe mar a bheadh de ghnáth.  Ní chreidimse gurb shin é an bealach le gnó a dhéanamh le haon eagras, ach go háirithe le heagras Stáit. Agus mar a dúirt mé, tá súil agam na tionsclóirí eile atá i mbun comhráite faoi láthair, go bhfanfaidh siad leis an Údarás agus leis an nGaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Bhí an tAire agus mé féin i láthair roinnt seachtainí ó shin ar an gCeathrú Rua nuair a tháinig comhlacht mór idirnáisiúnta a bhfuil clú air ar fud an domhain, IBM, anuas chuig an nGaeltacht le comhghairdeas a dhéanamh le comhlacht beag Gaeltachta lonnaithe ar an gCeathrú Rua, Telemara Teo., ar shínigh siad conradh leo ag tús na bliana seo agus a raibh an comhlacht sin in ann oibrithe as ceartlár na Gaeltachta a fhostú, an conradh sin a líonadh go huile is go hiomlán ina cheart agus ina chóir agus gan aon teacht aniar air ón gcomhlacht IBM.  Agus tháinig IBM chuig an nGaeltacht le duais a bhronnadh ar Thelemara Teo.  Sin é an cineál scéil faoin Údarás agus faoin nGaeltacht a theastaíonn uainn a chothú agus a chreidimse gur féidir a chothú.  Agus tréaslaím le foireann an chomhlachta sin, ach go háirithe le foireann agus le Príomhfheidhmeannach an Údaráis, mar creidim go bhfuil an-obair agus an-job déanta acu ar fud na Gaeltachta, go háirithe le blianta beaga anuas.</P>
    <P>Bhí 667 bpost lánaimseartha agus 80 <Col N="1642" /> post páirtaimseartha ceadaithe ag an Údarás agus gan iad in ann litreacha ofrála a chur amach acu, mar, mar atá a fhios agam agus mar atá a fhios ag an Aire, bhí airgead iomlán 1986 tógtha suas ag tograí a ceadaíodh i ndeireadh na bliana 1985.  Cloisimid go leor faoi chostais post amháin a chruthú in Éirinn, post amháin i gceantair an Údaráis Forbartha Tionscail, cuir i gcás.  Agus tá a fhios againn anseo go gcosnaíonn sé dhá dtriain den mheánchostas sa chuid eile den tír post a chruthú sa Ghaeltacht, agus sin in ainneoin na gcineál constaicí a luaigh an Teachta Gallagher atá le sárú ag an Údarás, nach mbíonn le sárú ag an gcuid is mó eile den tír.  Mar a dúirt mé ar dtús, ní chreidim féin dáiríre dá mbeadh aon údarás forbartha tionscail eile ag plé le ceantair Ghaeltachta seachas an tÚdarás, go mbeadh aon dul chun cinn i gcruthú postanna ann.  Ní féidir, mar a dúirt mé ar ball beag, tion-sclóirí sclóirí a chur ar an méar fhada.  Caithfidh siadsan cinneadh a thógáil inniu agus caithfidh siadsan a bheith ag dul i mbun oibre faoi cheann roinnt seachtainí nó roinnt míonna, agus tá, mar a thugann siad air, &ldquo;deadline&rdquo; acu ar fad.  Cuireadh go leor acu sin ar an méar fhada le bliain anuas.</P>
    <P>Anois, rinne an tAire &mdash; níl a fhios agam é an tAire féin nó an Rialtas a chuir ina luí air go gcaithfeadh sé dhá chinneadh aisteacha a thógáil i gcaitheamh na bliana seo.  Áit amháin a raibh an-iarracht déanta ag an Údarás postanna a chruthú ar fud na nGaeltachtaí ná sna tionscail sheirbhíse.  Agus b'fhéidir nach raibh oiread sin daoine ag obair sna tionscail sheirbhíse, go leor acu i gceantracha Gaeltachta na tíre seo iargúlta, gearrtha amach i bhfad ó thionscail sheirbhíse na gcathracha agus na mbailte móra.  Rinne an tÚdarás an-éacht gur tugadh na seirbhísí ar chomhleibheál isteach i gceartlár na Gaeltachta.  Agus rinneadh é sin mar go raibh an tÚdarás in ann deontais, beag suarach go maith ach a raibh an-tábhacht leo i gceantar beag Gaeltachta, a chur ar fáil do na gnáthdaoine, do mhuintir na Gaeltachta féin gan aon chur isteach ó aon duine nó aon tionsclóir mór a thabhairt isteach as taobh <Col N="1643" /> amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Ba éacht é sin agus ba éacht é a gcreidimse go n-aontódh fiú amháin an Teachta Begley leis, gur cheart dúinn gach uile thacaíocht a thabhairt dó.</P>
    <P>Bhí rud eile a raibh baint acu leis, go háirithe i mo dháilcheantar féin, agus ba shin forbairt portaigh.  Le blianta fada níorbh fhéidir portaigh a úsáid i réimsí móra de mo dháilcheantarsa, mar nach bhféadfaí teacht ar chomhoibriú nó ar thacaíocht ón bpobal i gcoitinne ansin, leis na portaigh sin a fhorbairt.  Anois tá sé ráite ag an Aire, tuigimse, le bord an Údaráis, gan a bheith ag plé le forbairt portaigh níos mó, nár cheart dóibh é sin a dhéanamh, cé go gcreidimse gurb é ceann de na gníomhartha is mó agus is áisiúla a rinne an tÚdarás agus a raibh déileáil acu leis agus gur gníomh é mar sin gur cheart tacaíocht a thabhairt dó.</P>
    <P>Feicim in óráid an Aire anseo ag deireadh leathanach a 2 go bhfuil sábháil airgid déanta ar Vóta na Roinne i mbliana, agus ag caint faoi na deontais tithíochta, d'iarr mise agus an Teachta Gallagher anseo ar an Aire roinnt míonna ó shin go n-éireodh leis eisceacht a dhéanamh, chomh fada agus a bhain sé le ceantracha Gaeltachta agus go háirithe le ceantracha oileáin Ghaeltachta, don chinneadh seo a thug an Rialtas go gcaithfí conraitheóirí tógála cláraithe a úsáid le do theach nua a thógáil.  Tá andeacrachtaí sna ceantracha Gaeltachta, tá a fhios ag an Aire féin é, mar tá sé gar do Ghaeltacht in a cheantar féin agus is ó cheantar Gaeltachta é féin ó dhúchas. Tá an-deacrachtaí sna ceantracha Gaeltachta agus go háirithe i gceantair na noileán, de bharr easpa conraitheoirí cláraithe a bheith ar fáil.  Agus creidimse fós gur cheart dó féin agus don Roinn athbhreithniú a dhéanamh agus eisceacht a dhéanamh i gcásanna den sórt sin.  Agus creidim gurb é cuid den chúis leis an laghdú i ndeontais tithíochta i mbliana nach bhfuil conraitheoirí cláraithe ag tógáil na dtithe agus mar sin nach féidir le pobal na Gaeltachta cur isteach ar na deontais.</P>
    <P>An dara sábháil atá ann ná £200,000 ar scéimeanna feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht <Col N="1644" /> agus is iontach go bhfuil an tAire ag caint ar Inis Meáin, mar chaith mise tamall ar Inis Meáin i gcaitheamh na deireadh seachtaine seo caite.  Tugadh le fios dúinn é sin agus chonaiceamar féin an drochbhail atá ar an gcé ar Inis Meáin.  Agus mar atá a fhios againn ar fad, níl aon bhealach amach ag formhór de phobal Inis Meáin-mura n-íocfaidh siad costas an turais ar eitleán, agus tá an turas sin an-daor-ach amháin ar bhád.  Tá deacrachtaí móra acu ar an oileán sin ag teacht amach in aimsir atá gaofar agus aimsir a bhfuil farraige throm ann.  Creidim dáiríre go bhfuil a fhios ag an Aire an tábhacht atá leis an gcineál sin muiroibreacha a dhéanamh ar an oileán.</P>
    <P>Ní thuigim cén fáth go gcuirfí é sin ar athló go dtí an bhliain seo chugainn.  An bhfuil an tAire ag rá linn go mbeidh an £200,000 sin ar fáil an bhliain seo chugainn nó an dtuigim as an méid atá ráite anseo go bhfuil sé á thógáil aige as an Meastachán agus nach bhfuil aon chruthúnas ann go mbeidh sé ar ais sa Mheastachán an bhliain seo chugainn?  Tá an tAire Stáit ag an Roinn Iascaigh ag rith thart timpeall an dáilcheantar sin agamsa agus ag caitheamh na milliún ar mhuiroibreacha. Fiú amhain tháinig sé isteach sa Dáil ag caitheamh oiread sin milliún i Ros a'Mhíl.  Fuair mé amach ón Aire Dlí agus Cirt a bhí ag labhairt thar ceann an Aire, nach raibh aon airgead ar fáil do Ros a'Mhíl i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Tá an cineál sin rith thart timpeall agus an gealltanas airgid seo ag déanamh andamáiste, mar go gcreideann daoine go bhfuil an t-airgead ar fáil.</P>

      <P>Tá sé anéasca ceann díobh sin a lonnú in iarthar na tíre.  Ach tá sé tábhachtach freisin go dtuigfeadh an tAire agus Roinn na Gaeltachta go bhfuil gá le costas den chineál sin le muiroibreachaí sábháilte ó thaobh slándála de a chur ar fáil ar na hoileáin.  Agus ba mhaith liom a fháil amach cen fáth go díreach nach ndeachaigh an Roinn ar aghaidh leis an gcaiteachas seo i mbliana.  Anois tá an tAire ag caint freisin ar hallaí agus ar ionaid phobail, agus go bhfóire Dia orainn, má théimíd ar fud na Gaeltachta &mdash; agus bhí an Teachta Begley ag caint faoi bhóithre áirithe &mdash; tá poill i gcuid acu a fheadfá feirm éisc a chur síos iontu.</P>
      <P>De bharr na drochaimsire tá bóíthre portaigh nach féidir móin a thabhairt amach as a bportach orthu de bharr an drochbhail atá ar na bóithre sin.  Creidim dáiríre, an t-airgead a chaitheadh i mbliana ar bhóithre ar fud na Gaeltachta nach fiú caint air bhí sé chomh beag sin.</P>
      <P>Anois, ag dul ar ais chuig an Údarás tá tionscal fíorthábhachtach a bhfuilimid ar fad ag plé leis agus a dtugaimid ar fad tacaíocht dó agus sin tionscal an éiscfheirmeoireacht. Aontaímíd ar fad go bhfuil todhchaí mór in ann don tionscal sin anois.  B'iad na cinnródaithe i bhforbairt an tionscail sin sa tír seo ná Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Tá caiteachas mór caipitil ag baint leis an dtionscal sin.  Creidimse gur cóir, agus Meastachán na bliana seo chugainn á phlé, áit speisialta a leagan amach i meastacháin an Údaráis le haghaidh forbairt an tionscail sin agus nach cóir an tionscal sin a chur i gcomórtas leis na tionscail eile nuair atá meastacháin Údarás na Gaeltachta á bplé agus an tAire ag deileáil leis an Rialtas i leith Mheastachán na Roinne an bhliain seo chugainn.  Mura ndeinimid é sin agus mura gcuirimid dream amháin, eagras Stáit amháin, i bhfeidhil fhorbairt an tionscail sin, a bhfuil an eolaíocht acu agus an cumas iontu í a fhorbairt mar is cóir, creidim go dtitfidh an tóin as an tionscal.

Chuir an Teachta Gallagher fáilte roimh airgead agus gabhaim buíochas leis as ucht sin. Rinne sé tagairt don mhoill a bhí leis an airgead agus rinne an Teachta Geoghegan-Quinn an rud céanna.  Bhí moill air toisc go raibh rudaí faoi leith le socrú idir an Roinn agus an Údarás.  Ach mar gheall ar an leibhéal rótharraingt, bhí an áis sin ag an Údarás i gcónái agus ardaíodh é sin i rith na bliana le go bhfeadaidís airgead a chaitheamh.  Ardaíodh é go deimhin faoi thrí.  Cuireadh milliún breise ar fáil dóibh sa rótharraingt.</P>
      <P>Tá curtha in ár leith go bhfuil an meon mícheart ag an Rialtas seo i leith an Udaráis, i leith na Gaeltachta, nár cheapamar ball dó seo agus ball dó siúd ar Bhord na Gaeilge.  Ba mhaith liom dhá rud a rá. Uimhir a haon, táimid anseo anocht ag caint faoi Mheastachán an Rialtais agus is é an toradh atá ar an oíche seo go bhfuil faighte ag Údarás na Gaeltachta i mbliana níos mó airgid ná mar a fuair siad riamh cheana.  Agus maidir le comhaltaí an bhoird, taobh amuigh de dhuine amháin a chuir mise ansin ón Roinn féin, fear na Roinne, tá chuile dhuine ar an mbord as an nGaeltacht. Ceapaim go bhfuil sé sin tábhachtach, go mbeadh na daoine ainmnithe ag teacht as an nGaeltacht ar aon nós.  Ach ceapaim go mba chóir do chomhaltaí ainmnithe an Údaráis, a bheith de bhunadh na Gaeltachta agus go mbeadh tuiscint acu ar fhadhbanna na Gaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rinne an Teachta Gallagher agus an <Col N="1647" /> Teachta Begley tagairt don Ghaeilge mar theanga agus na coláistí samhraidh chomh maith.  Tá fadhb maidir leis an nGaeilge.  Tá an Ghaeilge ag dul i léig. Nil a fhios agam cén freagra atá air seo nó cén fuascailt atá ar an bhfadhb seo ach tá fadhb ann.  Ag léamh na tuarascála a chuir Coiste an Oireachtais ar fáil, mhol siad go mba ceart don Údarás suim speisialta airgid a bheith acu le dul don chultúr agus don Ghaeilge agus go ndíreoidís a n-aire níos mó, mar adúirt an Teachta Begley, ar an nGaeilge.  Sin rud gur féidir linn suí síos agus a phlé leo.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Siopa Leabhar, siopa na Comhdhála, níl aon bhaint agamsa leis. Is mór an trua go bhfuil an raic seo ar siúl faoi láthair agus go bhfuil sé á dhúnadh, nó go gcloisim go bhfuil.  Ba mhór an chailliúint é do mhuintir na Gaeilge sa chathair seo agus go deimhin ar fud na tíre.  Ní ceist airgid é chomh fada agus is eol dom.  Níl aon baint agamsa leis, mar a deirim, agus ní gearradh siar atá i gceist ar dheontas nó tada eile.  Tá brabach á dhéanamh acu chomh fada agus is eol dom.  Tá deacrachtaí eile ann, chomh fada agus a chloisim, agus tá mise ag rá &mdash; ní le mo ladar a chur isteach in eachtra den tsaghas sin, mar tá faitíos orm &mdash; go bhfuil súil agam go dtiocfaidh ciall agus go gcoinneofar an áis seo ar siúl.</P>
    <P>Bhí an Teachta Begley ag clamhsán. Cheap sé go raibh croí an Údaráis i nGaillimh agus i Maigh Eo agus i dTír Chonaill agus gan aon chos a bheith i gCiarraí nó in aon pháirt eile den tír.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé sin fíor.  Níl sé sásta leis an mbealach ina ndáiltear deontais ina cheantair féin.  Má tá an Teachta míshásta leis sin, tá mise sásta suí síos leis agus ceisteanna a chur air cén tslí ina ndáiltear deontais.</P>
    <P>Na comharchumainn i ngcruachás &mdash; bhí agus go deimhin tá cuid acu fós.  Ach tá cuid acu gur thugamar cúnamh dóibh, gur chuireamar comhairle orthu agus tá baill i bhfad níos fearr ar chuid acu ná mar a bhí na blianta ó shin.  Chuaigh cuid acu isteach in obair agus i dtograí nár fheil dóibh agus chuaigh siad rófhada róluath, tá faitíos orm.  Thosnaigh siad ag cur seirbhísí ar fáil agus thrasnaigh siad <Col N="1648" /> an méid a bhí an chomhairle chontae ag cur ar fáil in áiteanna.  Rinne siad é sin toisc gur cheap siad gur theastaigh sé ó na daoine agus go mbeadh moill air dá mbeadh orthu fanacht do dhaoine eile agus rinne siad é mar sin agus bhí trioblóid ann.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na coláistí samhraidh, tá trí phunt deich in aghaidh an lae á íoc in aghaidh an dalta do na mná tí faoi láthair. Táimid ag plé cúrsaí airgid agus airgeadú faoi láthair agus beidh mé ag caint faoi sin amach anseo féachaint an féidir aon fheabhas a chur orthu - ach tá sé feabhsaithe le cúpla bliain anuas.  Glacaim leis agus ba mhaith liomsa go deimhin níos mó a thabhairt dóibh.</P>
    <P>Mhol an Teachta Begley go mba cheart dúinn anseo sa Roinn bheith páirteach i bhFundúireacht na mBlascaod.  Sin rud go mba mhaith liomsa breathnú air.  Tá mé mar bhall den fhundúireacht sin agus ní raibh sé d'acmhainn agam bheith ansin tráthnóna.  Ach guím rath Dé ar a gcuid oibre ansin.  Is áit í na Blascaodaí a bhfuil an-cháil air, an tOileán, ó thaobh litríochta dhe, a raibh Tomás Ó Criomhthain, Peig Sayers agus daoine eile ann a raibh an-cháil orthu.  Maidir leis an ráitis ó STMS, ba mhaith liom a rá nach bhfuil dochar déanta don Údarás, nach ceart go mbeadh amhras cothaithe in intinn éinne faoi céard tá ar siúl ag an Údarás.  Ba mhaith liom a rá go ndéanann sé i bhfad níos mó dochair go mbeadh Teachta anseo ag caint faoi amhras a chothú in intinn dhaoine mar mhuintir na mbanc a chuireann airgead ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Tá Údarás na Gaeltachta i mbliana ag fáil níos mó ná mar a fuair siad riamh cheana.  Ba mhaith liom tréaslú leo.  Tá uimhir na ndaoine fostaithe ag dul i méid. Rinne an Teachta Geoghegan-Quinn tagairt do chostas poist a chur ar fáil.  Sin cineál slat tomhais a gcloistear tagairt dó go minic.  Fad a bhaineann liomsa níl aon chiall leis sin.  Cuir i gcás nuair a bhíonn airgead ar fáil, beidh postanna, agus nach bhfuil breis postanna á gcur ar fáil?  Sé an costas do phost den saghas sin &lsquo;infinity&rsquo;. Níl aon chostas air &mdash; ní féidir é a thomhais.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom arís tréaslú leis an <Col N="1649" /> Údarás.  Siúráilte, tá mé sásta breathnú air.  Níor mhaith liom a rá go mbeidh deathoradh ar an debate ach déanfaidh mé iarracht.  Glacaim leis go bhfuil deacrachtaí ann ach tá na deacrachtaí céanna ar imeall na Gaeltachta, taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht - mo cheantar féin cuir i gcás.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wilson has been given permission to raise the subject matter of Question No. 64 on yesterday's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá buíochas mór ag dul duitse mar gur thug tú an deis dom an cheist seo a phlé ar Athló na Dála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question relates to the amount of money available for the reconditioning of old houses owned by local authorities.  I asked for information about the response from the local authorities to the announcement of the fund, the places in Ireland where money from the fund was spent and the provision the Department are making for about 30 local authority houses in Cootehill in County Cavan.  The reply I received indicated that a capital allocation of £5 million had been made available for 1986 for funding remedial works to low cost and pre-1940 houses. The reply stated that 55 applications for assistance under this scheme had been received by the Department and 30 proposals had been approved to date.  It appears that a total of £937,000 has been drawn to date by local authorities in respect of projects at Oldcourt Estate in Bray and Kindlestown Park in Greystones. I am sure the House realises by now how significant it is that the only places where the money was spent was in County Wicklow.  The Minister's reply was to the effect that a proposal from Cootehill Town Commissioners for the refurbishment of 35 houses was being examined in the Department.  It was that statement that prompted me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and I am <Col N="1650" /> grateful to the Chair for giving me permission to do so.</P>
    <P>After studying what has happened I am of the opinion that Cootehill Town Commissioners have been treated with nothing short of contempt by the Department of the Environment.  A circular letter dated 10 January 1986 referred to structural repairs to old houses.  On 3 March the contents of the circular were raised by the Cootehill Town Commissioners with the deputy county manager. A claim was submitted to the Department of the Environment on 6 May 1986.  The commissioners applied for a grant for Church Street amounting to £154,775 and for New Line amounting to £169,960.  The town commissioners and their town clerk were quick to assess what was happening and being aware of the need to expend this money, bearing in mind the employment it would give to skilled people in the town and the need to repair the houses, they did not sit on this.  The fact that I am raising this on 4 December gives an edge to what I am saying about this.</P>
    <P>On May 16 the town commissioners received a letter from the Department of the Environment requiring details of revenue and capital accounts for the year ended 31 December 1985.  I am not an over-suspicious type of person but I read that as a ploy to delay the provision of the money for Cootehill, money that has been allocated to two areas in County Wicklow.  The details were forwarded on 10 June, as requested.  On 24 June a letter was received from the Department requiring the submission of major technical data, specifications, cost per house of reconstruction, individual house plans to include floor plans, sections and elevations. That was a very strong demand because it necessitated the recruitment of professional staff.  The town commissioners, naturally, did not want to buy a pig in a poke and that was not surprising coming from a town like Cootehill, a good traditional market town.  They wanted some kind of guarantee that there would be an allocation before they <Col N="1651" /> embarked on that expenditure.  By 2 September a Department inspector, Mr. Jeffers, inspected the schemes.  In October the town commissioners, through their town clerk, applied again for a grant allocation. As the year was fading the commissioners became more alarmed and they raised the matter again with their town clerk.  That official telephoned the Department on 23 October, a follow-up to the letter of 2 October, and he again telephoned on 14 November and 1 December.</P>
    <P>Any fair minded person listening to the facts I have outlined would be very suspicious that the application from Cootehill Town Commissioners was not taken as seriously as it should have been by the Department.  There was not the usual promptness by the Department in dealing with this application.  I should like to know what happened with regard to the Oldcourt scheme in Bray.  When was the application for that grant submitted to the Department?  When was the expert advice made available?  When was the final decision taken?</P>
    <P>The House would also like to know <i>vis-à-vis</i> Kindlestown Park, when will all the steps outlined be taken in relation to the Cootehill commissioners?  The House will know that the allocations to the two places in Wicklow, £937,000, practically 20 per cent of the total allocation, was sanctioned by the Minister for the Environment at that time.  The Minister was a Wicklow man.  I do not make any allegations in that respect.</P>
    <P>The people of Cootehill who applied to have some consideration given to the application were ignored.  It may be a coincidence that the two localities in Wicklow were given the allocation at the time.  It may not be so, but I am entitled to get the views of the Minister of State because a considerable head of steam has been building up in Cootehill about it. We are into the final month of the financial year and the suspicion is that there will not be an allocation from the fund for Cootehill.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State to tell the House now that there will be a substantial <Col N="1652" /> allocation to Cootehill.  Will it be made in 1986 and, if not, will the Minister say that such an allocation will be made in 1987?  I understand from the Taoiseach and others that the Book of Estimates is being put together.  The gestation periods for the Book of Estimates have been particularly long.  I think the elephant has the longest gestation period in the animal world, but the elephant is only in the halfpenny place by comparison with what is going on in regard to the Book of Estimates.</P>

      <P>Before I give the official response, there are one or two points I should like to make by way of clarification.  The first is the time of the circular letter.  The circular was issued on 10 January 1985, not 1986, as Deputy Wilson said.  The Deputy repeated that date.  I do not know how the Deputy can say, therefore, that there was a quick response from the commissioners. How can he say that a reply after 17 months is a prompt one?  That is why the Cootehill Town Commissioners are so far down the list.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was said that the Department were negligent in their approach.  I would like to bring something to the Deputy's attention regarding the Cootehill application.  Further information regarding remedial works which came to the Department from the Cootehill commissioners referred to further defects.  The reason given for these was deterioration due to old age and neglect. That is clearly an indictment of the commissioners. I suggest the neglect was on the part of the landlord who, in this case, was the commissioners.  I am certain of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the county council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The application is from the commissioners.  If the Deputy wishes to examine the application I will <Col N="1653" /> be only too glad to accommodate him.  I will not mention the name of the person who signed it on behalf of the commissioners.</P>
      <P>I must make it clear that the basic responsibility for the management, maintenance and improvement of their rented dwellings rests on the housing authority who provided the dwellings.  To meet their outgoings on this, they have available to them their receipts from rents as well as 40 per cent of the proceeds of sales of local authority dwellings, together with other miscellaneous receipts related to housing.  Local authorities may also avail of the Department's improvement grant scheme for works such as the provision of bathroom/bedroom extensions and for the provision of water and sewerage facilities.  The after-grant cost of such work can be funded by means of an unsubsidised loan scheme which is also operated by my Department.</P>
      <P>In drawing up the national plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>, the Government recognised that the existing financial assistance might not be sufficient in cases where local authorities found themselves faced with outgoings not coming within the category of what might be termed normal maintenance and improvement costs. This arose mainly in connection with the remedying of serious defects which have arisen both in so-called &ldquo;low cost&rdquo; housing and in some of the older housing stock.  In an effort to help these authorities to meet the higher cost involved, the national plan provided that authorities might assign limited funds from their annual allocation for local authority housing to carry out a major programme of improvement works to &ldquo;low-cost&rdquo; housing and certain older stock suffering from serious deterioration.  In this case, that was not done.  There is no evidence that money was allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities were notified by the Department on 10 January 1985 of the terms of the new remedial works scheme. Under the scheme, capital up to £14,000 per dwelling, subsidisable at a rate not exceeding 80 per cent may be made available to local authorities to fund major repairs of a structural nature to pre-1940 <Col N="1654" /> houses suffering from serious deterioration as well as to &ldquo;low-cost&rdquo; housing. Houses purchased from the local authority may be included in a proposal for assistance under the scheme of where they form part of a scheme of rented houses and their inclusion is necessary to give an acceptable result to the scheme as a whole.  There is evidence that some of the Cootehill houses may have been purchased. Essential works of an improvement nature such as the provision of a water supply, sewerage facilities or a bathroom could be included in a proposal, provided other necessary works of reconstruction arising from structural deficiency are sufficient in themselves to bring the houses within the scope of the scheme.  Tenant purchasers are expected to contribute half the cost of the works either by means of a lump sum payment, an extended or revised annuity or a combination of both.  The scheme is designed to encourage tenant participation as much as possible.  To this end, in order to qualify for assistance under the scheme, local authorities where necessary must provide for environmental works to be carried out in co-operation with local residents.</P>
    <P>Obviously, those estates which are suffering from major structural defects such as leaking roofs, water penetration, defective walling etc. have to be dealt with more urgently than those whose main defects are of a less urgent character. A degree of priority must be given to the need to remedy the serious defects which have plagued the so-called low cost housing since its provision in the late sixties and early seventies.  The remedial works scheme represents the first serious effort to tackle this serious problem. While it was only to be expected that the authorities would be quick to take advantage of this scheme's generous provisions, the reality is that all the applications for financial aid cannot be allowed immediately but must be phased over a number of years.</P>
    <P>Applications under the remedial works scheme are running at a high level and to date some 55 applications have been received.  As indicated in the reply to <Col N="1655" /> Question No. 64 on 2 December, 30 proposals throughout the country have been approved following technical clearance and in the light of the progress achieved by the authorities in relation to projects and the urgency and extent of the work involved.  Each proposal obviously requires careful examination to ensure that the proposed solution will be effective. It is also often necessary to have remedial works carried out on a small number of houses on a pilot basis to establish the best and most effective way of tackling the problem.  Twenty of the approved proposals were in respect of houses in the low cost category while the ten pre-1940 schemes were those where the work required was of an urgent nature.  All but two of these applications were received in 1985 and the remaining two were received in February 1986.</P>
    <P>That answers Deputy Wilson's point as to when the application was received in respect of the two schemes in County Wicklow.  It was in 1985.  It should be said that they were actually first off the mark, first to avail of the opportunity and, as a representative of Cork where we have over 1,100 houses, I wish we had been a little earlier as well.</P>
    <P>The capital allocated for remedial works in 1986 was £5 million.  It was anticipated that given reasonable progress by the authorities involved in tendering, carrying out necessary pilot schemes in some of the schemes and so on they would recoup the £5 million allocation this year.  Kindlestown Park accounts for the bulk of the expenditure to date because it is at an advanced stage having been the first scheme to get underway and having acted as the pilot scheme <Col N="1656" /> which led to the introduction of the remedial works scheme.</P>

      <P>They were the low cost schemes.  Expenditure this year will be in respect of those priority schemes where local authorities started work in 1985 and early 1986.</P>
      <P>The application for financial assistance in respect of New Line and Church Street pre-1940 estates in Cootehill was received in the Department last May, over a year after local authorities were formally notified of the terms of the remedial works scheme.  The works proposed include the replacement of defective rendering, dry-lining of external walls, roof repairs, repair of defective wiring and plumbing and the provision of bathrooms.  The application was incomplete and Cootehill Town Commissioners were requested immediately to submit additional information in regard to the houses requiring remedial works and the financial situation of the local authority. Following further correspondence a technical officer from my Department carried out an inspection in September and I hope to be in a position to make a decision on the proposal in the near future.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 5 December 1986.</P>

      <P>A basic feature of my Department's approach to training in the Civil Service is that courses should be provided at each level in the structure, both for new recruits and for promotees to these levels, at which officers are acquainted with the role, functions and responsibilities appropriate to their level. Responsibility for the provision of these courses to grades below higher executive officer level rests with Departments, each of which has a departmental training officer.  The courses which they provide vary in duration (from one-five days) depending on the level at which they are aimed and the particular needs of the area to which the officers are assigned. Departmental training officers also provide a range of other courses for staff with some experience in their grades covering such topics as communications skills, dealing with the public and information technology as well as meeting the specialist requirements of particular sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Management training for middle management grades up to assistant principal level have been held in the Civil Service Training Centre for almost ten years.  In the last few years, the centre has extended its courses to cover principals, assistant secretaries and secretaries and their professional and departmental equivalents. These management courses, which are residential and normally run <Col N="1479" /> for three-five days, cover such topics as staff management, managing for results and communications.  In addition, familiarisation courses in information technology have been provided for these grades and are being extended to all management grades.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the White Paper, <i>Serving the Country Better</i>, all officers promoted at management level &mdash; general administrative, departmental and professional/technical &mdash; are required to attend the appropriate course.</P>
    <P>The centre also organises a wide range of development courses for management grades which affords officers an opportunity to focus on specific areas of managerial skills or knowledge which are of particular interest to them.  Of course, officers at this level also attend courses in other training institutes, where appropriate.</P>

      <P>A total of £18,444,000 was outstanding from the United Nations as at 30 September 1986 in respect of participation by personnel of the Defence Forces in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) over the period from May 1978.  On the basis of present levels of reimbursement it is expected that £3,939,000 of the amount outstanding will be refunded by the United Nations leaving a shortfall in reimbursable entitlements for this period of £14,505,000.</P>
      <P>The question of securing repayment of full entitlements for troop costs, calculated in accordance with the rates laid down by the UN General Assembly, has been pursued vigorously and continuously with the United Nations through the Department of Foreign Affairs using all appropriate means at its disposal.  At successive sessions of the UN General Assembly serious concern has been expressed by Irish delegations regarding the withholding of assessed contributions to the UNIFIL account by certain UN member states, which gives rise to the shortfall in the first place. In addition, in conjunction with other countries contributing troops to UNIFIL and by enlisting the support of our EEC partners we have continued to exert pressure on those countries not contributing to the fund.  In a meeting with the UN Assistant Secretary General in New York in July last I impressed on him our serious concern in this matter.  Every possible effort will continue to be made to have the outstanding amount reimbursed by the United Nations.</P>

      <P>The public service reform programmes of this Government has been detailed in the White Paper <i>Serving the Country Better</i>.  A separate chapter dealt with the question of implementation and made it clear that the White Paper was &ldquo;a statement of decisions taken and a firm action plan&rdquo;.  These decisions are being implemented and the Government regularly review the progress being made.  The answer to Question 26 outlines the substantial progress already achieved.</P>
      <P>Some decisions require legal underpinning and the drafting of the necessary legislation is now at an advanced stage and is being pressed ahead as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation will propose some of the most significant changes in our public service system since the foundation of the State.  These changes are aimed at freeing up Ministers and Departments from purely routine work and enabling them to concentrate on important policy issues <Col N="1486" /> and better management and at ensuring better co-ordination across the whole public service in relation to personnel and organisation.</P>

      <P>The total cost to the health boards of the chiropdy service is estimated at approximately £0.75 million in 1986.  This service is provided by the health boards by way of grants to voluntary bodies such as the social service councils who provide a wide range of services.</P>
      <P>The service is also provided by chiropodists employed directly by the health boards.  It is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the precise amounts spent by voluntary bodies on this one service as many of their accounts do not distinguish this service from others.</P>
      <P>Of the £0.75 million it is estimated that with the exception of purchase of minor items of equipment by the health board all the funds are paid in fees or salaries to chiropodists.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that approximately 70 chiropodists received payment directly or indirectly from the health boards.</P>

      <P>When the group were established in 1983, they made an application for funding to the North Eastern Health Board.

      <P>Regulations provide that a late claim to unemployment benefit may be admitted retrospectively only if good cause for the delay is shown by the claimant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned did not claim unemployment benefit until 30 April 1985.  Her claim was admitted from that date, but she did not qualify for payment <Col N="1497" /> as she did not satisfy the contribution condition of having 26 contributions paid or credited at the appropriate rate during the contribution year 1983-1984 which governed her claim.  She did not appeal against this decision.</P>
    <P>She is currently signing the unemployed register and is being allowed a credited contribution in respect of each week of proved unemployment.  The conditions for the award of such contributions are the same as for payment of unemployment benefit &mdash; namely, that she must be capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work.  At no stage has she been disallowed as not being available for employment and the question of an appeal against such a decision does not, therefore, arise.</P>
    <P>She also applied to be allowed sign the unemployed register retrospectively.  She was not allowed to do so, however, as it was considered that she had not shown good cause for failing to claim unemployment benefit earlier than she did.</P>

      <P>The person concerned submitted a claim for old age contributory pension on 22 September 1986.  He reached old age contributory pension age of 66 on 7 October 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of an old age contributory pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires a person to have a yearly average of at least 20 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from the year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.  The Department's records show that the person concerned had a total of 361 reckonable contributions in the relevant period which, based on his entry into Irish insurance, is from January 1962 to 5 April 1986.  This is equal to a yearly <Col N="1499" /> average of only 15 which is not sufficient to qualify for an old age contributory pension under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    <P>Where a person has been employed in another EC country his insurance in that country may be combined with his Irish record.  He may then qualify for a <i>pro-rata</i> old age contributory pension if the combined total would suffice to give him the required yearly average of at least 20. The person concerned was employed in Great Britain and details of his British insurance record are awaited from the Department of Health and Social Security, Newcastle-upon-Tyne.  His entitlement to a <i>pro-rata</i> pension will be determined when those details are received.</P>

      <P>His spouse is currently in receipt of disability benefit and is no longer regarded as an adult dependant.  Consequently since 17 November 1986, he is entitled to payment of disability benefit at the maximum personal rate of £41.10, with an allowance in respect of three child dependants at half rate.</P>
      <P>A temporary payment of £10 per week is issued to the person concerned to compensate him for the loss of the adult dependant allowance.  This amount will be increased to £20 weekly with effect from 17 November 1986 and will continue for the duration of his claim or for 52 weeks, whichever is the lesser.</P>

However no increase was authorised because the form required to establish her status with regard to the new legislation was not received by the Department.

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 20 December 1983, and was paid at the weekly rate appropriate to a man with an adult and two child dependants.</P>
      <P>As a result of the EC Directive, on equality of treatment, the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act 1985 was passed, giving men and women the same entitlement when claiming social welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>The first phase was introduced in May 1986.  This provided that married women were entitled to the same personal rate as other claimants.  The second phase was implemented on 17 November 1986. From this date men and women have similar entitlement when claiming increases of benefit in respect of an adult and/or child dependants.</P>
      <P>In the case of the person concerned, this has meant that from 17 November 1986, he is no longer entitled to an increase of benefit in respect of his wife, as she is in receipt of disability benefit in her own right.  He is entitled to half the rate payable in respect of his two children.</P>
      <P>His weekly rate of benefit was, therefore, reduced to £51.05 per week, with effect from 17 November 1986.  However, in order to avoid hardship a special temporary payment of £10.00 per week, has also been issued.  A further payment of £10.00 per week will also be made shortly to the person concerned, under the further alleviating measure recently announced.</P>
      <P>The wife of the person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit at the weekly rate of £41.10 up to 15 November 1986.  From 17 November 1986, she has also been paid half the rate payable in respect of her two children.  This has increased her weekly rate of benefit to £51.05.</P>

There is a long delay in dealing with such applications in the Land Registry partly because of the usually complex legal issues involved and partly because of pressure of work generally.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will, of course, appreciate that it would not be possible to give favourable treatment to any particular application except at the expense of other applications.  I am informed however, that the Land Registry give priority to applications in respect of which it is brought to their attention that there are special grounds for urgency.  That, in fact, is the position in regard to this application.</P>

      <P>The position with regard to the building project at St. Vincent de Paul girls' national school, Dublin 9, is that I have authorised the school authorities to proceed with the work on the basis of a certain tender which is suitable and on the basis that grant aid will be available from my Department towards the cost of the project.  The precise amount of grant to be made available in individual cases by my Department is regarded as confidential information, which it is not my Department's practice to disclose.  The formal letter which is about to issue to the school authorities conveying the necessary authorisation is one of some detail, most of the contents being in standard terms having reference to the normal provisions of my Department's building grants scheme.  The grant will be paid, as is customary, by way of interim instalments as work progresses with the usual small retention at the conclusion of work pending final certification of satisfactory completion.  I understand the Deputy is concerned about conditions attached to the grant.  In this connection I should explain that the project at the special request of the school authorities includes a floor area of building significantly in excess of the area allowable for grant scheme purposes, and calls for non-standard external finishes and other special treatment.  Apart from the exclusion from grant aid of those features considered to be outside the scope of my Department's grants' scheme, the Deputy has my assurance that my Department will assist this building project in every way possible.</P>

      <P>The White Paper, <i>In Partnership with Youth,</i> which outlines a comprehensive national youth policy is being implemented on a phased basis.  As part of the policy, responsibility for youth affairs and appropriate staff were transferred from the Department of Labour to my Department earlier this year.  The pivotal structure for implementing the policy is the national youth service, involving the establishment of a nationwide framework of local youth service boards.  It is proposed to establish 15 <i>ad hoc</i> local youth service boards in 1986 with the remaining boards coming into operation in 1987.  Grants to youth organisations have been increased in 1986. These increased funds allow for the employment of additional youth workers and the expansion and development of programmes for young people. Additional funds have also been made available for increased inservice training of youth workers, for programme development and for the establishment of a youth exchange bureau as proposed in the policy.  The matter of outdoor pursuits centres, will be further pursued with the relevant authorities as part of the gradual implementation of the proposals in the White Paper <i>In Partnership with Youth,</i> subsequent to the establishment and coming into operation of the local youth service boards and in the light of resources available.</P>
