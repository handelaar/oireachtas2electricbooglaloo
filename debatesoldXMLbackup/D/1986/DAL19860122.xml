      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement on the progress made on the implementation of the agreement between the Irish Government and the Government of the United Kingdom regarding Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the matters raised in this question are the particular responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs as joint Chairman of the Inter-Governmental Conference.  I am on this occasion answering this question which has been addressed to me as this provides <Col N="2" /> a suitable opportunity to convey to the Dáil the parliamentary procedure it is intended to adopt in regard to matters relating to the Conference.</P>
      <P>In future, questions about the conference will be taken by the Irish Permanent Ministerial Representative at the Conference, Deputy Peter Barry, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Moreover, I wish to inform Deputies that it is intended that answers will be confined to details as contained in the joint statements issued after meetings of the Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the procedure for more extensive discussion by the Dáil of the Anglo-Irish agreement in general.  I have <Col N="3" /> been considering what that procedure should best be.  I shall be in contact with the Leader of the Opposition as soon as this consideration is completed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matter raised in the question itself, the agreement entered into force on 29 November 1985, following its approval by the Dáil and Seanad and by the British Parliament.  The agreement was registered with the United Nations by both Governments on 20 December.</P>
    <P>There have been two regular meetings and one special meeting of the Inter-Governmental Conference set up under Article 2 of the agreement.  The texts of the joint statements issued after the meetings have been placed before the House, for reference.</P>
    <P>The first meeting was held on 11 December.  At this meeting the Conference had a first discussion of how it should approach its future programme of work in all the fields &mdash; political, legal, economic, social and cultural &mdash; assigned to it under the agreement.  It also discussed the security questions mentioned in the joint statement issued after the meeting, including Border security and steps to improve relations between the security forces and the minority community in Northern Ireland.  It agreed to establish a working group of officials to consider the machinery for the further discussion of legal matters, including the administration of justice and noted the statements of international support for the agreement.</P>
    <P>A special meeting of the Conference was held on 30 December at which the Irish Permanent Ministerial Representative, Deputy Peter Barry, Minister for Foreign Affairs, put forward views and proposals designed to give substantial expression to the aim of ensuring confidence in the administration of justice.  The hunger strike which was then taking place in the Maze Prison but which ceased on 6 January was also discussed.  The meeting was held at our request.</P>
    <P>At the third meeting held on 10 January officials reported on ways in which the discussion of legal matters could best <Col N="4" /> be pursued.  The officials are to continue their discussions with a view to a meeting, before the next meeting of the Conference, of a sub-group of the Conference comprising the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General and, on the British side, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Attorney General.  The Irish side offered views on the British consultative paper published in 1985 on the Police Complaints Procedure.  We also put forward views and proposals on legislation relating to flags and emblems in Northern Ireland and on the position of the Irish language in Northern Ireland and the British side undertook to consider these views and proposals before decisions were taken.  The Chief Constable of the RUC and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána joined the meeting and the Conference was given details of continuing and enhanced arrangements for the policing of Border areas on both sides.  The Conference agreed to consider at its next meeting a progress report from the Commissioner and the Chief Constable on the programme of work referred to in Article 9 (1) of the agreement relating to cross-Border security co-operation.</P>
    <P>In general, I may say that the progress made has been in line with the initial steps envisaged in the Joint Communiqué and represents a satisfactory start in carrying out the agreement which, as Deputies know, has for its first objective the achievement of peace and stability in Northern Ireland, the reconciliation of the two major traditions in the island and the creation of a new climate of friendship and co-operation between the people of Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>The next meeting of the Conference will be held in February.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the unemployment figures published on 10 January 1986, he still stands over his statement made during the Adjournment Debate on 18 December last in relation to unemployment that the momentum has slowed dramatically and this promises well for the future; if he believes that the estimated levels given in <i>Building on Reality 1985-87</i> for unemployment are still achievable; if the Government intend to adjust these figures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As was made clear in the Government statement issued with the end December live register figures the sharp rise in unemployment at end year, though disappointing, was anticipated, especially in view of the fact that the figures relate to a week later than normal and are thus not directly comparable with other end year figures in recent years.</P>
      <P>The end December figures reflect the traditional rise in unemployment at end year due to AnCO courses ending, to schools being closed for Christmas holidays and to the seasonal run down in activity in many industries especially in building.</P>
      <P>The increase in unemployment for the year 1985 as a whole at 14,500 was below the corresponding 1984 outturn of 17,400.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the unemployment levels given in the national plan, <i>Building on Reality 1985-87</i>, the plan provided, over the period from April 1984 to April 1987, for a stabilisation in the level of unemployment reflecting an expansion in private sector employment augmented by the special schemes provided for in the plan. The performance of private sector <Col N="6" /> employment has not been as strong as had been hoped for.  The Government reviewed progress on the national plan last autumn, in this and other respects, and considered it appropriate to introduce policy adjustments to boost employment creation with a view to bringing the employment position closer into line with the plan expectations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying that the dramatic increase in unemployment in the month of December to a figure of 239,000, the highest ever in the history of the State, did not occur?  Can he explain what precisely he means in his reply by making excuses for the increase?  Is he denying that the increase occurred and, therefore, in his document <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> where he said that having increased from an estimated 290,000 in April 1984&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Government's document <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> is in the question.  I am asking the Taoiseach in the question if he believes that the estimated levels given in <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i>&mdash; we are halfway there now &mdash; for unemployment are still achievable.  The Taoiseach has not answered that because in the document <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair understood that Deputy Mac Giolla was reading from a document and if he was reading, that is a quotation and it is not in order at Question Time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Without reading from the document, let me say that in a document called <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i>, which I understand gives Government policy with regard to unemployment, the Government stated that they expected by the end of 1987 to have unemployment lower than 200,000.  I am asking the Taoiseach if he still feels that that is an achievable target or is it more <Col N="7" /> likely to be over 300,000 or perhaps 400,000 in 1987?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the Deputy is quite correct in suggesting that I denied that the suggested figures given are incorrect. On the contrary, I said that figures of the magnitude mentioned for the end of the year, which should be for the beginning of this year, were anticipated and the exceptional increases anticipated were due to the fact that the figures related to a week later.  The Deputy will understand that owing to the peculiarities of the 365 day calendar, each year a given day of the week slips back a day until you reach the point where you have to move forward.</P>

      <P>This is the year to move forward and the week was moved forward. In any year coming into early January the level of unemployment tends to be exceptionally high.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me ask the Minister for the Environment if he will check to see if the Taoiseach has his two shoes on today because he is in that sort of mood again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would add that, while a clearer view of underlying employment and unemployment trends will emerge only in the months ahead, the official view for end January is that there will be no increase in the seasonally adjusted total on the live register, an outturn that would contrast with an increase of 4,000 in January 1985 and essentially reflect the fact that the end December figures related this year to the first week in January, as I have already pointed out.  If this official view proves correct, the rate of annual increase will now be down to 10,000 for the first time since mid-1980 when Deputy Haughey had the honour of leading the Government of this country, and would be only a quarter of the annual <Col N="8" /> rise in unemployment when Fianna Fáil were rejected by the people in November 1982.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Taoiseach's reply, and particularly from his latter remarks, that he believes that the target figure in the document <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> is unachievable.  In the latter portion of my question I asked if the Taoiseach intends now to adjust the <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> figures, on which the Government's projections, targets, budgets and so on are based, to a more realistic level of unemployment for 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The achievement of the original target would be very difficult in view of the fact that the level of unemployment is now higher at this point than was anticipated when the plan was produced, for the reasons I have given, the slowness of growth or recovery in the private sector.  That has been taken account of fully in the Government's estimates of unemployment on which the Estimates of expenditure are based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that practically all the targets set out in this document <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> have had to be abandoned and in particular that the existing levels of unemployment bear no relation whatever to the targets set in the document and that the Government clearly are planning for a current budget deficit which will be somewhere in the region of £200 million more than the current budget deficit set in the document, will the Taoiseach now in honesty withdraw this worthless, discredited document and give us some new approach by the Government to economic and financial planning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the Government's intention to follow the actions of the Government of which the Deputy was a member 20 years ago when <Col N="9" /> they scuttled from the second programme because of a temporary&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;twenty years ago &mdash; because of a temporary shortfall in their targets and so took fright that they abandoned the second programme prematurely and produced a phoney third programme.  This is not the way this Government tend to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach for heaven's sake bear in mind that the young people today are not all that interested in what happened 20 years ago, no matter what version he choses to give of those times?  They are interested in the situation today which is that, as everybody knows, unemployment is at least 240,000 and probably nearer 300,000 and that the Government's targets for the current budget deficit are not going to be realised. In these circumstances, as we are dealing with matters today and as he is Taoiseach today and responsible for the economy today, will he tell us what exactly the Government's plan is for the economy both in the budgetary situation and in regard to unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will continue to adopt the budgetary policies designed to achieve as far as is practicable a halt and reversal in the increase in unemployment and the recovery of growth in our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated today that these catastrophic unemployment figures of 240,000 were anticipated. That word was used also in the statement which the Government put out at the time when these appalling figures were disclosed to us.  How can the Taoiseach reconcile the use of that word and his statement that these figures were anticipated with the fact that right through last year and even up to the Adjournment Debate that took place before this House went into Christmas recess he kept on telling us that the economy was improving, that the unemployment situation was <Col N="10" /> improving and that &mdash; one ridiculous thing he said &mdash; we were the healthiest economy in Europe?  Leaving that aside, he kept assuring this House that the situation with regard to employment and unemployment was improving as late as the Adjournment Debate here immediately before Christmas.  Now he tells us that these catastrophic figures were anticipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the House and the Deputy that the exceptional increase in these figures was anticipated because owing to the shift in the date the week to which they were related&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The additional week this year would lead to a higher figure than normal in December because unemployment if it were plotted weekly rather than monthly would be found to rise very rapidly in the post-Christmas period into early January.  Last year when the date was earlier the increase was not as great in December but there was a considerable increase in January.  I tell the Deputy that the best official estimates are that the big increase in January that took place last year is unlikely this year because it has taken place already in these figures because of the shift in the week.  I think the Deputy is capable of understanding that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking for a final supplementary because it is important to get the philosophy behind the Government in regard to unemployment. Does the Taoiseach still believe or agree with the philosophy enunciated by more than one of his Ministers over the past couple of years that it is not the function of a Government to create jobs or employment?  Does the Taoiseach or his Government believe that still?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the function of a Government to create jobs in the sense of creating jobs where there is not work to be done of a productive character. That would create a continuing burden on the economy and lead to a situation where it would be impossible for those productive sectors of the economy, be they public or private, to expand activity and employment successfully.</P>

    <P>Funding through the Arts Council represents of course the principal channel of aid to the arts.  I have recently had a constructive meeting with the chairman and members of the Arts Council and am at present considering proposals made by them relating to several projects which they believe they would have difficulty in funding from their current grant for 1986 and I have agreed with them to discuss with the Minister for Labour the possibility of closer liaison with that Department in respect of approval of teamwork and SES grants involving the arts.</P>
    <P>Additional aid is, however, provided for the arts in other ways, some of which have recently become significant.  Thus, capital grants totalling £900,000 are currently being provided to arts projects out of the funds of suitors including £300,000 to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and £100,000 to the Royal Academy of Music for the renovation of their premises in Westland Row, and a further £100,000 through the Arts Council in respect of the Irish National Ballet project at the Firkin Crane.  In addition, £120,000 was provided by the Exchequer last year in connection with European Music Year.</P>

The latest report on developments between the Mercy Hospital and the North Infirmary has just been issued and I have no doubt that its proposals will be to the benefit of all people living in Cork city, particularly those living in the Deputy's constituency.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge that the merging of the South Infirmary with the Victoria Hospital does not present any great difficulty in that all that is required is the provision of an entrance in the boundary wall between the two hospitals, but I should like an assurance from the Minister that the proposal to merge or integrate the Mercy Hospital with the North Infirmary, because of the location of those hospitals, is a practical proposition. Will the Minister agree that that proposal is not a practical realisation of <Col N="22" /> the intentions, some of which are pious, and that the physical location of the hospitals may mean that there will be a danger of a diminution of services and facilities provided by the North Infirmary for the people on the north side of the River Lee?</P>

      <P>When a person is sick in Cork city the location of the hospital is of secondary importance; it is the health of the person that matters most.  Whether people receive attention on one side of the River Lee or the other is irrelevant. I should like to assure the Deputy that the people on the north side of the city will have outstanding services.  The work of bringing together the voluntary hospitals and the specialities is almost complete and the people in the areas involved will receive a much better service in future.  The report is under consideration but I am not in a position to disclose its details because I must meet the boards and local public representatives before I make a decision.</P>

      <P>I have just received the report and it is being considered.  I gather it is being considered by the boards of management of the two hospitals.  I will be seeking the views of the North Infirmary and the Mercy Hospital in regard to the proposals but I should like to assure the Deputy that any resources required in 1986 to complete the development of the hospital services in Cork city will be made available, particularly on the capital side.  I have a substantial capital programme for 1986 and money will be made available unstintingly because this development is essential.</P>

Will the Minister assure us that the accident and emergency activities will not be hampered in any way?  Will the Minister make capital provision for the accident and emergency services without any more doubtful thinking by the Department?  I want that important matter clarified by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal of difference in definition as to what is meant by accident and emergency services in a hospital.  The North Infirmary provides a service in regard to casualties and accepts accidents and emergencies of a particular kind.  The definition of future accident, emergency and casualty work is contained in the report.  I do not propose to go into detail about that at this stage but I must say that the two hospitals will provide substantial cover.  I have no doubt that the people of the area will be well served.  Deputies will be aware that the Cork Regional Hospital provides the acute accident emergency services for the city as a whole.</P>

Despite these difficulties, I have taken every opportunity to assist the agencies involved in the provision and maintenance of these places.  I was able, for example, to assist St. Michael's House at the end of 1984 through the allocation of an additional £150,000 to alleviate the burden of commitments entered into by the association without my prior approval.

Has the Minister had meetings during the past three months with St. Michael's in regard to adults who badly need places and training centres when they leave the children's section of St. Michael's?  There has been a problem in this regard over the last nine months and parents of children leaving St. Michael's have been unable to get any guarantee that places will be available for them in adult training centres, despite the fact that St. Michael's are prepared to take them on.

The problem with the centre in Belcamp is symptomatic of the problems in regard to adult places in residential units on the north side also.

When the allocation levels in respect of each health board are settled for 1986 I shall be instructing the boards to ensure that in their distribution of these resources they at least maintain the present level of availability of community-based services.  In addition, the pattern of development of services, for example in relation to psychiatric care, reflects the importance of community care and this is a trend which will be continued in 1986. Finally, I am continuing in 1986 the provision of a special fund to finance the development of new initiatives in respect of vulnerable groups in the community.</P>

Of that money, last year we spent close on £1 million on measles eradication, which has been outstandingly successful&mdash;the latest figures show a take up of about 80 per cent.  I want to thank the medical and nursing professions and the health boards for the work they have done in this area.  We will not need to spend that £1 million this year and this money will be spent in other community and preventive health care areas.  I intend to take a number of initiatives in that area.  The budget position will be tight but it will enable us to continue with the existing levels of community care, and in some areas there will be some expansion.</P>

      <P>The issuing of the <Col N="32" /> notices and the letters of allocations to the agencies has taken time because, of necessity, a number of policy questions arise every year.

      <P>The number of non-consultant hospital doctors throughout the country would appear to indicate that there are disparities in the distribution of medical manpower between Dublin and the rest of the country.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take both questions together.  As the House will appreciate, an inquest will be held into the tragic incident and I am, therefore, somewhat inhibited in what I can say lest I appear to be pre-empting the findings of the inquest.  I can say, however, that the prisoner, when checked at about 6.10 a.m., appeared to be sleeping and that at about 6.50 a.m. he was found hanging.  I am satisfied that, contrary to reports, the prisoner was identified by the prison medical staff as an abuser of heroin and that medication appropriate to helping the prisoner cope with the physical effects of withdrawal from heroin was prescribed.</P>
      <P>On the general issues raised by the Deputies, I would, first of all, refer them to my replies to Questions Nos. 7, 17, 27, 30 and 33 of 27 November 1985, Official Report, columns 317-326, where I dealt at length with the problems posed for the prisons by those committed to prison with drug addiction problems.  I also dealt with the question of treatment facilities in reply to Question No. 37 of 23 October, Official Report, columns 38-40.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity given by those questions to advise the House of developments within the prisons since the recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated on 27 November, the predicted and inevitable surfacing of prisoners who had been found to be HTLV <Col N="37" /> III positive, that is, to have been in contact with the AIDS virus, had occurred and that steps were being taken to deal with the matter.  As I said then, I hoped to make a joint statement with the Minister for Health regarding the best use to which an almost completed unit at the Central Mental Hospital could be put in order to assist the prison system in coping with the medical-related problems of prisoners.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, in a statement on my own behalf and on behalf of the Minister for Health, I indicated that the unit when completed in about two months time will be transferred to the prison service.  I am grateful for the co-operation of the Minister for Health in this matter.</P>
    <P>Since I spoke on 27 November, an official party, including representatives of the Prison Officers' Association, visited Great Britain to see at first hand what steps were being taken to deal with prisoners found to be HTLV III positive. Following consideration of the report of that visit and further consultation with the Prison Officers' Association, it was decided in the best interests of both staff and prisoners to confine prisoners diagnosed as antibody positive in one wing of Arbour Hill prison.  Guidelines for dealing with these prisoners were issued to staff following consultations with the Prison Officers' Association.  In addition, staff have received advice from medical officers on how to deal wth these prisoners. The Prison Officers' Association have expressed themselves as satisfied with these arrangements.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware from media reports, there are now around 50 prisoners, both male and female, who have been found positive and these are now segregated from other prisoners.  I should like to emphasise that no prisoner has been diagnosed as suffering from AIDS but the number I have mentioned have been proven to have been in contact with the virus.  The advice available to me is that only a very small percentage of these prisoners, if any at all, will go on to develop any symptoms of AIDS itself.  In common with the health clinics in the community dealing with people who are <Col N="38" /> antibody positive, the medical authorities in the prisons will monitor the condition of prisoners who are antibody positive.</P>
    <P>As the House will also be aware, I have announced that the Government have agreed to the appointment of a Director of Medical Services for the Prison Service, as recommended by the Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System, in advance of consideration of other recommendations made by the committee in order to assist the prison service in coping with the problems it faces in the health area.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from what I have said already that steps have been taken to deal with these problems and that further steps are planned.  I should like to emphasise, however, that because of the limited ways in which this virus can be transmitted, there is no risk of an outbreak of AIDS or anything of that kind in the prisons once the proper precautions are taken.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute to prison staff and to the Prison Officers' Association for the manner in which they have approached this issue&mdash;in marked contrast to the approach of others who do not have responsibility in this matter.</P>
    <P>In Mountjoy there are 140 prisoners regarded by the medical officers as drug addicts and of whom 14 are female.  On the question of the level of drug abuse in Mountjoy prison I am satisfied that exaggerated claims are sometimes made on this topic by released prisoners, contradicted just as frequently by other released prisoners though the contradictions do not receive the same media attention as the original claims.  As I indicated on 27 November, cameras are being installed in the visiting rooms at Mountjoy in an effort to prevent drugs being passed to prisoners during visits.  The contract for this work has been awarded and work will be completed as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that a catalogue of four deaths in as many months must be regarded as a failure on his part, as political head of the Department, to plan ahead for the increased incidence of drug <Col N="39" /> addiction in our prison system?  Can he indicate the reason for the difference in the statement he made regarding the time at which the prisoner, Paul Kenna, was checked and found alive and the statement he has made now?  This is a significant point and I expect the Minister to refer to it.  Also, can he clarify whether the drugs prescribed for Paul Kenna were administered to him and whether there is any indication that these drugs were taken by the prisoner?  I should like to here also from the Minister as to what treatment, if any, apart from detoxification, is given to the 140 prisoners in Mountjoy who are known to be drug addicts.  Are there facilities in Mountjoy for any treatment other than detoxification?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I reject the first part of the Deputy's contribution. I understand that the medication prescribed for the prisoner in question was taken.  I do not accept the argument that the prison system cannot cope with the number of drug addicts now within the system.  The position is that a number of people are being committed to prison following sentences for drug related offences.  There are others who are sentenced for criminal offences but who are drug addicts.  This is as a result of the crackdown on crime in the city.  There are a great number of drug addicts in the prisons but they are being treated and are being detoxified.  If any of these prisoners is of a non-violent nature I would be prepared to sign a release programme to have him sent to the Coolmine Centre or to Jervis Street Hospital but violent prisoners must be kept within the prison system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that if he cannot control drugs in the prisons there is little chance for control in this area on the streets?  There have been four deaths in our prisons in the past four months.  Three of these were definitely drug related, but yet the Minister is not prepared to admit that there is a problem.  As far back as 7 July 1983 <Col N="40" /> there have been questions in the House concerning the difficulties in Mountjoy in respect of drugs.  It is as a result of the Minister refusing to recognise the problem that we have now arrived at this worsening position.  The Minister is now in his fourth year as Minister for Justice. Will he agree that because of a total lack of planning we are now at this stage in regard to the problem?  The Minister has been grossly incompetent in his administration of the prisons.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is very difficult to be certain of what is the motification for any death in prison, but of the three deaths that had an association with drug taking there is far more evidence to suggest that they were as a result of the lack of illegal drugs in prison rather than the availability in prison of illegal drugs, that is, if the question of drugs was a motivating factor.</P>
      <P>Regarding my competence and the competence of the prison system to deal with the problem, if Deputy Woods had done anything when he was Minister for Health my problems would not have been so great.  At that time there was clear evidence that there was a drug problem in Dublin but blind eyes were turned so far as that matter was concerned.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It was not until late 1982 that any action was taken to deal with the drug problem. If one is effective in dealing with drug problems in society, it is inevitable that there will be an increase in the number of addicts in the prison system; but these people are addicted before they go to prison.  They are not becoming addicted while inside.  I maintain also that it is impossible for me to give a guarantee that in a place like Mountjoy prison, where there are 420 or 430 inmates, no illegal drug will be taken.  It would be impossible to institute that kind of regime.  It would involve withdrawing the privileges of the vast majority of prisoners who have no association with drugs.  It would mean cutting out visiting completely.  There is no problem in terms of drugs from outside being taken into Mountjoy prison.  All the evidence would suggest that there is very little drug abuse in the prison, despite the fact that in the prison there is a large body of drug addicts as a result of the activities of the Garda and the courts.  I am saying that we treat these prisoners medically to detoxify them and that, if they are suitable, we will do everything in our power to allow them avail of the appropriate programme so as to enable them to break their habit of addiction.  However, it is difficult for an addict in a private clinic, even one who is highly motivated and who has the support of family and friends, to break an addiction habit.  The task would be very difficult within the prison system.</P>

Can he indicate also why, despite the defence solicitor in the case of Paul Kenna indicating to the court that he considered that prisoner to be in need of psychological assessment, that observation was not noted and was not conveyed to the prison authorities?  I should like to hear from the Minister, too, as to whether he stands over a statement from some spokesperson for his <Col N="42" /> Department to the effect that it was not the responsibility of the prison service to pursue that matter, that it is a matter for the defence to arrange for psychological assessment of prisoners who are considered to be in need of such assessment.</P>

      <P>Regarding a request by a solicitor that this young man should be medically examined, I have already said that he was medically examined and was on medication prescribed by the medical staff in Mountjoy.

      <P>I am trying to address two questions to him and I should appreciate a specific reply.  The Minister has indicated that where the prison authorities consider addicts or those who require treatment are suitable they will be referred to Jervis Street.  Could he indicate what is done with those prisoners who are not regarded as suitable and what treatment is available inside prison other than detoxification?  If a defence lawyer indicates that a psychological assessment of a particular defendant is required, is it the case that the Department and the prison authorities accept no responsibility?  Does he not accept that if such a request had been noted the prison authorities would have taken a different approach to Paul Kenna when he was admitted to prison some days ago and that it is quite possible he might not now be dead?</P>

If any defence lawyer wants somebody to be medically examined in prison other than in the normal medical examination when a person is admitted, then the responsibility is on the lawyer to make that formal request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress before the extended Christmas recess I had been expressing &mdash; in line with the comments of my colleagues on this side of the House &mdash; my concern that administrative regulations of this nature being introduced here as a consequence of EC directives should be examined very carefully, at considerable length, before we felt obliged to pass them into our domestic law.  This is essential for a number of reasons.  First, the application of the directive we are now being asked to pass into law, as yet has not been passed into law in all of the member states of the EC.  There is no reason that we, who are especially vulnerable to the application of directives such as this, should be seen to pass legislation of this nature in a hasty manner without examining all of its implications at every stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might recapitulate briefly on a few points.  First, more than any other member state we have branches, as they are called, of foreign companies operating in a major way in our industrial programme.  These branches, as such, are not liable to disclosure under the Fourth Directive because in many cases the parent companies are based outside the EC, be they in the United States, Japan or elsewhere.  They are not liable to disclosure but our indigenous industry is <Col N="260" /> liable.  One can see immediately the disadvantage we would impose on our domestic industry which, God knows, at this time is suffering from the sufficiently crippling burdens imposed by the actions or failures of this Government.  We want to ensure that our indigenous industry, our corporations, are not placed at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> the others operating in our economy who obviously have different corporate structures from ours. That is the first point that needs to be stressed.</P>
    <P>The second point to be stressed is that we operate under a protocol since we signed the Treaty of Accession to the EC. As people are now becoming increasingly aware, it is fairly clear that the general policy and actions of the European Community, particularly in the sphere of employment in manufacturing or corporate enterprise, have been entirely inadequate. The level of unemployment in manufacturing industry or in corporate enterprise in EC countries is very much higher than that which obtains in the nonEC countries of Europe.  One might say they are a mixed bag in terms of their economic structures and prosperity, ranging from Austria to Finland, to Sweden, to Norway, to Switzerland. Over the last three or four years the level of economic activity of manufacturing growth has been higher outside the Community than it has been consistently within the European Community.  Therefore is it not time that the application of restrictive regulations like this one should be considered in great detail as to their further negative or damaging impact on what is already a very weak industrial sector throughout the European Community and particularly so in our case? We hear these days about reconsideration being given to these matters in Denmark. Whether Denmark reconsiders the fundamental issue of their membership of the European Community one thing is eminently clear, that is that the parliamentary committee to review the impact of EC directives, regulations and statutory provisions established in Denmark have power and authority far in excess of anything enjoyed even by this Dáil in <Col N="261" /> respect of secondary legislation of the EC.  I have witnessed personally major decisions of the Council being delayed because that parliamentary committee, which has a special function in Denmark &mdash; and this is not said in any critical sense of their role &mdash; have not been satisfied that the impact of the various directives and regulations would be other than damaging to the Danish economy. Hence, viewing their interests as they see them, they have, I think properly, delayed for months, even years on end, the application of directives that would have a major impact on their economy.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the Minister had expected that we would pass all Stages of this Bill before the Christmas recess.  Our spokesman, Deputy Flynn, argued persuasively and at length that this was a matter that should involve the most detailed analysis on Committee Stage as well.  It is self-evident that not merely the national interest but the proper and consistent application of regulations throughout the EC would demand that we would hasten slowly in this matter.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other matters one is entitled to suggest on Second Stage should be the subject of considerable analysis in the course of Committee Stage debate.  One is that the corporate structures throughout the European Community vary from place to place.  There are concepts of partnership in the Federal Republic of Germany that do not exist here.  Likewise there are corporate structures of law in France and Italy that do not exist here.  Clearly, some of these corporate or partnership structures are not covered by the application of the Fourth Directive.  Therefore, we may find ourselves in a disadvantaged situation because member states have tailored special corporate or partnership structures to ensure that the impact of this directive will not bite their corporate activities in a damaging way.  That been said, then at least we need to draw breath, to seek advice and examine what structures we might propose as appropriate to our economy which would ensure that we too would be able to claim certain privileges or derogations, not because we <Col N="262" /> asked for them but because the structures for which we are arguing are not covered by the directive.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has had any experience of the application of European law and directives will know that countries of great sophistication in terms of diplomacy and of administrative arrangement &mdash; France is perhaps the best example of this &mdash; are very adapt indeed, very sophisticated at ensuring that the manner in which EC regulations or Council decisions apply in their case is minimised in terms of damage and maximised in terms of advantage.  They never see it necessary to plead a special case for themselves &mdash; they are too sophisticated for that &mdash; but they always manage to achieve, whether at Council level or otherwise, that the structures they have and the interpretations they put on European regulations or Council decisions, while apparently &mdash; one must say <i>prima facie</i>&mdash; consistent with treaties and regulations, are applied in a manner that lessens the burden &mdash; if burden it is &mdash; of these decisions.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that this Government have begun to research the possibilities of proposing corporate structures here that would not be influenced directly by this directive.  The Minister who is responsible, and who is now being deputised for in the House, after all has been promising us for a considerable time amended company law legislation on matters of such importance as limited liability, and while we are waiting for that legislation &mdash; which, of course, will be directly affected by decisions such as this &mdash; is it not about time that we co-ordinated our actions?  If we allow this to go through right now we are introducing regulations which apply to the existing corporate structure in this country, but we are told that we are about to change that.  We have been told for about the last three years that we are about to change it. Deputy Cluskey, who was in the House up to a few moments ago, told us over a few years ago that he had proposals ready for Government in that area.  Is it not reasonable that we could not only argue but succeed in the argument at EC level that in so far as we are engaging right <Col N="263" /> now in a major overhaul of our whole company law provisions and regulations, we should not in the middle of that rearrangement and reform &mdash; it is a matter of most urgent reform &mdash; be forced to apply provisions of this nature which may impact in a different way on structures which now do not even exist?</P>
    <P>These are fundamental issues.  I am not making it a case of special pleading &mdash; we do not do so on this side of the House &mdash; in terms of a begging bowl plea to our colleagues in the EC, but not all of our colleague states in the EC have put this directive into effect, and some of them were members before we were. Secondly, the impact of it on this economy could be much more damaging than elsewhere.  After all, we have, as I mentioned, a special protocol which means either what it says or otherwise should be treated as mere words.  It says that the EC and the institutions of that Community in all of their decisions will do all they can in support of the national policies of development of this State.  All Governments, irrespective, would place industrial and corporate development at the centre of their intentions at least if not at the centre of their actions.  That is central to the national economic priorities of this State; still we are not even prepared to argue the impact of that protocol on the Council of Ministers in connection with the application of this directive.</P>
    <P>That said, I think there is common cause here that the Minister on the face of it seemed to avail of a number of &mdash; not derogations &mdash; escape routes in the legislation which he proposes.  I acknowledge that, and also that the legislation has not been brought before the House in any hasty way.  I am anxious to ensure that, it having been brought in here, we have time to consider it in detail here. That is the worry I have.  It might have been brought in here three or six months ago and it was not.  Now that it is here it should not be just swept out of the House before all of the issues that our spokesman, Deputy Flynn, and many others raised in greater detail than I, have been <Col N="264" /> not only discussed but answered in great detail.  The decisions we take here can have a major effect on the economic climate, particularly for corporate enterprises which are already under major attack.</P>
    <P>That is the extent of the contribution I wish to make at this point.  I hope it will be possible to go into all these matters in much greater detail on Committee Stage and that we shall have an opportunity to ensure that what is passed by us as being in the interests of the Irish people will not have the contrary effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank all the Deputies who contributed to Second Stage of this debate for the high level of their contributions which obviously reflected a great deal of research.  There were many questions asked and I should like to deal with as many as possible individually.  I shall start by dealing with some more general points made in the debate.</P>
      <P>First, I must repeat that in very many of the provisions of the Bill I have no latitude to make changes, since they are requirements laid down by EC directives. For example, a number of Deputies queried the use of the words &ldquo;seriously prejudicial&rdquo; in the context of companies getting exemption from disclosing certain sensitive information if this information were &ldquo;seriously prejudicial&rdquo;.  I must say that I also share the concern about the precise meaning of these words, but they are the words laid down by Article 45 of the directive which covers the exemptions in question.  Those are the words that we have to use and apply.</P>
      <P>Deputy Avril Doyle asked who would decide what is seriously prejudicial to a company.  This is a decision which would be left up to the directors since they are the people legally responsible under the law for the management of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flynn raised questions about the appropriateness of this Bill to Irish circumstances, as did Deputy McCreevy, and both Deputies commented on the way in which we handle our national position when confronted with new draft <Col N="265" /> directives which ultimately become directives which have to be incorporated in Bills such as this.  Deputy Flynn even went so far as to say that we might be better off if we did not have to implement this directive at all.  We do have to implement it.  That is the law of the Community of which we are a member and we have run out of time.  So far as deferring implementing it is concerned, we are confronted with a case against us in the Court of Justice for non-implementation.</P>
    <P>Deputies must bear this in mind, and we cannot take succour from the alleged deficiencies of other member states in their lateness in implementing the directive or, to use Deputy Flynn's remark, the dubious manner in which they were doing so.  Indeed, I am not too certain of what is dubious about parts of other countries' legislation and what particularly the Deputy had in mind.  However, that is a matter not for me but for the EC to follow up.</P>
    <P>As for safeguarding our national position in discussions on directives, I believe this was effectively done in the preparation of this directive.  We should remember that the negotiations on the directive covered five years between 1973 and 1978 under both Coalition and Fianna Fáil administrations.  Indeed, members of the new party would also have been involved at some stage, so all the parties have been involved.</P>
    <P>I believe there was a clear conception of where the national interest lay in deciding on the final form of this directive. Deputy Flynn rightly pointed out that we were already committed to a Fourth Directive type position because the First Directive on Company Law foreshadowed the publication of accounts by all limited companies.  What we negotiated in the Fourth Directive was the relaxation for small and medium sized companies.</P>
    <P>Various Deputies on the other side of the House referred to the exemption Germany had secured for a particular class of company known as GMBH &amp; Co. K.G.  I shall not attempt to give the German words represented by each of those initials but the nearest equivalent under our law is a limited partnership. <Col N="266" /> We are not including these entities in our Bill.  Deputies O'Kennedy and Flynn referred to the exclusion of branches of foreign companies from the Bill.  Deputy Flynn wants them excluded so that foreign investment here is not jeopardised. Deputy O'Kennedy, on the other hand, complains that they are excluded while Irish firms are covered.  I think that it would be wise for Members opposite, at least before Committee Stage, to agree their position on that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  Several Deputies asked how will the Bill be policed. Some also felt that the maximum fine of £1,000 for offences would not hurt companies, particularly large ones.  Let me be clear on this.  Section 22 of the Bill provides for further fines of up to £2,500 on conviction on indictment and a jail term of up to three years.  Offences by officers of the company are also punishable.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, if a company persist in defaulting in the form of failure to send in their annual accounts to the registrar, the registrar has enhanced powers under recent company legislation to strike the company off the register, and the company are thus wound up.  As for policing, this will be done by the registrar.  Certain offences in the Bill can also be prosecuted by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The reference in my speech to the registrar not being a company invigilator &mdash; a good word, that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;was intended to point out that the position, quite rightly, is that the registrar simply acts as a depository for public documents.  He is not expected to scrutinise and stand over what companies maintain is the position in relation to their affairs.  To involve the registrar in such a scheme of company supervision would not be feasible for the 70,000 companies on the register and it could have severe implications for the liability of the registrar and the State in such matters.  The real reason, of course, is that we could not afford to staff the office much more generously than we are doing at present and at a much higher level which would be necessary if we were to take on that role of invigilation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not really, but people who are worried will have at least a basis for asking questions of the company themselves in the information that is published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be liabilities attaching to these people in the event that that information proves to be incorrect. In the case of the further legislation which I have in preparation, the legislation in regard to abuse, there will be enhanced penalties, both civil and criminal, for people who put false information into accounts.  Without becoming involved in a heavy police state to deal with company accounts, there will be plenty <Col N="268" /> of penalties in place within the next year or so to deal with people who do not give correct information and thereby create situations in which others are at a loss. As for laxity in the filing of annual returns, the Government are determined to rectify this situation.  Resources are and will be allocated to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>In my opening speech I referred to computerisation in the Companies Office.  This is a comprehensive and thorough-going programme to bring the Companies Office documentation up to date and to rationalise and speed up the way in which that information can be made available most effectively to the public who use the office.</P>
      <P>The main tasks facing the Companies Office in the computerisation programme are the provision of data to the public from the computer system, the removal of all defunct companies from the register and the bringing of all companies up to date in the filing of their annual returns. The registrar is at present pursuing all companies who are not up to date in filing.</P>
      <P>Reference was made in the debate to the position in relation to co-operative societies and agricultural marts and the need to include such entities in this Bill, particularly in view of the size of the turnover, and the assets at the disposal of some of the larger co-operatives in this country.  I must say I do not disagree with the general thrust of the remarks made by various Deputies.  However, co-operative societies are societies formed under industrial and provident society law, not company law, and we cannot cater for them in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Flynn, Yates and Skelly commented with some vigour about section 23 of the Bill, expressing reservations on the powers contained therein.  Section 23 allows the Minister to amend the requirements of the Bill in so far as the contents of the balance sheet and the profit and loss account, and the notes to those accounts, are concerned.  I can assure Deputies that there is nothing untoward or sinister in this provision.  The powers in section 23 parallel, and indeed are on <Col N="269" /> all-fours with, in other words are the same as, similar powers given to the Minister by section 395 of the 1963 Act. Those powers have been there for more than 20 years without any great disaster befalling the business of the country.</P>
    <P>All that is involved in section 23 is a reformulation of this existing provision to allow the Minister to alter the matters contained essentially in the schedule to this Bill, in the same way as he can do exactly in relation to the Sixth Schedule of the 1963 Act.  There is absolutely no question of what may have been in Deputy Flynn's mind, which was the motive of the clawing back through statutory orders of what the Dáil here decides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly satisfied that you would not do that.  I mean that as a compliment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I could return the compliment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I would not be satisfied with everybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have a look at the matter between now and Committee Stage.  Presumably we shall be debating it then.  The only way I can see any room for amending it would be to still leave relative freedom but possibly circumscribe in general terms what should be the sense of the changes, that they would only be within certain broad objectives. I am not so sure that that is necessary but I shall look into it if Deputy Flynn is still concerned about it.  We can discuss it again on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned the proposed commencement date.  Some asked for confirmation if prior year figures have to be given from the start. Yes, they have.  The directive requires this.  Deputy Flynn asked that the 18 month transitional period in the directive should be used.  This transitional period refers to the period between July 1980, when the Bill should have been translated into national law, and February 1982, the date on which the Bill should have been <Col N="270" /> in operation.  We cannot use this transitional period because it has now expired.</P>
    <P>As for the implementation date I have in mind that it would apply to financial years beginning on or after the relevant date.  The first of July 1986, was suggested to me by the accountancy bodies &mdash; on the supposition that the Bill would be passed in December 1985.  I have to take it that the accountancy bodies are the people who will know in detail exactly what period is reasonable for companies to comply with the new legislation.  I think 1 January 1987 might be too far ahead. While the Bill introduces many new provisions for a lot of companies, it cannot be said that companies were not on notice of this for some considerable time.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years officials in the Department have been asked by many accountancy firms when the Bill would be implemented, and what should they do as regards accounts of companies now under consideration.  The advice given generally was that they should make plans now for the Bill and start getting companies to institute systems to allow them to collect and collate the material they would ultimately be required to present when the Fourth Directive came into force.  I cannot say now when the Act will come into operation.  I would like to allow six months from the date on which the Bill will become law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to argue that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are acting within constraints because of the law and the measures being taken to enforce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It will cause hardship for some companies who would not be as well geared as larger ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have difficulty in responding to some of the difficulties referred to by the Deputy earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flynn expressed some concern about the provisions of section 17 of the Bill which provides that the Minister may exempt the subsidiaries of parent companies in the EC under certain stringent conditions.  I am happy that this is a <Col N="271" /> worthwhile power.  I do not see that this particular provision is a &ldquo;cop-out&rdquo; facility for subsidiaries of multinationals in this country.  The parent of the subsidiary must guarantee the liabilities of the subsidiary.  I think some people dealing with a company, including those working for a company, would recognise the benefit of such a guarantee.</P>
    <P>I take the point that Deputy Flynn made concerning the Minister's role in granting exemptions.  I also note the points he has made concerning the nature and form of the guarantee.  I intend to put down amendments on Committee Stage which I am confident will meet the Deputy's points.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn also made two further interesting points concerning the operation of the Bill.  The first of these concerned the use of what is known as an accounting reference date.  This would mean that each company would specify what year-end they were using and notify the Companies Office to that effect.  The Companies Office would then know when to expect the particular year's accounts.</P>
    <P>This sounds very good in theory, and indeed the United Kingdom moved to such a system in 1976.  However, it means that the filing of accounts becomes separated from the filing of the annual returns.  If I understand it correctly, the UK are now having some reservations about having separated the two filing systems in the first place.</P>
    <P>I see no great difficulties for maintaining the current requirement of filing all documents together in one go with the annual return, and I do not see that the problems in the Companies Office will be insuperable.  Indeed it is precisely for the reason of reducing the amount of paper flying around that we have instigated the special auditor's report mentioned in section 18 of the Bill.  The registrar will simply have to see that report to be satisfied that the information being filed is what it is supposed to be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn also suggested that since we are now imposing a lot of requirements on all limited companies, and since more tightening up of company law is <Col N="272" /> envisaged in the future, we must stand back and question whether such arrangements are absolutely necessary, or indeed appropriate, to the small type of family owned or owner-run proprietary company. Deputy Flynn went on to suggest, much along the lines of a Green Paper published in the UK some years ago, that a new form of incorporation should be tried for small companies.  This would involve the minimum of filing requirements and would allow the filing of a solvency certificate rather than any detailed accounts.</P>
    <P>I must say this sort of thing has certain attractions.  Unfortunately, as far as I know, in the United Kingdom the Green Paper seemed to have died from lack of interest.  Usually, what happens with these ideas is that when they are being put into law a balance must be struck.  It is all right to make things simple for certain types of companies, but you do not want to make them so simple, and you do not want to make the classifications so wide, that other interlopers and &ldquo;cowboys&rdquo; would abuse such provisions.  We would not require some smaller companies to fulfil all of the requirements on a pragmatic basis.  In effect, that is what has been suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>How would one convey that to the appropriate people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the Bill.  There will be certain rather stringent requirements brought into company law but these will not apply to companies below a certain turnover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider publishing a small information booklet for such companies?  It would be invaluable.  Big companies have their own advisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an excellent idea, but it would be better if the accountants concerned, who are in the way of making money in certifying accounts on behalf of such companies, would issue a brochure at their expense.  The Department would be glad to help them.  It would be of <Col N="273" /> use to the accountancy houses by way of promotional material for their practices while providing authoritative information. One must consider the explosive rate at which new companies are being registered.  There are many guides to company law being brought out but Deputy Flynn seems to want a plain man's guide to a corporation&mdash;how does one become incorporated in the first place?  I will look at it but I am sure it can be done more than adequately by the commercial interests concerned.</P>
      <P>There would be great difficulty in defining a company by reference to the motivation or the status of the owner. What often starts off as a simple piece of legislative proposals has to be drafted carefully in order to avoid abuses, and has to have provisions nailed in to exclude this possibility.  At the end of the process the provisions allowing for the liberalisation are very often so detailed and cumbersome that those it is aimed at have no interest in making use of the provisions at all.</P>
      <P>There is a far simpler approach.  We have a body of company law which has operated for more than 100 years.  It is in need of amendment and tightening up and this will be done.  However, as we have done in this Bill, we can always take account of the appropriateness of certain provisions in relation to companies of different size, or of different structure.  I would prefer to do it this way rather than to concoct other untried arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite a few Deputies gave a welcome to the information which we are requiring companies to give in relation to pensions for their staff and employees.  There should be no confusion here.  The Companies Act cannot provide a system of regulation of pension funds and of pension matters, no matter how desirable that regulation may be.  What we have tried to do in this Bill is to encourage the provision of information by companies on whether such pension schemes exist, how they are funded, whether they have been actuarially assessed and, if so, whether the actuary's report is available. I think these simple and straightforward <Col N="274" /> provisions are important and should be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Other matters which seemed to concern certain Deputies were the sensitivity of some of the information being required by the Bill, particularly in regard to analysis of turnover.  I would simply draw their attention to the provisions which exist in the Bill for exemptions in case of certain matters of sensitivity.  Of course, other Deputies, such as Deputy Prendergast, questioned the whole <i>rationale</i> behind what he would regard as the fetish of confidentiality.</P>
    <P>Many of the concerns expressed in the contributions of the Deputies I have referred to above related to the fact that the Bill in certain cases went too far. Deputies Mac Giolla and Prendergast, however, felt that the Bill did not go far enough.  Deputy Prendergast referred to the Bill as a fraud and a sham.  He also referred to the Vredeling Fourth Directive and that the Bill was to give effect to that directive.</P>
    <P>Further allegations were also made by both Deputies that the actual number of companies which would be covered was minuscule and that financial institutions and insurance companies were being exempted.  I can only say that perhaps some of the concerns of the Deputies arise because they have been misinformed on the subject and what is contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Firstly, financial institutions, as I pointed out during Deputy Prendergast's contribution, are not exempted.  They will have to publish accounts; all they are being exempted from is the detailed format of those accounts.  There are good reasons for these exemptions and in my opening speech I went into some detail as to why they were necessary.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the reference to the Vredeling Fourth Directive is misplaced.  The Vredeling Directive on the information to be supplied to workers is completely separate from the Fourth Directive.  The Bill implements the Fourth Directive which is a measure in relation to company law for the protection of the various interested parties dealing with companies.  It is not as was the Vredeling Directive, <Col N="275" /> a piece of social or industrial relations legislation which is how one would describe the Vredeling Directive.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is not surprising that it was the EC Social Affairs Commissioner who brought it forward and not the Commissioner concerned with company affairs.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have already indicated, and I support this view, that information on what is going on in the workplace, and this covers not just financial information, does not have to be provided to the work force by means of filing with a public office, where the information, often of a sensitive nature, would be available to all of the public, not just those working in the plant.  It can hardly be in the best interests of all those dealing with a particular company that such information should be disclosed in that manner.</P>
    <P>After all the people working in the company have a lot to lose if the company lose their markets because information is given to others.  One would expect that people working in a company would prefer to get the information in a manner that was exclusive to them rather than it being given to the world at large which would be the way one would be getting it if there was a requirement that it be published in the Companies Office under the Bill.  It makes more sense to deal with that in the context of industrial relations procedures and collective bargaining rather than requiring that the world and his wife have access to this legislation which is proper only to the people employed in the company.  Jobs could be lost if information is given to a competitor in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the company and, ultimately, of its workforce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The third myth that I must dispel is the notion that only a handful of companies will be required to do anything under the Bill.  Reference has been made repeatedly to the term &ldquo;full&rdquo; accounts, and the impression has been given that only fewer than 100 companies <Col N="276" /> will be required to publish &ldquo;full&rdquo; accounts.</P>
      <P>Let us be clear about what full accounts mean.  Full accounts in this context means dotting every &ldquo;i&rdquo; and crossing every &ldquo;t&rdquo; as required by the Bill.  Medium sized companies will not have to do that but the amount of information they will have to give both in their profit and loss account and in their balance sheet, is in any layman's language, full accounts in the effective sense of the term.  That information will be there for all to see.</P>
      <P>The principal exemption which medium sized companies are obtaining is the facility not to have to disclose details of their turnover and cost of sales.  The reasons for this are simple and obvious, and the exemptions apply equally to small companies.</P>
      <P>Many small and medium sized companies are single product firms.  To publish in a profit and loss account the sort of information being required by this directive, which shows turnover, raw material and other costs, staff costs including wages and social welfare and other costs, other operating charges, distribution expenses and so on, would have the effect of providing a simple cost sheet on the costs of production of that firm which will be very useful to competitors both here and abroad.  I mention abroad because, for example, in the United Kingdom, and this includes Northern Ireland, small and medium sized companies have been given the exemptions from publication allowed by the directive.  I do not think it would be right for us to require that that information be given if it is not required to be given by a person less than 100 miles from here, in Warrenpoint or Newry, who may be in competition in the same product as a person in Dundalk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, and this is another myth I want to nail, small companies will be providing important details on their financial affairs.  Deputy Prendergast made a revealing comment in his contribution. He instanced a number of occasions on which he had found it impossible, in dealing with companies as <Col N="277" /> a trade union negotiator, to get the financial low-down on a company to see whether their claims that they could not pay a wage increase were justified or not.</P>
    <P>I quote here from what the Deputy said:</P>
    <P>When I look for a claim for my workers from a company in a business that can well afford to pay, a world brand name, they tell me they cannot afford to pay.  I tried to get them to bring in a pension scheme but they said they could not afford to do that either. We asked to see the balance sheet but they said they never disclose it.</P>
    <P>Well, we are asking small companies to disclose their balance sheet in this Bill. This balance sheet will convey the following details: fixed assets broken down between tangible assets and financial assets; current assets broken down between stocks, debtors due, falling within one year and more than one year, cash at bank and in hand, creditors, amounts owing within one year and beyond one year, capital and reserves, made up of share capital, reserves, and the profit and loss account.  That will provide a lot of helpful information to those anxious to know about the solvency of a company without necessarily wanting to know how it is trading <i>vis-à-vis</i> its competitors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It will provide too much information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Prendergast, when he gets around to using this information will find it useful. In addition, notes to the accounts are required giving details of accounting policies used.  This covers such items as the accounting conventions used, the policies applied on depreciation, research and development, stocks, capital grants, taxation, foreign currency translation and notes on pension benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further notes to the accounts will detail the breakdown of tangible fixed assets in relation to land, buildings, plant and equipment and motor vehicles. <Col N="278" /> Details will also be given of the amounts of creditors, bank loans and overdrafts, taxation, and the share capital of the company.</P>
    <P>This is not just my recipe of the information that small companies will have to give.  It is based on advice notes prepared by the accountancy firms for their clients indicating to them what the new arrangements arising from the Bill will be.  I suggest that the Deputies concerned might like to get their hands on those documents and study them and see exactly what is and is not covered by the Bill.  Those who feel that the Bill is providing too little information will be more than satisfied with what is being required.  All limited companies will have to provide this financial information.  We are not talking about 137, as mentioned by some commentators, or fewer than 100, or some other very small figure. We are talking about the whole 70,000 companies having to provide this information. This is the very reason why the Deputies on the other side of the House &mdash; Deputy Flynn in particular &mdash; have been suggesting forms of exemption from this requirement.</P>
    <P>When I listened to the various points put forward on Second Stage I was struck by the range of the spectrum we had traversed from those who felt that too much was being asked for &mdash; Deputy Reynolds used the term &ldquo;Socialist&rdquo; but that is not accurate because the legislation is required by the EC which has within its decision making process parties of all different political views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

What we want to do here is <Col N="279" /> stimulate corporate enterprise, and the provision of jobs, not kill it by inappropriate and ill-advised requirements.  While I do not think we should burden companies by requiring them to give too much information, we must remember that when a small company go out of business not having paid their debts it is not only the workers who suffer but very often other small companies who may have loaned them money or sold goods on account and are not being paid.  If we were to go too far in protecting a small company from the onerous requirement of giving information we might be harming other small companies who are entitled to that information in order to know whether they should extend credit or not.</P>
      <P>In the discussion on the Bill a number of issues were touched upon relating to company law in general.  Deputy Avril Doyle suggested the introduction of a chapter 11 type system such as they have in the US which puts a company under &ldquo;intensive care&rdquo; when its gets into difficulty rather than winding it up.  I am very conscious of the benefits of this and my Department have carried out a lot of detailed research on it.  Proposals are being developed for my consideration.</P>
      <P>The general Bill on abuse in company law is something I have done a great deal of work on with my officials. When I came to this Ministry there were proposals in place but they had not been cleared by the Government.  I turned those proposals into heads of a Bill which were approved by the Government.  The detailed legal drafting is now underway.  I have brought it a considerable distance in the last two years and I hope to bring it further in the next 18 months.</P>
      <P>Finally, in my opening speech I referred to the provisions of section 2 of the Bill now before the House and the fact that companies not trading for profit &mdash; religious companies and charitable companies &mdash; are being exempted under this section in recognition of the non-commercial nature of their activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may perhaps be useful if I refer for a moment to the sort of companies we <Col N="280" /> are dealing with here.  Companies not trading for profit would for example be the type of company licensed by the Minister under section 24 of the Companies Act, 1963, so that they do not have to include the word &ldquo;Limited&rdquo; in their name.  Such companies are formed for the purpose of promoting commerce, art, science, religion, charity or any other useful object, and which apply their income to the promotion of their objects.</P>
    <P>In practice the vast majority of these companies are public companies and will, therfore, have to file accounts under the Companies Act, 1963, notwithstanding the exemption under this Act.  They are not being exempted from disclosure.  The only exemption they are getting is not to have to follow the detailed accounting rules and formats are in this Bill, because those rules and formats are in general not suitable or relevant for them because of their largely non-commercial nature.</P>
    <P>The religious companies being exempted are those which are formed for charitable purposes and are under the control of a religion and which exercise their functions in accordance with the laws, canons and ordinances of that religion. Such companies are generally engaged in holding diocesan property in trust and because they are not trading companies the provisions in the Bill would not be suitable for them.</P>
    <P>The charities being exempted are small in number and are those in respect of which an order has been made by the Commissioners of Charitable Donations under section 128 (5) of the 1963 Companies Act.  It is understood that there are only 23 such companies at present in respect of which orders covering a three to five year period have been issued. However, I am informed that the commissioners recently decided that in future orders will only be granted in very exceptional circumstances so that the number of companies involved is not only small but is likely to diminish even further over the next few years.</P>
    <P>I understand that if the orders lapse these companies, being public companies, will have to publish their accounts under the 1963 Act but will probably <Col N="281" /> qualify as non-profit making and thus while required to disclose will not be required to comply with the detailed accounting requirements of this Bill.  This will place them on the same footing as the non-profit making companies I referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>I have taken a little bit more of the time of the House in replying to this debate than might have been expected. However, when we were discussing this earlier there were many useful and interesting contributions and I trespassed a little on your time to give as full a reply as possible to the points raised.  I wish to thank the Deputies who made such interesting contributions, especially Deputy Flynn, who made a very detailed speech, which, unfortunately, I did not hear due to the requirement of having to attend a Government meeting.  However, I studied it carefully later.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AliceGlenn" hpid="Mrs. Glenn Mrs. Glenn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is one of the most important to come before the House in <Col N="282" /> recent times and has its origins in pressure groups such as the Council of Civil Liberties, Children First, Cherish and social workers' groups, very many of whom were opposed to the pro-life amendment, support contraceptives, divorce, sex education and multi-denominational schools.  For years they have been proclaiming that the child care laws are out of date and that our adoption laws and administration need to be reviewed in unspecified areas.  They have never indicated which areas need to be reviewed.</P>
      <P>Since these people had something to do with the formation of the Bill it is necessary to know something about them.  In <i>Response,</i> Volume 4, No. 2, a document brought out by The Responsible Society, Family and Youth Concern, 24 Upper Fitzwilliam Street, Dublin, a paragraph dealing with an information pack on child sexual abuse says that on 3 November 1984 Deputy Barry Desmond gave a grant of £25,000 to the Irish Council of Civil Liberties to conduct a study into the sexual abuse of children.  They are regarded as a left wing pressure group, a most unusual body to have received an official grant for a study of this nature.  At the launch of the study an information pack was promised for the use of teachers, parents, social workers, etc.  It has now been printed and an expensive glossy folder produced with public money has been distributed free. It consists of 14 advice sheets but the information is mostly culled from abroad. It is filled with subjective experiences and figures for the incidence of incest and child abuse relate to other countries, not to Ireland.</P>
      <P>The whole exercise seems to be an expensive promotion of the Irish Council of Civil Liberties.  The document goes on to say that the ICCL executive committee includes homosexual campaigner, David Norris.  The sub-committee investigating sexual abuse of children consists of people who organised demonstrations in favour of abortion, including Ann O'Donnell of the Rape Crisis Centre and Dr. Marie Woods of the Wellwoman Centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> In the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Wednesday, 26 January 1977 there was an article calling for the end of inalienable rights for parents written by Kadar Asmal.  It is stretching credibility to think that Irish parents should be expected to accept the recommendations of these kind of groups who cast a slur on them.  There is a concerted campaign in the media at present aimed at influencing the people who will have to vote in a referendum if this Bill is to become law.</P>
    <P>I watched a women's programme recently and they gave four different examples of how children had been abused in their homes.  I can remember three of the examples given.  Children were abused by a young babysitter in one instance, the other example was that of a mature adult who had been abused in her youth by an uncle, but none of them was abused by the natural father.  That is a point worth nothing.</P>
    <P>Having set out the reasons why I object to certain recommendations in this Bill, I will now outline in detail the aspects I find unacceptable.  The thrust of the Bill is to allow the State greater power to interfere in the family and greater control over the education, upbringing and destiny of our children, overriding the constitutional rights of the parents.  To effect this, it seeks to establish rights for the child independently of the parents. The child, being a minor, cannot speak on its own behalf; so its rights must be asserted by a third party, the State.  The State can then move in on the family through its officials and direct parents about their children's upbringing, or even take the children into care.</P>
    <P>State control of this kind operates in Great Britain and elsewhere, often in an arbitrary fashion, and always with disastrous results.  The civilised world was shocked recently when it watched the fate meted out to Mrs. Gillick when she went through due process of law from bottom to the very top &mdash; the House of Lords &mdash; in an effort to protect not only her children, as she said in an interview, but all the children of Great Britain from the abuses to which they are being subjected. <Col N="284" /> We all know she failed.  Do we really want to introduce that type of situation for the parents of Ireland, because I believe that is what this Bill will do?</P>
    <P>State intervention on this scale is prohibited in this country by Article 41 of the Constitution, which declares the rights of the family and of parents to control the education and upbringing of their children. State interference is limited by Article 42.5 to exceptional cases where the parents, for physical or moral reasons, fail in their duty towards their children. In such cases &ldquo;the State as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means, shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents&rdquo;.  The State, however, does not possess the full constitutional rights of the parents but only such rights as are necessary for the child's welfare. &ldquo;In exercising the jurisdiction to control or to ignore parental right the court must act cautiously, not as if it were a private person acting with regard to his own child&rdquo;&mdash; that was the judgment handed down in the Supreme Court in the Kindersley case in 1944, and it was a very important judgment.</P>
    <P>It was therefore alarming to read an announcement in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Thursday, 20 May 1985 that the Government have agreed to hold a referendum to change the Constitution, if it were necessary, to implement the Children (Care and Protection) Bill.  This is very ominous because it means that there has been a deliberate decision to take away, under this Bill, some constitutional rights of the parents and to extend State control over our children.  The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill does not identify in any way the particular provisions which are in breach of the Constitution.  Of course, it is altogether improper to promote a Bill which is considered to be in breach of the Constitution, all the more so when the existence of the unconstitutional provisions in the Bill were not revealed to this House.  This Bill could be passed off as an innocuous measure, containing only good provisions, which needed constitutional amendment to ensure that it could not be <Col N="285" /> challenged.  The constitutional referendum could then be cunningly drafted and we could find ourselves in a very serious position.</P>
    <P>The grounds on which a health board can interfere in a child's upbringing are set out in section 33.  They are extended to include notably the grounds of the child receiving inadequate care such as to impair substantially the child's proper development.  This is a sweeping provision which could allow the health board, through their social workers, to interfere in families on a multitude of pretexts.  Interference would focus particularly on poor families who, under anti-family legislation, have been impoverished to the point where they cannot buy adequate food and clothing for their children let alone provide facilities which a middle class social worker might consider essential for the proper development of children.  Arbitrary action by the health board through the social workers in such a case could be the subject of a constitutional challenge.  We are all aware that many a well off and much loved child sits on a poor mother's knee. If those criteria were applied, social workers could say a home was inadequate because it did not have wall to wall carpets.</P>
    <P>The machinery for State control, other than emergency &ldquo;place of safety&rdquo; provisions, is set out in sections 34 to 40.  A health board, having reasonable grounds for believing that a child is not receiving adequate care or that a child is suffering assault, ill-treatment, abuse, neglect and so on, may apply to a District Court for a supervision or care order.  It is satisfactory at least that the State interference in the family should not be allowed except with a court hearing and decision, although an <i>in camera</i> hearing for these cases makes the check less effective. Even when the court allows State interference there should be safeguards &mdash; they are conspicuously lacking in this Bill &mdash; against harmful or objectionable action by the State when it gets control of the child.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with court orders, supervision orders and care orders under <Col N="286" /> section 35.  On the application of a health board the District Court can make a supervision order, which leaves a child at home; or a care order, which takes a child from its parents or guardians into the control of a health board.  A child subject to a supervision order may be required to attend at a specified place for such assessment, education, training or medical attention as would, in the opinion of the court, facilitate its proper development.</P>
    <P>This unfettered discretion could be very dangerous, as has been proved by examples already cited from Great Britain. Education, training and medical attention are fields in which not only reasonable divergencies of opinion exist, but serious moral issues on which no agreement is possible will arise.  A possible example would require a child to attend education which included sex education of a kind unacceptable to its religion or objected to by its parents. There is no safeguard against this.  Medical attention could involve the administration of sedatives or other drugs and devices which would not be in accordance with the wishes of the parents.  There must be safeguards against such plenary power over the child by the State.</P>
    <P>I now turn to religious safeguards.  A very necessary safeguard is to provide that any requirement under a supervision order shall not be valid if it would involve any assessment, education, training or medical attention which is contrary to the teaching of the child's religions, or which takes place under conditions which are unacceptable to the authorities of the child's religion, or if it is contrary to the reasonable wishes of the parents.</P>
    <P>Another very necessary safeguard is the Catholic Church, to which almost 95 per cent of the children likely to need health board care belong.  It is the only body with sufficient resources to protect poor families against the arbitrary exercise of State power and it should be given a clear entitlement to do so.  The reasonable objections of parents could be overridden by the courts.  One may ask if there was any consultation with the authorities <Col N="287" /> of the Catholic Church during the preparation of this Bill, or are we witnessing another arrogant example of the civil authority crashing like a mindless juggernaut through the delicate fabric of family life?  Having regard to the people responsible for providing much of what has gone into this Bill, it is very unlikely that the Catholic Church has been consulted good, bad or indifferent about the effects of the Bill on children.</P>
    <P>In section 36 (4) it is stated that the care order may include conditions regarding access by or consultation with a parent or guardian on matters relating to the child.  A part from this there is nothing in the section to control or limit the health board in their dealings with the child by reference to the wishes of the parents or by reference to the protection of the child's religion.  Even where a child comes into care in a health board there should be some safeguard for the child's religion, faith and morals and also provision for the role of the parents and family to continue to have the safeguards overseen.</P>
    <P>There are two classes of children in care, those committed to care by court order and children in voluntary care. Paragraph 14 of the explanatory memorandum to the Bill states that at present the health board can receive children into voluntary care only if the parents are dead or have abandoned them or if the parents are destitute.  Section 25 extends this to cover situations in which parents may need to place their children in voluntary care through illness, psychiatric problems or other difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is acceptable that parents should be allowed to place children in voluntary care for short or long periods if it is not possible for them to care for the children themselves.  However, there is a distinction between children in voluntary care and those committed by court order.  A child in voluntary care could always be taken back by the parents on request. Section 49 (2) allows the health board to hold the child and to apply to court for a <Col N="288" /> place of safety order if the child is believed to be at risk of any of the circumstances that would allow a care order to be made.  These include the very dubious ground of &ldquo;inadequate care such as to impair substantially the child's proper development&rdquo;.  We have already dealt with what that could mean.  It is also possible for a health board to delay the return of a child for up to 14 days if the child has been in voluntary care for six months.  Presumably this delay is intended to give the health board an opportunity of applying to the District Court for a care order to commit the child to retention in care.  Otherwise there would be no point in the delay of 14 days which is envisaged in the Bill.</P>
    <P>One must feel uneasy at the possibility of parents who have left a child in voluntary care as a temporary measure finding that they cannot get the child back when they request it.  The situation could develop where parents would be refused the return of their child, for example, if he were being fostered in a family that could provide better facilities for his &ldquo;proper development&rdquo; than the parents could provide.  This dilemma is explicit whenever a child is placed elsewhere than with his parents.</P>
    <P>The principle must be that a child cannot be separated from his parents except for a serious fault on the part of the parents.  Otherwise any family could be broken up if bettering the child's prospects of development were to be the criterion &mdash; this was hinted at in the Seanad debate on adoption on 30 June 1982. While paragraph 21 of the explanatory memorandum states only that release of the child will be delayed pending application for a place of safety order, section 49 would go further.</P>
    <P>I insist on the Government making it clear in what circumstances, other than where a child is at risk of neglect, ill-treatment or abuse, that a place of safety order must be made.  A health board will be empowered to retain in care a child who has been in voluntary care and whose parents or guardians have requested his return.  Perhaps this is one of the provisions on which a referendum is required.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> At present the courts commit children into residential care.  Subsequently the health boards may arrange fosterage for these children and also for children in voluntary care but with the provision that only children who are orphaned or deserted or whose parents are destitute may be placed in fosterage, and that the consent of the child's parents must be obtained if they are available.</P>
    <P>Under sections 43 and 44 any child in the care of a health board, including those in voluntary care, may be placed in fosterage and the health board shall not place a child in residential care unless the necessary care of the child cannot be provided except by residential care.  It would appear the consent of the parents is no longer to be required.  This is very serious.</P>
    <P>Pressure groups and a good deal of other opinion is strongly in favour of foster care for children as providing family life and they condemn institutional care as essentially bad for a child.  I suggest that the alternatives are not just as black and white as that and many children could be happier in a modern children's home than in fosterage.  Much depends on the child and on the kind of home life provided by the foster parents.  A family of brothers and sisters might be better off in a children's home than if they were scattered among different foster parents. Cases of children unhappy in fosterage when separated from their siblings have been reported in England since this law was introduced there.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not appear to contain any provision to safeguard the religion of children taken into care other than section 63 (3) which applies to custody cases only and also section 15 (7).  The need for such a provision arises in an acute form in connection with fosterage. Prior to March 1983 children could be placed in fosterage only with foster parents of the same religion.  In March 1983 the Minister amended the statutory regulations to allow children to be placed in the foster care of persons of other religions provided the child's parent or parents gave consent and to allow orphans or deserted children to be placed <Col N="290" /> with foster parents of another religion provided that the foster parents undertook to bring the child up in its own religion.  Non-Catholics cannot bring up a Catholic child in the fullness of a faith they have not got themselves.  At present, when so many denominations of Protestants are in vociferous disagreement with practically every item of the Catholic moral code, it would be putting the faith and morals of a Catholic child in certain peril to place him in charge of any person other than a Catholic.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is essential to make specific statutory provision that children be placed in foster care only with foster parents of the same religion.</P>
    <P>It would be advisable also to specify, as in section 13 of the Adoption Act, 1952, that the health board must be satisfied that each of the foster parents is of good moral character and is a suitable person to have parental rights and duties in respect of the child.  At a time when we are being encouraged to take on alternative lifestyles it is imperative that these issues be written into any Bill dealing with the welfare of our children.</P>
    <P>A similar provision should be made to ensure that children's homes are also satisfactory as regards the religious formation of the child, a provision that a child shall not be placed in any place of residential care unless such place is under the control and management of the Church to which the child belongs, or is approved by the authorities of the Church to which the child belongs is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>In a Bill which introduces the concept of a child's proper development it is amazing that there is no provision to safeguard the child's formation in his religion, which is of the most importance in the development of any individual.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Bill prohibiting changing the religion of a child but this applies only where a custody order is made by the District Court vesting legal custody of a child in a person with whom the child has had his home, for a period of 12 months if parents or guardians consent to the order or for a period of three years in any other case.  A parent or legal guardian who has been missing for 12 <Col N="291" /> months and who cannot be found or who is incapable of giving consent by reason of mental infirmity is deemed to have given consent.</P>
    <P>Section 63(3) prohibits a person granted legal custody of a child from changing the child's religion or arranging for the child's emigration, a legal custodian can, however, authorise medical treatment for the child, as provided in section 9.  Medical treatment may involve moral issues.  It is, therefore, essential that a child should not be given into the custody of anyone of a different religious persuasion.  The prohibition against changing a child's religion does not guarantee that a child will be openly brought up in his own religion and never taught to do anything or subjected to any influence or treatment contrary to the teaching of the religion to which he belongs. There should be strict specific provision for this.  A health board taking a child from his parents into care are bound to accept responsibility for the religious and moral education of the child under Article 42 of the Constitution, as well as for his intellectual, physical and social education, also referred to in Article 42.</P>
    <P>There must be provision to ensure the proper religious and moral upbringing and formation of the child according to the teaching of the religion to which he belongs.  In any law which transfers the care of a child to the State, with the responsibility of supplying the place of the child's parents, Article 42 of the constitution is specific in terms of this protection.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for the registration of children's homes by health boards and for the making of regulations by the Minister for Health governing the design, maintenance, repair, ventilation, heating and lighting of the homes, the kind of accommodation, including washing and plumbing, the food and staffing, in fact most detailed control of the homes. There is a saver in subsection (6) that no requirement contrary to the religious beliefs of a religious body or organisation running a children's home can be imposed. All aspects of the care of the child <Col N="292" /> are dealt with in detail, except that all important aspect of his religious background and formation.</P>
    <P>Section 16 prohibits a children's home from receiving any child, save in emergency, except with the approval of a health board.  This is in pursuance, presumably, of the policy of placing children in foster care rather than in a home.  The health board will decide which is appropriate.  It will be an offence with a penalty of £500 to receive or retain a child without the approval of a health board.</P>
    <P>This is rather highhanded and could involve overruling the reasonable wishes of parents to place a child or children in a home for voluntary care, rather than in fosterage.  The Bill does not provide any appeal to the District Court in case of dispute but a constitutional case could possibly be taken by a parent whose wishes were overruled.</P>
    <P>Is it not most inconsistent to reject institutional care for children while we are talking about providing day care for the children of mothers who are being forced in greater numbers out of their homes in order to provide for their children? What is the difference between day care and institutional care?  Day care represents the State providing for institutional care for a child during the greater part of his waking hours.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 13 of the explanatory memorandum is to the effect that section 24 will enable day care services to be provided by the health boards for persons with special needs, for example, single parents and travellers.  However, the section contains no such limitation.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, too, to consider the extent of the problem because this is very much exaggerated and would be much less if the State was not co-operating in setting up alternative lifestyles.  Of the children born to unmarried mothers, 40 per cent go into long term care.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 5 of the explanatory memorandum it is stated that about 3,700 children spend time in care each year and that in 1984 the figure was 3,724.  The number of children who are in long term care as a result of marital breakdown is small.  Most of these are put into short <Col N="293" /> term care while the problems are sorted out.  The figures indicate that 50 per cent or more of those children return to their families when the parent's differences are resolved one way or another.</P>
    <P>I am gravely concerned about the impact this Bill will have on society.  What I find alarming is that, having listened during a long period to many of my colleagues speaking on the Bill, none of them seems to see any danger in it.  That is very unfortunate.</P>
    <P>Government intrusion into the family seems to be spreading with the notion that only the State can solve the human problems in the areas of health, education and welfare.  Without the benefit of any consensus from the electorate, an unwritten family policy seems to be emerging.  The Minister for Health seems to be intent on building up layer upon layer of legislation which would mean that the State, rather than the family, would have the primary responsibility to define and satisfy the full range of human needs.  The State's response is always therapeutic.  It never tries to identify and treat the causes of the problem.  This Bill, together with the proposed changes in the adoption laws and the Status of Children Bill, is a classic example of the trend that has been emerging for some time.  Some weeks ago in an article in one of the national newspapers, a senior civil servant was quoted as having described the proposed changes as a veritable minefield.  I agree totally with that view.</P>
    <P>One of the thorniest issues regarding child abuse and neglect is the difficulty of the definition.  The goal is to strike a balance between protecting the rights of the parents and the integrity of the family while at the same time maintaining the legitimate interest of the State in the lives and limbs of defenceless children.  The Government would do well to remove the obstacles to the growth and development of the family, namely, excessive taxation and misdirected Government spending.  There is an awareness of the need to protect and defend the primacy of the family which it enjoys under Article 41 and Article 42 of our Constitution. <Col N="294" /> There is an awareness among the electorate which was reflected in the results of the recent local elections, and I agree with Deputy John Kelly when he said yesterday that the people of this nation do not want the socialist policies in which we have been engaging for far too long. I look forward to the referendum on this Bill and it is my earnest hope that by the time it comes about there will be no family in Ireland left in any doubt as to the adverse effects of some of the sections in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for my voice since I am suffering from a sore throat.  I welcome some aspects of this Bill which are badly required.  I refer to such things as the introduction of regulations and controls on day care facilities, foster care in children's homes and the improved provision for children placed in care, where this is necessary.  I also welcome the introduction of new custody facilities for foster parents.</P>
      <P>This is the first of three Bills and I had expected that the Minister would tackle the most serious problems in this first Bill.  The question of juvenile justice is to be dealt with in the third Bill.  Serious problems are to be found in areas such as the inner city of Dublin and a positive range of provisions is urgently needed for the extension of the range of services to make probation an effective alternative to prison.  The provision of probationary and after-care hostels, the employment of adequate numbers of school attendance officers, the expansion of the juvenile liaison officer scheme and the probation and welfare service are all vitally important.  Another vital factor is the increase in the age of criminal responsibility to 15 and the provision of a juvenile court system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the series of measures which are now required urgently to cater for young people at risk, but for some reason the Minister has run away from the most urgent measures required.  He has decided in this Bill to introduce measures which are less urgent.  The young people who are most seriously at risk are to be found in such places as Dublin's inner <Col N="295" /> city.  Surely these people should be the first for consideration in trying to bring about improvements.  The Minister has been cowardly in tackling these problems because it would be controversial and would require the expenditure of a significant amount of finance.  In being seen to be doing something while in fact doing nothing, the Minister has opted for the easy way out.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the limited provisions of this Bill, it falls far short of dealing with the problems it sets out to tackle. The Task Force on Child Care Services, which sat from 1975 to 1981, came up with a series of very useful and important proposals; yet this legislation ignores the vast majority of proposals in that report. The Minister's response to the report in this legislation is a serious disappointment to the many voluntary and professional people who give their lives to the services of young people at risk.</P>
    <P>Prevention and early intervention are crucial but this Bill totally ignores these concepts, apart from paying lip service. The health boards are being given the job of providing the services to be initiated by this Bill but the Bill is skimpy in its provisions.  It is provided that a health board may do this or that and we can take it that they have the option not to take any action.  How are the health boards expected to do anything without the necessary finance?  The lack of adequate resources makes this exercise tantamount to putting legislation through the House in order to put it on the top shelf.  The health boards do not have the financial resources to do much of the work which is so urgently required.  In the Western Health Board area we have discontinued dental, optical and other services; yet the Minister says that the health board may do this or that, without any clear indication as to how he proposes to finance these activities.  The Minister should table an amendment to provide that the health boards &ldquo;shall&rdquo; do certain things, indicating that he will provide the necessary finance.</P>
    <P>The health board staff dealing with this area, particularly social workers, are <Col N="296" /> already clearly overworked with existing commitments.  There is no effort made in this Bill to improve the performance of the social workers by improving the training and supervision.  The matter is left to the discretion of the health boards. Taking the country overall one can note a serious discrepancy between the performance of one health board and another.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the Bill about which I am concerned is its almost total ignorance of the very useful contribution of the voluntary organisations.  I have a letter from the ISPCC who express their disappointment that voluntary organisations like theirs have been excluded from the decision-making process in relation to child care services.  They say that their organisation contributed to the Task Force on Child Care Services established in 1980.  Yet this Bill reflects little of that report which took six years to compile. They say they would like to see the establishment of a national children's council which would promote co-operation between the various agencies engaged in child care.  They contend that a national policy could minimise the different degrees of interest in child care services within the health board regions.  They go on to say that their organisation is involved at many levels throughout the country in developing preventive services for children and for families experiencing difficulties.  They are concerned that the emphasis in this Bill is placed on the regulation and inspection of the various child care services which will not allow the overworked social workers sufficient opportunity to develop preventive services.</P>
    <P>The ISPCC are one of the bodies which, probably more than any other in this country, play a most important role in looking after children at risk.  Yet they have expressed their serious dissatisfaction with the provisions of this Bill and have called for the establishment of a national children's council.  One must question why the provisions of this Bill do not allow for the establishment of such a national children's council which was <Col N="297" /> also envisaged in the report of the task force to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>On the question of the child care advisory committees and the voluntary organisations, the voluntary and community representatives on child care advisory committees, as proposed under the terms of this Bill, do not constitute a way forward. Neither are they in any way adequate.  It is suggested that membership of a child care advisory committee may include persons who are not members of a health board.  Yet the main thrust of that task force report was to enable communities to assess their needs and to plan an appropriate response. Unfortunately, the provisions of this Bill render it difficult for communities to assess their needs and to plan an appropriate response.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill do very little for people interested in the preventive aspect of this matter.  They do not seem to encourage the development of voluntary organisations and community groups interested and involved in providing child, family and community services; neither do they give them an equal say in the planning, financing or delivery of services in their areas.</P>
    <P>As is envisaged under the provisions of the Bill, the District Court does not constitute a suitable forum for dealing with children with special needs and is also totally unsuitable for the dispensing of justice.  It is for that reason that I suggest there should be a young person's or juvenile court to deal with the evergrowing problem of juvenile delinquency and to deal with the growing problem also of despair and disaffection among young people.  Therefore, in addition to the establishment of this court, I contend that my earlier suggestions should be implemented.</P>
    <P>The final point with which I want to deal is the proposal of the task force committee that school attendance officers, special schools and so on be brought under the control of one Department.  I am not sure whether they suggested that that should be the Department of Health.  That being the case, this Bill chooses to ignore the <Col N="298" /> aspects of child care now placed at such risk because of the problem of school truancy.  One wonders when and where this Government will tackle this problem. There was announced recently a youth policy which was a consequence of the Costello Committee which had dealt with this problem in detail.  Their report contained significant and worthwhile proposals on the problem of school truancy and on the need for the employment of school attendance officers.</P>
    <P>It is my contention that the seeds of crime and vandalism are now being sown at an alarming rate among young people engaging in school truancy particularly in Dublin city.  Yet after three years in office this Government have totally ignored this escalating problem.  There is no question but that the rampant crime and valdalism now to be found throughout this city are born among nine, ten and eleven year olds who are engaging in school truancy. Yet the services necessary to solve that problem are grossly inadequate.  One might have expected that this Bill would have endeavoured to tackle that serious problem.  The appointment of school attendance officers, the establishment of special schools and so on do not form part of this Bill.  I find it very difficult to understand how the Minister can ignore such a serious, urgent problem.</P>
    <P>In his concluding remarks on this Bill it is important that the Minister would clearly outline to the House when he proposes to introduce legislation in regard to the other matters I have mentioned, those which I assume will be included in the ensuing two Bills.  I should like to know when the Minister expects to introduce those Bills and whether he will include in their provisions those so sorely missing from the present one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that one cannot please everybody.  At the beginning of his remarks I think Deputy F. Fahey described the Minister's approach as cowardly and insufficient, contending that he should have placed the third Bill before the first one.  Those remarks are unwarranted and unfair, taking into account the trouble to which the Minister has gone <Col N="299" /> to endeavour to introduce the necessary Bill, which indeed constitues far-reaching social legislation essential to the welfare of our children.  Indeed, it updates legislation which has obtained for over 100 years.  In other sections of the law we have been putting up with legislation which has been in existence for over 100 years.  Therefore, I cannot understand what Deputy Fahey is complaining about.  Rather than looking positively at the provisions of this Bill, their advantages, the happiness they will bring to many miserable, tortured children experiencing the many horrors of life within our society, all Deputy Fahey appears to do is criticise them, complain that they are insufficient and that we should have something else in their place.</P>
      <P>I welcome the honest approach adopted in the formulation of the provisions of this Bill.  Because it is so far reaching and comprehensive, inevitably difficulty arises in drafting a formula that will meet the answers to all the complications in child care, child abuse, custody of children, separation from parents and loved ones, suffering and hardship.  There is an opportunity for Deputy Fahey, if he wants it, between now and Committee Stage of the Bill to take it section by section and take full advantage of the research that has been done in the area of child care.  The explanatory memorandum lists the organisations who were consulted in the preparation of the Bill. Deputy Fahey can take advantage of those and of the large body of knowledge available in the libraries and in the body of law that has been prepared in other countries.  As spokesman for youth he might engage himself usefully in that exercise rather than coming in here and throwing a shot at the Bill and talking about something entirely different through all his short contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not absolutely essential to go in detail into the sections of the Bill as Committee Stage has to come up and the Minister is open to suggestions and recommendations.  Some people are <Col N="300" /> taking a one point of view look at the Bill and condemning it on the basis of that one look.  The Minister's opening remarks made clear what he is trying to do, and this is related to children to whom the Government are committed and that the legislative programme provides a comprehensive, updated and extended body of law to protect and promote the welfare and security of our children. Deputy Fahey could have been more concerned with the horrible examples and cases of child abuse that have occured and been reported widely in the last few months in this country.  Some of these cases are horrifying.  We have been inclined to think that we are something other than we are.  We are not capable of looking at ourselves objectively.  We are confused by the same tag of Christianity that the Irish people have acquired or given to themselves over the years. Because you are a Christian, or people think you are a Christian, you can often ignore the fact that you are anything but Christian in your actions.  There is very little evidence in this country of Christianity. I have heard it said here as recently as the last week in the last session, on marriage breakdown for example, how tolerant a nation we are, how compassionate and humane we are.  I reject the suggestion that we are any of those three things.  Daily we prove that we are not. Perhaps the fabric of which Christianity is woven is not complex enough to absorb the society of the eighties.  Maybe Hinduism would do so; Christianity does not. Therefore, we heard ridiculous assertions by my colleague, Deputy Glenn, in several of her comments about religion.  The total approach seems to be in the context of religion and no mention is made of the horrible lives that some children in this country had even in religious institutions through the years and how they were used and abused in those institutions without a grain of humanity shown towards them. They were used to serve the sons and daughters of the establishment.  They were used in private, boarding, fee paying schools to do cleaning, make beds, wash up, and were not even given an education.  They could not wait to reach <Col N="301" /> the age of 14, then the legal school leaving age, to take the boat to England and get to hell out of this unChristain country and never show face in it again.  That was the way we treated our orphans down through the years.</P>
    <P>I question whether we should insist that children go to homes of the religion of the parents.  Listening to Deputy Glenn one would think that Catholicism was being assaulted when 97 per cent of the population are Catholic, yet the Bill is condemned because it might provide for the possibility of someone ending up in the care of a non-Catholic foster home. As a matter of fact, in many cases, children would enjoy a better chance, better advantage if they were fortunate enough to end up in such a situation.  I hope that the Minister will ignore totally the kind of suggestions I have referred to.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into the Bill in great depth at the moment.  I welcome it as a tool to help those who are looking after children, who care about them genuinely, who feel helpless at the moment, as many of us do in that we cannot reach out and protect and look after children in the circumstances I have mentioned and give them a chance.  I find almost cruel the approach of some people when discussing the Bill in that they can be so heartless although they think they are being kind.  The real objective, purpose and goal that we should have are to make society as egalitarian as possible and reject out of hand the approach that has been taken down throughout the decates by those who have been in power for most of the time, the approach of patronage towards the disadvantaged and the less well off.  We think we can absolve our consiences by patronage, dipping into our pockets or maybe hiding under the cloak of Christianity or religion, but we never really open up society and give equal opportunity and fair advantage to everyone.</P>
    <P>Sinces the foundation of the State this society consciously or unconsciously, has been run by an elitest group of Irish people whom it seems the State has benefited.  That may not have been the intention when it was set up but that is <Col N="302" /> what has come about.  The Establishment have promoted a system of rule whereby the professions gain and the sons and daughters of the middle and upper middle classes continues to benefit in perpetuity, and the gap is becoming wider.  Even in the ten or 15 years since I left college and became an adult the chances of a person getting through third level education have diminished greatly.  One would have throught that in the last ten or 15 years, with the improvement of standards, the control of our own destiny would have come about; but that has not happened because of those who have been in power and are formulating laws and controlling the professions.  These professions have not been opened up and the opportunities have not been given.</P>
    <P>The Minister has brought this Bill before the House today because the most helpless and most vulnerable in our society have been abused, very often not deliberately but because of their unfortunate circumstances.  The religious &mdash; and particularly those whom Deputy Glenn has defended so much &mdash; have been totally pigheaded in their approach towards the kind of families that we should have. The coldness, heartlessness, ignorance and unreality of approach of the leaders of those religions, who are again products of the establishment, have shown in the roles they have laid down, the impression they have made and the influence they have had on the uneducated members of our society.  They pushed them to the brink, making them suffer beyond endurance in having large families living in a way of life which ensured an existance of slavery in their short lives.  One half of the families had to emigrate and the other half were doomed to an early death.</P>
    <P>One of the few heartening things about this Government is our good fortune in having a Minister like the present Minister controlling the portfolio of Health.  I hope that he will continue with the same approach that he has used to the portfolio since he came into office.  I hope that he will not be deflected from his task of trying to bring about justice and fairness in our society and a system of health which will look after the disadvantaged, <Col N="303" /> even if it is to the discomfiture of those smung people who make speeches solely about the spiritual welfare of children who need care and protection.</P>
    <P>This is very significant social legislation which will help to protect and promote the security of Irish children.  It has been suggested that society's dedication to democracy is most severely tested by its attitude to its children.  When considering the rights of children we are forced to examine many of the attitudes of our society to basic principles of democracy &mdash; freedom of self-determination, protection of the week, personal quality and individual worth.  In a democratic society we expect that all children will be entitled to the same level of care and believe that they have similar physical, emotional and educational needs.  We do not expect that a child's future place in the hierarchy of society will be predetermined at birth. We expect that the children will be able to develop their potential so that their place or role in society will not be determined by where they were born or how much money their parents possessed but will be decided by their natural abilities, attitudes and inclinations.  We have a filtering system which we encourage in our society; and this is emphasised by the cruel educational system which gives a better chance to the advantaged people.</P>
    <P>Remember that these are people who know how to use the system best.  Even when money is spent in certain disadvantaged areas you will often find that the facilities provided are taken up by the people who know best how to use the system.  I had experience in my constituency in that regard.  I discovered that in one part of it 4 per cent of the population get a crack at a third level education and they make up 27 per cent of the population of St. Patrick's, Mountjoy.  In the other part 1 per cent of the population &mdash; that is 1 per cent of 50,000 to 60,000 people in Ballyfermot &mdash; get a crack at a third level education and they make up 17 per cent of the population at St. Patrick's in Mountjoy.  The gap is becoming wider.  With regard to the facilities provided in that area in recent years in a <Col N="304" /> regional college, it turned out that most of the students came from places outside that area, although the facilities were provided for the area.  We must cut through this unfair system.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that the educational system will be torn down &mdash; the system which leads into the third level institutions and which only the advantaged can use to get there.  These factories, after secondary schools have dealt with the students, grind people who can afford to pay extra money into the universities and produce the continual cycle of sons of professional people contiuing to benefit at the expense of the disadvantaged.  If we start at the bottom with something like this Child Care and Protection Bill, we can change society, and this Bill is important enough to do that.</P>
    <P>If children are more cared for they grow up to be adjusted and balanced and they will be able to take their proper place in society.  There is nothing so pathetic as to see an innocent person being abused and the same goes for the abuse of animals. Just because animals are not human, people believe that they can be abused and that the owners can inflict any from of cruelty on them.  If we cannot have the right kind of approach towards our dumb animals, we cannot have it towards the children of our community.</P>
    <P>The burden of bringing up children is often just too great for the families to bear and as a result there is terrible hardship and suffering on innocent members of our society.  I find it extraordinary that when the Minister, as he is doing now, introduced Bills, which showed concern for helping and balancing our society, trying to help the disadvantaged and the suffering, he was attacked by well-meaning people, often by individuals and groups in society outside the House.  I wonder to the electorate realise that they have elected people to the House who do not put forward their points of view.  The electorate are not represented because I have heard people say that they have gone to individuals or groups and because of the opinions they had been given by such individuals and groups decided that a <Col N="305" /> piece of legislation was all right &mdash; in other words, it had got the <i>imprimatur.</i></P>
    <P>That is a disgraceful state of affairs.  Is it any wonder that there is criticism when progressive, forward looking legislation is introduced?  It is to be expected; and I am sure the Minister, with his great experience, is not surprised at the arguments coming from the most conservative groups in our society.  This, after all, is a very conservative House, representing a very conservative people.  Those who are brave and courageous and who have the ability to try to improve society must do so against the will of the people who think they are doing best for society, the people who are supposed to be giving the lead in showing us how to look after those children; the people who tell us how to love our children and our neighbours and our brothers, how to share equally, how to give equal opportunities, how to be tolerant, humane and Christian.  Not even the practitioners of those precepts, not even those ordained to carry those tasks, are able to put them into practice.</P>
    <P>I challenge members of Christian religions in Ireland to show me that they are making their precepts work.  In their own lives those people are unable to do it. There are a few people, whom you could possibly count on the fingers of two hands, who are setting a lead quietly on the ground, living with the poor and their problems.  Those people know that in order to help the disadvantaged they must get out among them.  You must never think of people more disadvantaged than yourself and refer to them as &ldquo;they&rdquo;.  This is a common flaw and a common giveaway by the patronage dispensers.  They themselves can drive from one district to another and not see the problems around them.  They can pass by needy children and not be moved, and stop half a mile down the road where they live in luxury.</P>
    <P>It is about time somebody took the bull by the horns and faced this blot on society.  It is about time somebody broke down the barriers erected in 1908.  It appears that one must go to certain institutions for permission to do anything in regard to social legislation because this <Col N="306" /> has been claimed as their domain.  I commend the Minister and the Bill for trying to break down those barriers and get at the problems that they have caused.</P>
    <P>A TD would have to be blind if he did not see the terrible sufferings and hardships that exist outside.  Many of us are blind, and the House has been universally blind in many instances, particularly during the last week we sat when we attempted to rush through legislation in order to enrich a bunch of scoundrles who are robbing the poor in order to enrich themselves.</P>

      <P>On the Bill, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about gaming by way of swindling machines.  The Bill is dealing with victims of those whom I have just referred to.  Much of the care and protection to be afforded by this Bill will go to children of parents who have been swindled and improverished by such injustices in our society.  I suggest that Deputies Fahey and Glenn should have thought more carefully about that when making their contributions.  We are not looking at children in isolation.  We must look at the reasons why the problems are there, and the causes.  We must try to eliminate those causes and give an umbrella of protection.</P>
      <P>I do not regard this as State interference in the same way as institutions with certain beliefs and codes would try to protect children.  There are no prejudices in this Bill, whose benefits will be open to all children, to all members of society. The idea is to have the children returned to their parents or substitute parents as soon as possible.  There is an extremely important thread running through the Bill, the attempt to stop child abuse. Games have been played with the health boards and other authorities when people who should not have their children back try to fool the authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember the terrible crimes against children that have taken place in the last few months in Britain and throughout the world.  In Ireland, Britain and the US child abuse has come very <Col N="307" /> much to the fore, and it is plain that the spirit of the Bill is to the help to provide resources from the protection of children against abuses of all kinds.  The Bill does not propose to interfere, and I am sure the Minister does not want to get involved in family life.  His ideas is to intervence only when family life breakes down.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill provides for the strengthening of the powers of health boards to provide child care and family support services.  There is a growing need for such services.  Sometimes the need arises because a woman wants to go on working after raising a family, and so that children can receive proper care and attention and have an opportunity of learning to mix with other children. There are pressures on families living in newly developed areas where there are few facilities.  Mothers of young families who are housed in strange surroundings and a distance from their relatives live under a terrible strain.  There is also a need for alternatives to placing children in full time care where their parents are only temporarily unable to care for them.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Bill adopts a brave approach in regard to the children of single parents and the children of travellers. Under the heading of preventive measures in the explanatory memorandum there is a reference to the fact that for disadvantaged children and working parents day care services were an important source of support.  There is a great need for some support for single parents because on their own it is difficult for them to hold down a job and rear a child. Single mothers, and travellers, have been treated as the pariahs in our society in recent years.  I often hear criticism of decisions to provide services and housing for single mothers.  There is a terrible prejudice against them in our society. People should remember that the prejudice also applies to the child, an innocent party that must be protected.  I have no doubt that the Minister will be attacked because he has tried to provide something for such people in the Bill.  The critics will suggest that if one becomes a single mother all types of services will be <Col N="308" /> available, such as housing, and that under the Bill it will be possible to put a child into a day care centre where the State will look after him or her, as if there was something wrong with that.  This all goes to emphasise the hypocritical nature of our society.  There is no substitute for parental love and the best one can do is to provide for the needs of children.</P>
    <P>The objective in the Bill is to try as far as possible as to cut down the amount of institutional care and substitute foster care and love for children.  Most of the children involved are very young and impressionable.  What they need is love and I do not think it makes a lot of difference if a child is blessed with Holy Water, has prayers read to it from the bible or Hare Krishna type singing if that child is given plenty of love and care.</P>
    <P>We need and alternative to placing children in full time care where parents are temporarily unable to care for them. We need to provide adequate family support services because the welfare of children is inseparable from the welfare of families.  Some families need a lot more support than others.  That need may arise due to factors such as the size of the family.  Large families are often promoted vigorously by the religious leaders in our society whose proponents are now trying to pick holes in the Bill and are saying, &ldquo;My God we are going to lose our religion?&rdquo;  It would be no harm if we lost our religion because of what it means and does to our society in a lot of cases. Perhaps we should start afresh by being more humane to each other.  Some need more support than others because a single parent may be involved or economic factours such as a low income or because of social conditions.  Many people have been made to feel that they are bad parents because they are unable to provide for the needs of their children.  It is important that the basic needs of children are provided. The harsh reality here is that many people cannot afford to maintain their families.  We must recognise that and provide adequate support for them.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill recognises that where a child must be cared for other than by its family that the most desirable approach is <Col N="309" /> to provide the care required with another family rather than in an institutional setting. Institutional settings have meant that thousands of our adults will have a lifetime of nightmares.  The horrors of institutional care, some of which have been documented, have come to us from those who lived through them.  Some of my relations who were orphaned went to those institutions and left the country with bitterness in their hearts because of the treatment meted out of them.  The institutions were almost militarised in their approach.  Orphans were used in boarding schools &mdash; in fact, they were used at Clongowes Wood College for years until they reached the age of 14 &mdash; to clean out dormitories and look after refectories being used by the young gentleman about to take their place in our society.  Most of those children were not educated by the Jesuits.  It often puzzled me why they were not given an education.  In fact, they were not allowed use the facilities provided for the young gentlemen, such as the swimming pool or the courts.  In their free time those orphans went to the nearest shop to buy crisps and so on and told of their dreams and prayers that they would soon reach the age of 14 or 15 so that they could leave school and take the boat to England, never to return.  We are trying to redress such happenings in the Bill. Those who think they know better want control over the minds and bodies of such children.  The approach outlined in the Bill is a healthy one.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provided for the registration of residential facilities for deprived children. That will cover residential homes, the former industrial schools, for which the Minister has assumed responsibility from the Minister for Education, and homes approved under the Health Acts for the reception of children in need. That area was in a sorry state when it was under the control of Education.  The treatment of pupils in those institutions was often too brutal to relate.  The Department of Health, the Minister, and the boards, will give more protection to a child and provide a better opportunity for such a child to be taken care of by a <Col N="310" /> family.  This is in line with the policy of promoting foster care as the first option in caring for children apart from their families and preventing unnecessary or inappropriate use of residential care facilities. I am glad that is the case and that the Minister recognises that where a child cannot be cared for by his family the most desirable approach is to provide the care he or she requires in a family rather than in an institutional setting.  I do not wish to denigrate the excellent service provided for many years by children's homes but I am sure we all accept that in most cases it is better for a child to grow up in a family and I am glad that this has been recognised in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are and will continue to be cases where children's homes will be better suited to the care of certain children. However, such cases usually involve children who need specialist care on a long or short term basis.  Some of those children need to be assessed, others need emergency short term care and some children do not wish to be fostered.  The Bill is brave in regard to many areas and it will give rise to a lot of discussion.  For example, Part V, dealing with custody, provides for a new procedure which would enable persons bringing up a child to obtain a custody order granting them legal custody of the child which would prevent an abuse of the rights of a child who is placed by parents in foster care. At present such child may be removed at any time regardless of how attached he or she has become to the foster parents.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Bill is to protect the interests of the child by affording legal recognition to the relationship with the foster family and securing it against arbitrary and precipitous interference.  I am sure that will give rise to discussion and the objective is right.  However, it can be provided for in enabling legislation and I will come back to that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Bill is to be as broad as possible and to cater for all the exigencies and difficulties that may arise. It must also have the child in mind all the time.  That is very welcome because long <Col N="311" /> ago we did not look on the child as someone who had rights.  In fact we did not consider that youth had any rights.  Children were pushed around &mdash; perhaps not intentionally &mdash; but in those days they did what they were told, did not ask any questions and were seen but not heard. They did not speak in the presence of adults and nobody ever asked their opinion about anything.  We have made tremendous advances since then inbehavioural science and children have been studied and are now treated as human beings with rights and privileges. An attempt has been made to cater for this in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill provides for procedures to ensure that children in the need of care and protection receive it.  Section 25 extends the powers of the health board to take children into voluntary care.  At present a health board may receive children into voluntary care only when they have been abandoned or where their parents are dead or destitute.  There are many othere cases where parents may need to place their children in voluntary care, for example, in cases of marital breakdown or family crises and I am glad that the Bill recognises that the health boards can accept children into care in these situations.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill is also significant in that it places an obligation on health boards to promote the welfare of children in their areas.  The big worry in providing care and protection for children is very often in the area of abuse and in making sure that there is access to children suspected of being at risk.  Social welfare workers should know what is going on and this must be a big worry to the Minister in formulating the Bill because there have been horrible killings in Britain and the finger was pointed at the social welfare workers.  It is a very difficult area and I hope this will be successful in providing protection for these children.  We are very fortunate in having wonderful health boards nurses and others who look after children.  We have the kind of society in which that system works although with Dublin expanding so rapidly it is not easy <Col N="312" /> to become familiar with all the families in an area.  Houses in estates change hands rapidly and it is difficult to get to know people.  Perhaps the Minister for the Environment could appeal to Dublin Corporation to do something with their estates and to plan them better in the future so that they would include a mix of houses and smaller compact areas.  They should get away from their terrible, closed mind attitudes and stop building these inappropriate housing estates which create so many problems.  They are now so bad that even murders are taking place in them.  Children could be better cared for if these estates were more manageable.</P>
    <P>Most Ministers do not act on the suggestions of backbenchers and, therefore, it is very difficult to implement their ideas.  I have suggested in the past that instead of having housing lists we should give loans through the Housing Finance Agency which would not require a deposit so that we could have a natural mix of people around the city.  These people could buy their houses where they liked and this could greatly help to diminish the problems in these estates.</P>
    <P>I will reserve my more detailed comments until the Committee Stage.  Section 27 provides that in an emergency a garda would be empowered to remove, without warrant, a child whose safety required that he be a removed.  While I have many problems with the Bill, which will have to be tested out, I welcome this provision which attempts to safeguard children.  I know what the Minister is trying to get at here.  This section is trying to safeguard children and to prevent the terrible tragedies we have read about recently happening here, but I would be happier if this power were extended to social workers attached to health boards.  It goes without saying that I realise there are dreadful problems in this area and that serious accusations are made when individuals are given authority to pay money to people in need.  The public come to clinics and complain about this or that officer and it can be difficult to sort out these problems.  The Minister is making a brave attempt in this Bill and I am glad he did <Col N="313" /> not sit down and take instructions from just one group.  If he had followed the suggestions of previous speakers we would have a very restricted Bill of one or two pages but we would still have the same problems.  We might end up with the same 97 per cent of people with one religion but it would be religion in name only.  I would prefer to see this power vested in social workers because they are trained to deal with these matters and are directly involved in monitoring families and so on.</P>
    <P>When considering such laudable measures to protect children from neglect, we must also consider the prevention of such cases.  Studies of the parents of non-accidentially injured children indicate that they often have personal and social problems, have a low threshold of tolerance and overreact under such stress as a child crying.  Such families required considerable emotional and practical support until some of the stresses have diminished. However comprehensive the support for families in such a situation is, adequate protection for children is only possible if the health boards are given additional funds to provide the necessary services.</P>
    <P>The Bill has many good provisions in relation to the care of children namely, the recognition of the importance of care for children in their own families and the role of family support services in ensuring this, the proposal to register day care facilities, the recognition of children's rights <i>vis-à-vis</i> parents' rights, the commitment to develop foster care services, and the commitment to ascertain and consider children's wishes to relation to placement and care.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to emphasise once again that we need to safeguard children's welfare by providing adequate financial support for the family and by providing adequate support services to aid families in trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister for allowing me time to make a few comments. I welcome this Bill, which is very important.  It is the first major development since 1908 and is a genuine effort to strengthen and update the law on child <Col N="314" /> care.  It is particularly important for people in the social area to have a strengthening of the legislative position. The support required is provided in this Bill, but there are a couple of sections which need to be strengthened because they are a bit vague.  On Committee Stage we will have an opportunity to put down amendments to them.</P>
      <P>Like other speakers I would like to see a preventative service in this area.  We have seen in other countries recently some terrible tragedies involving children and the social and health workers were blamed for the problem, but perhaps the support they needed to provide a comprehensive service was not there in the first instance.  I welcome this Bill which will provide, to a large extent, the support and help needed to provide adequate services, particularly the preventative area.</P>
      <P>As a society we are very strong on the family unit and the position of the family is safeguarded in the Constitution. Every effort should be made to ensure that the family unit is maintained and the separation of families should be a last resort. The existing agencies should get the backup services necessary to prevent anything like this happening, because all children have a right to a secure family environment and foster care should be a last resort.  There are many foster parents doing a tremendous job providing a very happy environment for needy children; but difficulties can arise, for instance, in the area are of medical treatment or issuing passports.  Legislative support is very much needed where passports for these children are concerned.  It is important that due consideration be given to these issues.  I hope to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill on Committee Stage.</P>

I thank Deputies for their contributions but I have great difficulty in thinking Deputy Glenn for her contribution because, frankly, I think she has some appallingly erroneous misconceptions about the thrust and import of this <Col N="315" /> legislation.  The only charitable response I can make is that, if she wishes to meet me and the officers of my Department, we will exert every effort to dispel these serious misconceptions.  I very much regret that she named in this House four or five people who are not Deputies and who have no opportunity of refuting the implications on their personal integrity.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The country and in particular the major cities and urban areas are plagued at present by an avalanche of crime, lawlessness and vandalism.  The crimes of robbery and burglary have reached epidemic proportions.  No house, business premises or home is safe.  For many citizens their homes have become virtual fortresses to be guarded night and day from attack and break-in and these realities have been referred to in this House quite often in recent times.  People have to leave somebody to mind their houses night and day.  If a person goes to a funeral, a wedding or to any other occasion and where it might appear that their house will be empty, it is very likely that the premises will be broken into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new sense of anxiety and fear stalks the community.  The knock on the door of the home of the elderly person or woman living alone now often means the beginning of a frightening experience. Even those people who have not yet fallen victim to this crime wave pay indirectly through a doubling of the cost of home and motor insurance and the cost of extra security.  People throughout the <Col N="316" /> community have to make special arrangements to protect their homes and businesses and they have to provide additional security which is now regarded as a normal cost and expense.  Thus, the public are paying threefold for the Minister's failure to deal effectively with crime.  We have to pay through income tax, we are the victims of crime and now we are paying extra insurance costs at all levels.</P>
    <P>While the Minister for Justice speaks publicly about slight reductions in the overall level of indictable crime from the record level of 102, 387 in 1983, the real problem is the massive increase in the level of crime during the past six years. Total indictable crime rose from 62,000 in 1978 to 99,727 in 1984.  That is taking a year after the peak year of 1983 when the figure was over 102,000.</P>
    <P>The total increase in the general level of crime is something beyond party politics and it is something the Minister has been very slow to recoganise as being outside the ambit of party policies.  It is something about which all of us are concerned. It is not a matter for public relations statements to the effect that there has been a 2.5 per cent or 2.6 per cent decrease in crime from the peak year of 1983.  What we are faced with is the total level of crime as we experience it in society today and, as I have indicated, that has grown out of all proportion in the past six years.</P>
    <P>The bulk of this crime is burglary and larceny which together account for the figure of 94,184 or 93 per cent of all crime.  The following figures show how important this kind of crime is to the community.  Total indictable crime is 97,727 and crimes of burglary, larceny and robbery amount to 94,184.  That figure is made up of 35,228 burglaries, 1,129 aggravated burglaries, 1,1799 robberies, 79 robberies with arms and 55,947 larcenies.  I mentioned these figures to show the extent to which the larceny and burglary affects the crime situation.  It is the major content of indictable crime and it is clear that any steps that can be taken to deter or detect this kind of crime will have a major impact on the total level <Col N="317" /> of crime experienced today.  If we can reduce the level of larceny and burglary we will bring back sanity and peace to our streets and our homes.</P>
    <P>One way to do this is to reduce the market for stolen goods.  Of course there are other ways and we will discuss them on another day.  The Minister will have our support in any measures he takes to reduce the general level of crimes but one way in which it can be done is to reduce the market for stolen goods.  It is well known that crime today pays.  It is unlikely that the offences will be detected. For instance, in the Dublin Metropolitan Area only one larceny in every four was detected in 1984 &mdash; the figure is 24 per cent.  Some 75 per cent of larcenies went undetected and the perpetrators went scot-free.  That is the reality.  People are getting away with crime and it is paying them in money terms.</P>
    <P>It is when we look at the value of these stolen goods that we realise the full extent of the business side of crime in Ireland today.  It is big business.  During the same six year period the total value of property stolen has increases steadily from £10.3 million in 1978 to £34.5 million in 1984. There has been a steady increase each year in that period.  The sum increased from £10.3 million to £11.5 million.  In 1981 the figure was £20 million, in 1982 it was £29 million, in 1983 some unusual items were included and the figure increased to £43 million and in 1984, which was the last year reported, the figure was £34.5 million.</P>
    <P>The value of goods recovered amounted to only £2.57 million in 1984 or 7.5 per cent.  The recovery rate is extremely small.  Some £32 million of stolen goods were not recovered.  They found their way into the legal market and the criminals involved had a lucrative turnover, a turnover that would tax all the energies of the major corporations to handle and to distribute such volume of business.  The majority of burglaries today do not yield cash.  The thief has to settle for goods such as jewellery, videos, stereos, electrical equipment, silverware and other valuables.  If he is to continue in business he needs to find dishonest <Col N="318" /> handlers or fences to receive the goods. Stolen goods must be stored, hidden and transported to their destination.  They must be sold with the proceeds being laundered back into society, because the ultimate objective is to make money that can be used for other purposes.</P>
    <P>The legislation to deal with this problem is well out of date and requires amendment.  That is why Fianna Fáil have put forward this Larceny (Amendment) Bill.  The Bill is designed to update the law in this important area of crime, to close the loopholes that have been identified, to strengthen the hand of the Garda in detecting and in prosecuting and to curb this incrative business of dealing in and handling stolen goods.  We are seeking in the Bill to have some legislative action taken in this area, action that we believe would be helpful and which could have a major impact in reducing crime in this area and making such crime less worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be wise to stop tinkering with the crime statistics and to address the real problem.  The value of stolen property has trebled and this has been reflected in the cost of insurance to the law abiding citizen.  In this fourth year in office, the Minister is still found wanting with the public once again carrying the cost.  The law which governs the crime of receiving stolen goods is the Larceny Act of 1916 but this has long been regarded as obsolete and ineffective by judges, lawyers, the Garda and undoubtedly by the criminal.  One distinguished judge of the Circuit Court, Judge Frank Martin, when dealing with criminal cases highlighted repeatedly the inadequacies of section 33 of that Act and called for an amendment to create an offence of handling stolen goods.  It is not as if this was something new.  The Garda have been seeking increased powers in this area and the courts have been calling for action.  Clearly, a general review and updating of our criminal law, with all its antiquated distinctions between felonies, misdemeanours, penal servitude and imprisonment, is long overdue.  When we are returned to Government we will embark on such a process and it will <Col N="319" /> include a codification of the criminal law in this area.  However, the extent of the review required will mean that such a process will take some time but the criminal can be relied on to exploit to the full any delay.  Any change that can render it easier for the Garda to deal with the current crisis and which can be enacted now ought to be enacted now.  There is every reason for taking steps at this time to close these various loopholes.</P>
    <P>There are a number of obvious deficiencies in the present law.  While it is an offence to receive stolen property knowing it to have been stolen, it is not an offence to receive such property believing it to have been stolen.  It is more difficult to prove that a person knew an item to be stolen than to prove that he believed the item was stolen.  It is an offence only to receive the stolen property. It is not an offence to receive or handle the proceeds of the sale of stolen property.  Surely the proceeds of the sale of stolen property should come within the ambit of the Act.  In every receiving case the onus is on the prosecution to prove that a person found in the possession of stolen property knew at the time he received the property that it was stolen but that onus is very difficult to discharge.</P>
    <P>To sustain a prosecution for receiving stolen property it is necessary to prove that the property was received by the accused into his possession.  Under the present law only a very small proportion of the types of activity involved in the disposal of stolen property could lead to a successful prosecution.</P>
    <P>The law provides that certain criminal activities, such as being in a building with intent to commit a felony, are offences only if committed at night and &ldquo;night&rdquo; is defined as being between the hours of 9 p.m. and 6 a.m.  In the matter of stealing, even of house breaking, the offences can be committed readily by day and certainly outside the hours of 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.  The specifying of those hours indicates the nature of society at the time the legislation was enacted.  It is interesting that burglary was regarded then as the <Col N="320" /> very serious crime of breaking and entering by night.  Up to the last century the crime was punishable by death.  The punishable by death aspect has been removed in the meantime but the by night aspect has remained as an anachronism in the law.</P>
    <P>The law as enacted in 1916 did not provide for the modern sophisticated equipment used by burglars and thieves today nor did it envisage the use of such disguises as crash helmets and balaclavas.</P>
    <P>Time has passed and the criminals in their own industry have used different methods and different equipment.  To that extent the law is lagging far behind. This makes the job of the Garda extremely difficult in relation to proving that someone was engaged in the business of larceny or burglary and in particular that instruments carried by an accused were carried for the purpose of such an offence.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the House to provide remedies for the problem.  The remedies we purpose are in relation, first, to the handling of stolen property.  Our Bill proposes to remedy these deficiencies.  We are proposing that the handling of stolen property, knowing or believing it to have been stolen, replace the present offence. This would penalise not only receivers but also those who convey stolen property to any place after a theft and also those who would take charge of or hide the property or those who would negotiate for the sale of it.</P>
    <P>The present law provides only for the offence of stealing or receiving stolen property.  There is no offence in regard either to handling the stolen goods or to handeling the proceeds of the sale of them. The new definition would include a person who in the course of his otherwise innocent employment criminally removes stolen property &mdash; for example, a dishonest driver employed by a dishonest haulier.  If a driver becomes involved in a dishonest way in handling the goods and is an essential link in distributing them or in hiding them he would be commiting an offence.  Our Bill proposes to bring within the ambit of the offence not only a person who knew that the goods <Col N="321" /> he received were stolen but also the one who believed them to have been stolen.</P>
    <P>In addition to extending the scope of the activity necessary to involve a criminal sanction we are proposing also to extend the scope of what constitutes stolen property.  It is intolerable that a person who handles the proceeds of the sale of stolen property, knowing or believing he is doing just that, is immune from prosecution.  Our Bill would close that loophole.</P>
    <P>Another matter is the question of the burden of proof.  Under our criminal law the onus of proving guilt rests, as a general rule, with the prosecution as opposed to the onus of establishing innocence resting with the defence.  In general that is a good rule and should be preserved, but there are exceptions.  For example, under section 28 of the present Larceny Act once it is proved that a person has been found by night in possession of housebreaking implements there is an onus on him to advance a lawful excuse for that possession.  A similar situation exists in certain cases involving persons found in possession of instruments for use in forgery. Until the courts decided otherwise in 1966 in the case of the People versus Oglesby it was generally thought that a similar rule applied to persons found in possession of recently stolen goods. Obviously it was considered up to that time that the same rule applied where the goods were recently stolen.  In the Oglesby case the accused was tried and convicted in the Dublin Circuit Court on a charge of receiving a tape recorder, the property of Córas Iompair Éireann, knowing it to have been stolen.  The tape recorder had been removed from a car on 4 March 1965 and was found in the accused's house on 15 May 1965.  The accused informed the Garda that he had purchased the recorder from a man in a pub.  We have heard that story fairly often, or that something fell off the back of a lorry.  The trial judge, Judge Conroy, gave a full direction to the jury on the burden of proof and informed the jury that if they rejected the explanation of the accused as to his possession of the recorder they were entitled to convict. <Col N="322" /> On the application by the accused for leave to appeal it was held by the Court of Criminal Appeal that the trial judge's directions to the jury were unsatisfactory because his remarks made in the course of his charge might have caused the jury to think the issue which they had to try was whether they accepted or rejected the explanation given by the accused and that if they rejected it they should convict.</P>
    <P>Decisions given before the year 1935 in relation to the so-called doctrine of recent possession in receiving cases, in so far as they decide that an onus of proof lies on an accused person in possession of goods which have been recently stolen to give an explanation or in so far as they decide that the jury may convict if they reject the explanation given, must now be regarded as incorrect.  The Woolmington case in 1935 applies in that case &mdash; AC462.</P>
    <P>The so-called doctrine of recent possession does not shift or discharge the onus which rests on the prosecution of proving that on all the evidence the accused was guilty.</P>
    <P>The so-called doctrine of recent possession does not exist.  It is a convenient way of referring to inferences of fact which, in the absence of a satisfactory explanation, may be drawn as a matter of common-sense from other facts.</P>
    <P>When a person charged with receiving goods knowing them to be stolen gives an explanation in answer to the charge, it is the duty of the trial judge to state to the jury what the explanation was.  He may then comment on it.</P>
    <P>It is evident that the decision brought to an end reliance on the so-called doctrine of recent possession as a prosecution weapon in the fight against crime.  This effectively brought about a major change as far as the powers of the Garda were concerned in relation to the doctrine of recent possession of stolen goods and adversely affected their position in relation to obtaining prosecutions.  Still nothing has been done about that.</P>
    <P>I retrieved from the Library the report on crime of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána for the year ended 30 <Col N="323" /> September 1966.  It makes very interesting reading.  The total number of offences recorded was 19,029, In 1983 the figure passed 100,000 and in 1984 the figure was marginally under 100,000 &mdash; over 99,000. That is the kind of change we see in our society when we walk in the streets.  They may not have been quite so excited about larceny and the handling of stolen goods in the sixties and seventies but in recent times this has become a major problem, especially in urban areas.  Perhaps that is why no action was taken in the early years.  We are now in a totally different crime situation which cannot be dealt with by small changes here and there.</P>
    <P>We are putting to the House the changes proposed by this Bill.  Section 33 (a) (2) of this Bill goes some way to reinstate that doctrine.  The essential ingredients are (a) property recently stolen, (b) found in the accused's possession, (c) without a satisfactory explanation. These three elements will now constitute sufficient evidence that an accused knew or believed the property to be stolen at the time he handled it.  This provision would make common-sense.  It would merely provide that once a prosecution have established in any handling case that the accused was found in possession of property recently stolen there would be an onus on the accused to provide a satisfactory explanation of how he came to be in possession of the property. Such a rule would not prejudice the innocent man.  He would merely have to explain that when he obtained the property he did not know or believe it to be stolen.  It would certainly facilitate the conviction of the guilty man who would not be able to furnish a plausible explanation which would establish his innocence. Only persons found in possession of recently stolen property would be affected.  We are satisfied that the introduction of such a rule of evidence would be of enormous assistance to the Garda in their fight against those who seek to profit dishonestly from the misfortunes of others.  This Bill contains such a proposal.</P>
    <P>One blatant anachronism in the <Col N="324" /> present Act is the assumption that robberies and burglaries are committed at night.  It is an offence for a person to be found at night with his face blackened with the intent to commit such offences. It is an offence to be found at night with housebreaking implements.  Regardless of what the situation was 70 years ago, crime is now an around-the-clock activity and probably more burglaries happen during the day than at night.  The advent of the balaclava and the crash helmet has lessened the necessity to use shoe polish to blacken the face.  Times have changed but the law has not.  This Bill will remedy and update the law in these respects. Regardless of time of day or night it will be an offence for a person to be found with his face disguised or concealed in order to facilitate or evade the consequences of a robbery or burglary or other such offence.  Possession of housebreaking implements &mdash; the crow, the pick lock and the jack of Victorian times &mdash; will still remain an offence.  It will also be an offence to be found with modern, more sophisticated implements made or adapted for use in the commission of not only offences such as robberies and burglaries but also the unlawful taking of or interference with motor vehicles.  That is why we have the references to sections 112 and 113 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, in order to tie in the equipment which would be used in going about by day or by night for the breaking and entering and the stealing of goods from cars.</P>
    <P>Tracing stolen property &mdash; section 33 (B) of the proposed amendments extends the limits to which stolen property may be traced.  Under this section the definition of &ldquo;stolen property&rdquo; includes not alone stolen property but any transmutation of the stolen property.  For example, a stolen painting may be swapped for a BMW car.  At that stage, by virtue of the provisions of section 33 (B), the BMW will represent the stolen property in the hands of either the thief or the handler. All the provisions which would attach to the stolen property will attach to the property representing the stolen property, in this case the BMW.  Explanation <Col N="325" /> will be required as to how it came into the possession of the person charged.  That is particularly important because we have seen many examples of people who organise and arrange crime who will not be caught with the stolen property itself in their possession.  They will ensure that it is the proceeds or the realisation of the stolen property which they have.  At present it is not an offence to have these proceeds in one's possession.  In our Bill we are proposing that it should be an offence to have the proceeds and to have any transmutation of the stolen property included as such stolen property in the hands of the handlers, the fences or any of the people along the line, including of course the thief himself or indeed herself.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for codification and change.  The remaining sections of the Bill are of a technical nature covering consequential amendments and transitional provisions.  The offence of handling is a completely new one.  It is not contained in any of our Acts at present and would henceforth carry penalties.  Therefore we are saying, in section 4.33 (2) (a) that a person guilty of handling stolen property shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to both the fine and the imprisonment; or (b) on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £5,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years, or to both the fine and imprisonment.  Those are the penalties we propose for the handling offences, the handling of stolen goods or their proceeds.</P>
    <P>We know that no amount of piecemeal amendment can replace an overall examination of the criminal law, even if limited to offences against property and its possession, which will result in a codification of the law.  It is fair to say that the criminal law is now a labyrinth of Acts, amendment and amendment of amendment which taxes even the skills of those expert in its administration.  The law, and in particular the criminal law, must be accessible to lawyer and criminal alike. It goes without saying that it must be <Col N="326" /> accessible to the legislator without the need for experts to tread a clear passage to understanding.  The way to this understanding is through codification.</P>
    <P>The primary statute dealing with the stealing of property is the Larceny Act, 1916, which, to give it its full title: &ldquo;An Act to solidate and simplify the Law relating to Larceny triable on Indictment and Kindred Offences.&rdquo;  That Act has served the State well in the prosecution to conviction of persons committing any of the offences set out in that Act.  Naturally the changes which have taken place in society in the 70 years of the statute's existence have rendered parts of that Act less effective, both as a result of the wiliness of the criminal mind as much as the changes in the judicial interpretation. The fact that the Act has lost some of its effectiveness in itself is sufficient reason to amend and update its provisions.  The British Larceny Act had full force and effect in the United Kingdom until the passage of their Theft Act in 1968.  They changed their Larceny Act in 1968 when they had growing problems at that time in relation to larceny and burglary.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out with the benefit of statistics, the problems here were not of such a great order at that time.  Perhaps we could excuse those who went before us at that time for not changing this Act in that period.  For example, the total number of offences of larceny in 1966 was 11,791.  However, things have changed drastically since then.  We have lagged very seriously behind, particularly bearing in mind the tremendous increase in this area of crime over the past five or six years.  In the United Kingdom the Larceny Act had been found to be lacking. Rather than engage in piecemeal reform the United Kingdom Parliament replaced the Larceny Act with a new comprehensive Act.  Therefore they introduced their Theft Act in 1968 and comprehensively updated the whole area of larceny.</P>
    <P>The provisions of our Bill will not end the dishonest handling of stolen goods but will lead to the conviction of many criminals who are today virtually immune from prosecution, and who know it. <Col N="327" /> These provisions will lead to the recovery of stolen goods and their proceeds.  We are recovering approximately only 7½ per cent of stolen goods and that is not sufficient. The present situation, in which without an admission of guilt it is virtually impossible to convict the dishonest handler, particularly if he appears to be a pillar of society, cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>Whether in Government or in Opposition Fianna Fáil would be failing in their duty to the people if we did not do all in our power to bring these criminals to justice.  The Government, who have failed already to introduce the necessary legislation, will be compounding that failure if they obstruct our efforts.  I ask them to put the national interest first, to leave aside party political considerations and to join us in the fight against crime.  The Minister may well contend that there are some technical matters on which he would have particular views in relation to this Bill and that he would like to suggest amendments of one type or another.  Any Bill that comes before this House is subjected to some form of amendment in the course of its passage.  Indeed some of the Minister's previous Bill were subjected to a great deal of amendment.  We all put a great deal of time into those amendments and supported the Minister in that work.  If the Minister has any amendments we shall be quite happy to consider them and ascertain whether it is possible to reach agreement on the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is time we showed people outside this House that the whole question of crime &mdash; and this Bill must surely cover one of the major areas of crime affecting our society today &mdash; is being tackled. Surely we can work together in order to find a solution in this instance.  We have put forward a proposal here, a Bill to deal with this problem which in our view would have a very great effect on crime today.  We ask the Minister and the Government to give it their support and to join with us in defeating and reducing this kind of crime.</P>

      <P>In order to explain the reasons why the Government are opposing the Bill it is necessary to begin by outlining briefly what the Larceny Acts are about.  Those Acts, principally the Larceny Act, 1916, contain a range of offences penalising dishonest conduct.  These offences include various kinds of stealing, embezzlement, fraudulent conversion, obtaining property by false pretences, robbery, burglary, blackmail-type offences, receiving stolen property, and possession of housebreaking implements etc. by night.</P>
      <P>Essentially what the present Bill proposes to do is to replace two sections of the 1916 Act by new sections dealing, first, with going equipped for and other acts preparatory to, stealing etc. and, second, with handling stolen property. The long title gives the impression that the scope of the Bill is considerably wider but this is in fact quite misleading.  The long title states that one of the purposes of the Bill is &ldquo;to reform the law in relation to the carrying out of robbery, burglary and other such offences and, in particular, the commission of these offences in daytime&rdquo;.  The clear implication is that the Bill contains improvements of the law on robbery and burglary and that there is some gap in the law at the moment relating to the commission of those offences in the daytime.  I want to make it quite clear that this Bill proposes to make no changes in the law on the offences of robbery and burglary and that the definition of those offences under the present law makes no distinction of any kind between conduct engaged in during the daytime and something done at night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, the provisions of the Larceny Act relating to robbery and burglary are exceptional in that they have already <Col N="329" /> been reformed quite recently.  The Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, has already modernised and simplified the law relating to robbery and burglary.  It removed the old, technical distinctions between simple robbery and aggravated robbery and substituted a single, up-to-date offence of robbery.  It also did away with the complications of the old law relating to burglary and housebreaking, with its outmoded technicalities as to what constituted &ldquo;breaking&rdquo; and its distinctions between breaking in the night and breaking in the day and between breaking into dwelling houses and breaking into other kinds of buildings.  The 1976 Act replaced all this by two new, simplified offences of burglary and aggravated burglary.  In short, as a result of the 1976 Act our present law on robbery and burglary offences, far from being in need of major reform, is satisfactory and modern and the present Bill proposes no reforms in it.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the actual contents of the Bill.  It proposes to reproduce with modifications two groups of offences under the Larceny Act, 1916.  These are, first, the offences under section 28 of that Act of being found by night in possession of housebreaking implements etc. and, second, the offences under section 33 of receiving stolen property.  The modifications consist chiefly of adopting provisions similar to those contained in the English Theft Act, 1968, dealing with the corresponding offences under that Act. These are the offences under section 25 of the 1968 Act relating to going equipped for stealing, which corresponds to section 28 of the 1916 Act, and section 22 of the 1968 Act relating to handling stolen goods which corresponds to section 23 of the 1916 Act.  However, the efforts to incorporate into the 1916 Act provisions similar to those contained in the 1968 English Act have in many respects been less than successful and the text is very defective.</P>
    <P>Let me say, at this point and before I go into any further detail, that the criticisms I am obliged to make are not meant as &mdash; and should not be interpreted as being &mdash; a reflection on the competence <Col N="330" /> of those who produced the text.  I would like to stress that point.  The work involved in preparing Bills such as this is highly specialised and it is no reflection on people who can have little or no experience of that kind of work to say that this text does not in fact measure up to what is needed in a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>It would take a disproportionate amount of work, and would divert resources away from the Government's existing legislative programme, to have the adequacy of the Bill analysed in complete detail, and that is especially so when, as I hope to explain later, that would be only part of the task that would have to be undertaken, and the less demanding and time-consuming part.  However, a number of defects have become clear from a preliminary examination of its provisions.  Some of those defects are of such a nature that it would be unlikely to be possible to proceed with the Bill in a form closely resembling its present form. There are also some points in the Bill that would need to be considered further before the Government could agree to legislation of this kind being proceeded with.  A few examples will illustrate my point.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill deals with the possession of equipment for stealing and related offences.  It amends the Larceny Act, 1916, by substituting a new section for section 28.  Subsection (1) of the new section 28, which substantially reproduces section 25(1) of the English Theft Act, 1968, provides that a person shall be guilty of an offence if, when not at his place of abode, he has with him articles for use in the course of or in connection with any offence of stealing etc.  In the English Theft Act that offence of possession of equipment for stealing is the only offence that was created in substitution for those contained in section 28 of the 1916 Act.  However, the Bill before the House goes on to provide for three other offences, which reproduce with slight modifications a number of distinct offences that are contained in the existing section 28.  In the light of the new general offence provided for in subsection (1), the need for these other two offences is <Col N="331" /> very doubtful.  This is a situation where it is not possible to take the view that additional material, even if not required, could do no harm.  It could, potentially, do great harm for it could affect the interpretation of what is in subsection (1). One point that arises in that context is how, in a case covered both by subsection (1) and subsection (4), the question of onus of proof, which differs in the two subsections, would be determined.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) makes it an offence for a person to be found having in his possession without lawful excuse any key, picklock, etc. or other instrument of housebreaking.  This reproduces section 28(1) of the 1916 Act but extends it to daytime as well as night.  This additional offence seems to be superfluous given that subsection (1) covers possession of any article for use in the course of burglary etc.  Subsection (4) does differ from subsection (1) in that it puts on an accused person the onus of proving that he had a lawful excuse for possession of an instrument of housebreaking.  Even though an identical provision was contained in the 1916 Act, this is something that would need to be examined very carefully in the present specific context before its reenactment should be decided upon.  In any event, subsection (2) of section 28 would have the effect of requiring an accused to adduce evidence as to the innocence of his possession of an article once it was shown that it was an article made or adapted for use in stealing etc. In view of that provision, the need for the complete reversal of the onus of proof provided for in subsection (4) is not clear.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of the proposed new section 28 makes it an offence for a person to be found having his face blackened or disguised or concealed for the purpose of facilitating the commission, or evading the lawful consequences of any offence of stealing, or indeed of any offence under the 1916 Act.  It is difficult to envisage any real need for such an offence.  Wearing a mask would be covered by the offence under subsection (1) of having an article for use in the course of or in connection with stealing. <Col N="332" /> Other kinds of disguise are unlikely in this connection.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) of the new section 28 makes it an offence to be found in any building with intent to commit any offence therein.  This would replace section 28(4) of the 1916 Act which is confined to being found by night and where the intent required is to commit a felony.  The implications of transforming the existing offence so as to cover conduct in the daytime and to cover intent to commit any offence at all would need to be considered carefully.  Would it cover certain forms of conduct which might not appropriately constitute an offence at all? Would it, for example, make it an offence to be found in one's place of employment with intent to make a false return there? On the face of it, the provision is at least capable of being interpreted in such a way that it might have some unintended effects in areas that are not in any way related to preparation to commit crimes against property or against the person.</P>
    <P>In any event, the purpose of the provision, which presumably is to make it an offence to be present in a building with intent to commit such a crime, is met by the modernised offence of burglary which is provided for in the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976 and which I have already mentioned.  Under section 23A of the Larceny Act, 1916, as inserted by section 6 of the 1976 Act, a person is guilty of burglary if he enters any building or part of a building as a trespasser and with intent to commit any of the following offences: stealing anything in the building or part of a building in question, or inflicted grievous bodily harm on any person therein, or raping any woman therein or doing unlawful damage to the building or anything therein.  A person is also guilty of burglary if, having entered any building or part of a building as a trespasser, he steals or attempts to steal anything in the building or that part of it or inflicts or attempts to inflict grievous bodily harm on any person therein.  The maximum penalty for this offence is 14 year's imprisonment.  If a person commits any burglary and at the time has with him any firearm or imitation firearm or any <Col N="333" /> weapon of offence or any explosive, he is guilty of aggravated burglary and liable to imprisonment for life.  In short, the mischief at which subsection (5) of the proposed section 28 is aimed is already adequately catered for by the 1976 Act.</P>
    <P>There is one final point that I want to make about section 3 of the Bill.  Some media coverage of the Bill following its publication conveyed the impression that, because section 28 of the 1916 Act is confined to situations where somebody is found at night, there is a complete gap in the law as regards possession of housebreaking implements in the daytime. However, there is an offence of possession of housebreaking implements contained in section 4 of the Vagrancy Act, 1824, that is not confined to possession by night.  The maximum penalty for the offence under the 1824 Act is three months' imprisonment which is, of course, inadequate and very much less than the maximum penalties that are available under the 1916 Act.  Nevertheless, it is not the position that there is a gap in the law at the moment such that there is no offence at all with which a person found in possession of housebreaking implements in the daytime can be charged.</P>
    <P>I come now to section 4 of the Bill which substitutes three new sections for section 33 of the Larceny Act, 1916.  It replaces the present offence of receiving stolen goods with a new offence of handling stolen goods which is very similar to the offence of handling provided for in the English Theft Act, 1968.  There are two principal changes involved in the proposed new &ldquo;handling&rdquo; offence.  The first is that it would cover certain other kinds of meddling with stolen property besides simply receiving it into one's possession. I believe that such an extension of the present offence is desirable.  A proposed provision of a Criminal Law Bill which is being prepared at present would have a similar effect.  The present Bill would also make it an offence for a person to handle stolen property not alone where he knows it to be stolen, as at present, but also where he believes it to be stolen.  There is no doubt that a reform of the law of <Col N="334" /> this kind is desirable and would be of assistance in the bringing of presecutions. It should be mentioned, though, that this change might not meet all the claims that are sometimes made for it.  The impression is sometimes given that, if a reference to belief that the property was stolen was introduced into the definition of this offence, it would then be enough to prove that a person accused of &ldquo;handling&rdquo; suspected that the goods were stolen or deliberately closed his eyes to the obvious fact that they might have been.  However, that is not the effect of the English section as it has been interpreted by the courts. That is not an objection to the proposed new section 33, because a reference to &ldquo;belief&rdquo; would extend the scope of the offence appreciably anyway.  However, it is an aspect of the matter that would probably need to be examined more closely if such a provision were to be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>There are technical defects in the new sections substituted by section 4 of the Bill.  I will mention just a few of these by way of illustration.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) of the proposed new section 33 provides for a general offence of handling stolen property.  In addition, subsection (3) makes special provision for the handling of stolen mail bags, postal packets or other property taken from the post.  A provision of this kind was included in the 1916 Act but it seems to be inappropriate and unnecessary that a modern Bill should include special provision in relation to this kind of property. If any such provision were to be included, the Post Office Act, 1908, which includes related provisions, would have to be examined.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) of the proposed new section 33 reproduces with slight modifications an unsatisfactory provision in the 1916 Act in order to cover the &ldquo;handling&rdquo; in the State of property stolen etc., outside the State.  There are a number of defects in this provision.  For instance, it would mean that a person would be guilty of an offence of handling stolen property in this country even if the circumstances in which the property was obtained abroad in the first place would not have <Col N="335" /> constituted an offence under the law of the foreign country concerned, just so long as they would have constituted theft or unlawful obtaining under Irish law.  In other words, a person could be guilty of handling stolen property in Ireland even though the property was not stolen at all under the law of the place where it was originally obtained.  Also subsection (5) provides that the offence under it is to be a felony or a misdemeanour depending on whether the original unlawful obtaining of the property would have been a felony or misdemeanour if it had happened in the State.  There is a contradiction between this and section 5 of the Bill which says that offences under section 33 are felonies.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 33 B of the Bill defines stolen property in such a way as to include property directly or indirectly representing that which was originally stolen.  Section 46 (1) of the 1916 Act includes a defination of &ldquo;property&rdquo; which relates to the interpretation of the Act as a whole and accordingly would apply to the new section 33 B as well. That definition is inconsistent with the definition in subsection (2) of section 33 B.</P>
    <P>I think I have said enough to make it clear that, laudable though the objectives of the present Bill may be, it suffers from a number of serious defects which make it unacceptable as it stands.  I have not mentioned all the defects in it and those I have mentioned have been identified as a result of a necessarily incomplete examination.  If a fuller examination were made I feel sure that some other difficulties would come to light.</P>
    <P>It may be suggested that the Government, instead of opposing the Bill, should put down amendments to rectify these defects.  I am afraid that it simply would not be possible to do that at the present time consistently with the Government's existing legislative aims in priority areas. I want to make it quite clear that the fact that it has been possible to identify a number of defects, some of them serious, in the Bill in the short period since its publication, does not mean that I would <Col N="336" /> be in a position to come into the House in a further short period of time with legally accurate and satisfactory amendments which would put everything right with the Bill.  It is one thing to examine a Bill and identify the ways in which it is defective.  It is quite another day's work to come up with workable and precisely drafted solutions to the problem identified. The work that would be required to put the Bill right technically would really amount to re-drafting the Bill.</P>
    <P>The law in this area is very technical, tied up as it is with concepts of the land law of property.  The Theft Act of 1968 in England was hailed in its day, and rightly so, as major reform measure. However, I think it is fair to say that it has not been without its difficulties in operation because of the almost intractable nature of some of the problems that arise in this sphere of the law.  It was in fact amended by another Theft Act in 1978.  If the present Bill were to be adequately examined with a view to its being put into acceptable form, a considerable investment of resources would have to be made.  Staff in my Department who are engaged on other urgent legislation would have to be switched to the research and other work that would be needed if the substance of this Bill was to be properly examined.  As well as that, staff in the parliamentary draftsman's office would have to leave aside other work and take on this Bill.  All Governments have had the drafting of legislation done on a centralised basis by specialised draftsmen. The reason for this is that it enables special drafting expertise to be built up and that makes for greater consistency in drafting approach and technique across the whole range of legislation being promoted by different Departments.</P>
    <P>If the Government were to divert the resources that would be needed to deal adequately with the Bill at the present time, this would upset the Government's own legislative programme.  The legislation that is in the pipeline at the moment contains the measures that the Government regard as of most immediate priority.  The Bills I myself have on hands at the moment include the Bills on Garda <Col N="337" /> complaints, telephone tapping and domicile and the proposed Bills on the abolition of juries in personal injury actions and on liquor licensing.  It would be quite unacceptable that progress on these urgent measures should be delayed by taking the present Bill on board at this stage.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from all this why it has long been a tradition with Governments generally not to support Private Members' Bills unless in exceptional circumstances when the subject matter is suitable for such an approach.  The present Bill, involving as it does the complex and technical area of the Larceny Acts, is not in my view a suitable case for Private Members' Bill treatment at all.  I must emphasise, however, that I intend to bring forward legislation on the subject matter of the Larceny Acts at the first possible opportunity.  This would probably involve a more wideranging review of those Acts than is undertaken in this Bill.  I am not saying that that review must necessarily be a comprehensive one in the first instance, since that might be, and I suspect would be, an example of the best being the enemy of the good, but, as I have said, it would probably cover more than this Bill.  In principle, at all events, offences of theft, fraud and blackmail should also be covered since they too are in need of reform and modernisation but we shall have to see how far, in the interests of practical progress, it is useful to go intially.  The Government are currently engaged in an assessment of their priorities in relation to future law reform work and in this context I am looking at the possibility of an early review of the larceny Acts.  Meanwhile, it is surely inappropriate and wasteful to legislate on two aspects of the subject in isolation.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that a number of initiatives have already been taken which will help to counteract the particular kind of crime which the present Bill attempts to deal with.  The enactment of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, is concrete evidence of the Government's concern to provide the right legislative response to the difficult crime situation we face <Col N="338" /> today.  That Act addressed itself to the principal areas that were causing concern in our existing law relating to the investigation of crime and the trial and conviction of offenders.  Moreover, it did so in a way that was balanced and fair and posed no threat to fundamental rights and liberties. There is a special provision in the Act to tackle the particular problem of possession of stolen property.  There are also some provisions of general application which will be effective in dealing with those who engage in offences such as robbery, burglary, or receiving.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Criminal Justice Act, which relates to the witholding of information about stolen property, will strengthen the law to deal with persons found in possession of stolen property. Under the Act a person found in possession of property believed to have been stolen will be guilty of an offence if he fails or refuses, without reasonable excuse, to give an account to a garda who questions him as to how he came by that property.  This new provision will serve two purposes.  First, it will allow effective action to be taken against persons who are found in possession of stolen property but against whom there may be insufficient evidence to ground a charge for either larceny or receiving.  Second, it will enable the Garda to get at those whose business is the trade in stolen property.</P>
    <P>The Act also contains provisions which allow a court or jury to draw appropriate inferences from the failure or refusal of a person who has been arrested to account, when asked by a garda, for objects, substances etc., found in his possession or for his presence at a particular place at or about the time the offence for which he was arrested was committed.  Those provisions have an application to persons who commit thefts or burglaries or receive stolen property.  Any failure on their part to account for items in their possession, such as housebreaking implements or stolen goods, or for their presence near the scene of a crime, will be capable of giving rise to adverse inferences and strengthening the cases against them.</P>
    <P>The Act furthermore provides for a <Col N="339" /> new power of detention which allows the Garda to detain, for up to six hours, a person arrested without warrant, on suspicion of having committed an offence carrying a penalty of at least five years' imprisonment.  This period of detention may be extended on the authority of a Garda superintendent for a further period of six hours.  The new power of detention will, of course, apply to persons suspected by the Garda of the offences of stealing etc., and of receiving stolen property.</P>
    <P>The new detention provision will allow the Garda an opportunity to question persons suspected of these offences.  The Garda are also being empowered to photograph and fingerprint such persons and to carry out certain forensic tests. The evidence obtained from questioning and fingerprinting etc., I believe will help to improve the rate of detection of offences of this kind.  The power to fingerprint suspects should help in linking suspects to particular crimes.</P>
    <P>Certain other provisions of the Act, such as the strengthening of the law in relation to offences committed on bail, the changes in trial procedure and the Garda's new power to fingerprint persons convicted of an offence or dealt with under the Probation Act, will also have an effect, although perhaps more indirectly, on this type of crime.</P>
    <P>Some of the provisions of the Act to which I have referred are already in force but the rest await the establishment of the Garda Síochána Complaints Board and the making of regulations on the treatment of persons in custody.  When the Act as a whole is in operation I believe that it will make a big contribution to the prevention and detection of theft, burglary, etc.  My immediate priority, therefore, where legislation to deal with this sort of crime is concerned, is to get the Act into force by promoting the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill, 1985, and the treatment regulations, which are at a very advanced stage of preparation.</P>
    <P>Some very important initiatives on the policing front have been taken recently <Col N="340" /> to tackle the problem of thefts and burglaries. First, there is the neighbourhood watch scheme.  I have already had occasion to speak at some length in the House about what is involved in this scheme and it is unnecessary to go into it in detail again now.  There are more than 120 such schemes at various stages of implementation in urban areas and I understand that the Garda are very satisfied with the way they are working.  The response of the public to the scheme also has been very positive.  It is too early yet to be able to give any proper assessment of the result the system is achieving.  But I am confident that it will help to reduce the incidence of car thefts and burglaries in the areas where it is operating.  The Garda also have plans to introduce a system of marking of property in the context of neighbourhood watch.  This would facilitate the recovery of stolen property and would be a useful weapon against receivers.</P>
    <P>Another service that is being provided by the Garda is the Crime Prevention Advisory Service, which is a special unit within the Garda with overall responsibility for crime prevention.  Adequate security measures and increased vigilance by property owners are important elements in the fight against burglary and robbery.  The Crime Prevention Advisory Service is available to give advice to householders and business people about how to protect their property.</P>
    <P>Other measures are being pursued to involve the community at large in crime prevention activities and to forge closer links between the Garda and local communities. A policy of community policing is being formulated.  Some experiments have been carried out with a view to establishing police &ldquo;clinics&rdquo; in areas at a distance from a Garda station.  Such clinics would involve the attendance of a garda at a local centre for a fixed period one or two days a week and would give the public a convenient means of contacting the Garda, for example to report crime, discuss aspects of local policing, seek crime prevention advice and so on. The Garda authorities are considering the development of this type of service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="341" /> As far as car thefts are concerned, the provision of extra prison space to accommodate so-called &ldquo;joyriders&rdquo; and take them out of circulation has had a decided impact on the incidence of this particular kind of crime.  Provisional statistics for the first 11 months of 1985 show that the total number of unlawful takings of vehicles are down by about 22 per cent as compared with the equivalent period in 1984, while burglaries and robberies showed a drop of about 8.5 per cent.  This trend gives room for cautious optimism.</P>
    <P>The Government's response, therefore, to the problem of crimes such as theft and burglary, has been vigorous and varied.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1984, has made major reforms of criminal law and procedure and various operational and enforcement measures have been taken of the kind I have mentioned.  The Bill before the House attempts to widen somewhat the scope of the offences of possession of housebreaking implements, etc. and of receiving stolen goods.</P>
    <P>The Government consider that these changes, while not constituting major reforms of the Larceny Acts, are desirable in themselves.  We intend to bring forward a wider reforming measure in this area as soon as other priorities and available resources allow.  Unfortunately, this Bill suffers from so many defects, a number of them serious, that it is not acceptable as it stands.  To put it right by way of Government amendments would take a lot of work and would mean that resources would have to be diverted from the other more immediately urgent items on the Government's legislative programme.  Accordingly, I must oppose this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I was disappointed at the Minister's response to our Bill.  I am sure Deputy Woods is prepared to accept that everything in the Bill is not perfect and that he would require experts in the Department of Justice to assist him, but nevertheless he has made an attempt to do something about a problem which is causing great concern among the public.  I was pleased <Col N="342" /> that the Minister conceded that the measures proposed in the Bill to deal with those found guilty of handling stolen goods have merit.  I expect our Bill to be defeated but I hope its introduction will mean that the Minister will speed up the preparation of the Bill he mentioned. Something positive must be done to deal with the crime wave.  I feel strongly about the amount of crime throughout the country and I avail of every opportunity possible to speak out against it.  The amount of crime is staggering.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods told the House that the number of indictable crimes reported in 1984 was 97,727 which included 94,184 burglaries, larcenies and robberies.  That figure must highlight the necessity to bring to justice the burglars, receivers and handlers of stolen property.  We have a national emergency on our hands as far as crime is concerned.  Today, in response to my question about the number of incidents where guns were used in the last ten years, the Minister for Justice, in the course of a written reply, informed me that guns were used in most robberies. According to the Minister there were 46 armed aggravated burglaries in 1980 &mdash; I was disappointed that the Minister confined figures to the last five years &mdash; that the figure for 1981 was 81, had risen to 232 by 1982 and by 1983 had risen to 341.  In 1984, the last year for which figures are available, the figure rose to 361.  In 1980 there were 194 armed robberies; 306 in 1981 and the figure fell in 1982.  I expect that the reason for the reduction was the decision to seek the help of the Defence Forces in the transport of cash.  The total number of burglaries in 1980 was 331 and that figure rose to 566 in 1984.  I am sure that the figure for last year was higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to Deputy Woods, of the total number of indictable crimes, aggravated burglary accounted for 1,129 of which 361 involved the use of firearms. I accept that unemployment and other factors can be blamed for the increase in the crime wave and that we must remember that we are living in a consumer society.  In the thirties and forties there were very few televisions and no video <Col N="343" /> machines, but I understand that there are 250,000 video recorders here now.  In the thirties people did not have items that were worth stealing.  Some years ago a person said that Midas was very rich because he did not have anything to spend his money on.  He would have plenty of things to spend his money on today.  I have often asked why Governments have not taken action to stop burglaries and I have reached the conclusion that the reason is that there is no loss to the State involved in house burglaries.</P>
    <P>The Minister told the House that the number of robberies in 1985 showed a drop of 8½ per cent compared to the previous year, but it is my view that crime is on the increase.  Many robberies are not reported because people are fed up.  I am talking about people who have been robbed six and seven times.  It would be interesting to know if the Department keep statistics on how often houses are broken into.  People have the awful feeling that efforts are not being made to deal with crime.  Their attitude is that once an object is stolen they will not see it again.  It is their view that there is no longer a sense of urgency when they report robberies to the Garda.  We need tighter laws to deal with what is in effect a warlike situation.</P>
    <P>I do not hold any brief for criminals and those who come to my clinics requesting assistance to get somebody off a charge have been told to see some public representatives. The Minister will agree that he has not received any letter from me seeking to have a prison sentence mitigated.</P>
    <P>I am very discouraged at the response to the speech by Deputy Woods.  I commend him for introducing this Bill as there is a tremendous need for it.  We must adopt a Bill of this nature pretty quickly.  The Minister said that there are many Bills coming before the House. Important sections of the Criminal Justice Act cannot come into force until the complaints tribunal is set up.  In the meantime people all over the country are <Col N="344" /> suffering terribly and looking for easement.</P>
    <P>The Government should as their top priority declare war on crime, because no one today can leave their homes with an easy mind.  People are terrified to go on holidays in case their homes are robbed. Of course, criminals nowadays do not care if people are in the homes they intend to rob, they just tie them up and rob the house.  There is a terrible viciousness in the community.  Unfortunately, because of the response of the Minister to the Bill, for the foreseeable future the receivers and handlers of stolen goods will get away with their crimes.  Even if it is only a stopgap, we should amend legislation to cater for this emergency.  In Britain they brought in an Act in 1968 and another in 1978 but we have not done anything.  In other countries the situation may be serious but not desperate, in Ireland the situation can be desperate but never serious.</P>
    <P>I meet people from time to time and I have to try to explain why the law is unable to protect them.  I have always stated that the first obligation of the State is to protect the right of the individual, not just on the streets but also in their homes.  We are failing miserably in that task.  I went to a meeting a year or so ago and I was hurt very deeply when a woman said that she hoped my house would be robbed so that I would know how it felt. I said that that was a horrible thing to wish on anyone, but I understood the pain which brought that remark to her lips.  I feel for these people and I know that they can only take it for a certain amount of time.  More and more people will take the law into their own hands.  We have seen the growth of the concerned parents' group who are a front for Sinn Féin, as the Minister for Justice also stated.  Many well intentioned people have joined them and they may well grow in strength.  I love our democratic system and it terrifies me to think that people will set themselves up as avengers to punish those who are avoiding prison because of a technicality in the law.  The figures for indictable offences &mdash; 97,727 &mdash; are frightening.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> I do not want to be unfair to the Minister but he tried to trivialise the Bill.  He gave a condescending pat on the back to the well-intentioned people who prepared it, although I know that they worked long and hard in ensuring that it would be acceptable.  The Minister should have said that if they brought back the Bill in a month or so that he would have amended it.  The people know that the Government are not prepared to come to grips with the crime wave.  The Minister pointed out that anyone found in possession of house breaking implements during the hours of daylight could be prosecuted under the Vagrancy Act but he admitted that they would only get three months' imprisonment, which is nothing to these people.  Some of these Acts should be done away with and their powers transferred to a Criminal Justice Bill which should incorporate an updated Larceny Bill.  It is ridiculous to be working under the provisions of the 1916 Act. Is it any wonder we have reached the stage we are at?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there was no doubt that a reform of the law of this kind is desirable and would be of assistance in the bringing of prosecutions.  The Minister and the Government know this.  My colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell, sits with me on the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism and he knows the problems involved.  I find it very difficult to meet my constituents because we are not facing up to the emergency in regard to crime.  We wait until the fire is burning before we try to put it out.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that it may be suggested that the Government, instead of opposing the Bill, should put down amendments to rectify these defects but that it would not be possible to do that at present and be consistent with the Government's existing legislative aims in priority areas.  What is the greatest priority?  I should like to see a poll taken on what people think of law and order. That is the biggest issue, because people want the Government to ensure that criminals are caught.  The Garda know who they are and it is very frustrating for them to see them walking free.  The old <Col N="346" /> legislation is almost worthless and it has now reached the stage where only very stupid criminals are caught.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to be more specific about when legislation will be introduced to ameliorate the situation.  We are doing something in Opposition to help the Government as best we can.  We are pin-pointing the areas where we consider the greatest public concern exists.  A Government should always pay very careful attention to the Bills introduced by an Opposition because they are echoing the voice of the people.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Longford County Hospital Closure.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>May I express my gratitude for being given the opportunity to raise a matter which is of great concern to the people of Longford?  This matter appeared on today's Order Paper as Question No. 39 which, unfortunately, was not reached.  On behalf of the people of Longford I want to express the shock they felt when they heard of the premature closure of the Longford County Hospital.</P>
      <P>The purpose of raising this subject this evening was to appraise the Minister of the very serious concern which is widespread throughout the community.  At a public meeting held last Monday night and attended by approximately 700 people from all walks of life &mdash; industry, the chamber of commerce, the ICA, cultural and social organisations, sporting organisations and concerned parents &mdash; very serious concern was expressed.  The proposed closure of Longford County Hospital at the end of the month poses very serious problems for the community. They see themselves without any type of emergency or casualty service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister appreciates that I am not raising this subject to score political points because we all know agreement was reached and confirmed by the Minister and by the Midland Health <Col N="347" /> Board on many occasions that the Longford County Hospital would not close until the new casualty unit, which would provide a 24-hour service, was built and was in operation.  But a new situation developed recently with the premature retirement of the surgeon.  This was no fault of the Minister or of the county surgeon.  I would like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to Mr. Barrett for the magnificent service he has rendered to that community for the past 18 years. I wish him well and good health in his retirement, but this has raised a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge the planning for the casualty unit is in the early stages. Tonight the Minister will have an opportunity to tell us exactly what the position is, to give a guaranteed commitment that this casualty unit will be provided, and also to give us the time scale.  People are afraid that if the hospital is allowed to close on 31 January, apart from leaving us without a casualty or emergency service, there is the possibility that at some time in the future the Department or the Midland Health Board might decide not to proceed with the casualty unit.  I am giving some of my time to Deputy O'Rourke and she will tell us of a similar incident in Athlone when, despite guarantees and commitments, nothing was delivered.</P>
    <P>The Minister must appreciate the problem in Longford.  I got a clear mandate from the meeting last Monday to put the facts before the Minister and to ask him to meet a deputation.  I have spoken to him about this.  I appreciate how busy he is the week before the budget, but he said he will consider meeting them later.  He said that until he hears the up-to-date position from the chief executive officer of the Midland Health Board he will not be in a position to comment.  I hope that tonight he will be able to give clear answers to my questions.</P>
    <P>There are reports in the local newspapers of alternative services being arranged at the St. Joseph's and Mount <Col N="348" /> Carmel complex.  If the Minister is pursuing that line.  I want him to give clear and unequivocal answers to these questions. Has any agreement been reached with the consultants?  Has agreement been reached with the general medical practitioners for their services?  There are serious doubts that such agreements have been reached.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify these matters.</P>
    <P>The people want the Minister to honour the commitment given on many occasions &mdash; and repeated by him in Longford town in November 1983 when he opened a mentally handicapped centre &mdash; that Longford County Hospital will remain open until the new casualty unit is built.  I want him to tell the people of Longford that that commitment will be honoured.  I am not asking for extra expenditure because I understand that nobody could have foreseen that this hospital would close in 1986.  Consequently the money provided in the Estimates for the running of this hospital should still be there.  All we are looking for is what we are entitled to and that is to keep the hospital open and to provide cover by consultants from Mullingar until such time as those services can be transferred to the Mount Carmel Hospital complex.  The Minister should approve the appointment of a temporary surgeon or arrange cover by consultants in Mullingar to run this hospital in conjunction with the general medical practitioners. The Minister will appreciate the shock felt by the staff in that hospital and the temporary staff who will be replaced in St. Joseph's Hospital complex if the county hospital closes, because the proposal is to move the permanent staff from the county hospital to St. Joseph's.  They will replace temporary staff there.  There are people there who have major commitments with regard to mortgages and so on and they will not be able to meet those commitments.  People will lose jobs unnecessarily in St. Joseph's Hospital.</P>
    <P>All estimates would have been based on the County Longford hospital staying open for the period of 12 months.  I want answers to these questions from the Minister tonight.  The meeting last <Col N="349" /> Monday night became very emotive.  The matter of health in any community can generate emotional and angry scenes.  I do not want to see this community rise up in anger.  Commitments were given to them which they accepted in good faith. It is within the power of the Minister to allay their fears.  We should get on with building the new unit as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>At the meeting doubts were expressed about whether we would ever get the new unit and the chairman had difficulty in controlling the meeting and in keeping the temperature down.  The people at that meeting said then &mdash; and they will repeat this to the Minister when he receives them &mdash; that they will be looking for full hospital services in Longford, not just the unit that may or may not be made available.  I have no reason to believe we will not get that unit.  I have been assured by the health board that it is in the early planning stages.  The Minister may correct me but I believe that the plans will now be sent for final drawings and will be ready for tender when the Department examine them.  Perhaps the Minister can indicate tonight the length of time involved. It is important that we know this, particularly in view of the emotive atmosphere in Longford with regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>In 1932 a site was bought for a county hospital in Longford and money was spent on services.  During the years since then people did not really believe that Longford hospital would ever close. When the point comes to close it the people are entitled to get a suitable replacement.  I cannot see any reason why the hospital cannot be kept going until the new unit is built.  That commitment was given time and time again.</P>
    <P>There is another matter the Minister might clarify tonight.  There is talk that the post of surgeon which was temporary for 18 years has been made permanent. The question was raised at the meeting last Monday night that if the post has been made permanent why is it not being filled.  I do not know the situation.  I wish to know from the Minister if he is prepared to approve the appointment so that the services can keep going.  Is it the <Col N="350" /> case that Comhairle na nOspidéal have to approve it or is ministerial approval sufficient on its own?</P>
    <P>There is also doubt about the legality of the situation.  The closure of Longford hospital is bound up in a rationalisation plan of services prepared by the Midland Health Board.  Part of that was the provision of the new unit, with the hospital to remain open until the new unit was built.  A doubt has been expressed by eminent legal people in Longford that the Midland Health Board have a legal obligation to continue with those services and that of the CEO of the board has no statutory authority to order the closure of Longford hospital at the end of January. If I cannot get a satisfactory solution to the problem in the House tonight, it may be that the statutory legal situation in relation to the CEO's decision to close the hospital will be challegened in the High Court.  Perhaps the Minister would give us his views on that matter.  It might save people a lot of trouble.  The fact that consideration is being given to challenging the matter in the High Court is a reflection of the depth of feeling and the anger now pervading the community.  They are prepared to go to any lengths to ensure that the commitments given to them are honoured.  They will not accept being left without hospital services.</P>
    <P>Longford is a growing industrial town. There are plenty of new industries but every day there is a serious risk with regard to accidents which inevitably occur.  Sporting organisations, the GAA, rugby, soccer and hurling clubs have used the hospital, as have the various industrial concerns.  Not least, parents have had to take their children to hospital on many occasions with minor injuries.</P>
    <P>I have listed all the questions to the Minister and I hope he can respond satisfactorily to them.  Emotions and anger are building up in the community.  What is needed is clear answers from the Minister that the hospital will remain open until the unit is in place.  The Minister must ensure that consultants cover is given so that we may continue with the level of services obtaining until we get what <Col N="351" /> everyone told us we would have, namely, a new casualty unit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank my colleague for giving me some minutes of the time allocated to him.  I was at the meeting in Longford on Monday night. It appears to me I am fated to talk on the Adjournment about the lack of hospital facilities in the constituency of Longford-Westmeath. I have spoken on the Adjournment on three occasions about Athlone hospital and once again we are on the long road of broken promises. During the years I have been given firm commitments from the Minister about Athlone hospital but these commitments were waved away as if they meant nothing. I spoke to the people in Longford last Monday and I told them the same thing would happen to them as happened to us in Athlone if they did not become more vocal, strident and aggressive about their point of view.  We allowed ourselves to be browbeaten by the Minister.  I do not wish to be aggressive.  I am only telling the truth.  The Minister knows what happened with regard to Athlone.  A large industrial town has been left with no hospital/doctor cover &mdash; an extraordinary state of affairs.  I do not want the same to happen in another large town in my constituency.</P>
      <P>The people in Longford were promised they would have a fully staffed 24-hour casualty unit and that existing facilities would remain until that unit was built.  It is much more than just the closing of a hospital on 31 January, dangerous, wrong and ill-judged as that decision will be.  I am afraid that the promises given with regard to the casualty unit, promises given in great detail, will prove to be nothing.  The fine promises that were reiterated in our case before the local elections have come to naught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the people in Longford do not fight now their county hospital will be closed, the casualty unit will not be built, economies will become more stringent and the people of the county will find themselves with no surgical or casualty services of any kind.  I ask the Minister tonight not <Col N="352" /> to treat Longford as he treated Athlone. I ask him to retain the county surgical facilities until the casualty unit is built and to give a guarantee here tonight that that unit will be built.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter because it gives me the opportunity of clarifying the position.  My colleague the Minister for Defence, has raised this question with me also on a number of occasions.  In addition, a few weeks ago I met here with my colleague from Mullingar, Councillor Dollard, who also has expressed concern about this matter. I do not propose to receive a delegation because of having discussed this issue with the public representatives and now also here this evening.  I would not foresee any change being made as a result of any such meeting and neither would any new light be likely to be thrown on the subject as a result of another meeting.</P>
      <P>The second point is that the hospital will close at the end of the month.  That is definite.  This is a unique hospital in many ways.  It is a small 45 bed hospital carrying out only surgical procedures. The surgeon there, Mr. Barrett, has done an outstanding job in keeping the hospital in operation and in maintaining a surgical service in extremely difficult circumstances. But this is an arrangement that cannot be repeated on his retirement. There are three reasons for this.  Any modern surgical service requires a minimum staff of two surgeons, so that one can cover for the other.  However, such a staff complement could not be justified in the case of Longford.  Appointments of this nature require the approval of Comhairle na nOspidéal and that approval in the circumstances at the hospital would not be forthcoming.  That is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third reason is that the hospital is in a very poor condition and is not capable of being brought up to modern standards. There is only about 50 per cent bed occupancy rate there.  The workload would not justify even providing for the appointment of one surgeon to replace <Col N="353" /> Mr. Barrett.  I do not propose to change the decision to close the hospital.</P>
    <P>Deputies are correct in saying that it had been decided to close the hospital in the years ahead anyway but the decision of Mr. Barrett to retire earlier than anticipated has brought the decision forward. The agreement on my part was on the recommendation of the health board.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the chairman of the health board.  He has been an outstanding chairman in a very difficult position. Equally, I wish to pay tribute to the CEO of the health board who has been equally outstanding, imaginative and progressive in his approach to the hospital services in the region.  Their efforts, together with the efforts of the planning staff in the Department, have led to the bringing to fruition of the long awaited rationalisation of hospital services in the midlands.  What we are talking about here is the final step in that process.  I assure the Deputies that we will not be going back in any way in regard to the decision to provide a casualty unit at Mount Carmel District Hospital.  When that unit is in full operation it will provide a 24-hour general practitioner emergency service. It will enable the consultants from Mullingar to provide outpatient clinics and minor surgical facilities on a day basis at the hospital.</P>
    <P>Let us put matters into perspective. Mullingar is only 27 miles away in terms of what we are talking about.  The road in question is good.  We are talking of a distance similar to the journey from Arklow to Loughlinstown, from Carlow to Kilkenny, from Athy to Naas or from Killarney to Tralee, for example.  Therefore we are not talking about anything unusual in the present case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputies that the sketch plans for the casualty unit have been prepared.  We will be spending £350,000 on the work involved.  Even with the health board expediting their final planning documents the unit would still take the best part of 12 months to <Col N="354" /> build.  I should hope that the building would be completed within that period. We have sketch plans from the health board.  The work will start this year. Unquestionably it will be completed in 1987.</P>
      <P>The staff residence on the Mount Carmel site will be converted to provide a 20-bed welfare home as part of the plan. That is clear-cut in terms of its inclusion in the proposal.  There will be a day care centre established on the site also and the final phase of the geriatric hospital, St. Joseph's, is under construction.  That will also encompass community care facilities. For that purpose last year we allocated £320,000.  When this building is completed it will accommodate, together with the developments I have outlined, all the health services in Longford.  This will provide the people with an excellent, streamlined and simplified health care service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The changed circumstances have accelerated the process.  The major maternity and paediatric extension to Mullingar Hospital is progressing satisfactorily. We are spending £8 million on Mullingar General Hospital in order to provide a full service for the people of Westmeath and Longford.  In addition, major improvements in the surgical facilities in Mullingar cost £300,000 during 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

      <P>The report on the psychiatric services &mdash;<i>Planning for the Future</i>&mdash; was published last March.  It has been considered by the many interests concerned.  The health boards are now developing detailed plans for their areas in accordance with the guidelines given in the report.  The present stage in planning is concerned with determining the location and types <Col N="46" /> of facilities which will be required to provide a service which is essentially community based.  The capital and other requirements will depend on the outcome of this planning process.</P>
      <P>With regard to the proposed mental handicap centre at Loughlinstown, this project does not arise under the psychiatric planning report.  This centre was designed in response to the needs identified by the Eastern Health Board in developing their services for mentally handicapped persons.  I have suggested to the health board that instead of building this major centre at Loughlinstown they might better achieve their objectives by the provision of a smaller facility at Loughlinstown together with appropriate facilities at a number of centres spread over the north city and north County Dublin and at some centres in County Wicklow.  The board is now considering my proposals.</P>

    <P>On the broader issues raised by the Deputy, I should explain that although there is no single set of comprehensive guidelines that deal, <i>per se,</i> with the supervision of children's homes my Department has from time to time issued guidance on various aspects of the subject, e.g. staff recruitment; financing; review of placements in the homes and the supervision of admissions to, and discharges from, the homes.  Guidelines have also been issued to health boards and children's homes on procedures for the identification, investigation and management of non-accidental injury to children, including injury resulting from sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>It is standard practice for each child placed by a health board in a children's home to have a named social worker who liaises on an on-going basis with the home, the child and his family.  Community care social work teams review progress and future plans for children placed by them in homes on a regular basis.  These reviews often incorporate full case conferences involving health board staff working with the child and the family; child care workers in the home, the resident manager and, where appropriate, the parents.  This close and regular contact between board personnel and individual children provides health boards with a very effective method of monitoring and supervising children in children's homes.  In addition, since January 1984 all these homes have been placed on direct annual budgets from the local health board.  Heretofore, they were funded on a capitation basis per child. The new financing arrangements, of necessity have meant much closer working relationships than heretofore between the administration of the homes and that of the boards, giving boards a greater input into the running and administration of the homes, their staffing and their capital development programmes.</P>
    <P>Because the sexual abuse of children is a criminal offence, the investigation of <Col N="49" /> such allegations is primarily a matter for the Garda.  However, as I have already mentioned, health boards have procedures for the identification, investigation and management of such cases.  Unlike the Garda investigations, the primary objective of the health board procedure is not the prosecution of the offender but the early determination of the course of action to be taken to protect and provide for the future wellbeing of the child concerned. Where such investigations may involve a child in a children's home, I am satisfied that health boards have sufficient statutory powers to arrange to have the child removed.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that I am not completely satisfied with the adequacy of the present statutory basis for regulating children's homes.  As the Deputy is aware under section 15 of the Children (Care and Protection) Bill, currently before this House, I have provided for a new registration system and for the making of regulations governing the conduct and operation of children's homes.  This will provide an ideal opportunity to update and consolidate regulations and guidelines for children's homes.</P>

      <P>Hospital services cards are issued to persons who are entitled to free hospital consultant services and free general practitioner services in respect of maternity. The criteria for such eligibility are set out in the Health Services (No. 2) Regulations 1983 (S.I. No. 139 of 1983) as amended by the Health Services (Amendment) Regulations, 1985 (S.I. No. 145 of 1985). A person whose income in the year ended 5 April 1985 was less than £13,500 is currently entitled to these services and consequently to a hospital services card. Income is defined in the regulations as income estimated in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Acts.</P>
      <P>The determination of eligibility is a matter for the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, who is required to satisfy himself that the income of the applicant complies with the regulations.  Normally, in view of the definition of income, the applicant's P.60 or notice of assessment from the Revenue Commissioners is required as proof of income.  However, where such is not available the chief executive officer may accept other evidence of income as he deems appropriate in the particular circumstances.</P>

      <P>Considerable progress has been made in relation to the implementation of the recommendations of the Working Party on the organisation of general hospital services in the South-East Dublin and East Wicklow area.  For instance planning is proceeding on the development of both St. Vincent's and St. Michael's Hospitals as recommended.  I have made provision in my Department's capital programme for the construction of new theatres, out-patient department and upgrading of the accident and emergency department at St. Columcille's, Loughlinstown Hospital and the consultant medical staffing of that hospital has now been placed on a firm footing with recent appointments in surgery, medicine, radiology and anaesthetics.</P>

      <P>It was intended originally to provide an extension to Mount Carmel District Hospital in Longford to cater for casualty and out-patients services before the County Hospital there would be closed. However, with the early retirement of the consultant surgeon at the end of this month the health board propose to close the hospital from that date.  I agree with this approach.</P>
      <P>Following the closure of the hospital the casualty and out-patient services will be located in existing accommodation at Mount Carmel pending the provision of the new extension.  I can give an assurance that the early retirement of the surgeon will not result in the planned arrangements for the provision of the extension for the casualty and out-patients services being delayed in any way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">

      <P>On the basis of staff censuses carried out in 1974 and 1981 the total staff employed in the health boards and voluntary hospitals increased in that period by about 46 per cent i.e. from 39,792 to 58,030.  In the same period clerical and administrative staff increased by about 72 per cent i.e. from 3,428 to 5,891.  This compares with an increase for the same period of 91 per cent in paramedical staff and 67 per cent in medical and dental staff.</P>
      <P>The growth in numbers employed reflects the rate of development in the services in the period.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by Aughinish Alumina Limited, arising out of the very large cost overrun in the construction of the plant and the subsequent fall in metal prices. The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and I met with representatives of AAL on 14 November last.  Another meeting is planned for later this month.  In the meantime there are on-going contracts at official level with AAL with a view to ascertaining if a solution can be found.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the report of the working group, which was set up under the aegis of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism to investigate the difficulties facing the company, that the major problems at Aughinish have been caused by the worldwide depression in the alumina market which have not been matched at AAL by parallel decreases on the cost side &mdash; the major cost item is the bauxite raw material. AAL have requested, by way of assistance to reduce their costs, a very large allocation of natural gas at prices per therm below that at which they buy their heavy fuel oil on the world market.  Natural gas may not be the only option; all possibilities are being examined.</P>

      <P>Apart from programmes being carried out by organisations such as the ESB and An Foras Talúntais, my Department have a wind powered turbine programme in operation at selected locations.  This programme is being funded by my Department and the EC Commission. The purpose of the programme is to investigate the potential for this technology in Irish weather conditions; to maximise the efficiency of wind turbines by intensive supervision and modifications where necessary and to establish by detailed electronic monitoring the econmics and reliability of these machines.  In addition my Department have agreed to make a contribution towards the cost of installing a wind turbine on Cape Clear Island.  Its cost will mainly be funded by the Federal Republic of Germany and the EC.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these installations will be sufficient to evaluate wind turbine technology in Ireland and that the erection of further machines by my Department would not be appropriate at this time.  It is planned to continue the current programmes for some years, after which the situation will be reviewed in the light of programme results.</P>

      <P>The question of the admission of <Col N="69" /> citizens to a country, and the issue of visas for that purpose, is one for the receiving country.  Consequently, the material in the tables below is based on information obtained from the countries which issued the visas.  It is not clear what the Deputy means to include in the term &ldquo;working visas&rdquo;.  For example, a person given &ldquo;immigrant&rdquo; status is normally entitled to work, but many would be dependants who do not intend to work.  Other work visas are for special temporary purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be appropriate for me to <Col N="70" /> speculate on possible future changes in the visa practices of other countries.  No legislative changes of significance in relation to working visas have been introduced in any of the three countries mentioned.  The question of certain changes being proposed in the US legislature in the immigration policy of the US was raised before, and I dealt with it in my replies to the House on 5 November and 5 December 1985.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy's question refers to the Ministers of State Group on the Food Industry (Food Group).</P>
      <P>The group's terms of reference were, broadly, to examine the functions and responsibilities of Government Departments and State agencies concerned with the food sector, to identify any overlaps or gaps between the interested parties, and to ensure that State resources were being used to maximum advantage. Import substitution, <i>per se,</i> was not, therefore, a mandate given to the group.</P>
      <P>I am keenly aware of the problems caused by food imports, and, along with my colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, have given every assistance possible to measures aimed at curbing such imports.  To this end I have, for example, conducted a series of meetings with the heads of the main supermarket groups and exhorted them to increase the volume of Irish products passing through their outlets, and to develop closer links with Irish suppliers.  The response to these meetings has in the main been positive. The Deputy will appreciate, however, that nothing dramatic can be achieved overnight in an area where there is a multiplicity of consumer needs and tastes and that it is only by unremitting efforts on the parts of all concerned that we can be confident of fully reversing the present trends.</P>
      <P>The Irish Goods Council will continue to be in the forefront of bringing the advantages of Irish products to the notice of distributors and consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in line with Government policy, a range of incentives is available to manufacturing firms in the food sector.  Grants, for example, are available from the IDA for <Col N="77" /> projects aimed at import substitution. The IDA will also be providing a specialist food centre in Waterford which will provide facilities for new small enterprises in the food processing sector. SFADCo, through the food processing centre in Limerick, and through grants, advice etc., are also active in the food sector.  Further assistance is available from other State agencies, such as An Foras Talúntais and the IIRS.</P>
    <P>Everything possible is being done to help Irish industry compete with imports, and as I indicated in previous replies on the subject to the Deputy, this can best be achieved through Irish firms being in a position to compete successfully with imports in such areas as price, quality, product development and delivery performance.</P>

      <P>Details of the special scheme of tax incentives which is to apply to development and reconstruction work in certain inner-city areas of Dublin, Cork and Limerick will be announced as soon as possible together with details of the areas to be designated.  These areas will be formally designated following the enactment of the necessary legislation which is at present being drafted and the taxation incentives will be provided for in the Finance Bill.  The purpose of these arrangements is to encourage the redevelopment and reconstruction of the designated inner-city areas which are rundown and generally perceived to be unattractive for investment purposes. Since the nature and extent of the projects to be undertaken will depend largely on the response to the scheme from interested builders, developers, traders, etc., <Col N="81" /> I cannot at this stage give an estimate of the numbers likely to be employed on development which will qualify for the incentives.</P>

      <P>Provision was made in the 1985 Public Capital Programme for the payment of a State grant of £80,000 to Dundalk Harbour Commissioners towards the cost of the construction of a jetty to link Oake's and Connick's Quays.  The financial viability of this project was under examination in my Department when the commissioners requested that the grant allocation be diverted to a major dredging project which they are proposing to undertake at the Soldiers Point and Inner Harbour areas.</P>
      <P>Dundalk Harbour Commissioners have recently received tenders for the dredging work and I understand that they are considering these.  My Department is considering the financial viability and financing of the project.  If the project is found to be financially viable the financing will consist of commercial borrowing, a contribution from the commissioners' own resources and, possibly, grant assistance. A decision on the latter will be taken as soon as possible in the light of the commissioners' current and projected financial position and the availability of funds for harbour works in the 1986 Public Capital Programme.</P>

      <P>An unmanned VHF Maritime Radio Communications Station, built by my Department at Croughalough, County Donegal, became operational in February 1983.  The station, which is remotely controlled from the Malinhead Coast Radio Station, provides VHF coverage over an area extending from west of Tory Island along the northern coastline of Donegal, eastward and northward towards the Scottish coast.  It services life-boats, international shipping and aircraft, the fishing fleet, Air Corps fishery patrols and pleasure craft.  In addition to its primary safety at sea function, the station provides access to the public telephone system.</P>
      <P>The station is one of three such stations built to date as part of a pilot scheme to determine the feasibility of a network which will eventually cover the entire coast.  The other two stations are located in Counties Cork and Kerry.  Extension of the VHF service to the rest of the north west coast will involve in due course the construction on the west coast of Donegal of a VHF station which, like that at Croughalough, will be remotely controlled from the Malinhead Coast Radio Station. A detailed survey has been conducted of the region with a view to determining the best location for the station.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that tax repayment claims on the grounds of unemployment are normally dealt with at four-weekly intervals by reference to earnings to date of cessation of employment and cumulative tax-free allowances to date of claim.</P>
      <P>The taxpayer ceased employment on 7 October 1985 and on 3 November 1985 submitted to the inspector of taxes a claim for repayment of tax on the grounds of unemployment.  On examining the claim it was discovered by the inspector that tax had been under-deducted by the taxpayer's most recent employer from her earnings in the current year and, consequently, there is no repayment due before 14 February 1986.  On 12 November 1985 the inspector wrote to the taxpayer explaining the position and also advised her to reapply after 14 February 1986 if she is still unemployed.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, as the taxpayer's estimated income for the current year exceeds the appropriate age exemption threshold of £3,500, he is not entitled to exemption from income tax for this year. However, as his estimated income will not greatly exceed the relevant exemption threshold, he has been granted a measure of marginal relief subject to review after 5 April 1986.  An amended certificate of tax-free allowances, to include estimated marginal relief, will be issued to the taxpayer as soon as possible. Any tax overdeducted from his retirement pension since 6 April last will be refunded to the taxpayer by the payer of that pension when the amended certificate is put into operation.</P>

      <P>Statistics are not available which would enable the precise information requested by the Deputy to be given.  Using income distribution statistics for the year 1983-84, which is the latest available basic data, it is tentatively estimated that the income tax yield attributable to income arising from sources within the State which was assessed under case III of schedule D (section 53 (1), Income Tax Act, 1967), for that year was about £56 million.  The corresponding figures for 1980-81, 1981-82 and 1982-83 are £25 million, £36 million and £45 million respectively. A breakdown of these figures to <Col N="118" /> relate them to interest arising from individual financial institutions could not be obtained without undertaking an inquiry which could be carried out only at a disproportionate cost.</P>

    <P>Note</P>
    <P>These total revenue figures comprise actual receipts of excise duty from motor vehicles and estimates of VAT receipts on private cars and motor-cycles.  Reliable information on which to base an estimate of VAT receipts on commercial vehicles is not available.  VAT on commercial motor vehicles is deductible by the majority of purchasers in their VAT returns and the net VAT receipts from such vehicles are therefore likely to be comparatively small.</P>
    <P>There are no figures available for the numbers of vehicles actually sold in each year.  The figures for registrations of new motor vehicles which are set out are probably a reasonable approximation.</P>

    <P>Notes</P>
    <P>Category A motor vehicles consist mainly of motor cars and minibuses.  The term &ldquo;Category B&rdquo; generally covers all other motor vehicles.  Prior to 1 January 1985 the chargeable value of a vehicle for excise duty purposes was the price (exclusive of excise duty and VAT) which the vehicles would fetch on a first arm's length sale to a dealer.  From 1 January 1985 the basis on which excise duty on motor vehicles is charged was changed from price to dealer to retail price.</P>
    <P>The rate of excise duty shown in the first column applied also to motor cycles, but the 50 per cent rate remained applicable to those vehicles until 31 December 1984.  Since 1 January 1985 allowance is made in charging the excise duties on imported secondhand motor vehicles, including motor cycles, for the age of the vehicles in accordance with fixed depreciation scales.</P>

      <P>Information on the yield from building is given in the reply to Question No. 170.</P>

    <P>It is not possible to state the actual amount of VAT yield from building materials as VAT returns are not submitted in a manner which would enable the yield <Col N="130" /> from particular items to be identified. Sufficient data from other sources from which estimates of the yield could be made, are not available.

      <P>By end-December 1985, 844 holdings had been assessed by inspectors in the farm classification office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of occupiers who will be <Col N="131" /> liable for farm tax in any year will depend on the threshold fixed for liability to the tax in that year.  This, in turn, will depend on the rate of progress being achieved by the farm tax commissioner in carrying out assessments.</P>
    <P>The cost in 1986 is estimated at £6.053 million.  It is hoped to complete the work within the next five to six years and, on that basis, the total cost is estimated at some £30 million to £40 million.  There are approximately 175 field staff on assessment work.  They all hold academic qualifications in agricultural science or an analogous degree.</P>
    <P>The daily rate of assessment is at present in the region of 4,000 statute acres.  It is considered that this rate will increase substantially without a corresponding increase in costs.</P>
    <P>When the assessing officer calls to inspect a holding, the farmer should provide whatever information is sought in relation to land occupied, boundaries etc. Section 17 of the Farm Tax Act requires that this information be given.  A farmer who considers that there are limitations affecting the productivity of his holding should so advise the assessor.  Such information will be welcomed and taken into account to the extent that this is possible under the Act.</P>
    <P>Dwelling houses will be excluded from the area of land assessed.  Farmyards will, in general, be included.</P>
    <P>All holdings having less than 20 adjusted acres will be excluded from liability for farm tax.  It will not be possible until the entire classification is completed to say how many holdings will be in the excluded category.</P>

In September 1981 following completion of dry rot eradication works, but before commencement of modernisation works, the Department of Justice indicated that the Garda did not propose to reoccupy the premises but would continue to remain in occupation of the temporary Garda station pending provision of a new station.  This situation currently obtains.</P>

      <P>The temporary preservation order made by the Commissioners of Public Works in respect of Rathfarnham Castle acknowledges that the castle, its associated medieval features of architectural and archaeological interest and its amenity area constitute a national monument. The expiry of the order will not alter that but a new order, temporary or permanent, can be made by the commissioners if, in their opinion, the circumstances warrant it.  I have no request from Dublin County Council for financial assistance towards the cost of purchasing the castle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an improvement in recent years in the standards of hygiene generally in the food industry but there remains, undoubtedly, much room for further improvement.  Inspections of food premises are carried out by the environmental health officers of the local health boards.  The numbers of inspections carried out on food premises in 1984 and the numbers of prosecutions taken in that year for breaches of the Food Hygiene Regulations were as follows: inspections 71,306; prosecutions 133.</P>
      <P>Health boards generally take an educational approach in the first instance with the management and staff of food operations and for the most part they secure their ready co-operation.  Prosecutions are taken where such co-operation is not forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department keep in close contact with the health boards concerning activities and developments in the area of food hygiene.  For example, in response to the growth in the numbers of mobile food stalls throughout the country my Department are preparing proposals for the up-dating of the provisions in the food <Col N="136" /> hygiene regulations in regard to these stalls.  I also hope to have issued in the near future a guide to hygiene for butchers' shops.  In the final analysis I believe we will only achieve and sustain the required standard of food hygiene when the general public insist on it and are prepared to express disapproval whenever they encounter poor standards.</P>

However according to the 1981 Census there were 21,768 persons between 65 and 70 and 46,266 persons over 70 living in single person households.  Projections in the National Council for the Aged report, <i>Housing of the Elderly in Ireland,</i> suggest that by the year 2000 there will be 89,400 persons aged 65 years and over living alone.</P>

      <P>I do not agree that the person in question is being discriminated against.  It is understood that while the person is in receipt of a British invalidity social security pension he is employed (and living) in Ireland. The fact that the person is employed in the territory of this member state of the European Economic Community makes him subject to the legislation of this State in accordance with article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No. 2001/83.  Accordingly, the person's eligibility for a medical card would be determined by the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board in the normal way.  The board, in May 1985, having considered all the circumstances of the person in question deemed him ineligible for a medical card.</P>

He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £50.20, being the appropriate rate in his case of £58.35 less means of £8.15.

In accordance with the provisions of the legislation governing the unemployment assistance scheme, the value of any benefit or privilege derived by an applicant from any source must be taken into account in the assessment of means.  It is, accordingly, necessary to establish the value to the applicant of any board and lodging which he enjoys and the details of the earnings in question are required for that purpose.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the terms of the relevant legislation the rate of unemployment benefit payable to a claimant is reduced after 156 days of benefit, where he does not satisfy the contribution condition of having 280 paid contributions in a seven year period.  The reduced rate is equivalent to the short term urban unemployment assistance rate.  Arising from the commitment of the Government to assist the long term unemployed, special increases have been awarded to long term unemployment assistance claimants over the past three years with the result that a claimant on the long term unemployment assistance rate receives more than a claimant on the reduced rate of unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>The policy of paying a special higher rate to the long term unemployed is justifiable. This group of claimants, by and large, will have exhausted any redundancy entitlements or other means they may have had on becoming unemployed and require special support.  The Commission on Social Welfare has been requested to examine the policy of reducing the rate of unemployment benefit for claimants who fail to satisfy the 280 contribution condition.</P>

Her son attained 21 years on 18 November 1985 and he can no longer be regarded as a qualified child from that date.  Accordingly, her rate of widow's pension was reduced to £39.15 a week. This is the appropriate rate of pension payable to a widow under 66 years of age with no qualified children and whose weekly means exceed £8 but do not exceed £10.  Her means, derived from a farm holding, were assessed at £8.07 a week.</P>

      <P>Panels of assessors are appointed under the Social Welfare Acts to assist appeals officers at oral hearings about entitlement to unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance. The panels are composed of persons nominated by local employer and trade union bodies and are constituted at intervals of five years.  The Roscommon area is at present served by the Longford, Sligo and Ballina panels.  The Longford panel was set up on 17 April 1983 and is due to expire on 16 April 1988.  The Sligo panel was set up on 24 June 1985 and is due to expire on 23 June 1990.  The Ballina panel was set up on 13 June 1983 and is due to expire on 12 June 1988.  The employer and worker bodies represented on the panels are as follows:</P>

A grant of £5,000 was made available to the organisation in 1984. However, in 1985 it was not found possible to make a grant available due to the high volume of applications received. The scheme for grants will continue in 1986 and the appropriate advertisement will be placed in the national newspapers next month at which stage it will be open to the organisation concerned to submit an application for a grant.</P>

      <P>The claim of the person concerned to widow's non-contributory pension was refused last April because her means assessed at £70.84 per week, after allowing for a deduction of £6 per week in respect of one qualified child, exceeded the then limit of £54 per week applicable to her as a widow under 66 years of age <Col N="191" /> with one qualified child.  This limit is now £58 per week.</P>
      <P>The local social welfare officer was not satisfied with the estimates of income furnished by the claimant.

      <P>The person concerned sought a transfer of her unemployment benefit to the United Kingdom on 25 September 1985 for a period while she was seeking employment in that country.  She was given a letter of advice for presentation at an appropriate local office in the United Kingdom for the purpose of continuing her claim.  Authorisation of payment was sent to the headquarters of the Department of Health and Social Security in Newcastle-upon-Tyne on 25 September 1985.  Inquiries are being made of the Department of Health and Social Security to establish the reason for non-payment of benefit as authorised.  When these inquiries are completed her entitlement to unemployment benefit for the duration of her claim in the United Kingdom will be examined.  On her return from the United Kingdom she again claimed unemployment benefit from 2 January 1986.  Her claim was allowed at the maximum rate appropriate to a single person, of £39.50 weekly, and pay-related benefit of £13.57 weekly.  Combined weekly payments at £53.07 weekly will continue to be made as they fall due.</P>

      <P>Because of the way social security is organised and financed throughout the EC the comparison of the contribution rates requested in the Deputy's question would not be possible. In some countries varying contribution rates and income ceilings are applied even within the same scheme, in other cases flat rate contributions may be levied in addition to percentage contributions and in the case of some occupational injuries schemes the contribution rates can be related to the degree of risk in specific occupations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information on the rates of social security contributions payable in EC member states is contained in the publication &ldquo;Comparative Tables of the Social Security Schemes in the Member States of the European Communities, Thirteenth Edition&rdquo; which is published by the Commission of the European Communities. This relates to the situation at 1 July 1984, the most recent date for which the information is available.  Table II in the publication which deals with financing gives a breakdown of the contributions payable by employers and employees in respect of the various branches of social <Col N="194" /> security in all the member states, including Ireland.

He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at £12.90 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £99.80 less means of £86.90.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the means assessment, when he was previously signing as unemployed, and arising from contentions made by him in support of his appeal the case was returned to the social welfare officer for further inquiries.  The inquiries, which are extensive, are not yet completed and when they are the case will be referred to an appeals officer for determination of means, and the rate of unemployment assistance payable to the person concerned will be reviewed in the light of the decision of the appeals officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>To double the 1985 headage payment rates in County Limerick would involve doubling them also in all other areas which are designated as disadvantaged. This would cost over £30 million and current constraints upon Exchequer resources make this impossible.</P>
      <P>However, the issue of vouchers under the feed voucher scheme together with the other relief measures undertaken by the Government, should alleviate the position of farmers in County Limerick and elsewhere who were adversely affected by the inclement weather of 1985.</P>

      <P>The level of aid under the scheme is generous given the difficult budgetary situation and the conditions of the scheme were designed to ensure that those farmers in greatest need benefit most.</P>

      <P>As some 90,000 applications have been received under the feed voucher scheme it has not been possible to carry out on-farm inspections in all cases.  Assessment of applicants which have not been inspected is based on information on livestock numbers and fodder stocks supplied by the applicants.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that the feeding quality of fodder this winter is below normal standards and this has been taken into account in assessing fodder supplies on farms.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Statistics are compiled for the commissioner's annual report on crime on the basis of Garda divisions.  The statistics for Roscommon are included in the total for the division of Roscommon-Galway East.  However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the figures set out as follows have been obtained by excluding certain figures not applicable to Roscommon and, while there is a margin of error, they give a reasonably accurate account of the position in respect of County Roscommon.  Figures for 1985 are not yet available.</P>

A person may be committed to prison for failure to comply with a court order to make certain payments in discharge of a debt, an order which may be made only after examination of means designed to establish that the person can pay.  As far as can be ascertained from prison records, a total of six persons with addresses in County Roscommon were <Col N="226" /> committed to prison on foot of such order in the period from 1 January 1981 to 31 December 1985.

      <P>I propose to deal with the position in relation to those projects where grants are payable by my Department.  There are seven such projects in all, and in each a national school is concerned.  In the case of five of the projects, the school authorities themselves placed the contracts. The accounts in respect of three of these were cleared between the 13th and 15th of this month.  The other two projects in this category are at the final account stage: in one of these, the final account has been lodged and is being processed with a view to an early payment being made, and in the other the draft final account is still awaited.  The remaining two school projects are ones in which the Commissioners of Public Works placed the contracts.  In these cases, the final accounts are being examined with a view to an early payment.  Where there are still outstanding payments, I have asked that examination of claims should be expedited.</P>

      <P>My Department has received representations on behalf of the Advisory Committee of St. Paul's secondary school, Greenhills, Dublin 12, regarding the revision of the scheme of special grants for certain subjects.</P>
      <P>The position is that, following many complaints about the operation of the system of payment of these grants, a new system was introduced in 1985 in the interests of equity, simplicity and earlier payment.  As a result of the more equitable system of distribution some schools received less and others more than hitherto.  The total amount of money paid out for these grants in 1985 was however greater than in any previous year.</P>
      <P>A sizeable proportion of the funds available in 1985 had to be devoted to clearing a backlog of claims which brought the system up-to-date for the first time in years.  No such backlog of claims remains to form a charge on the funds available to pay these special grants in 1986.</P>

      <P>An application for assistance under the teamwork scheme was received from this group last year.  However, due to the exceptional demand for teamwork it was not possible to consider a number of applications, including the one from Durrow Community Council, for assistance in 1985.</P>
      <P>The work proposed by the council, which involves landscaping and restoration work is regarded as being more suitable for assistance under my Department's social employment scheme and I would suggest that Durrow Community Council contact the National Manpower Service in Portlaoise if they are interested in applying for assistance under that scheme.  Details of the social employment scheme were, in fact, forwarded to Durrow Community Council by my Department in August 1985.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office is the official source of statistics relating to industrial disputes but figures are not yet available from that office in respect of 1985.  My Department estimates, however, that 437,000 days were lost through industrial disputes in that year.  Of these, 90 per cent were due to official industrial action and 10 per cent due to action classified as unofficial.  The one-day public service stoppage and the teachers' national and regional disputes accounted for over 200,000 days lost.</P>

    <P>It is not the policy of my Department to publish the names and addresses of employers against whom proceedings are taken.</P>
    <P>Premises covered by Joint Labour Committee Orders are inspected regularly by inspectors of my Department. Where breaches of Joint Labour Committee Orders are detected by inspectors in the course of those inspections, the employer concerned is first made aware of his responsibilities and asked to comply.  This results in full compliance in the great majority of cases.  Where compliance is not forthcoming, the question of instituting legal proceedings is put forward for consideration by the Department's legal advisers.  A problem which can arise, particularly in the hotel and catering industries, is that employees are not willing to make statements and give evidence necessary for a successful prosecution and this is a factor which must obviously be taken into account when the question of instituting proceedings is being considered in individual cases.</P>

Participation rates by region at the end of December 1985 are set out in the following table.

Allowing persons under 25 years to participate would not be consistent with this objective.</P>
